<p>Enceladus is much smaller than Earth and therefore has far weaker gravity, which would correlate with smaller pressure at a given altitude. However, its ocean seems to occupy a larger percentage of the planet's volume compared to Earth's, in addition to being buried under a thick sheet of ice.</p>
<p>Given Enceladus' size, gravity, and nature of it's sub-surface ocean, what would its water pressure ranges be? Could a human swim in it without a pressure suit? Could a submarine reach any depth?</p>
<p>Bonus question is to estimate the temperature range of the ocean. Since it's liquid, it'd have to be above zero celsius unless it's highly saline. Is there expected geothermal or tidal friction heating? How warm would it be purely from solar exposure, or radiation coming from Saturn?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can calculate this with the equation:</p>
<p>pressure=density <em> force of gravity </em> height. </p>
<p>This gives you the pressure of the fluid column above you, but this works pretty well for very large amounts of solids. We are assuming that gravity doesn't change much over that distance, I suspect it might since Enceladus is so small. Wikipedia says that Enceladus has 30-40 km of ice and has a surface gravity of . Pushing this all through <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=30+km+*1%25+earth+gravity*density+ice" target="_blank">Wolfram Alpha</a> gives a &quot;sea level&quot; pressure of 3.11-4.15 Megapascals. This is equivalent to being 320-420m(1000-1300 ft) underwater on Earth. That's about as far as any SCUBA diver has ever gone, but it has been done. The world record took 12 minutes to descend, but 14 hours decompressing on the way up. Deeper dives can be made, but you start needing a rigid pressure suit. It's also close to the pressure limit for military style submarines made of steel, but titanium submarines have gone to 10 MPa. Submersibles made for extreme deep sea diving definitely could. </p>
<p>The temperature is unknown but depending on how much ammonia is mixed in, it's anywhere from somewhere above a brisk -3 C that you could dip in for a minute or two without dying, or a -103 C ammonia water slurry. What we do know is that it is <em>deep</em>. 20-30 km(18 miles) deep. That's three and a half Marianas Trenches or Mount Everests. The water pressure down there (again, assuming the equation holds) is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=40+km+*enceladus+gravity*density+ice%2B30+km+*enceladus+gravuty*density+water" target="_blank">about 7.5MPa</a>, within the limit of some submarines and diving hardsuits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things about the Earth's oceans: its main sources of energy are wind, the sun, tides and fish (funny, right?). Enceladus' ocean, if completely covered by ice, gets no energy directly from the sun or any kind of light, but must get massive forcings from ice movements above (equivalent to wind forcings here on Earth) and tides from Saturn's gravitational pull. Geothermal could be a large source of energy too, although so far we have no way of knowing.</p>
<p>Now, we usually talk about sea pressure in pneumatic, or relative terms, meaning that we take pressure at the sea surface to be zero and then vertically integrate density times gravity to estimate pressure at any given depth. We do that because humans are &quot;tuned&quot; to live at sea level, or absolute pressure 1 atm = 1010 hPa, so we define that as zero to measure deviations from atmospheric pressure. However, estimating absolute pressure would require integrating the density of our entire atmosphere. </p>
<p>If you wanted to do the same for an ocean that's buried under miles of ice, then you would have to take into account the weight of all the ice above a given point. Glacial ice is about 0.92 times as dense as water, so being under 1 km of ice is equivalent to having 920 meters of water above you. We know very little about these oceans, and since gravity is not the same in Enceladus as it is on Earth, I can't say for sure, but I'm pretty confident that no human could swim there. Considering that ice sheets in Greenland are up to 4 km thick, glaciers in Enceladus must be huge everywhere, creating gargantuesque pressures.</p>
<p>Given the mass of Saturn, maybe it could create tides strong enough to drastically reduce bottom sea pressure, as it 'lifts' water and ice upwards. Also, vertical shear during these tides must be a really important source of turbulent kinetic energy and thus provide heat to these oceans. So that's the only way I think humans could, at least momentarily, exist in an ocean like that.</p>
<p>This is all a theoretical construction, and the reality might be different, but if we could make a cruise to explore these seas for the first time, that's what we would base our experiments on before knowing any better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something I can weigh in on as I'm looking at Enceladus as part of my PhD. </p>
<p>Basically it depends on which model you use. Currently the thinking is that there is a localised subsurface ocean around the southern pole that probably forms a lens shape with the thick part of the lens  only 5-10km beneath the South Polar Terrain/Tiger Stripes <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0063" target="_blank">1</a>. And the deepest part being 50-60km beneath the ice shell <a href="https://twitter.com/NatureAstronomy/status/849212317552259073/photo/1" target="_blank">So for visual purposes</a>.</p>
<p>Now depending on the densities and thicknesses you use for the ice and liquid and the rocky silicate core you will get various values.</p>
<p>With varying thicknesses the sea floor pressure will be anywhere between 28 and 45 bar or 2.8-4.5Mpa <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11084-015-9475-9" target="_blank">2</a>. . Which is equivalent to 250-450m below sea level on Earth. This pressure is entirely habitable by known barophiles (pressure loving organisms!) which have been known to survive up to 50Mpa and plenty of multicellular organisms live happily below that depth in our oceans (Hadal Snailfish have been found at 8145m!) </p>
<p>The Pressure within a porous silicate core is likely to only be around 30Mpa which seems pretty tame too<img src="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001910351500250X" alt="3" />. </p>
<p>What we can say is that pressure isn't going to be a problem for biology under Enceladus type conditions.</p>
<p>Now yes this new evidence suggests that there is hydrothermal activity and geochemical energy available but to form multicellular organisms you need a fair bit more energy - which may be available but at the moment this is only a theory.</p>
<p>So for temperature this gets fairly complicated. The temperature will depend on: the heat source - which may be down to tidal heating from Enceladus' resonance orbits, or from a possibly warm core thats lasted since formation; The chemistry and thickness of the ocean/shell - If its a relatively low salinity NaCl-H2O system or whether there is ammonia involved; And finally the amount of heat that is being stored/lost.</p>
<p>Geochemical evidence from the plume suggests the ocean is warm. Silica nanoparticles have been found in the E ring <a href="https://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0703/ering_cassini_big.jpg" target="_blank">image</a> which is maintained by Enceladus' activity. These nanoparticles can only form in alkaline high temperature environments 323K-373K (50C-90C/122-194F)<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v519/n7542/full/nature14262.html" target="_blank">4</a>  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9604" target="_blank">5</a>. Other evidence such as radiation around the tiger stripes shows that the temperature of the vent systems are 30K warmer than the surroundings <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41550-017-0063" target="_blank">1</a>.
Other simulations suggest the core could be anywhere from 20-150C <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103514006459" target="_blank">6</a>.
The chemistry of the ocean matters too, if there are significant concentration of ammonia salts, the melting point may be depressed up to 16K at 0.1%wt NH3 so there may be liquid but it may be below freezing temperature of pure water.</p>
<p>The combination of geochemical and geophysical data points to the ocean being warm i.e. above the freezing point of pure water, whether its been warm for its entire history or whether this activity is recent is another question.</p>
<p>In important distinction should be made between habitable and inhabited. Maybe this ocean is habitable but uninhabited and therefore a pristine niche that could be invaded by Earth species.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, this is cool and maybe the idea of a Biosphere doesn't stop at the stratosphere, but extends to the outer reaches of the solar system!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine replacing it with a third-person pronoun, as if you were talking about a known person.  You might have to change the order of words, especially when the phrase you're wondering about is a question, but it'll still show you <em>which</em> word is right.</p>
<p>Where you'd use <em>he</em> or <em>she</em>, it's <em>who</em>.  Where you'd use <em>him</em> or <em>her</em>, it's <em>whom</em>.  For <em>his</em>-or-<em>her</em> and <em>his</em>-or-<em>hers</em> it's &quot;whose&quot;, but that's kinda beside the point.</p>
<p>Examples of the process:</p>
<p>&quot;[?] are they&quot;? -&gt; &quot;<em>He</em> is ...&quot; so &quot;<em>Who</em> are they&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;[?] did you go with?&quot; -&gt; &quot;You went with <em>her</em>&quot; so &quot;<em>Whom</em> did you go with?&quot; (but this sounds a little clunky, and most people would accept <em>who</em>.  If you rephrased it in a pickier way, as &quot;with <em>whom</em> did you go?&quot;, practically nobody would accept <em>who</em>)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>as others have stated if you can replace it with he/she, use who, him/her is whom</p>
<p>however the REAL answer is that as english has evolved, who has beome acceptable to use in all cases, and the &quot;who/whom&quot; police are generally regarded as annoying and insufferable. </p>
<p>they're not the same as grammar police, they specifically like to wait for moments to point out who/whom &quot;corrections&quot; whenever possible. but what they don't realize is that everyone hates them, and it's okay to just say say &quot;who&quot;</p>
<p>(i mean that. english is evolving to lose pronoun cases. whom is becomming an obsolete word. in casual conversations it's generally always considered ok to use &quot;who&quot; in either case....however you CANNOT use &quot;whom&quot; in both cases.</p>
<p>this presents a few issues about the word.</p>
<p>1) if you never use, you'll never have to worry about using it incorrectly.</p>
<p>2) 90% of the time people try to use &quot;whom&quot; in casual conversations they are using it incorrectly and they sound like pretentious idiots. you can avoid that by just not using it at all. everyone will always understand you for saying &quot;who&quot; in casual conversations.</p>
<p>3) that being said.. casual writing and convos &quot;who&quot; is always fine. they say you SHOULD use whom when possible in formal writing. but if you're using it make sure you use it correctly. it doesn't have the same interchangeability that &quot;who&quot; does... you sound dumb if you use &quot;whom&quot; in the wrong context. when in doubt, just say &quot;who&quot;.</p>
<p>but it's getting to the point where it's being phased out and eventually no one will say it anymore. (english does evolve over time, just like every language.  like i said we're phasing out pronoun cases.. and whom is the next to go.)</p>
<p>whatever you do, don't be a &quot;who/whom&quot; policeman in casual conversations or all your friends will hate you lol.</p>
<p>as you can tell from my post i'm starting a movement to phase out capital letters next. who's with me?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Noone will lend you anything. 900 is perfect. You could walk into a bank and ask for a $500k mortgage and you should have no problem.</p>
<p>How they're calculated is a closely guarded secret. But generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the more you pay off your debts (credit cards, line of credit) = good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pay off big % of your debts every month (good) vs. just paying the minimum (bad)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do you have just a few big debts like a mortgage and a line of credit that you make regular payments on? good. Or do you have lots of small debts like 3 credit cards, and 4 store credit cards that all carry balances?</p>
</li>
<li>more outstanding debt = bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this is one side of things. If you have a bad score but just got a massive raise, then your chances improve. Or a lender could also say &quot;pay off some of this debt first, then we'll talk about a loan.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a score that let's a bank know how responsible you are with your money, and how risky it is for them to lend to you. In other words, it's used to gauge how likely you are to pay off loans every month for long as it takes to pay the loan off completely. Essentially, a credit score is a <strong>responsibility score</strong> -- it won't <em>just</em> apply to loans. We'll talk about that later.</p>
<p>Several factors are used to come up with your credit score.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>35% of your credit score comes from you payment history.</strong> Basically they'll look at it all the loans and credit cards you've ever had, as well as stuff like insurance payments and rent, and see how often you make a late payment. So if the monthly payment on your auto loan is due on the 15th of every month, and you frequently pay it on the 25th, that will lower your credit score. <em>This means that paying stuff on time is really, really, important.</em></p>
</li>
<li><strong>30% of your credit score comes from your credit utilization rate.</strong> Your credit utilization rate is how much of your available credit you actually use. This is simpler than it sounds; take the amount you spend on a credit card, and divide it by your credit limit. Example 1: You have a credit card with a $1000 credit limit. You put about $200 on your credit card every month. Now divide $200 by $1000. The answer is 0.20. So your credit utilization rate is 20%. Example 2: You have a credit limit of $11000. You put about $9500 on your credit card each month. Divide $9500 by $11000. The answer is 0.86, so your credit utilization rate is 86%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, it's important to note here that a credit utilization rate of 20% or less is <em>good</em>. It means you're using credit to buy things, but not a crazy amount. This, along with a good payment history, makes you look great. BUT if your credit utilization rate is way higher, like, 86%, that makes you look very, very, bad. That tells bank that <em>most</em> of the money you spend is borrowed (credit is essentially borrowed money. Pay with your credit card now, then pay back the bank later).</p>
<p>So let's say I'm the bank and you're asking me for an auto loan. If your credit utilization rate is 90%, I definitely don't want to give you that loan. If so much of the money you spend is borrowed, how can you possibly have enough money to make payments on the auto loan? Onward, financially savvy  steed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>15% of your credit score comes from how long you've been using credit.</strong> Basically, this is just how long you've had credit cards, auto loans, etc. If you're 18, it won't be much. If you're 30, it'll be a lot higher. But remember, just like credit utilization rate, a long credit history doesn't help you if you have late payments; it actually hurts you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10% of your credit score comes from your mix of credit.</strong> Really simple -- do you have one credit card and that's it? Or do you have a credit card, a mortgage, two auto loans, and a personal loan? Much, much better. Having different kinds of credit to your name looks good. That doesn't mean run to the bank and start opening different types of accounts to get a good mix, though. You'll eventually probably end up with a good mix of credit without even trying to. Essentially, this is just a grownup thing. A really young person doesn't really need a mortgage and an auto loan. But a 50 year old probably does.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>The last 10% of your credit score comes from new accounts.</strong> What you don't want to do here is open a whole lot of new accounts (like credit cards) in a short amount of time. If I open five credit cards in three months, that tells the bank that I'm opening a credit card, finding out I can't pay for it, then opening another one just to pay for the first one. And a third credit card to pay for the second... You get the idea. </li>
</ul>
<p>And that's what a credit score is. But where does it come from? Who gives it to you?</p>
<p>Credit bureaus. There are three credit bureaus. Equifax, Transunion, and Experian. So here's how it works. You get a $3000 personal loan from the bank. You and the bank agree that you will pay them back $83.33 per month for three years. You pay the $83.33 every single month for three years, just like you said you would. Every single month, your bank will report to one of these three credit bureaus to let them know whether you're paying them on time or not. That information will go on your credit report and be used to come up with your score.</p>
<p>OR let's say you're renting an apartment for $600 a month. You pay your rent late about eight months out of the year. Every single month, your landlord tells the credit bureau whether you were on time or late. Those eight late payments  will make your score lower. (Not every landlord reports to the credit bureaus, btw.)</p>
<p>So one of those credit bureaus will use all that stuff that got sent to them by banks, landlords, etc, and use the above breakdown to spit out your score.</p>
<p>Two really important takeaways here.</p>
<p>One is to <strong>live within your means</strong>. Cannot be stressed enough. Just because you <em>can</em> buy a 2016 Camarro does not mean you <em>should.</em> Yes, you might be able to get the loan from the bank, but can you pay that loan back? </p>
<p>You might not have $1000 laying around, but if you really, really want to go ahead and buy that stupid really big TV, a credit card will do the trick. That doesn't make it a good idea. Remember, credit is <em>borrowed</em> money. Not <em>fake</em> money. Whatever you borrow, you have to pay back, with <em>interest</em>.</p>
<p>And the other takeaway is that <strong>the worse your credit score is, the more expensive life is.</strong> See, you can have a bad credit score and still get that auto loan. The difference is, if your score is bad, you might have an interest rate something like 18%. That's really, really, high. Like, stupid high. If you have an interest rate that high, you will end up paying many thousands of dollars more than the actual price of the car. Or, you'll have to pay the bank back <em>more</em> then you put on your credit card. See how a low credit score costs you money?</p>
<p>Let's say you're applying for a job, and the employer looks at your credit (this is really common with government jobs). Remember waaaay up top where we called your credit score a <strong>responsibility score</strong>? If your score is low, that employer will think you're irresponsible, and they won't give you a job. So again, your low score cost you money. A lot of landlords will even look at your credit. Having a low credit score can actually make it harder for you to find a place to live.</p>
<p>Your credit score is really, really, important. Having a higher one makes life much easier, financially. Don't just spend money and hope for the best. Use that breakdown above and maximize your credit score. Live within your means, be smart, and think about what you're buying. Thirty year old you will thank you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the past, when getting a loan (mortgage, car loan, credit card, etc.) the lending institution would have to review your credit report, and make judgement about whether to extend the loan or credit to you. But there were inconsistancies, and it took a long time. The 3 credit bureaus (who collect the data and provide it to lending institutions) developed algorithms that crunch all your data and spit out a score ranging from 300-850. This makes it easy most of the time, as the lending institution can set broad guidelines that make a decision almost instantly for 95% of people.</p>
<p>The score is compiled from pieces of data such as your credit utilization rate (amount of credit relative to amount of credit you have, ie. $1000 balance on a $5000 limit credit card is 20% utilization); number of accounts; history of on-time payments; whether there are negative marks on any accounts; length of credit history; how many other recent credit pulls.</p>
<p>So the way it's used is you go to buy a car and they request your credit score... let's say it's 770. They may not approve a loan to credit scores below 600, charge 6% on loans with scores between 600-720, 4% on scores 721-800, and 2% on scores over 800. So you'd qualify for a loan at 4%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5 is that a credit score is an estimate of how likely you are to default on credit based on how often other people who have a credit history like you have done so. Note that there are different credit scores for credit cards, home loans, auto loans and just about anything else. </p>
<p>FICO works with the credit reporting companies to save everyone's credit report each month and they can basically look at people who had a credit report similar to yours in the past and see how many of them will miss a payment or default on their loan in the future. </p>
<p>Banks decide that they only want to loan money to people who have a low probability of defaulting or that if you have a higher chance of defaulting they will charge more interest on the loan. </p>
<p>The credit score is like predicting the weather. If the weather report says 80% chance of rain tomorrow It doesn't mean it will rain, just that in the past when the weather was like it is today that 80% of the time it rained the next day. </p>
<p>The credit score is not a judgement about you; however people use it to judge you; so if you're going to be judged by it then it's important to look as good as you can. How to do that is another topic. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: it's an estimate of how often people with credit histories like yours are likely to default in the future. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for one of the major credit bureaus and I can say most everyone here has laid it out pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>But explaining like you are 5:</strong></p>
<p>It is a number that lets companies, not just banks (car dealerships, department stores, banks.. etc.) know how likely or able you are to pay off a loan should you get one to purchase items. This is called Debt to Income Ratio.  They take into consideration how much money you make versus how much money you are paying out. If you earn a certain amount yearly, can you pay all your rent/house mortgage and bills and still afford that new car too? Also how well are you at paying off your loans or credit cards. The better you are at it, the higher your score and the more people are willing to lend to you.</p>
<p>It was originally invented as a way for banks/lenders to let other banks/lenders know that you already had a loan or account with them and if you were paying them like you were supposed to.  This also was supposed to prevent you from taking a loan out one bank and not paying it back and going to another bank and taking out a loan with them and not paying that one either.  This allows the second bank/lender know you were not paying your bills so they would not lend to you.  Much the way it is today.  </p>
<p>Later the Credit Score was added.  Basically, this was a way for a lender to quickly look at your credit history and see if you were someone they wanted to lend to.   By having a quick visual of a number, they didn't have to sift through the information and actually read or decide on their own if you were a good risk.</p>
<p>While everyone is right about how the score is figured, it is a bit more complicated than that.  The reason being is there is more than one credit bureau company.  Each one weighs or factors your score a bit differently.  That is why if you pull your score from each company, it is not the same. Some factor how well you pay your bills with more &quot;weight&quot; than how much much total credit you used in comparison to how much total you have to use. Some will drop your score more if you miss a payment to a lender, more than another one will.</p>
<p>Honestly, there really are too many variables to explain each one unless you seriously have a bad score and history and are trying to figure all this out and how to get your credit score up. So I will just leave it at there are several factors that the credit bureaus look at (Did you pay your bills on time, how much your total line of credit is versus how much you actually used, how long have you had credit... etc) to determine your score and if you are a good risk to take if you apply for a loan or line of credit.</p>
<p>I will also quickly mention that the lenders, when they pull your credit score and credit history, can also exclude factors on your credit score/history to alter the credit score number.  For example, when my daughter purchased her house a few years back, the lender that gave her the loan to purchase her house, removed any information about medical bills that were not paid, which increased her credit score and ultimately gave her a lower interest rate and the amount of money that they were willing to lend her.  This is not uncommon when it comes to medical bills on your credit record, unfortunately, I do not know the reason why.</p>
<p>TLDR, It is a number that tells lenders what kind of a risk they will take if they were to extend you credit for a credit card, mortgage loan, car loan... etc.  The higher the number, the better &quot;risk&quot; you are or the better chance you have to get that line of credit or loan.</p>
<p>I have personally helped many people look at their credit history and score, learn to understand it and also showed them how to increase the score or what steps they should take to &quot;clean up&quot; their credit history and how to actually get this done.  I do not get paid to do this, I do it because after working with a credit bureau for a while, they really can do a number on people who do not understand this information.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me and I will be happy to answer any questions you have. Just please keep in mind I only check Reddit every few days or so, so I might not respond the same day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a part of your brain that paralyzes you when you fall asleep. It blocks every signal that your brain tries to send to your muscles. That part is unsynced or damaged in people who sleepwalk.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the person is also able to look around, espond to stimuli and do complex tasks like talking or making themselves a sandwich or even driving. There's a special condition in the same vein that causes the sleeping person to attempt to beat the shit out of their sleeping partner. That's an indication of brain degeneration.</p>
<p>This is during the dreaming part of sleep called REM, where your brain is very very active and able to do complex tasks. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a problem everywhere these drugs are available.</p>
<p>When many of the drugs were put on the market, the risk of tolerance/addiction was either downplayed or not fully understood. Keep in mind that there are <em>still</em> doctors who don't believe opioids are potentially problematic and just keep writing prescriptions. Research is a lot more transparent these days and more people understand that something isn't right, but it takes time to change the culture. </p>
<p>There are a few contributing factors. </p>
<p>One, opioid withdrawal is really, really awful and very difficult without the right supports in place. </p>
<p>Two, the standard practice is to simply cut people off and stop writing prescriptions rather than address the underlying addiction. With detox looming, street drugs become a substitution. </p>
<p>Three, there are relatively few evidence-based detox and recovery beds for prescription opioid users. </p>
<p>Four, a shocking number of people still see addiction as a moral issue rather than a medical issue. They don't want their tax dollars/research dollars/healthcare dollars going to <em>junkies on the street</em> who <em>choose that lifestyle</em> and should just <em>pull themselves together and contribute to society</em>. And things like <em>harm reduction</em>? You mean this program <em>doesn't</em> force abstinence? The end result is that objectively helpful approaches like harm reduction tend to be unpopular politically, so they just don't happen.</p>
<p>Five, alternatives to opioids in pain management are still catching up and opioids may be the only option in some cases.</p>
<p>Basically, a lot of different systems failed and continue to fail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Jumping in from both the pharmacy profession inside the US and as someone who travels internationally a fair bit (including outside of the traditional &quot;West&quot;), I have a couple comments.</p>
<p>Prescription opioid abuse exists pretty much everywhere that prescription opioids exist. There are several reasons why its a mainstream issue here and less so elsewhere. </p>
<p>First, prescription opioids are just more common and more available here compared to most of the world. </p>
<p>Second, the relative availability and ease of access to prescription opioids versus the same for 'street' opiates makes prescription drug abuse much more attractive than it is in places where street opiates are cheap and easy to get hold of. </p>
<p>Third, we've had numerous public health and media campaigns here highlighting the issue. I have traveled in certain countries where vaguely similar epidemics are occurring, but the people there don't really recognize it for what it is.</p>
<p>Just a note - most of my experience with this outside of the US and the West in general is in the Middle East, where I travel frequently but do not practice. I've been struck by local ignorance when it comes to what types of drugs people are consuming and for what reasons. They know that some people are taking lots of medicine for less than medical reasons but they ignore it because it's unsightly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While opioids and other drug epidemics exist all around the world for many different reasons, the U.S. has it's own set of special problems caused by a very firm stance against drugs. The war on drugs is the best example. </p>
<p>Now, in other countries like Portugal, drug laws are a lot more loose. You don't go to prison for years just for doing heroin. At least not all the time. This means that instead of punishing people who have serious addiction problems, they offer them needle-exchange programs and healthcare. Heroin addicts in countries like these live much better lives and are given the opportunities to get their life back on track. This means that a lot of heroin users in some other countries are not only able to function in daily life, but they are also given the help they need to quit abusing. Addicts here don't often stay addicts, and thus their addiction rates are low. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, in America the law isn't so lenient. Addicts in the U.S. of A. are severely punished for their problems. Addicts here aren't given the tools to keep their lives on track, and thus spiral into a drug-fueled nightmare life. Addicts in America are often poor, unhealthy, and looked down on. Not only this, but they are also thrown in prison for years because of their addiction, making them even less likely to get their life fixed up. </p>
<p>This means that American addicts often stay addicts. The numbers pile up. If you want to find out more about the negative effects of the war in drugs, I would suggest reading up on countries with better laws here </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several have mentioned erythropoietin and increased production of red blood cells in bone marrow, but that isn't the whole picture. We also need to increase the actual blood volume to compensate for the bleeding. </p>
<p>The kidney has a ton of different functions. One of them is regulating your blood pressure. When you lose blood, your kidney will notice a fall in blood pressure as the blood flow through the organ decreases. To compensate, the kidney will start reabsorbing more water from urine (or rather, primary urine), which will increase the blood volume. (It does this by increasing its secretion of an enzyme called renin, which will cause the production of a hormone called angiotensin. Angiotensin increases the reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidney, which will cause water reabsorption by osmosis.) </p>
<p>In addition, there are receptors in some of your larger arteries (particularly the carotid bifurcation) that can also sense a fall in blood pressure. These are called baroreceptors. They will signal to the brain and tell it to release a hormone called ADH, which also makes the kidney absorb more water. </p>
<p>So to answer your question: Your body has several ways of measuring blood pressure and will retain water if blood pressure falls (i.e. your blood volume decreases as a result of bleeding). When enough water has been retained, your blood pressure will normalise. When this happens, the kidney will stop reabsorbing extra water and therefore stop increasing the blood volume.</p>
<p>I hope this helped! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The bone marrow produces stem cells, the building blocks that the body uses to make the different blood cells – red cells, white cells and platelets.

<p>Your body makes about 2 million new red cells every second, so it doesn't take long to build up stores of them again.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>I copy-pasted this from an old post I made on /r/pcmasterrace</em></p>
<p>To understand how anti aliasing works, I'm first going to explain why it is needed. First you need to know what a sample is.</p>
<h3>How images are rendered</h3>
<p>Imagine your computer is rendering an <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Y4gW0Qu.png" target="_blank">image of a tomato on top of a table</a>. In order to render the image each of the 1920 * 1080 pixels on your screen needs to have colors assigned to them. This isn't as easy as viewing a video or an image. The tomato can be viewed from any angle, and the pixels will need to be recalculated many times every second to produce a smooth animation.</p>
<p>A sample is a light/color calculation that can be thought of as an infinitesimally thin ray of light. Imagine that you have a bunch of these rays of light, and pretend these light rays are 1-dimensional objects - lines - that are going straight through your screen. For those familiar with optics this is called normally incident. Most often each pixel will get one ray of light.</p>
<p>Most often your computer runs a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/IG9pbks.png" target="_blank">single one of these rays through the middle of a pixel</a> (the surrounding pixels in that image are highlighted to make it easier to see the sample). When one of the rays hits an object in the game, it bounces off and goes back through the same pixel it came from, this time with the color of the object it hit. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/SK1vYX4.png" target="_blank">That ray then determines the color for the whole pixel</a>.</p>
<h3>Why AA is needed</h3>
<p>Now most of the time this works pretty well. If you have two pixels from the same object that are right next to each other - like two pixels on the inside of our tomato - they'll have pretty similar colors and the image will look smooth. However, when you reach the edge of this tomato, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/xSFk13p.png" target="_blank">you'll eventually find a pixel is no longer over top of the tomato</a>. The pixel on the left will be red like the tomato, but the one to the right of it will be brown like the table it's on. The difference in color is dramatic. The pixels are either on the tomato or not, there is no middle ground.</p>
<p>The problem here is that the pixel's don't accurately represent what's going. If you look at the &quot;pixels&quot; drawn over <a href="http://i.imgur.com/rc3wMbi.png" target="_blank">the image of the tomato</a> you'll see that the area covered by the some of pixel has too much information to be conveyed by a single ray of light. On the right half of the pixel there's the table, and on the left half there's the tomato. Other pixels contain significantly less information. The pixels in the upper left corner of the image have fairly uniform colors throughout them, so when they are reduced to a single sample there is less information loss.</p>
<p>The solution programmers have come up with this problem is what we call anti-aliasing. The game engine <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ip01OiT.png" target="_blank">takes more than one sample per pixel</a> (either one in each corner of the pixel, a few different samples in a grid formation, or sometimes even in random locations). Some will hit the tomato and some will hit the table. The colors are then averaged together to give you your final pixel color.</p>
<h3>Types of Antialiasing</h3>
<p>The method of AA that's the simplest to understand is called super sampling anti-aliasing (SSAA). It simply takes more than one sample in every pixel on the screen. Because sample calculations take a while to do, this form of AA is extremely taxing on your graphics card. You're essentially rendering the same screen multiple times.</p>
<p>Another form of AA is called multi-sampling anti-aliasing (MSAA). This form of AA has an intelligent algorithm that finds out what pixels need more than one sample, and then simply does more samples on those pixels. This form of AA is much cheaper than SSAA and is also a lot more popular. MSAA doesn't work well for all games. Minecraft is the best example of a game where the edges of objects aren't the only thing that needs to be anti-aliased. Take a look at the insides of block textures. The game doesn't blur anything inside of blocks like most other games do, so SSAA is the best option for Minecraft.</p>
<p>There are other forms of AA, but these two are the most popular and the simplest to describe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Try taking some basic LEGO® bricks (let's use some black 2x2 blocks  for our example, part #3003) and try to make a diagonal line with them. You'll find the best you can do looks like a staircase with zigzaggy corners.</p>
<p>Now step back and squint a bit so your vision is blurry. The further you are, the less you notice the pointy corners. If you were to do the same thing with DUPLO® bricks of the same 2x2 size and color (part #3437), you'de find a similar effect, but you'de have to be much farther away to make it look less zigzaggy.</p>
<p>So how can we get rid of the zigzaggyness? One way, as we saw, is to use smaller bricks (pixels), which allow us to be closer. But there's also another trick you can use. Going back to your original smaller bricks (which are black, on your conviniently white table), start placing grey bricks so that they touch a black brick on two sides. You'll notice the line is bigger, but if you step back and squint, it'll look even less zigzaggy than before. That's because the grey is the color in between the line and the background, which means they blend together better when we look at them. This is a type of antialiasing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Pixels are all square.  That means they are very good at drawing straight lines, but very bad at drawing curved and diagonal lines, because things start looking jagged.</p>
<p>Anti-aliasing uses blur and smoothing to hide the jagged edges so that things don't look quite as pixelated.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aliasing happens when you try to describe something that changes rapidly, and you can't describe it fast enough. For example, imagine you're measuring a half a meter deep hole, and your measuring stick is only capable of measuring in full meters. Whatever measurement you leave with, you've lost information of the real size; you're left with an approximation. </p>
<p>The same thing happens in sound. Say you want to measure a 10Hz wave (moves up and down ten times a second), but you are only capable of measuring it five times a second. You'll never get an accurate representation of the true shape of the wave, and anything you come out with is distorted. This is aliasing. The more samples you make, the closer you get to a real representation what the shape truly is.</p>
<p>A guy called Nyquist proved that in order to sample a frequency, we need to sample at at least twice the rate. </p>
<p>So, anti aliasing is a way of getting around these fundamental issues in what happens when we lose information in our signals. With pixels for example, the square edges introduce such a harsh transition that we lose information of what goes on between the pixels. An interesting way of reducing this effect includes sub pixel anti aliasing, where you take advantage of the fact that each pixel is comprised of a discrete R, G, B value, smaller than the pixel itself and therefore capable of generating higher 'spatial' frequencies. It has been proven that you can share these colour components with neighbours to try and spoof the missing information, producing what appears to be a much higher quality image.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apparently Reddit is full of gamers who tell you nothing of the core concept. </p>
<p>So let's start with what aliasing is. Let's say your checking to see how often a light blinks. So you decide you are going to check it every minute to see if it's on. </p>
<p>You start the timer and you see that the light is on at the minute mark. Aha.. You say it blinks every minute. But wait... What if it was blinking every 30 seconds... And because you were checking every minute, you only saw every second blink and missed the 30th second blink event. </p>
<p>So you say... Fine. I will check every 30 seconds now. And yet the question can be asked... What it was blinking every 15 seconds and you only saw every second and forth blink event?
Essentially, you were seeing blinks that were partly determined by your speed of checking for them. You saw 1 when there could have been 2,4,6,8 etc. Blinks in that minute. </p>
<p>There is a pattern here which I won't get you but this inaccuracy that occurred is called aliasing. </p>
<p>This goes on and on and you eventually reach a conclusion. You can only be absolutely sure of the frequency of something if you check it at least twice as fast as that frequency. This is called the Shannon Nyquist sampling theorem. </p>
<p>Anti-aliasing is basically the opposite of this and depending on how complicated the setup of frequencies is, methods to anti alias also change. The fundamental method of anti aliasing is simply check the frequency more often in time or space and hope that you are at least twice as fast as the actual frequency.  This is called supersampling. </p>
<p>You could do something more complicated. For example. You could check every 10 seconds , and also every  15 seconds. This means you will be able to see blinks if they occur at some point for all multiples of 10 and 15 seconds. That's pretty good. By checking at 2 different speeds, you've sort of reduced the need to go faster for one frequency. This is called multisampling</p>
<p>Now in a computer for graphics, aliasing occurs because pixels are processed at a certain frequency, change at another and are displayed at still another frequency. This creates the jarring because of aliasing (you aren't getting all processor produced pixels displayed because you screen refresh is to slow for example). You have to use extra tricks in the GPU to makes sure the image does not get jarred. This is anti-aliasing... Performed by more complicated algorithms of the same basic steps above.</p>
<p>Edit : A lot people seem to be assuming that the word &quot;frequency&quot; only refers to temporal frequency. It doesn't, your assumption is flawed. Before the &quot;this is wrong&quot; comment, I recommend you read up on Fourier analysis. <a href="https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci773s1c/lectures/ImageProcessing-html/topic1.htm" target="_blank">https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/courses/compsci773s1c/lectures/ImageProcessing-html/topic1.htm</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a sailor's perspective, we're envious of how easy space is. </p>
<p>Since the vacuum of space is transparent, Houston can see exactly where their ships are going. For exploration that's a big fucking deal.  Unlike Columbus they don't leave Europe thinking they're going to hit India. With undersea exploration it's the same problem. The points of interest in the sea aren't bright shining stars or planets that you can see from across the solar system. Biologically, eyes work in space but they don't work underwater. The technological challenges to observe and monitor phenomena are harder when you're blind.  Yes, the seafloor is just a few miles away, and not in the Andromeda galaxy, but for all intents and purposes it might as well be on the moon. It's more difficult to observe and monitor with Hubble-like clarity.</p>
<p>Because of eyes and the emptiness of space, all Galileo needed was a $50 telescope and an abacus or whatever. As a space explorer, he not just mapped the solar system but he modeled the orbits. He mapped both distance and <em>time</em>, space-time.  Exploration-wise, that's like the whole ballgame. Since things move and change, it's important to be able to plot where stuff will be and what the conditions will be in the future.  It's difficult to engineer solutions without reliably predicting that stuff. </p>
<p>Since most of space is, well space, devoid of matter, the is no friction and water mass moving things around, just gravity. The math and physics of gravity are so simple Galileo could do it and Apollo could do it with slide-rules. But the ocean, like the weather, is governed by fluid dynamics as well as gravity. This is a much more computationally intensive type of physics to math out. It's hard to the measure and describe dimensions of a blob of liquid.  Validating a model of how a blob of water moves in relation to temperature and gravity is more difficult than watching a few individual planets interact gravitation-ally.  So if you want to know where an undersea current is going to move a sandbar or a fishery in the water column, you can't simply plot its orbit with relatively simple arithmetic.  So mapping and modelling is a big problem. With today's super computers we've just barely begun to create reliable 'Galileo-level' weather models. Hydrodynamic models are a unconquered frontier of science and computational power. </p>
<p>Communication is another line of sight problem. Apollo can phone anyone on Earth from the moon with radio signals because he can see the whole thing. Radio doesn't work underwater terribly well. On the surface you need to bounce off satellites to get around the curvature of the Earth.  It sounds like a dumb, solvable problem but the physics of a large mass of water between you and where you want to go is a stubborn, unrelenting obstacle. Yeah, the vacuum of space sucks, but it's kind of a stable, unchanging environment compared the the dynamic, interacting, multi-factorial oceangraphic, geological, biological, meteorological ocean processes.</p>
<p>While escaping Earth's gravity is difficult, once you're in space, the frictonless travel means you can cover great distances in orbit without an ongoing expenditure of energy. Unmanned probes need more care and feeding at the bottom of the ocean. Things at great depth on the seafloor fail because the forces exerted by the water are greater than those in a vacuum. Think of the failure of the Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventor. Difficult to say whether the oil companies have a bigger budget than NASA when it comes to undersea exploration for oil...</p>
<p>So I would argue that we don't necessarily spend more money on space exploration or have more success colonizing space. It's just that the money we do spend generates a lot more exploration than a similar expenditure can achieve at exploring and monitoring the undersea environment. Like exploration is more than just getting there. You have to be able to write home and describe how the New World works. Want me to send my ship to an ice moon? Better know how geysers and shit works.  You have to be able to understand its forces to engineer operational solutions. You need to be able to leverage its advantages for your gain. </p>
<p>We've explored ways to do that at the surface. But blindness underwater is a stubborn problem. Yes the abyss feels close, but it is much less logistically inhabitable than the International Space Station.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The exploration of space is for multiple reasons : </p>
<ul>
<li>Having a backup plan if the planet Earth is not habitable anymore.</li>
<li>Using the planet to put all the factories and other things that pollute to have a clean earth and have atmospheric layer on this planet.</li>
<li>Having a way of pression in case of war (a missile laucher in space would be pretty scary).</li>
</ul>
<p>And probably more...</p>
<p>The oceans on the other hand are smaller in size than a planet and have a lot of pressure (that's in part why we didn't explore them, we don't have the equipment to handle that much pressure yet). Also, there is no natural light in the deep water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There has to be a way to build and live there, create sustainable energy from it, and turn it into drinking water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can do all of these things. Underwater structures exist. Hydro-power exists, and desalination exists. There's not a particularly large base of people clamoring to live under the sea however, so the market doesn't really exist.</p>
<p>Also I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;more money on exploring space.&quot; space exploration is limited to relatively few entities, mostly governments.</p>
<p>All kinds of entities, public and private, are exploring the oceans. For instance, energy companies attempting to exploit underwater mineral content. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am just confused why we are constantly looking to space for future answers, when we still have 70% of the world left for possible expansion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We aren't really exploring space for &quot;Expansion.&quot; There's still a fair amount of room simply on the surface of the Earth that <em>isn't</em> water. There are no realistic plans in the foreseeable future for a significant portion of the Earth's population moving to another planet or Moon, and any sort of movement that actually put a dent in Earth's population is just about logistically inconceivable, no matter how good our technology. </p>
<p>We explore space for <em>information.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need to understand the objectives of space exploration vs deep ocean.</p>
<p>Astrophysics provides insights on how the forces of the universe work leading to new materials, manufacturing methods, etc. Things we use today vs a misguided notion of extra-terrestial colonies (I'm all for trying to put humans on Mars but that's just a small extension for space exploration).</p>
<p>Experiments in zero gravity have yield a vast amount of new tech and medicine that have improved lives. Satellite have expanded globalization, understanding of climate and environment. </p>
<p>Deep ocean exploration is designed to understand how life evolves in different environments, and that (so far) can't be done in space. There's significant breakthroughs in understanding of life forms and evolution with deep sea exploration.</p>
<p>But while worth to be explored, deep sea imposes serious physical barriers. The pressure alone is a major deterrent. It's easy to pressurize a space station but the human body can't live for long periods under sea pressure as the higher density of air will cause pulmonary toxicity. Even life under 40ft would cause devastating long term damage to the body.</p>
<p>Underwater habitats would not be practical considering waves, currents and storms. The danger of physical harm outweighs any desire to pursue further, specially since there are terrestrial alternatives still being explored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ever since humans started having a concious mind, people have pointed up at the moon and stars, and each night they looked, they were in awe by the beauty of the sky. Soon, questions arose: &quot;What are those twinkles in the sky?&quot;, &quot;Are <em>we</em> a twinkle?&quot;. And then the creation of us also became a question. What made the other planets? Are we alone?</p>
<p>There are more planets and solar systems than there are oceans on our world, and we humans enjoy a good adventure. Everyone can go swimming in the ocean, and everyone knows whats at the bottom. Fish, and different types of fish and water creatures. No one wants to hear about a new fish, but everyone wants to know about a potential for life millions of miles away from home. Our ocean, like the universe, is vast, but nowhere near as vast as the home to all things known to man, space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your brain as a space ship and alcohol as a solar storm the ship has to travel through. </p>
<p>As the solar storm intensifies (more alcohol), the ship has to divert power from other components to maintain power on the shield and protect the ship. One of the first changes is that the AI autopilot (smart decision making) gets switched to a basic manual controls (impaired judgement). </p>
<p>As the storm intensifies, the captain decides to disable the flight recorder logs to save power. This means that the current flight data (short term memory) is not stored to the archives (long term memory).</p>
<p>This is what happens when we drink too much alcohol. It's not that we lost memories but the alcohol prevents us from recording them in the first place. Low to medium amounts may result in patches of time when memory is not recorded but heavy drinking can result in whole sections of time where you have no memory of what occurred. Alcohol does not erase memories as you generally remember all the events that occurred before you started drinking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol affects a specific receptor in the brain that is responsible for memory formation. When you drink too much, this receptor is unable to work properly and you &quot;black out&quot; because you're brain isn't capable of creating new memories (which is an interesting distinction from creating the memories and later forgetting them).</p>
<p>If you want a slightly less ELI5 answer, in order to create a memory, the NMDA receptors in the hippocampus must be activated. This is accomplished by the presence of the neurotransmitter glutamate coincided with depolarization of the neuron (which itself is usually caused by activation of AMPA receptors which causes flow of sodium ions into the neuron). Activation of the NMDA receptor allows calcium to flow into the neuron, which causes vesicles that contain AMPA receptors to bind to the neuron's outer membrane. This increase in AMPA receptors on the neuron's surface is known as short-term potentiation and is the first step in long-term potentiation (which usually involves neurons creating new connections with one another). Long-term potentiation is what allows us to store memories. Alcohol, however, inhibits the NMDA receptor. In the presence of alcohol calcium cannot enter the neuron and, as such, new memories cannot be formed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Memories are formed in the brain by neurons making new connections. A theory is that alcohol effects how the neurons form connections such that without alcohol the neurons don't connect.</p>
<p>There is a field of study called State-dependent memory. The basic idea is that if you get drunk, when you are sober you won't really remember what happened. But if you get drunk again you will be able to remember.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
