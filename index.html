		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IANAL but I do mod a site that has to deal with this. The laws are rather iffy. In Canada and Great Britain (but i don't know if that includes the whole UK) it IS illegal to own/view such images (and if nothing else they can be the basis to search your computer or belongings for more 'solidly' illegal material). In the US it is mostly not illegal as long as it is fictional and not realistic. The site i mod for is hosted in the US and for years we instantly removed anything that depicted the characters as children, or explicitly called them younger than 14 (but also based on art style to exclude the 1000 year old 6 year old bullshit). </p>
<p>We have since allowed the loli/shota/cub stuff but only quarantined behind a secondary filter in a community you have to sub to to see, same for bestiality themed content: you only see it if you really really opt to and if it's anywhere else we burn it with fire.</p>
<p>The reason for the change was that it was figured to be far enough away from the crime. A picture of murder is not a murder - the crime is killing, not seeing it - a picture of a naked child is a naked child - the crime is 'sexually viewing' a child - but a picture of a fake naked child is not a naked child. It is blurry as all fuck. However, and this is where the admin talked a bit to a lawyer but i don't have the conversation anymore, there is a weird legal bit where the more realistic it is the more blurred the line becomes; shota-cub is pretty far from a real kid being harmed but editing a picture of a 12 year old to make them seem sexual is pretty close to a kid being harmed. The same rule weirdly enough goes for bestiality themed drawings and animations; the closer it looks to being real the closer it is to the crime itself. </p>
<p>The main reason is that children are &quot;Our Children&quot; and being soft on any issue like that is political suicide; so where other things can still be called art as soon as kids are involved the art claim gets overruled by the &quot;My Kid&quot; claim.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It simply is that the possession of sexualised images of children is illegal in and of itself.  With rape and murder however it is the act that is illegal and possessing images of that act doesn't constitute a crime in and of itself (outside of being the one to take them or deliberately concealing them from the police or various other crimes like that).</p>
<p>There are certain concessions made for non-photographic work imported from outside the country for non-mainstream entertainment (manga, anime, visual novels, etc.) but for most of these they'll adjust the ages of characters up to 18 where possible in translated versions or downplay the sexualisation through careful editing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems no one is answering the heart of this question which is &quot;Why is it ok for violent acts but not this?&quot;</p>
<p>I believe it has to do with the majority of individuals not having an innate attraction to adolescents. The concern is that with exposure to sexualized images of children people will begin to sexualize adolescents when they otherwise would not and therefore lead to more instances of sexual abuse in real life. </p>
<p>In regards to violence on the other hand, while it is not accepted it is understood to be part of our natural mental makeup. Showing images in regards to violence in essence isn't going to instill any feelings that weren't seen to be naturally there in the first place. Now whether it manages to incite more violence or not is another debate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laws are sometimes based on emotion and not actual logic because laws are made by people.  Many people including law makers believe if sexualized images of children were freely legal, it would promote more danger to the welfare of children.  This idea is as antiquated as prohibition laws in the US for alcohol. What it amounts to logically is a thought crime. This does not somehow apply to murder and gore. </p>
<p>The same idea of laws based on emotion go for hate crimes. The idea is that for some reason already heinous crimes are &quot;more&quot; illegal now because the intent was based on hate. The idea of making possession of pornographic imagery illegal is akin to the war on drugs or making prostitution illegal. What we are doing is not attacking the root of the problem which is the heart and mind. </p>
<p>Back to the CP problem and why it is a thought crime.  If I view sexual imagery of children, the thought is I have the &quot;potential&quot; to harm children or promote the harming of children. So I must be jailed for the &quot;potential&quot; and not for the crime of raping children. </p>
<p>Let's use that logic for something else such as murder, which we should inherently think is very bad. In a world of complete command and control, we would make any imagery of killing illegal including video games because it has the &quot;potential&quot; of spreading violence and murder. </p>
<p>Please try and convince me otherwise in a logical manner, or just let the flaming and down votes commence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ask yourself why a room doesn't just grown infinitely bright over time after you turn the light on?</p>
<p>Light is absorbed by everything in the room at some rate. It's also reflected at some rate as well. When you turn on the light there is an initial period  of increasing brightness as the reflected light builds up, but then it reaches a state of equilibrium (much too fast to be perceptible, except in regard to the ramp up of the brightness of the light source itself). The light will have a characteristic number of average &quot;bounces&quot; in its lifetime before it is absorbed. Let's say you have a very &quot;bright&quot; room with 90% reflectivity (roughly mirror-bright). That means 10% of light is absorbed. After 131 bounces a given photon will have only a one in a million chance of having avoided being absorbed in such an environment.</p>
<p>If you have, say, a 10m wide room, that's roughly 1310m of total distance traveled. Which a photon will travel in only 4.4 microseconds. So when you turn the lights off in a 10m wide mirror room the light will be one millionth as bright within 4 microseconds of the light going out. And 4 microseconds after that it will be one million times dimmer still, after only 12 microseconds the light will be a quintillion times dimmer than the start. In a very short amount of time even the vast number of photons produced by a light source will be completely absorbed on an instantaneous timescale for a human. A 100% efficient 100 Watt source of 2 eV red photons would produce 3e20 photons per second, which would be reduced to fewer than 1 photon in our hypothetical room in only 15 microseconds.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I corrected some math mistakes! Sorry, I was tired last night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Then he challenged us to work through all of the standard equations with that theory.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Fijian and Tongan iguanas form a genus of their own, <em>Brachylophus</em>, which is a part of the Iguaninae (also containing marine iguanas, spinytail iguanas, green iguanas, and others). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain their isolation. The most widely followed one involves rafting from the Americas. It is not unthinkable that iguanas would be able to raft for such long distances; they possess nasal salt glands and also thick skin. </p>
<p>Where exactly in the Americas they actually originated from is hard to determine. Interestingly, morphologically <em>Brachylophus</em> is more similar to the likewise arboreal <em>Iguana</em> than other island-dwelling iguanas like <em>Cyclura</em> and <em>Ctenosaura</em>, which tend to be ground-dwellers. <em>Iguana</em> is incidentally relatively widespread in South America. It remains possible that <em>Brachylophus</em> diverged from the latter through some ancestral population around Mexico or the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
<p>Like <em>Brachylophus</em>, the red mangrove <em>Rhizophora mangle</em> is known from Fiji and Tonga (and also Galapagos), but basically nowhere else in the Pacific. Interestingly, it forms a large part of the diet of <em>Cyclura</em>. <em>Iguana</em> and <em>Brachylophus</em> eat it too. Certainly suggestive that <em>Rhizophora</em> may have played a role in the dispersal of <em>Brachylophus</em>.</p>

Look at this map and consider that for tens of thousands of years prior to the end of the last ice age, sea level was more than 300 feet lower than it is now. There would have been a line of islands providing a route that many species could have taken to cross the pacific, including humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Seriously though, /u/iorgfeflkd's answer is a good one in general, but only if you can bring a detailed &quot;map&quot; with you. If you can bring a reference then by identifying the location of certain objects you can easily identify across galactic distances (like pulsars) then you can locate Earth in 3D space pretty straightforwardly.</p>
<p>But your question seems to be more &quot;how would someone find their way to Earth if they just had their memory to go on?&quot; Which is a different and more complicated problem.</p>
<p>First off is the easy stuff, like knowing that Earth isn't near the core or near the edges, that eliminates a big chunk of the galaxy as search space. Then you have other things, like having the Andromeda galaxy and the Magellenic Clouds being visible in the sky. That eliminates a lot of potential stars that would otherwise have the Milky Way in between those objects and obscure them from view.</p>
<p>Then you have some &quot;trivia&quot; which you might be able to use if for some reason you could remember it. For example, the mass. If you have some alien star catalog you could figure out what the equivalent of 2e30 kg would be and look just for stars of that type. Solitary stars (non binary or trinary stars) and then if you got lucky you might be able to search that catalog for systems with Earth's planetary menagerie.</p>
<p>If that sort of thing isn't an option then you're going to have to fallback on other techniques. Generally you'll look for notable stars and nebulae that are near Earth to find the neighborhood and then find the star system that would end up matching the same stars in the sky as Earth. You might be able to track down the Orion nebula, the Pleiades, Betelgeuse, and Sirius, for example. And between those you should be able to get <em>really</em> close to Earth. Once you can find Sirius (a bright white star only about 2x as massive as the Sun with a white dwarf companion) then you can basically just look at the nearby stars and find which one is the Sun. You can also try looking for the alpha centauri system, which is a triple star system near Sirius with two closely orbiting stars and one more distant dwarf star. The closer you get to Earth the more the constellations will start looking similar to what you're familiar with, so that's a big help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>From the outset, you'd need to have an awareness of the spiral structure of the galaxy, and know which arm the Sun is in and roughly how far out from the center it is. </p>
<p>Within a few thousand light years, the Hyades is an extremely recognizable signpost. From there, the Pleiades is easy to spot. Given those two points of reference, plus the vector toward the center of the galaxy, one can recall a rough vector toward the Sun. Moving along this vector, you'll know you're close when you see Orion take shape. You fine tune it by aligning the stars in the hand holding the bow, as they are nearest the Sun.</p>
<p>From that close, you should be able to spot Alpha Centauri and the Sun as they are a close pair. Within the system, motion parallax should reveal each of the planets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you flatten the town, your country loses it's largest producer of widgets.  Generations of experience, tools and machinery evaporated.  You still need widgets, but now someone has to kick out millions to rebuild the factory and the town around it to produce them within the country again, and even then it'll be a year before you're in production.  </p>
<p>Until you're producing again you'll have to pay double the price for imported widgets, which is made even more complicated when the US has <a href="http://media.jrn.com/images/2000*1247/b99685395z.1_20160313230454_000_gsnerv85.1-1.jpg" target="_blank">1000ft of freedom</a> parked off your coast, enforcing a trade embargo.  </p>

<p>This is pretty much why. Chemical weapons tend to have very high human casualties while being able to minimise damage to infrastructure. </p>
<p>To achieve the same effect with conventional armaments you would incur far greater collateral damages in terms of infrastructure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you say that currently in the 6 year Syrian Civil War, that conventional weapons are winning it for the Government? I would say not, that in fact conventional weapons clearly aren't strong enough to dislodge any kind of rebel. Chemical weapons are extremely powerful, both physically and psychologically. </p>
<p>Dropping Sarin gas on a village and killing everyone indiscriminately is a terrifying move. Both sides have guns, both sides have rockets, etc, but only one side has the means to 100% kill everyone in an area. </p>
<p>So, there are tactical reasons why, to dislodge an enemy they have been unable to dislodge using conventional weapons. There are psychological reasons, to scare your enemy into surrender. Sending a message, we won't just bomb you, we will poison the air so even your kids just die, and then if you survived, we'll bomb the clinic too - and most importantly Trump won't do shit. Putin won't allow his boy Trump to do anything, so why not use it? What's gonna happen if you do?</p>
<p>The last reason is that Syrian Command and Control structure ain't exactly top of the line. The US spends billions and billions in training and technology to enforce a command structure in which orders are always followed - and it still doesn't stop some humans being human and doing what <em>they</em> want. The US armed forces are still rife with violations of the geneva convention, still struggles with the problem of soldiers and commanders doing things based on their own personal desires rather than the desire of their commander.</p>
<p>So the Syrian army definitely has men in it capable of ignoring the prospect of outrage and uproar and just using sarin gas because he is an evil bastard. Or he's angry, or...whatever reason.</p>
<p>My best guess is that this was not authorised by Assad, nor Russia. A commander just decided, he didn't want to deal with bullshit, send in the gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If tachyons exist, then considering one tachyon there is at least one frame where its energy is negative (this comes from a bit of relativistic geometry). Now, consider the lowest energy state there is (the ground, or real vacuum) and then create such a negative-energy tachyon: this lowers the energy to below that of the ground, which means there actually isn't a lower bound to energy and no ground.</p>
<p>The energy not being bounded from below is uncomfortable in a classical theory but completely unworkable in quantum mechanics, since it means that the probability of any process is irreparably divergent. Basically any process includes uncontrollable contributions from the production of an arbitrarily large number of virtual tachyons and everything is infinite.</p>
<p>Lower-boundedness of energy is therefore usually taken as an axiom of quantum mechanics and this excludes tachyons as physical particles (and partly saves causality as a bonus). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General relativity, it could be argued, makes such a field impossible; if you solve the time dilation equation for a photon, you find that time doesn't exist for a massless particle. The eight minutes a photon exists for between the sun and earth, only exists for things with mass, from the reference frame of the photon, the distance was traveled instantaneously. A particle with mass requires more energy to accelerate closer to the speed of light, as its mass increases, and time dialates to almost infinity as you approach the speed of light. A tachyon, or faster than light field of any sort would do the opposite, it implies negative mass, and backwards time, and by General relativity, a particle that goes faster, gains mass, and releases more and more energy to reach a stable, or ground state and &quot;slow down&quot;. It would break physics, but more importantly,  a single tachyon, once it popped into existence,  would travel backwards in time, emitting more and more energy as it approached its ground state (lowest energy state) and would, at the end of its &quot;timeline&quot;(which would be the beginning of time) emit infinite amounts of energy.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real measure is how long it takes the average worker to earn enough to afford a given item.   </p>
<p>So say it's the year 1900, and your rent is $5 per month and you earn 25 cents an hour, so it takes you 20 hours of labor every month to afford your rent.</p>
<p>So in the year 2017, your rent is $1000 per month and you earn $25 per hour.   So it takes you 40 hours per month to earn enough money to pay your rent.   So your dollar has 50% less spending power from then until now.   </p>
<p>But this is purely speculation... obviously there were a million different types of apartments/houses/mortgages back in the year 1900 and the same applies today, it's difficult to make a true &quot;average&quot; for any of that, same with wages, it's difficult to say that the average worker today makes a certain amount.  We have people earning $7 per hour and people earning $250 per hour, sometimes in the same building.   </p>
<p>The true Consumer Price Index tracks hundreds of items and tries to quantify this sort of thing, but many argue that it's not very accurate.   In 1900, you probably got a room with a bed for your rent, and no kitchen, and a communal bath at the end of the hall that everyone used.   Is it a fair analogy to compare that to a modern apartment, wired for cable and internet, with a dishwasher and garbage disposal, hot water heater and air conditioning?   Probably not.   So you see how hard it is to compare then to now.   Just look at how much cars have changed over the past 50 years, so it's hardly fair to complain about the price going up when you are getting so much better of a product for your money.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand inflation you need to understand the difference between money/currency and wealth.</p>
<p>We create wealth all of the time. Let say you pay 1 millions dollars to mine materials out of the ground and you sell those material for a profit. That profit is new wealth that you created. Then someone could buy a bunch of materials and pay workers to create a product that they will also see with a profit, creating even more wealth. We create wealth with human work (physical or intellectual) and from natural resources.</p>
<p>Now if you continue to create wealth, but your amount of currency stay the same, then the value of that currency will increase. People will want to trade more currency that there is so currency will become rare and the value of that currency will increase over time. That's deflation and it's bad. It's bad because it become more profitable to keep your money than invest it. And without investment, you can't create as much wealth.</p>
<p>So the solution is to print more currency as wealth increase in your country. To ideal goal would be to print the exact amount of currency as your country create new wealth. The problem is that it's hard to estimate the exact amount of wealth that will be create so you can print the exact amount of currency you need.</p>
<p>The value of your currency depend on the law of supply and demand. Your production of currency if you supply of that currency. And the amount of wealth you create is the demand. If you over produce your currency you have a higher supply than your demand so the value of your currency decrease over time. If you under produce your currency, well it's like I said at the beginning. You have a lower supply of currency than the demand (wealth). So your currency increase in value.</p>
<p>So now you have a choice. You know you can't produce the exact right amount of currency, so you can either over produce currency, which create inflation, or under produce currency which lead to deflation. The answer to that is that a little bit of inflation is better than a little bit of deflation. Because a little bit of deflation still incentive people to keep their money, while a little bit of inflation incentive people to invest their money. And investment is an engine of economic growth.</p>
<p>So yes. Our currency have lose spending power since 1970. But we have a lot more currency, so we actually have a higher spending power. Well, the country as a whole have a higher spending power. Individual can lose their spending power if there isn't a good redistribution of wealth in your country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your grandparents might have said &quot;back in my day you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel!&quot; There's truth to that, today a loaf of bread cost $1-$3 or so. However back when the Model T (first mass produced car) was being made they paid their workers $5 a day and that was a very high paying job. Today people get paid $7 an hour due to minimum wage laws. </p>
<p>So inflation only gives part of the story and isn't really a bad thing. Inflation is generally under control of the Federal Reserve and they try to keep it around 2% or so. In doing so goods and products rise in price by about 2% and due to that workers ask for a 2% raise to meet that price, which in turn can make prices rise again etc. </p>
<p>Really what you need to look at is the median salary and a standard 'economic basket'. The basket is a term that basically means take a bunch of standard stuff people have to buy each year and compare that year over year. If the basket is rising in price faster than the median salary we have a problem. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably, it depends on what you buy.  Inflation is measured by comparing prices of a basket of goods over time, but that's complicated by some goods changing.  A can of coke hasn't changed very much since it was invented, but television sets or mobile phones have changed pretty dramatically since the 1970s.  </p>
<p>So when measuring for inflation you have to estimate how much a good has changed over the period (if your parents had a 25&quot; color CRT TV in the 1970s that cost $700, and you have a 50&quot; flat screen that cost $400, has the price fallen by 42% ($400 to $700), by 71% ($28 per inch vs $8 dollars per inch), or has the price risen because you have to spend $600 per year on cable (or $120 on Netflix) while they watched free broadcast.  </p>
<p>30% less spending power means that when someone made estimates for all the changes that have happened technically to products, as best they can, $1,000 today buys about the same amount of stuff that $700 did in 1970 (however that includes salaries).  </p>
<p>It's like that because we have a money supply that grows, which allows easy financing of the economy's capital requirements and gives the Federal Reserve a healthy amount of ability to control the economy's growth rate via bank interest rates.  When our money supply was relatively fixed (because it was based on how much gold had been found) there were short swings of inflation and deflation that occasionally made debt very, very costly.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since 1913, the USD has lost about 95% of its buying power!  (1913 is significant because that's when the US government created a new central bank after we killed it, twice).  </p>
<p>The way I explain buying power to people is to explain the relationship between labor and what you can do with the fruits of your labor.  </p>
<p><strong>Money is simply a medium of exchange</strong>; meaning, it is a means by which I can exchange 1 hour of my labor for my boss for your book.  That is, you don't care that I did 1 hour of work for my boss.  However, my boss gives me pieces of paper that you can use to buy your lunch.  I want your book and you want my pieces of paper so you can buy lunch with them.  </p>
<p>So my 1 hour of work turns into your lunch through my $10.  </p>
<p>Since the US Government divorced the USD from its gold and silver backing, the USD has turned into a fiat money (a more complex term that just simply means nothing is backing it - you cannot take $1 to the government to get the gold or silver backing it).  Even though the spending power of a money backed by gold or silver will fluctuate, the fluctuation is not controlled by any single group.  Now, the USD is controlled, mainly, by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve (it is largely controlled by the faith put in it by the world market for USD - however, that market is heavily influenced by the Treasury and the Fed).  </p>
<p><strong>In short, as the supply of a good or service increases, holding other variables constant, the value of each unit of the good or service tends to fall.</strong> The same is true for money.  If today there are $100 in circulation, each $1 you own can, let's say, buy you a gallon of milk.  If tomorrow there are $200 in circulation, then, most likely, each gallon of milk might cost $2 (or much more depending on whether a panic sets in!)  </p>
<p>But the spending power of a unit of money goes down (one dollar could buy you a whole gallon but that fell to two dollars per gallon after the change).  </p>
<p>The same is true with labor.  If today there are 100 people who can perform the task of painting my car and each of them are willing to charge $10 to do the job, and then tomorrow there are 200 people willing to do it, they'll push the price down to $5 or lower!  The power of that unit of labor falls as the supply of it increases.  </p>
<p>It is like that because all valuation is subjective.  You subjectively value my $10 based upon what it can do for you (buy your lunch) and I subjectively value your book to be worth about $10 which is worth about 1 hour of my labor and my boss values 1 hour of my labor to be worth about $10 (on and on and on).  If the total number of units of currency in circulation increases, the person providing your lunch might no longer value your $10 (that you got from me) to be worth the lunch because he had to pay more for the constituent parts and then demand $15 for the lunch!  </p>
<p>Anyway, </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <strong>All valuation is subjective</strong>.  The power of a dollar is what you can exchange it for and the function of a dollar is a present store your past labor (credit is a present store of your future labor).  <strong>As the supply of dollars increases (by the treasury or the fed) the per-unit value falls because each individual subjectively tends to have a lower valuation of what he or she can exchange it for</strong>.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, the idea that EVERYONE should vote is extremely new. Today, we think of voting restrictions as being intended as a way of making sure certain parts of society didn't get a say out of spite or elitism, but in reality, it was much more an attempt to solve a problem that we still suffer from today: Most people don't really know what they're voting for.</p>
<p>By restricting voting to landowners, the idea was that voters would not only be more likely to have the education necessary to understand what their vote meant, but also had a vested interest in the long term success of the nation (or state, or county, or whatever). The idea was that if you owned property in the place you were voting, you would vote for things that would lead to the success of the place as a whole, so the value of your land would go up, your farm would succeed, etc. If you were just some guy working odd jobs, you were more likely to vote for the guy who offered you free food and money until the whole economy tanked, then up and leave when it went south.</p>
<p>This isn't as wrongheaded as it may seem at first blush. A decade ago, many South American countries elected very far left politicians who essentially took the position of &quot;We'll just give the poor people who voted for us free stuff&quot;. Brazil's Lula, for example, was elected largely by uneducated or undereducated poor people, who he then pandered to by constantly giving them things for free. While he was extremely, extremely popular at the time, the end result was that he took Brazil from having overflowing coffers to being buried in debt, contributing massively to Brazil's current economic situation.</p>
<p>Obviously, I don't mean that to say &quot;Only rich people should vote&quot;. But allowing everyone to vote does have some trade offs.</p>
<p>Anyway, to the point of the question, it wasn't until very recently that women were allowed to own land or get a very good education. So, in the context of the views of the time, not allowing women to vote actually made a great deal of sense. If you want to restrict voting to educated people with a vested interest in the long term success of the area (in this context, landholders), then women of the time genuinely rarely met the requirements.</p>
<p>Ultimately, women not having the right to vote until the 20th century wasn't necessarily always specifically sexist in and of itself, but rather the result of other forms of sexism. The whole thing is fairly convoluted when you get into it.</p>
<p>Edit: A word</p>
<p>Edit 2: Just wanted to clarify a couple things. Apologies for the really long edit, but numerous people have responded to me making basically the same couple points, so I figured I'd address them here instead of just saying the same thing over and over individually.</p>
<p>First, Regarding former Brazilian President Lula, I certainly don't believe he was all bad. The poor in Brazil have it extremely bad, and Lula's predecessor Cardoso probably focused too much on long-term economic growth and big picture, and not enough on helping the people here and now. As can be seen in the American midwest, rustbelt, and inner cities, ignoring people who need help now in favor of making it better for everyone isn't a perfect plan. However, Cardoso did manage to create an economically stable state, which set Lula up a good situation for Lula to implement much-needed reforms. However, he tried to do too much too fast. Brazil's economy was booming, and he dove head first into creating tons of assistance programs, pensions, etc., which helped millions of people.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this was all contingent on Brazil's economic boom continuing. When commodity prices started dropping and oil started bottoming out, Brazil's money well dried up, but government spending didn't diminish. The aid and reform programs continued on, but now without any way to fund it. Rousseff probably had time to stop it, but instead she burned everything to the ground. Now most of those people Lula temporarily helped are in as bad or worse situations than they were before. Ultimately, he broke a very simple economic rule for governments: Save during boom years, spend during bust years.</p>
<p>Again, this isn't to say everything Lula did was bad. Helping the poor is something that Brazil needed for a long time, and still needs a great deal of. My point was, his electorate didn't want a better situation in 5, 10, or 15 years. They wanted a better situation right now, and he gave it to them. Now that's gone, because by giving them what they wanted when they wanted it, he created an unsustainable economic situation.</p>
<p>Second, regarding the beliefs that I'm promoting restricting voting to rich landowners, I absolutely am not. I didn't address the issues with only landowners voting because that wasn't the point of my post. I was providing context, with a modern example, for the problem those voting restrictions were trying to solve, and the role they had in why women couldn't vote, as was the question asked by OP.</p>
<p>The fact is, many people, regardless of economic class, gender, race, sexual orientation, or any other differentiation, probably don't make very good voting decisions. My personal opinion, since it's being assumed quite a bit, is that ideally, we WOULD restrict voting to qualified people. However, I've yet to learn about or think of any system of voter restriction that would prevent people who don't have the ability (for whatever reason) to vote responsibly and intelligently while allowing all the people who do. There are vast numbers of issues poor people face, for example, that wealthy and middle class people have absolutely no knowledge of, so obviously poor people DO need to be able to vote.</p>
<p>As far as I see it, allowing everyone to vote creates fewer problems than restricting voting in a flawed way. Allowing everyone to vote is much like democracy itself: Extremely flawed and riddled with countless problems from beginning to end, but unfortunately the best form of government we've been able to come up with so far. </p>
<p>I hope this all lends some clarity to what I'd intended to be a bit of context for an answer regarding why women couldn't vote for so long. Thanks for reading, if you've read this far.</p>
<p>Edit 3: I thought I'd do a third edit here to say that my summary of Brazil's economic situation is EXTREMELY simplified. There's no possible way to thorough discuss the economy of an entire nation in a standard sized book, let alone a couple paragraphs on Reddit. Combine this with the facts that it's impossible to accurately gauge why and how an economic situation came to be until at least several decades later and that I am not, and would never pretend to be, an expert on Brazilian economics (although I've done my share of research into it, and have discussed it with a Brazilian economist whose views and opinions I regard extremely highly), and you're going to get a cursory summary that doesn't take into account nearly all the minor details. Lula had, and continues to have, millions of very intelligent, well-read supporters. I happen to disagree with them, no disrespect intended.</p>
<p>Edit 4: I'm never sure if it's appropriate to make an edit when someone gives you gold, but I didn't do it the one other time someone was so generous and I felt like a giant ungrateful dick. Thank you for for the gold, anonymous gilder, sincerely! Also, if whoever gilded that other post reads this, thank you belatedly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the 'arguments against' (or reasons why it wasn't happening) I had read up on was that nobody could really comprehend how a married couple (2 becoming 1 unit) would have two different votes. Think of it as '1 vote for 1 unit'. So why double the paperwork for no point. Husbands were seen as being responsible for the doing of the task. Indeed, to mount a horse or strap on boots regardless of weather and go do 'their vote'. The household vote. </p>
<p>I'm going a bit by fading memory but a basic 'argument against' related to that first one was 'anti-elitist' and worried about the wealthy upper-classes taking over. So they assume a couple will be voting the same. Now, (re: husbands obligation to carry out physical task) and now you've doubled the possible votes. However, this is highly inconvenient to households of lesser means. poor to middle-class homes where the mother and grandmother simply cannot easily travel out on windy rainy nights days and leave children behind (or take them). ....  however ..... this was NOT as much the practical issue for wealthy upper-classes who had maids and nannies and the ability to take covered coaches and escorts and stay in hotels if need be etc.</p>
<p>so what they feared was basically the middle-poor folks can still only send the husband to cast the vote on behalf of the couple. The 1 vote for the 1 household/couple but the wealthy could basically double their votes with easy access and practical ability. </p>
<p>There was also an 'argument against' or opposition from what were the 'social liberals' of the days in the Western democracies as women were, at that time, considered the stricter religious morally superior of the sexes. In one book I was reading about a US debate it was almost hilarious how the strictest opponents to women voting were funded by and made of: The local saloon owners, the local whorehouse owners/staff/regulars, the local casino, the local boxing organizers. Basically, they were well certain that if wives (their 'enemies' if you will) get the vote then they'd instantly start making alcohol/prostitutes/gambling/sports etc illegal overnight. </p>
<p>I think there was another issue about war or wartime or post-war but something to the effect of consequences if and when significant numbers of men were at war and/or killed in wars but i forgot what the deal was on it.</p>
<p>Today we probably can't see these things anymore. People don't become married at 18 as much. People today can't believe a married couple (married... merged together) means merged/married together into one unit. Its normal to think they'd work to different political goals. That in the olde days people really had to brave outdoor weather, the crowds and dangers to go vote. Not just have the wife stop somewhere on a drive home and keep the babysitter for an extra hour at the most inconvenience. Or that women and in particular the 'women's movement' used to be an extreme right-wing Christian conservative movement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a great response to why Queen Victoria didn't like feminists over at /r/askhistorians, which you can find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/5qvm8e/was_queen_victoria_reacting_to_a_specific_group/" target="_blank">here</a>. It's worth reading the whole comment, but the tl;dr is that Queen Victoria maintained a lot of her power and influence by maintaining a public image of her as a proper lady. She emphasized her motherhood (mother to princes, mother to an empire, etc.) and family life to keep her firmly in the mainstream and feminism was a threat to the power of that image. That's not a direct response to why it took until 1918 for women to be able to vote, but it at least shows why Queen Victoria wouldn't have been helping feminism move forward. </p>
<p>As for why 1918 and not a little earlier or later, the main reason was WW1. A lot of men were fighting on the front and women filled in for their jobs at home. As a result, women became seen as more capable. Right after the war, Parliament passed a voting law that got rid of a lot of previous requirements for men (only about 60% of males over 21 could vote prior to 1918 and many men returning from the war did not meet the requirements, which was not politically popular) and it gave some women the right to vote (over 30, with some property and education requirements). The full right for women to vote came in 1928.</p>
<p>There's a lot more history to the suffrage movement in the UK that lead up to the passage of those bills, but that's probably best saved for another post. </p>
<p>Edit: We get it guys - poor men and men of color have historically been disenfranchised too, but that doesn't really have much to do with the question of why no women were allowed to vote in the UK when its ruler was female.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, I read a book about political philosophy from I believe the 1840s if I remember right, and the author brought up the subject of women voting. He said that intellectually he couldn't think of a reason why women should not vote, but that the man was head of the household and that he wouldn't want to introduce strife over voting between a married couple. He entertained the thought then that unmarried women might be allowed to vote, but said that that would benefit only widows and young unmarried women, and that he would not wish to encourage the latter to remain unmarried. Therefore, he said he was against expanding the franchise to women.</p>
<p>You will find that many 19th century (and earlier) arguments around giving various rights to women often didn't center around their intellectual abilities, but around gender and household roles. Sure, you find plenty of male authors of the time period who we would now label as misogynistic (believing women were natural inferiors, etc) but that wasn't necessarily a given. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its important to note that Queen Victoria did <em>not</em> rule, but rather reigned. She was a figurehead not at all unlike the current royal family in the name of which a popularly elected Parliament forms a government. The remainder of the eligible aristocracy can participate in politics in the Upper Chamber of Parliament (the House of Lords), but the Monarch is relegated to advising the Prime Minister as to the policy the Monarch prefers.</p>
<p>Although the opinions and views of the Monarch are influential, the Monarchs themselves cannot implement any policy either foreign, domestic or imperial/commonwealth. The Monarch does retain the power of Royal Assent (which is sort of a veto in reverse, rather than rejecting legislation the Monarch refuses to agree to it), but it is almost never withheld in contemporary UK politics out of respect for the democratic process necessary to pass a bill through both chambers successfully.</p>
<p>I realize this doesn't answer your question, but despite being the titular Empress of India, Queen Victoria had almost no say in the practical administration of its government (she never even visited India) outside advising the PM who could - if he chose - pass that advise on to the foreign office or the Governor/Viceroy of India. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For argument's sake, here's 50g of candy across the board.  Note that volume-wise, this is much less than the equivalent in juice, soda, or fruit, which are all mostly water.</p>
<p>Candy (per 50g):  </p>
<ul>
<li>Snickers bar -- 244 calories, 24g sugar, 12g fat, no fiber, trace vitamins  </li>
<li>Hard Candy -- 197 calories, 32g sugar, no fiber, no vitamins (note: more carbs but less &quot;sugar&quot; than butterscotch)  </li>
<li>Butterscotch Candy -- 195 calories, 40g sugar, 1.65g fat, no fiber, no vitamins  </li>
<li>Twix bar -- 251 calories, 24g sugar, 12g fat, 0.6g fiber, trace vitamins</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the calories and sugar content in fruit is a lot lower than what's in soda, juice, and candy, and all fruits have both fiber and vitamins.  Soda has no vitamins, and while juice is better in that it has some vitamins and fiber, it's worse in that they usually dump a bunch of extra sugar into it.  Chocolate candy has a lot of fat, no fiber, and very few vitamins, while hard candy or fruit candy is basically pure sugar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well look at it this way: sugar, and foods that turn into sugar like carbs, all break down to the same thing, glucose, or food for your cells.</p>
<p>The problem isn't what they become, it's how long it takes them to get there. Take a fruit for example. You're not eating just straight sugar, you're eating a lot of other components with it, like the fibrous material an orange is made out of. Your body digests it all at once, but the sugar in the fruit is tempered by the rest of the material in the fruit, causing the distribution of sugar in your blood to rise gradually instead of all at once with, say, soda or candy. The gradual increase allows the body to use the sugar as fuel without the blood sugar level rising too high too quickly, something that would trigger the release of insulin into the blood to lower the sugar level of the blood. Insulin is the body turning sugars into fats, storing them for use later instead of right now. So, if you make a habit of eating food filled with sugars, especially processed sugars which are much more potent than natural sugars (hard candy vs apple, which is sweeter?), your body releases insulin much more often, turning more sugars in your blood to fats to compensate and keep your body in balance. Foods higher in sugar are more easily and more quickly converted into fat when they don't have something else (like fiber) to balance out how quickly they're absorbed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at it this way, sugars all have the same problem; they're not good for you in excess. Doesn't matter if they come from fruit or sugar cane, basically a problem in large amounts. You can pick up a apple, and feel satiated, because you're ingesting the sugar from it with a bunch of dietary Fibre. Most adults would eat one or two apples and feel good. As soon as you process it, it's a different story. You grab a glass of juice, which has been extracted, and all of the Fibre removed. It takes, say, 5-7 whole apples to produce that glass of juice. So in effect you're ingesting 500-700% the quantity of sugar because that food choice is processed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Another important thing to recognize is the act of chewing and what signals are produced as a result. The time it takes to eat an apple is significantly longer than the time it takes to eat a mars bar. You have to bite off chunks of apple, and then chew and chew. All this chewing takes time which will leave you with a stronger feeling of fullness afterwards. </p>
<p>One reason why people overeat is because there is a significant delay between food in the stomach and a feeling of fullness. About 20minutes or so. So anything you can do to make the process of eating take longer will help your body register that you have in fact ingested food. That's why an apple which has less calories and less sugar than a mars bar will leave you feeling fuller for longer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sugar is sugar.  &quot;Healthy&quot; sugar is a subjective statement and a marketing tactic.  You benefit from the fiber and vitamins in fruits, but the intake of sugar is what the real factor is.  Too much sugar intake in any food is unhealthy.  Soda is deemed unhealthier because it has concentrated sugar and lots of it.   Ketchup has a huge concentration of sugar, yet people squirt loads of it all over their fries and eggs.  Fruit roll ups and dried fruits still have sugar.  The bottom line is monitor your sugar intake by looking at labels and finding out which fruits have more sugar content vs others.  Fruit juice and Fruit drinks are just as loaded with sugar compared to some energy drinks.  Honey and agave nectar are still broken down into sugars.  There is no healthy sugar.  Your daily intake is what matters and the higher concentrations that you put into your body at one specific time can cause your insulin level to react at a different rate therefore putting you at risk for diabetes.  Feel free to correct any inaccuracies.
Also the factor of rate at which we metabolize sugars is a big part of the formula.  An unhealthy sedentary lifestyle of constant consumption of processed foods including concentrated sugars  in soda, fast foods, and candy puts a person at a higher risk for diabetes and heart disease vs an active lifestyle of a runner consuming simple sugars from fruits and energy drinks who will metabolize those sugars faster and thererfore be at less risk for diabetes and heart disease.
Thats my take on it.  imo</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Edited</strong> to fold in a couple of great contributions from some other commenters.</p>
<p>The vast majority of smooth curves don't have &quot;closed-form&quot; equations, meaning that you can't write an f(x) in terms of simple functions like polynomials (x, x^2, x^3, ...), exponentials (e^x), trig functions (sin(x), cos(x), ...), and so on.  In fact, a random scribble on paper isn't likely to be a proper function at all, because it would fail to be a one-to-one mapping that satisfies the vertical line test.  As several point out below (/u/idc2011, /u/darksoulisbestsoul and others), though, you can parameterize a such a scribble as the set of functions {x(t), y(t),...}.  So anything below would apply to these individual functions.  (If you'd like an algorithm for finding the parameterizations, I'm afraid I can't help you there.  Wolfram Alpha does a pretty great job, though.) </p>
<p>Nearly any smooth function can be written as a (generally infinite) series of terms in a set of <em>basis functions</em>.  Polynomials form one such basis, so you'd be able to write your curve as</p>
<p>f(x) = A_0 + A_1 x + A_2 x^2 + ... + A_n x^n + ...</p>
<p>Now all you have to do is find the set of coefficients A_0, A_1, ... in order to have an equation for your curve.  For a randomly-drawn curve, there will be a lot of them, so this is best done using a computer.  In fact, there will typically be an infinite number of terms, so you'll never be able to find all of them even with a computer.  You can get an arbitrarily good approximation of your curve, though, by computing as many as you need to get &quot;close enough.&quot;</p>
<p>This polynomial expansion is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series" target="_blank">Taylor Series</a> of the curve.  Sort of.  My background is physics, where we call all polynomial expansions &quot;Taylor Series&quot; (<em>yes, even when it's a MacLaurin series</em>), but
/u/functor7 has a great point below about the distinction.</p>
<p>The set of sines and cosines of different frequencies also form a popular set of basis functions; an expansion in terms of them gives you your curve's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series" target="_blank">Fourier Series</a>.  Fourier Series work best for functions that display periodicity, like sound waves.  I mention them because lots of people are familiar with Fourier analysis and might like the connection to stuff they already know, but they probably won't be best for modeling a random, non-repeating function.</p>
<p>For that matter, polynomials aren't typically your best bet, either, as the aptly-named /u/stoptalkingyourwrong points out :).  I was glad to see him/her and several other posters (like /u/samclifford, /u/DataLaird) mention splines, because I've used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline" target="_blank">b-splines</a> for curve-modeling, and they are in fact the bomb for arbitrary smooth-curve fitting.  I didn't bring them up because they're a little more complicated, but in essence they provide an alternate polynomial basis for the expansion.  The Wikipedia article (linked) is a good place to start if you want to learn more.</p>
<p>If you're more curious about the mathematics of the Taylor Series, /u/dxdydz_dV has a fantastic post below that you should read.  There's tons of other great information in the comments, too.  I have to walk away now, because I really do need to get some work done today, but thanks to everyone for the instructive discussion!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a fun alternate answer... you can come up with a set of piecewise functions where each function is nothing but an equation of a line... the more piecewise functions you use the more accurately it maps to the random drawing, and as the number of piecewise functions approaches infinity the degree of error would approach 0. Essentially you're just vectorizing the shape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finding the exact equation won't be possible except in very specific situations (e.g. a straight line). But in many cases, you could approximate it to arbitrary accuracy (or in reality: a level of accuracy limited by how accurate you can measure the coordinates of points on the curve).</p>
<p>Note that between any pair of distinct points you can draw precisely one straight line. This line fits with the equation:</p>
<p>y = a x + b</p>
<p>for unique values of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. If you take three points on your curve, in such a way that they're not all on the same straight line, there is a single parabola, given by</p>
<p>y = a x^2 + b x + c</p>
<p>that can be fitted to cross all three points. If you take four distinct points that do not lie on a parabola, you can fit a single cubic function. And this process can be repeated for larger and larger sets of points.</p>
<p>The more points you take in your sample, the more precisely the approximating polynomial function will match the original curve. The requirement here is that the curve has at most a single y-value for each x-value and that it is smooth enough (specifically: infinitely differentiable). If either of these requirements is not met, then this process will fail to give an accurate approximation at some point.</p>
<p>The equation you end up with is a polynomial of the order of the number of sample points minus one. So if you take 10 sample points, you'll end up with a 9^(th) order polynomial (y = a x^9 + b x^8 + ...).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a simple function? no. However, your best approximation is probably going to come in the form of a series of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve" target="_blank">Bezier Curves</a>. The mathematics behind this are the basis for all modern digital typefaces (Pioneered by Adobe back in the 80s) and allows for a very good approximation of complex curves. </p>
<p>When translating a raster line drawing (which is what a scanned version of your drawing would be) into a vector drawing, you can pretty much specify how arbitrarily accurate you want the result to be. The more accurate, the more functions and segments there will be, but it will be closer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
