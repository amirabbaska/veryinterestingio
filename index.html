		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a much-debated question in physics, and unlike what people here are saying, it's not due to pressure or friction melting the ice. The pressure of a human being is not enough to meaningfully alter the melting point of the ice below.</p>
<p>Instead, I believe that the current mainstream theory is that the ice molecules in the topmost layer of the crystal lattice act like liquids. They are not locked in place from all sides, so they have some freedom of movement which gives ice its slippery characteristics.</p>

The reason it slips when not on a very low temperature is that because the surface turns to water which makes the contact between the ice and other objects slippery.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If I wasn't clear, I was wondering more about selecting an album, hitting shuffle songs, and having it shuffle in the correct order. It seems the general responses have been more tailored to selecting a playlist and having the album play in the correct order.</p>
<p>It appears the math is similar regardless, but is the algorithm affected differently?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course it could - provided it has a really random shuffle, i.e. if the album is shuffled the new sequence is taken from the set of all permutations with equal probability.  This also gives you the probability: If the album has 12 tracks, then it has 12! = 12 <em> 11 </em> 10 <em> 9 </em> 8 <em> 7 </em> 6 <em> 5 </em> 4 <em> 3 </em> 2 = 479,001,600 different permutations, and the probability to pick any one is  roughly 2x10^-9 .</p>
<p>I don't know enough about the shuffle algorithms used, but when doing a quick search on google I get a feeling that the algorithm is more sophisticated, and may bias towards songs with high ratings. In that case the math changes.</p>
<p>Of course you could just create a playlist with three songs, and shuffle that a couple of times, and note down the order of play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to explain this is that they sacrificed the future at the alter of their comfort.  I cannot think of another generation in history that had as much power so young and the opportunity to actually change the entire world in a meaningful way.  Think about it - they actually had enough clout to get Congress to amend the Constitution to lower the voting age!  Can you imagine millennials trying to get an amendment to say, stem climate change passed?  Instead, the hippies of the 60s became the coke dealers of the 70s, junk bond dealers of the 80s, internet bubble chiefs of the 90s and finally, reaching the height of their power, destroyed the economy in the 00's. They traded idealistic action and power for home shopping and drone strikes.  Plugging their ears against the onslaught of messages telling them they are dooming their children and grandchildren to a life of fewer opportunities and perhaps catastrophic consequences, they persisted in short term gains.  Now at the end of their time in power they are politically taking their ball and going home. </p>
<p>Their parents (the WWII generation) ensured they would live in a prosperous, strong place.  They saw war for what it was and did everything they could to ensure those horrors would not come back to the world.  They used their power for science, for the arts, for education,for the good of all mankind. You know, the things the boomers said &quot;well, we got ours, fuck the rest&quot; to.  </p>
<p>They speak of how younger generations are &quot;entitled&quot;, fully aware that the economy they grew up in was stronger, the cost of living was less, the wages were higher, the education cheaper, the housing more affordable.  It's a lie.  It's them trying to shift blame for their actions by blaming someone else.  It's the tactic used to those who come to the end of the line and still don't want to own up to what they have created.</p>
<p>I know many are not like this.  But the fact is that they voted in all the power that allowed it to happen this way.  So yes, I lay most of the problems future generations to come will have at their feet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think part of it is also this lack of self-awareness around the Boomer generation. They see the problems, but cannot see that they are part of it. The following is a sweeping generalization. Individual results may vary.</p>
<p>They put in place the education system that allows for standardized testing to rule education. They are the teachers, the administrators, the voters, that put the systems in place that educated those of us born between 1980-1995. But they call the following generations lazy, entitled, self-congratulatory. &quot;Special snowflakes.&quot; Etc. We all had to succeed or they would cut funding to schools.</p>
<p>They voted in administrations that started bank de-regulation. While they were busy patting themselves on the back for Civil Rights, they allowed Wall Street to sneak into government. And then they blamed the Clinton/Bush era for the Wall Street debacles. Not saying the blame rests solely in the 70-80s, but they seem to forget who they allowed into office, and what they allowed them to do. Corruption cannot seep in unless someone has poked the holes for it.</p>
<p>They won't retire. Not can't, won't. The natural cycle of employment has stuttered with Boomers holding onto jobs way past the age of retirement. But the poor job economy is Clinton's fault, Bush's fault, Obama's fault.</p>
<p>They won't invest in future generations. They resist change. While they spearheaded great efforts to help their own situations - voting age, drafting, Vietnam, Medicare (for them) - they forgot to plant seeds for the rest of us. Now that we are trying to improve our situation - immigrant students, LGBTQ rights, climate change research and action, food insecurity, failing infrastructure, a struggling economy, an antiquated economy, a housing market gone amuck - now they resist. They vote, in droves, to prevent having to spend their tax money on current or future programs.</p>
<p>&quot;What is a legacy? It's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.&quot; - They went to our garden, planted nothing, pissed on it and told us it was raining, and then asked why we didn't grow.</p>
<p>BUT - the Boomer generation VOTES. That's why they continue to have the power they have and fuck us over. We need to VOTE. Small elections, special elections, location elections.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their parents were called &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; but I like to call Baby Boomers &quot;The Luckiest Generation&quot;.</p>
<p>Baby Boomers are essentially the start of the modern day America as a concept and practice.  The idea of a good job, good house, good healthcare, good retirement, 2.5 kids, 2 cars in the garage, and a nice TV.</p>
<p>You can have it all!</p>
<p>And your voice can be heard.  You can be a modern day consumer.  You can have stuff and the life and the best healthcare... etc.  And its not all that hard to get as long as you just &quot;work hard&quot;.</p>
<p>Best part is the kids can have it too!  ... except we most definitely aren't.</p>
<p>A lot of what is considered and what made &quot;Modern America&quot; starts in the industrial revolution and mostly stopped evolving in the 80's.  Realistically not much has changed since then:</p>
<p>-Medicine may be better but the idea of a healthy lifestyle really is nothing new now.  And the idea that medicine will make life better is decades old.</p>
<p>-Social Media is new but all it REALLY is is the instantaneous communication of ideas and the democratization of that.  Decades ago ideas, news, etc. could be instantly shared around the globe via TV, radio, telephone, etc. and be mass consumed.  Interesting note here is that the phones we use now are built soley on the refinement of decades old technology.  GPS, touchscreen, cameras, LCD, internet, wifi... all decades old.</p>
<p>-Cars may be cleaner but they have been around for quite a while now.  Getting better and fancier, and pushes for emissions and efficiency have been around since the 70's.  Just look at the 70's gas crisis, Leaded gas, catalytic converters, etc.  For safety... Ralph Nader, and the wheel speed sensory.  The list goes on.</p>
<p>-Social Rights may be gaining a lot more traction than ever (a good thing) but social movements and protests are nothing new.  Been going on for a long long time.</p>
<p>I'm rambling a bit but suffice to say that the only big thing that has come about since the Baby Boomers had kids was the internet.  And the baby boomers gave us that.  So this means that the Baby Boomers either were born with certain concepts of America in place or they shaped and changed them directly.  And they did a LOT of that so that  much of our world is directly influenced and made by them.  And that is modern day America!</p>
<p>We are paying now for all of that prosperity they got to have.  So much borrowing against future generations.  Whether it be the environment or economy.  They really got it easy in a lot of ways.  The cost to entry to a middle class life now is much higher than it used to be.  And that class is disappearing.  But then again the middle class of America didn't come about til the boomers were born so there is that factor as well.  So they grew up with the idea, in the midst of, became, and the essentially drove the middle class as we know it today.</p>
<p>I could literally type for hours as the &quot;Baby Boomers vs later generations&quot; argument is one of my favorites... But let me bring up the 2 things I hate the most:  Corporations and Investment Banking (Wall Street).  The boomers took corporations and turned them into machines of capital generation through innovation and deregulation.  But ultimately corporations are only &quot;responsible&quot; to only the boardroom and the investors.  And they are the only ones who make any money.  And since they are so woven into society now, no one knows how to stop this... or they are very afraid to.  That boardroom is the head and will gut itself to keep the head alive.   So goodbye quality products and employees if you put any pressure on a corporation via taxes.  All the while they just keep exclaiming how they are &quot;the backbone of the economy&quot; or some such BS for what all they actually do for us.</p>
<p>And then Investment Banking.  I remember from school learning when I was 9 the idea that you put your money in savings and it generates interest!  Now that's just silly.  Simple banking is only for the poor and uneducated now.  Now its hedge funds, mutual funds, stock market... whatever!!  Literally through deregulation and some good creativity we have entire BS money markets that the boomers came up with to get rich or to invest for retirement!  We literally have this idea now that money gets created in mass quantities out of nothing and its mainly just BS and a LOT of risk.  Just look at the housing crisis and recession.  Its all just made up money and bullshit.  At least when you make something there is a tangible product to it.  But now?  That's the new norm and VAST quantities of everyone's money is tied into that working.  Mainly boomers like it for their retirement accounts.  But at this point anyone who can afford to buy into some investment wants it to pay off.  Its easy free money.  And it just doesn't really work that well in the long run.</p>
<p>You can debate a lot of this back and forth but ultimately the boomers loved the idea of retiring at 65 and living comfortably and healthily.  Sadly its just NOT TRUE.  Society can't afford to have people living that long while doing nothing.  And to generate the capital needed to afford &quot;that sweet retirement life&quot; while working only so long requires a lot of gambits, risks, and making future generations buy into a system that just wont work.  Between BS investment banking, and social entitlements like medicare, medicaide, social security, government pensions, etc...</p>
<p>Well we are just stuck with a system that doesn't work now thanks to the Boomers.  Go to a good school, work hard, get a job, work hard, get a house, work hard, get a family, work hard, retire on what you've earned at 65-70... its all just a system that doesn't work.</p>
<p>They grew up with a lotta prosperity.  And we are left with a system that mainly benefits those that are born into money.  It doesn't even need to be a lot of money!  But what matters more now is what your economic factors growing up are than how &quot;hard&quot; you work.  If you want to find the American dream go to Canada.  Its actually easier to get ahead there than it is in the US.</p>
<p>That said most of our parents are boomers and we still love them.  and many boomers are NOT doing so good.  So no need to run around hating them personally or anything dumb.  Ultimately we are all born, we all meet the same fate and die, and we are all in this together. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>tax breaks during their prime working years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>massive government deficit spending to keep the economy afloat</p>

<li>short term fixes for Social Security and Medicare designed to cover themselves and not much else</li>

They also take every chance to pat themselves on the back for creating &quot;the best music&quot; or for driving the cultural changes of the 60s and 70s, etc. They are a generation who couldn't keep their hands out of their kids and grandkids piggy bank, greedily borrowing more and more benefits today, knowing their kids and grandkids would have to foot the bill someday, yet still blaming younger generations for their lack of opportunities and wealth.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <em>President</em> didn't even have term limits for almost 200 years. The reasoning behind that is that the President is 1/3 of the government by himself, as well as the commander in chief of the military. That power can be abused, especially by a president who stays in office for many years and uses his power to weaken political opponents.</p>
<p>By contrast, a Senator or Congressman is just 1/100 or 1/435. Even the most powerful of them can't really do much on their own. </p>
<p>I personally don't believe in congressional term limits, because the people should take the responsibility of monitoring their representatives and replacing them when necessary. Term limits are a lazy and half-assed way to avoid that responsibility.</p>
<p>Lastly, former members of the military do get lifelong healthcare if they're wounded in action. Additionally, anyone who retires from the military can stay on the government's plan for cheap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The positive case against term limits goes like this:</p>
<p>Ultimately you want people in government to be able to govern effectively.  Legislators need to be good at the job they do to ensure good governance, and a large part of being good at your job is experience doing your job.  For this reason, a representative who has served for 20 years will likely be more effective at serving his or her constituents and country than one freshly elected.  Take, say, a committee which deals with national security issues. Arguably a representative who has been receiving classified briefings for twenty years will have a better understanding of the context in which new information is presented than a representative who only started receiving classified briefings six months ago.  The experienced representative will be better able to understand how important a particular piece of intelligence is, whether something is normal or remarkable.</p>
<p>The other factor is who you <em>don't or can't</em> limit the terms of. Civil servants have their careers for life, unless they do something specific to get them fired.  It's their job to know their departments inside and out, and as they become more senior they get to know other departments workings too, and get to know other senior civil servants.  This is critical to the efficient functioning of our governments, it ensures continuity between administrations, it ensures problems can get resolved, it ensures representatives can be properly briefed on what's happening in the actual engine of government, so correct policy decisions can be made. It takes decades to make a good and experienced civil servant who can keep a government department running, and it's still basically just a regular career so you probably don't want to put term limits on these jobs.  If there are strict term limits on elected representatives, this breaks the chain somewhat between the elected and unelected portions of our governments.  If representatives don't have a clear and solid grasp on what government departments do and how they operate, a lot of the actual power in government then falls into the hands of unelected civil servants, who are able to run rings around the inexperienced representatives they're theoretically accountable to.</p>
<p>And lastly, lobbyists.  You <em>can't</em> put a term limit on a lobbyist.  Lobbyists influence all politicians, regardless of whether they're new or long-standing, but arguably lobbyists influence new representatives more than they can experienced ones.  When a new rep gets to the legislature, they don't know the ins and outs of how the system works, they don't know the back channels, they don't know who to talk to in order to get x or y done.  Generally the experienced members of the party will help with that, but what if there are no members of the party with a decade in the legislature, due to term limits?  Well, along comes a lobbyist, a former legislator who now works for Big [Industry You Don't Like].  He offers to take the new legislator under his wing, show him how things work, smooth over a few things.  Before you know it the new legislator has the lobbyist as his mentor, and so lobbyists find it even easier than they do now to influence government policy to their liking.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now that's not to say there aren't counterpoints to these arguments, and others have covered more cynical reasons for it to be as it is, and there are definitely arguments <em>for</em> term limits which I haven't covered because you've asked for the opposite, but the above is the basic outline of how those opposed to term limits would argue the merits of having legislators with long service.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Experience is a valuable commodity in politics.  We want our legislators to be experienced enough to govern in our interest, and we want the people with the most experience to be the ones we can directly control through elections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>His two biggest points were that it was undemocratic for the government to take away the people's choice of their elected officials and that it was unnecessary because the average person only serves about 10-15 years in Congress. That means most people who serve only spend a fraction of their working years in Congress. That's only two or three elections for a senator. There are a few extremes, but in general there is already high turnover in Congress. Occasionally I see a Facebook post claiming that serving just one term gets you a lifelong pension, but that's not the case. You have to put in a lot of time to pull a full pension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Title vs actual text - pick <em>one.</em></p>
<p>If the people like their representative, why shouldn't they be able to keep re-electing them if they feel they are doing a good job and voting the way they want them to? </p>
<p>My own rep is Maxine Waters, who is a bit of an embarrassment but I sure as shit would rather have her than <em>ANY</em> Republican (or some dipshit Green for that matter) because I know that she has consistently voted 100% they way I want her to vote on the bills that matter most. And 90% on the rest. </p>
<p>While <em>Congress</em> might get low marks on the whole, people like their own Representatives much better. At least the <em>majority</em> of those in a district like their reps. </p>
<p><strong>Term limits have very bad unintended consequences, namely lobbyists REALLY start writing the laws.</strong>  Just take a look at my state of California, which stupidly passed term limit laws and now most of our really important laws dealing with major industries are written by the lobbyists for those industries. </p>
<p>Why? Because with term limits not only do the legislators not have time to learn either their jobs or the issues they have to govern over, but they worry about what <strong><em>job</em></strong> they are going to have when it's over. Lobbyists are very good about dangling post-office positions in front of these A-holes to get them to vote in their favor. Without term limits, the <strong>public</strong> has the job they want to keep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>The long answer:</strong> there's three factors that cause this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Congress makes the laws. We've elected people who don't think term limits are a good idea, and most of them really like being in congress, so they don't want to kick themselves out.</li>
<li>Most people wouldn't like being in congress. They've made it so that 50% of the job is begging for money, and politics are currently extremely partisan and bitter. There's just not many people who want that job, so many candidates run unopposed.</li>
<li>Most incumbents get re-elected even though congress has dismal approval ratings. The most likely explanation might just be that name recognition matters. People who have been there for a long time are recognized and they also have the connections and donors to buy ads to make sure people remember who they are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, the kind of people who enjoy being politicians have turned the job in to something that has bushy pay and benefits, but would also drive most people insane. And most people are too lazy or indifferent to care, so they just let the nutters in congress stay there. If we had term limits maybe things would be different, but we don't, so they aren't.</p>
<p><strong>The short answer:</strong> campaign finance in the US is messed up, the people who know how to work the system get to stay and make the rules about how things get run. The people who can't (or won't) abuse the current system don't get a say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen some answers about why starch specifically requires hot water, which are likely correct as well, but I'll provide an explanation via thermodynamics. In general for anything like this it is all based on diffusion. Diffusion generally refers to the movement of matter from a high concentration to a low concentration, so if you have a lot of water molecules in one place (i.e. water in a bowl) next to a space that contains very few water molecules (i.e. a dry grain of rice floating in that water) the water molecules will be more likely to enter that space over time, this is due to entropy of mixing (I can go deeper into entropy upon request but I'll spare you here, basically it is a numerical measurement for the reason that things mix together).  This is why if you let even cold water close to freezing sit in a bowl with rice or beans it would eventually infiltrate them, but like you said it would just take a long time. Even cold atoms have energy, but that energy just makes them vibrate, not move with any kind of purpose, so the odds that they'll end up inside of the grain of rice are random.  Now the energy of the atoms increased with temperature, which makes them vibrate more, which means that they are that much more likely to enter the grain of rice. The thermodynamics probably compound with any chemical reason for the starch absorbing water as well.</p>
<p>TLDR: Hot things vibrate faster, faster vibrations increases the odds that each water molecule enters the rice over time. So hot water will enter the rice faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note. Beans and chickpeas are very difrerent from rice or any other grain.</p>
<p>With beans and chickpeas and lentils, the water has to penetrate the tough outer skin. Often, even with hot water, chickpeas and beans do not cook through (water is unable to go through the skin barrier).</p>
<p>A common technique used when cooking chickpeas (especially in Indian cooking where beans and chickpeas and lentils are key protein sources so are eaten every day) is to add baking soda which makes the water more alkaline and helps the moisture go through. Often, tea leaves or tea bags are added which being mildly acidic counteracts the alkilinity of baking soda and the food still ends up tasting good (and not bitter).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a huge believer in neighborhood revitalization and restoration (R/R), and it's become a huge thing in parts of the US and Canada where I've lived. Some of the projects I've seen completed have completely changed that area, and it can be a good thing for property ownership and business. But, this all depends on the area itself.</p>
<p>To start, it's stupidly expensive to restore an old building. As other users have pointed out, you have a lot of codes that are more than likely being violated (building/fire codes, mostly). Additionally, there may be zoning codes in place by the city that you need to adhere to. The cost of renovating these buildings is usually a lot higher than what the property in the area is worth, so it's difficult to find investors willing to spend the money on R/R and fight to bring the buildings up to code and restore them for business. From my experience, investors won't invest in this unless there is significant promise for return - The area is a &quot;cultural zone&quot; (art district, food district, historical areas etc) that already has a lot of interest from the local population. This makes sense to restore the old buildings as the area is popular and will bring in money. Also, you have to look at the ambiance of a restored building - They're suited for that retro/vintage-done-modern look that is becoming incredibly popular, but it's still a small market. Most people still prefer a more modern apartment or business space unless they're trying to fit into that eclectic niche of exposed brick and handmade goods.</p>
<p>There's also the aspect of the building quality. Old buildings that are run down have a high chance of asbestos, mold, lead paint/piping, water/structural damage, animal habitation (and sometimes humans squatting) or other issues. This could make it unsafe to renovate and is a huge risk for investors looking to restore an old building for future risk. It's also a risk for future residents.</p>
<p>There's a socio-economic aspect to this as well. A lot of areas that are run down are run down for a reason - These areas are usually on the borderline of poverty (or are impoverished) with higher rates of crime and violence. It makes no sense for an investor to dump a lot of money on an area that has no money. People that are currently in the area are not going to be able to afford the newly renovated housing that the investor is going to want to charge, and people who CAN afford it are not going to want to move into an area that has a higher crime risk. Even businesses are reluctant to open up shop in a high-risk area. The investor would get next to no returns and lose money on the project. I mean no offense, but look at the types of businesses that are most prominent in low-income areas. You'll see a lot of pawn shops, mechanics and (here in Denver now) weed shops. Higher class areas are full of boutique shops that attract wealthier clients and boost the economic growth of the area and make it more desirable. There are a lot of risks while working in run-down areas - For example, if you were to restore a series of old houses for low income families, you run the risk of those families not taking care of the property and it having to be restored again at a later time - There are a lot of damages that could come out of it based on the generalization and stereotype of the people who frequent these areas.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that if an area is deemed abandoned and there are homes or buildings that could be restored, the government should step in and assist. In some places, they do this, if the district is desireable. It could be a great opportunity for low-income affordable housing to help in areas that have a housing crisis. &quot;Companies&quot; like Habitat for Humanity could work on these projects and provide more community assistance to those in need. An old motel could be turned into single bedroom apartments for those in times of need (victims of domestic violence, or even student housing).</p>
<p>There's a lot that goes into a decision on whether or not to restore a building for future use. I feel we as a society should look into it more, but the risks generally outweigh the potential profits.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Lots of factors are used to determine if a building is suitable for renovations and repurposing. These factors include the building itself, the community and whether or not a profit could be turned from the renovations for the investor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here on the U.S., it at least partly has to do with changing fire codes and building codes. If you renovate that extensively, you have to bring the whole structure up to current code, which can involve additional fire systems, structural shoring, insulation to meet energy efficiency guidelines,etc, which puts the renovation costs well above the cost of new construction. And that is just too get the same size structure... If a larger structure is a business need, then adding onto a building adds a lot if cost </p>
<p>You then have businesses looking at the 10- year costs of operating. A new building with ground-up energy efficiency is going to cost less than an old one that has been retrofitted with energy efficient measures.</p>
<p>All told, new construction for retail is often close to half the 10-year cost of renovation/expansion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When a building is abandoned, there will usually be a cascade of problems, leaks, water damage, mold, structural weakening, etc. Rather than have to individually repair these costly problems, it's usually much more cost effective to bulldoze and rebuild. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: new buildings can more easily meet the UK governments aims for sustainability/accessibility of our housing stock as they regulate the big house builders. However smaller developers are converting existing office buildings to residential at a high rate.</p>
<p>This isn't the whole picture but I think it will add to what others are saying: With regard to UK housing, we have great swathes being built by social housing providers such as London &amp; Quadrant (in London anyway). </p>
<p>Many of the schemes that these providers are building are grant funded by the Homes and Communities Agency HCA and contain an element of &quot;Affordable housing&quot;, which typically comprise of a mix of Shared Ownership, intermediate rent, and social rent or general needs properties (perhaps the last group is equatable to the old nomenclature 'council housing'). The HCA funding requires these schemes to be scored against a set of performance indicators called Housing Quality Indicators (HQI), which look at room sizes, accessibility and sustainability criteria. </p>
<p>Now many of these social housing providers use these HQI scores as their own key performance indicators and obviously strive for improvements year on year, and aim for the highest possible scores so that they can continue to demonstrate to the funders that they are building houses that will stand the test of time. It is much harder to score highly in these audits if you are converting existing buildings. </p>
<p>To add, there is also a big emphasis on 'Building For Life' at the moment in the UK housing industry (particularly the social/affordable housing side of the industry). Homes should be designed to be adaptable for use for every stage from toddlers to the elderly. This again is difficult to achieve within our existing building stock. </p>
<p>At the smaller developer end however (ie. people building 10-20 flats or less), there is a huge drive of people utilising Permitted Development relaxations in recent years to convert disused or under occupied  office buildings to residential. Due to changes in legislation, these types of refurbishment do not require detailed or onerous planning permissions from local government, so redevelopment of existing offices to housing is up.</p>

<p>Forming these triple bonds releases a lot of energy. If you have a compound that contains a lot of nitrogen, you can cause it to release a lot of energy by decomposing into N2 and other products. NO2 groups serve two functions - stabilising the nitrogen atoms until you want the molecule to decompose, and releasing energy themselves as the oxygen radicals rebond to the other atoms.</p>
<p>This is why many explosives are made of nitrogen compounds. It's all about causing the formation of triple bonds to release a huge amount of energy rapidly when the compound decomposes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The Oxygen combines with whatever is in the fuel, such as Carbon and Hydrogen to form CO2 and H2O, the Nitrogen combines most strongly with other Nitrogens, forming N2. This releases energy just as the combustion of Carbon/Hydrogen does, it also creates gas which massively increases the volume of the reaction's products compared to the starting materials, both of which create explosive effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Based on that you can make a very rough assumption of number of Rex prey in a certain area. It is hard to calculate the exact number of each prey animal since we have so little info about Rex prey preferences. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, at best this will give you some very general picture. It is hard to make precise calculations using this because we have very little info about metabolic characteristics, social structure and general behavior of trex( I use Rex as an example, this is true for all dinos).  Were they metabolically more similar to birds or reptiles, were they solitary or lived as pairs or as small groups, were they active hunters or scavengers, if active hunters; did that ambushed prey or chased them, were they very territorial or territories overlapped, how was the inter-predator interactions, how fast babies grew , how much parental investment were there,  were juveniles allowed to share the territory with their parents until maturing. All these questions and many more needs to be answered for a precise calculation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note: Some of the content below might sound gross to some, but this is/was the way of life for a huge chunk of people that you might never come across. Also, please don't judge them if they are so poor that they can't even afford a proper toilet. </p>
<p>I am from India and it is true that we (the general population, not the elite or upper middle-class) use our left hand to wash off the bum with water after nature takes its course. It is one of the first things that we are taught when we are around 3 years old (till then its your mom/dad/elders, because Indian style squatting toilets are not safe for kids and need supervision). We are taught to wash our hands with soap immediately afterwards. It is so ingrained in your psyche that transition from that habit to Western habit of using a toilet paper was so painful because I would never &quot;feel&quot; clean after using toilet paper. Also, I come from a lower-middle class background in India, and when I was a small kid and we used to go to our grandparents house in rural south-India, they didn't have a proper toilet. They had dug a pit in the estate behind their cottage and adults used that to take a dump. Kids would just go into the woods and take a dump where no one is seeing them and clean up afterwards. You always take water with you to clean up afterwards. </p>
<p>Back when the caste-system was still very prevalent in India, people from a certain caste were responsible for cleaning up other people's shit from common area (dump sites like woods). It is still true in many rural locations in India, but education and general social progression is slowly changing it. Current Prime Minister, Mr. Modi, even started a campaign called Swachh Bharat (or Clean India) under which a chunk of the budget was allocated to build toilets in rural India and generate awareness in those area.</p>
<p>As a side-note, as the living standards are rising, people are moving towards toilet paper in India too and having a western-style lavatory in your house is considered a must have and a &quot;status-symbol&quot; (because we love to copy western culture as a mark to show better life-style). It is important to note that squatting is the most natural style of taking a dump, rather than sitting on the toilet seat. It is more healthy and less strenuous on the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'll notice all the replies you got were from people who a) were very ill, b) had/have depression or c) done all nighters for work or school. The reason is, sleep - how long and when - is closely linked to your biological state and health. In normal circumstances, healthy human adults sleep when it's dark and are awake during the day, eg approximately 8 hours in a 24hour cycle. </p>
<p>The time you feel sleepy, wakeful, and length of time you sleep is called circadian rhythm. At different times of day and night your body produces hormones that aid falling asleep/waking up. For example, melatonin is thought of as the 'sleep' hormone. </p>
<p>In normal people, your daily routine helps encourage a regular circadian rhythm. Sunlight can trigger the release of hormones that make you feel awake and inhibits the release of melatonin. This is why 'normal' people tend to sleep for 6-9 hours, the length of darkness/night time (in most seasons and locations on the earth). If you wake up and go to bed the same time every day, (along with eating at regular times, exercising at regular times, expose yourself to natural light and it's not the middle of summer or winter, etc) then your circadian rhythm will be regular.</p>
<p>People who sleep for different lengths of time- whether very short nights or 20+ hours as in your question, are likely suffering from a disruption of their circadian rhythms. They might have worked a very long day (as people have noted in anecdotes) or had high stress (stress hormones will disrupt the circadian rhythm). If someone does this regularly - shift workers, travelling across multiple time zones, those in the army, illness, etc, your circadian rhythm becomes more and more confused, and if you haven't had the 7-9 hours per 24 that most people need, you'll get what's called a sleep debt. So basically their hormones aren't strong enough to wake them after the normal periods or when it gets light, and they continue sleeping until their bodies have recovered sufficiently from the damage of staying awake too long. Unfortunately, no matter how much 'more' you sleep in the long run, repaying a sleep debt can never completely undo the damage of not allowing your body to sleep regularly. Look after your circadian rhythm!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I can &quot;sleep&quot; for long periods, or rather stay in bed for long periods because I never really get rest. My body fights to breathe and continuously wakes me up when i should be getting REM sleep. I wake up something crazy like 60-80 times an hour. I hate the machine and it doesn't help me. I am getting a surgery done soon to &quot;cure&quot; me of it though. I can't wait to not need more than 8 hours in bed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone with severe insomnia, I envy those who can fall asleep and stay asleep! </p>
<p>A recent conversation with my doctor opened my eyes to another chemical produced by your body as you are awake and moving, and enables falling asleep. Adenosine. From what he told me... As you move through your day, your body produces adenosine, and when you get to a certain level, your body shuts down to purge itself of the adenosine. As the levels get high enough in your body, your body starts to produce melatonin to aid in heading you to dreamland. The length of time you stay asleep is actually determined by how well your system purges the adenosine. Without underlying issues, those who sleep more purge the adenosine more slowly; those who sleep less, purge more quickly. Physical activity (exercise) early in your day can jump start adenosine production and help you to sleep better. </p>
<p>In my case, though I work a physically demanding job, my body doesn't produce enough adenosine to start melatonin production in levels that will put, and keep, me down. I can go 36 hours before sleeping for 4, and be back up and going for another 24+. Regimented medication and scheduling, plus doing more outside of work (exercising, staying active after my shift, etc.), is about the only way I can fall and stay asleep for more than a couple hours at a time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
