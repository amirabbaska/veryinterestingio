<p>Postal service is the best analogy here.  Your house address is how people send letters to you.    Each up address can be broken down into street and house number but for this example let's just says it's your whole address.  </p>
<p>Routers/firewalls are like post offices, they may not have anyone there who knows where 12345 easy lane is, but it knows where the post office in Simple, TX is, so it sends it there. </p>
<p>In the mean time while it passes through some of these routers/firewalls the traffic gets monitored and logged. </p>
<p>Apartments are more like dynamic ips, it's a temporary address assigned to a large group of dwellings.  This is most of us who have home internet connections.  The apt complex knows who has what address, and when questioned they know who had apt 987 in June of 2008.  </p>
<p>This is why TOR network was created, and this is also the importance of VPNs.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An IP address is actually an address. It's a number that uniquely identifies anything that connects directly to the internet.</p>
<p>As for tracing online activities - it becomes a little bit more hairy. Say you are at campus and connect through the same router as all the other students. Then the router is the only thing with a global IP address. Everyone else connecting through that router will identify as the same IP (it's called NAT if you want to read further)</p>
<p>Your home connection may or may not be a fixed IP. There is a limited number of IP addresses so most ISP's use dynamic IP's. This means that your IP of today may be your neighbors tomorrow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say you want to send a request to a web server, you put the website name into your browser, say wee.reddit.com, and the browser ascends the request to the web server, except how does it get there? </p>
<p>Computers and routers don't send data to host names, they need something that's easier for computers to understand. Every computer and router connected to the internet has a numeric address, the IP address. There's a process that converts names like www.reddit.com to addresses and your computer does that and sends the request to the address. </p>
<p>Now, to get the response back your computer needs to have an address. I'm going to gloss over some details you can google if you're interested (rfc1918, nat, dhcp) but your computer gets an IP address from your ISP automatically and when you send a request to a server that request includes your address so the server knows where to send the reply. </p>
<p>Now, your address uniquely identifies your computer on the internet, so if someone does something on the internet the server they talked to has a record of what IP address made the request. From that people know which ISP issues that address to a user and then they can ask the ISP which customer had that address. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever been in a group with two people that have the same first name? Someone might say &quot;Hey John&quot; or whatever name, and both look up and wonder if you mean them or the other John. Usually this problem is solved by adding more information that only applies to one of them, like their last name, or simply calling them by their last name to begin with. </p>
<p>Computers have this problem when they try to talk to each other too, especially now that we've connected thousands of them together on the Internet. This problem is solved by giving each computer that connects to the Internet a number that only they have, an IP address. </p>
<p>Since the Internet got way bigger than anyone had thought of back when they chose the numbers used for IP addresses, they divided them into public and private IP addresses. The private ones can't connect to the Internet, so they don't need to be unique. Each home or business has at least one router, which is a special type of computer with both a private IP address and a public IP address, the latter being assigned to it by their Internet service provider, like Comcast or CenturyLink. Computers and game consoles and tablets and stuff use their private IP addresses to talk to the router on its private IP address, which then uses its public IP address to talk to other computers on the Internet. </p>
<p>So people on the Internet can sometimes see the public IP address and can look up what Internet service provider it is from, and find the city and state it's in. Unless the customer posts it somewhere, only your Internet service provider knows the actual address of the house or business behind an IP address. A government or a hacker may be able to get that information from the Internet service provider, but is usually very difficult and rarely happens. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a phone number. Pretend your internet service is the same as phone service. Each customer has their own phone number, but they can also have more than one phone in their home which all use this number.</p>
<p>Websites are just computers with their own phone numbers: Reddit, Google, Facebook, all have their own numbers. When you want to visit a website, your computer uses a service akin to the YellowPages to find the phone number for that service. This is called DNS.</p>
<p>So your computer looks up the records for whichever site you're visiting and connects to that service and you can now talk to each other. The internet providers around the world all have the physical infrastructure in place to route all traffic from everyone in the world.</p>
<p>You can be traced the same way as you can by your phone number. If you prank call someone, your number will show up on their caller ID. Someone only has to look up your number (IP) to find out who your provider is, call your provider, and request your account holder information.</p>
<p>When you connect to a website or service, they can see your IP address in their logs. There are ways around this, called proxies. These are just middle-men which route your connections. It would be like calling a mobile phone and having the call forwarded through that, so that the receiver would see <em>that</em> phone's number and not yours.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, what you see in the movies is fake although this used to work back in the 60s.</p>
<p>On old cars, the ignition key just worked a switch. You had a switch for &quot;on&quot; which activated electrical circuits like the fuel pump and the spark ignition system. Then, there was a second switch which activates an electric motor which starts the engine turning. Once the engine is turning, and assuming it's OK, then as long as the engine has fuel and power to the spark system, it'll keep running.</p>
<p>So, a thief could break into the car, look under the dash for the wires to the ignition switch, and activate the circuits by touching the wires together. You'd have to tie the main power circuit &quot;on&quot;, and then you could run the starter motor by touching the start wires together.</p>
<p>By the 70s, the car manufacturers had learned that this wasn't particularly secure, so they put a backup system. The ignition key lock wouldn't just work the switch, but it would also mechanically block the steering wheel so you couldn't actually drive it. </p>
<p>My dad had an old toyota, and the ignition key wore out while we were on vacation hundreds of miles from home. The key just wouldn't turn enough to start the car. We called the local recovery guy, who worked out that the key would turn just enough to unlock the steering wheel, but not enough to work the switch. So, he pulled out the wires from the dash, and showed us how to hotwire it so that the engine would run. This allowed us to get home, and book it into the dealer for a proper repair at a more convenient time.</p>
<p>By the late 90s, computers had developed enough that engine spark and fuel systems could be electronically controlled, rather than controlled by complicated mechanisms of rotating shafts, gears, cams and switches. As a computer was running the engine, it wasn't that much more complicated to add computer security.</p>
<p>Since the late 90s, most cars have a chip in the key, which listens for a radio signal, and when it gets the signal it transmits a password. The ignition key barrel has an antenna in it, and when the engine control computer sees the start switch is active, it transmits a &quot;login password&quot; signal from the antenna to the key. The key responds, and if the computer gets the correct password, it activates the fuel and spark. If the password is wrong or missing, then the fuel and spark systems don't work. The engine will turn on the starter motor, but it won't actually start.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Most cars without modern theft protection could still be STARTED but not DRIVEN by twisting the right wires together (First, twist an ignition+ source to +12V, then touch a starter+ wire to +12v until engine is running). But you couldn't drive the car.</p>
<p>What they never account for are the mechanical lockouts tied to the ignition switch. When you turn the key, a physical lockout releases the steering wheel lock and allows it to turn. Without physically turning the key, the steering wheel would remain locked, even with the engine running, hence making the car undrivable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the steering wheel lock, this used to be much easier to do because the ignition switch was in the dash and the dash had more open space underneath it.  You could see the two wires that you needed immediately.  Almost all of the other things that are now in the steering column were also separate switches arranged on the dashboard.</p>
<p>Now the necessary wires are bound up in a harness that goes up into the steering column.  Along with the ignition wires, you have the turn signals, wipers, headlights, airbag, parking lights, horn, and probably cruise, and radio.  There are probably twenty wires to sort out now, and since you can no longer see the back of the ignition switch, you may not know what color the ones you want are.  Just cutting that bundle apart without cutting wires can be five minutes work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a lot easier to think when body is in relaxed state and the more upward blood flow goes to brain. Resting chin on head reduces supporting neck muscles using up the blood flowing upwards, hence more blood for brain; additionally by sitting down more blood is available for upper body as the lower body is not as active. So generally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Thinker" target="_blank">the thinking man</a> pose is optimal for active brain.</p>
<p>We subconsciously do this when thinking deeply, and has become an evolutionary trait. There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirshasana#Contraindications_and_cautions" target="_blank">other ways</a> to increase blood flow to brain, but that benefit maybe countered by discomfort.</p>
<p>Edit: Minor word correction as I was not resting my chin on hand
Update: Speaking from experience, not research based</p>
<p>Update2: Queries on source? Peer reviewed research will be hard to come by given the topic (medically mundane/commercially not valuable)..but it is evident from experience that thinking capacity is diminished after heavy food or we feel light headed when getting up suddenly–both corresponding to redirection of blood supply while heart rate has not caught up. Once the heart rate has caught-up, there's more overall circulation, so mild activity works. Heavy activity, however, counters the benefit of circulation with lower blood oxygen level. Easy way for focused thinking—sit down after drinking ginkgo tea followed by a brisk walk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If so, would the universe be expected to eventually randomly reach a sufficiently low energy state that stars, galaxies, and planets could reform?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The probability for a fluctuation (quantum or otherwise) that decreases entropy is on the order of exp(- ΔS / k_B), where ΔS is the entropy variation and k_B is Boltzmann's constant. This is unimaginably small even for very little entropy variations. Let me make a little example:</p>
<p>Trouton's rule tells you the entropy of vaporization of most fluids is about 86 J/K per mole at standard pressure. So the vaporization of a mole of water (~18 ml) at standard pressure involves an entropy increase of ΔS ~ 86 J/K = 6.2 * 10^(24) k_B. This means the probability of just 18 ml of water spontaneously condensing back into liquid is of the order of exp(-10^(24)). </p>
<p>That's about zero point, about 10^(23) zeroes, then one. The time you need to wait for this to happen through fluctuations is equally huge. As a comparison, the time it takes for even the largest black holes to evaporate and heat death to be truly reached is incredibly smaller than this.</p>
<p>Now there is no certainty on whether the Universe will last <em>forever</em> forever. This amount of time is so large that hoping we can extrapolating the physics we know is ridiculous. But I mean, if you do, and you also assume no big crunch (so negative spatial curvature) then sure, the total probability is 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That’s where the spider’s genius for recycling comes in. When the orb-weaver takes apart an old web, it actually eats the silk. The protein from the old silk is never wasted, from the spider’s digestive system, it goes to the silk glands to be made into a new web. Even if a spider misses a few meals, it can still go on spinning webs. This is thanks to the efficient recycling program that lets spiders conserve protein by eating old webs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an international student in China who is also an American citizen. I go to an American international school with an American curriculum. </p>
<p>In my experience, people tend to stick with people of a common nationality. The Americans at my school stick with the Americans, the Koreans with the Koreans, and the local Chinese with the local Chinese. As a result, exposure to different cultures is dampened.</p>
<p>The main requirement to go to our school is that you cannot be a Chinese citizen- local Chinese are only allowed to go to our school if they get special permission from the Chinese government. As a result, the only local Chinese students that go to our school have strong connections with the Chinese government and therefore are not likely to rebel against their beneficiaries. (Believe me, our school wants to take in local Chinese to improve their numbers and to make money- especially as more and more companies are deciding to send foreigners who don't have families- but they simply aren't able to because the government won't allow them to).</p>
<p>American media has a very warped view of how Chinese people view government. People tend to not care about political issues until it directly affects them- for example, the only problem most people at my school actually complain about is the Great Firewall of China (we all use VPNs) and slow internet. </p>
<p>Chinese values also tend to put safety over freedom. I was at a family dinner recently with a couple of local family friends, and one of the girls there is at a top local private school and planning on going abroad for education at an American university. All anyone could talk about was Trump and safety (they were concerned about sexual assault in the US- the university she wants to go to is notorious for being an unsafe campus, although the education is superb). Another girl with a green card for the US hadn't gone back since Trump arrived due to safety and immigration concerns (she had gone to a top American university- Ivy League type- but I won't name it for privacy). So yeah, like you said, America is hardly a shining beacon of hope and democracy. </p>
<p>Many Chinese exchange students even leave the US after their education with a <em>stronger</em> sense of nationality- <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/magazine/the-parachute-generation.html" target="_blank">the New York Times has covered Chinese exchange students extensively</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s a common sentiment among Chinese students abroad, who find that their foreign experiences sharpen their sense of national pride. Over the summer, Korbin started delving into Chinese history books and training in kung fu. In America, he found his Chinese core.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TL;DR The Chinese government has it under control. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chinese students in America are not ordinary Chinese people. They are typically from well-off families, families who are well-off because they are connected to the government or part of it. Though China is experiencing a growing middle class and more ordinary people are likely finding it possible to send their children abroad, many Chinese students will be the children of elites. </p>
<p>As such, they are already benefiting extensively from the government and would see (consciously or otherwise) less of a reason to oppose it.</p>
<p>In my own personal experience, the students can also be insular. They stick to groups of Chinese students. That means less of an opportunity to be exposed to other views.</p>
<p>Additionally it's very easy for people to succumb to false equivalency. Regardless of your own political views, worldwide faith in the U.S. as a shining example of democracy has gone down considerably. Foreigners hear about how Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million yet isn't President. They hear about how we have the highest incarceration rate in the world (barring a tiny island country by the name of Seychelles). They hear about our government surveillance. It'd be exceedingly easy for a Chinese student to tune out any criticism of his native government when this &quot;shining example of democracy&quot; has problems like that.</p>
<p>So overall, no, I don't think Chinese officials are particularly worried. America has the top universities in the world, and China knows that to become the top dog they need an educated elite. It is also partly propaganda on our own end that we think the average Chinese person would want their government to be toppled if they only knew the facts. They're much more concerned about economic growth. As long as that chugs along, most people are happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Why not? </p>
<p>Most of what we know is what was taught to us by other people. That's true for everyone! That means we can never really be <em>totally</em> sure if something is truer or better than another thing except!... when we take the time to learn all about it and measure it ourselves. Whether that's about the number of your friends' toys or what's right or wrong... But none can actually measure everything! So we need to think about <em>why</em> we believe something someone else tells us!
Do they actually know better or is what they say made up so they can seem smart or wise? Does it match what other people say and, if not, what are the differences and where do they come from?</p>
<p>If your friend tells you baseball is better than football you wouldn't just believe him would you? But you won't know why he thinks that and what might be cool about baseball that you hadn't heard before until you ask her.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>It is a shame there is so much anti-Chinese propaganda on Reddit.  The government isn't at all worried nor are the people worried about the government in daily life.  Westernization is seen as progress in most respects, with the decadence part the only one that is ridiculed.  The majority of Chinese people have already accepted some level of (specifically) American culture.</p>
<p>America does not have a great reputation among many countries in the world and yet we (the American people) and our government rarely worry about them (unless they are traveling to a Muslim country).  There are plenty of people throughout the world who believe that America is a country that was founded through the violent exploitation of natives and supported by slave labor until industrialization which then led to horrific conditions for factory workers, may of them who were immigrants, all the while polluting the lands.  After we wised up and realized &quot;Hey, why wreck our lands when we can go abuse other nations&quot; and launched military operations across the globe, and we then have the gall to criticize other nation's actions.  But our students show up in those communities mostly because they want to study and broaden their horizons, not because they are willing/able to be indoctrinated.</p>
<p>We just assume those kids traveled abroad to drink and party heavily in an exotic locale, and not that they have become radicalized against us.  Unless again of course they traveled to a predominantly Muslim country which then the government does have a critical concern.</p>
<p>Edit: Just a quick personal side note on the internet censorship in China.  I was able to play Runescape so I didn't give two sharks about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In Australia, the government weather bureau is not used by most popular weather apps - e.g. Apple weather, Yahoo weather and Android's default weather app. They use a service called Weather Underground, which crowd-sources its raw data from a network of personal weather stations. </p>
<p>For this reason, the most popular weather apps for this region always differ from official sources. </p>
<p>I don't have data on which is more accurate.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Weather is chaotic. The calculations are extremely complex, even minute changes in starting conditions create wildly different results. A scientist called Edward Lorenz discovered this in 1972 by entering 0.506 instead of 0.56127 for one of his computational calculations predicting weather. This slight change entirely changed the results and led to his famous paper &quot;Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?&quot;.</p>
<p>Things like rolling fluid convection which is where hot air on the surface of air is replaced with cold air from the atmosphere is impossible to graph. Any attempt to do so displayed what's now known as a &quot;strange attractor&quot;. This cannot be predicted, it moves randomly, never overlaps or retraces it's path. </p>
<p>For perfect prediction the initial conditions of wind speed, air pressure, rolling fluid convection etc. needs to be recorded as accurately as possible. The issue is that the number of decimal points are close to infinity for values like this as are the number of variables. And methods of measurement aren't perfect and aren't fully encompassing resulting in the chaotic nature of attempted precision.</p>
<p>This discovery is a big linchpin of Chaos Theory; a perspective shift of science which saw a move from determinism. It's pretty interesting, I recommend everyone to look into it.</p>
<p>edit: Obviously in this case somebody screwed up, I was just trying to highlight why different stations have different predictions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are many highly reliable weather sources available. If you are using an app on your phone which I am assuming you are, unless you know specifically where their weather reporting station is then the information may not be reliable. </p>
<p>If you are in the US and are genuinely concerned about the weather, perhaps you ride a motorcycle or want go for a run I suggest you check out these links..
(Some require registration and some require conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit.)</p>
<p>1800wxbrief.com
(Gives forecast, cloud coverage, current weather, cold and warm fronts and much more.)</p>
<p>LiveATC air radio
(App on iTunes, allows you to find airports near you with the most current weather conditions updated hourly- winds, temperature, weather and pressure.)</p>
<p>These above are good and reliable weather sources. With a little bit of research into what the chart symbols and terminology mean you'll know more about the weather than the reporters on the 5 o'clock news. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like all processes and activities controlled by the brain, paying attention requires the release of neurotransmitters onto neurons (in this case, specifically those associated with motivation and learning).</p>
<p>A prolonged and constant stimulus (e.g. listening to a long lecture) that induces neurotransmitter release can use up all the neurotransmitter, which would cause the neural pathway to become fatigued. Therefore, the neurons involved in this activity are said to have become acclimatized - unresponsive to further stimulation.</p>
<p>Acclimatized neurons are the reason you space out. The particular regions of the brain involved in motivation and learning about the given subject are simply out of neurotransmitter and can't process further inputs.</p>
<p>However, these neurons can be responsive again once they reuptake the neurotransmitters. This happens automatically but occurs fastest when you preoccupy yourself in another activity, which allows a different set of neurons to be used instead of the ones that are fatigued.</p>
<p>Some people space out less than others because the same activity might activate a different number of neurons or have a different pattern of neuronal activation from person to person. In brains where the total activation is spread out among more neurons, the fatigue takes longer to set in.</p>
<p>So a person who loves history might actually enjoy a long, complicated, and monotonous lecture on the Civil War because it activates different parts of his brain over a larger volume of it. Whereas, in a person who is not interested in history, the lecture would stimulate (and strain) the few parts of the brain that they would use to try to understand the lecture, such as those associated with speech and memory.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Attention is mainly due to dopamine. Sometimes get too much dopamine from a particular tract of sensory neurons delivering information to your brain. </p>
<p>So it seems dopamine is highly elevated prior to ejaculating to porn, and then comes crashing down afterwards, and by doing that we are actually killing our dopamine receptors and weak neurons in the brain and it's all because of the abnormal hit of dopamine.</p>
<p>It also has to do with subclinical electrical changes in random parts of the brain that don't fire when they aren't in sync. It'd be like if you're on the Titanic to send a morse code message asking for help, but you have no sense of rhythm and you send a jumble of beeps. So the morse code listener is not alarmed by an SOS message, but just thinking it is noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The history of humans using names to describe each other likely predates the written word, so we don't have clear evidence on exactly how it evolved. It's likely that prior to having &quot;first names&quot; the way that we now use them, we still had &quot;relational names&quot;</p>
<p>The evidence suggests that &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;Papa&quot; (or the prehuman equivalent) existed first, then as social groups became larger and more complex we had to be able to differentiate between other adults and came up with an alternative system of naming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not a linguist but I will take an educated guess.</p>
<p>The word &quot;mother&quot; ultimately comes from baby talk &quot;ma&quot; (like &quot;mama&quot;) with a suffix indicating kinship. This understanding comes from linguists' reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, the common ancestor language of a vast number of modern languages and believed to be spoken around 3500 BC.</p>
<p>So 5500 years ago, linguists believe (and this kind of thing is on reasonable footing) that people were already talking about their mothers. Reconstructing language further back than this is essentially impossible. Written records of PIE don't exist so all our work to reconstruct this language is very very complicated, painstaking guesswork, which academics have undertaken by comparing the words across hundreds of languages and finding common characteristics. It's likely that many aspects of the reconstruction are wrong just because random processes will have obscured the true origin of words.</p>
<p>All this means that working out anything further back is pointless: we just don't have the evidence there to do so. So we cannot know for sure.</p>
<p>One titbit though: Koko the gorilla (whether or not you believe she can use language is a tricky subject, but let's suppose you do) has signed about her mother. If Koko really understands the signs she makes, then this means that gorillas already can understand the concept of mother, which would indicate that it's very likely we have had a word for mother for essentially as long as we've had anything worth calling &quot;language.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not directly related, but I've read that the &quot;di&quot; phoneme is present in practically every language and always means something similar, God, gods, holy, sacred or something like that.</p>
<p>For English speakers this is retained via Latin influences in words like deity and divine. </p>
<p>Edit- it's the sound that's important and it follows all the rules that languages follow when changing over time. What this means is its not the spelled out word in English &quot;di&quot; that matters in other languages. It's the sound or some form of it. Example, ancient Chinese refers to God as Shang Di. This has changed over time to Shang Ti.    </p>
<p>Edit 2 - I'm feeling the hate right now guys. Not a good feeling. I'm not intending to present an academic peer reviewed study. This is just and fyi I thought OP might find interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laundry gets clean via the <em>forcing of detergent water and rinse water through the fibers repeatedly</em>. Eventually a build up of minerals from water accumulates in and around fibers, trapping dirt inside. This interferes with the cleaning process, especially with hard water. Towels feel scratchy as a result, so you resort to adding fabric softener. Fabric softener can accumulate in fibers too. A cup of vinegar added to rinse water will help prevent mineral build up and keep your laundry soft. You might even want to allow the vinegar to agitate and mix well into the rinse water and soak everything for 30 minutes. Don't worry, any residual vinegar smell will be gone when the laundry is dry. A vinegar rinse will help inhibit the growth of mold and mildew, which is what you smell in the thrift store. Sunlight kills microbes, so try hanging your blankets outdoors in the sunshine before storing them away. Store in a old pillow case on a ventilated shelf or buy a bedding storage bag with a zip closure. Don't pack things too tightly in your closet or in a box. Ventilation is your friend. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
