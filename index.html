		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question was asked a year or so ago, and was one of the most interesting threads I have ever read on Reddit. </p>
<p>Notably, I'm surprised no one has mentioned the main take away from that thread.</p>
<p>I'll recap to the best extent my my chemically abused memory can allow:</p>
<p>Land masses effect the flow of air, upwards and downwards etc. because of this, clouds consistently form in consistent patterns above and down wind of land masses.  In ancient times people (Polynesians In particular iirc?) could look at cloud patterns and map out land masses they had never in fact been to. They would draw maps of these islands, with out ever having been to, or seen, them in person. </p>
<p>These maps were handed down for generations, while the people waited for a storm or proper weather conditions to carry them by boat to these islands for the first time. </p>
<p>Mind blown. Maps to never before seen lands were drawn accurately and passed for hundreds of years, until some nob-typical winds allowed and they would take a leap of faith and push out. </p>
<p>I think I got the concept right. With some proper google use, you can probably find more information on this method. </p>
<p>That prior thread also mentioned the ability to see the reflection of distant lands when looking up at the bottom of an overcast cloud layer. </p>
<p>Edit:
This page has nothing to do with anything I just mentioned, but seems to answer this question precisely:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What a great question!  I didn't know five minutes ago, but from a bit of googling it sounds like the energy involved in a crater impact is more like a bomb going off than a ball splatting into dust.  So your usual intuition for how impacts happen doesn't really apply.  Imagine lobbing a stick of lit dynamite at an angle, and it explodes the instant it hits the ground.  The damage from the explosion expands out in a circle, and the fact that it was traveling at an angle doesn't really change how that explosion happens.  Of course a meteorite isn't dynamite, but it's traveling so fast that it pulverizes into a circular explosion of hot expanding gas on impact, and that gas is what causes the crater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I'm doing a lot of work in structural geology currently and impact structures are something I work on. In order to keep this as simple as possible we can break the creation of an impact structure into three stages: </p>
<ol>
<li>Contact and Collision -- projectile strikes earth's surface</li>
<li>Excavation -- transient crater is created, sediment is launched upward </li>
<li>Modification -- erosion and uplift </li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned above, the intital contact is less like an impact and more like an explosion. In fact, most of the projectile is vaporized upon contact and a lot of underlying sediments are vaporized too, that's how powerful it is. Stage 3 of the impact process also contributes to this circular look by slumping the rims of the transient crater. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many reasons... </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Alcohol causes far more impairment. Alcohol can quickly put a person in a stupor where they can barely see, have no balance, very slow coordination, etc. Marijuana? The effects are almost entirely mental and far less overpowering. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alcohol can outright kill you. You can overdose and die from alcohol poisoning. Roughly 6 people die each day in the US from alcohol poisoning. Marijuana overdose deaths? Zero in history. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alcohol is highly addictive. It's withdrawal symptoms are right up there with heroin - your body can become so dependent upon alcohol that you can literally die from the withdrawal. Marijuana? Most people don't believe it has any addictive properties, and those that do will admit it is very mild. Sugar is much more addictive.</p>
</li>
<li>Alcohol causes a wide range of long-term health issues. I can't even bother to begin listing them because the list is insanely long. Marijuana? It's actually used to <em>treat</em> a wide variety of illnesses. It does increase risk of lung cancer if you smoke it, but that's just from inhaling any kind of smoke, period, not from marijuana itself. Many people vaporize it so they don't inhale any smoke. </li>
</ol>

<p>(1) Your nervous system: Cerebellar degradation, Wernicke's encephalopathy, peripheral polyneuropathy, alcohol induced seizures, not to mention withdrawal
(2) Your GI tract: Barrett's esophagus, gastropathy, GI bleeds, pancreatitis, liver failure (both acute and chronic)
(3) Your Heart: Alcohol-induced myocarditis
(4) Your lungs: Aspiration pneumonia
(5) Your muscles: Alcohol-induced myopathy
(6) Your psyche: Suicide and suicidal ideation, depression, insomnia, judgement, domestic violence, homicide, </p>
<p>Marijuana has a couple of psychiatric associations, including an increased risk of psychosis when used in teenagers, increased risk of depression, and poor GPA when used by kids.  There is some evidence that MJ might make people sicker if they already have HCV, but those studies aren't great. It can lead to cannabis hyperemesis syndrome if you use it too much.  Plus there is some data that if you use bud, you are at higher risk of a fungal pneumonia called Aspergillosis.  These pale in comparison to the incredible risks of alcohol use, especially chronic alcohol use.  Add to it that alcohol is &quot;socially acceptable&quot;, even heavy drinking, and you have an epidemic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Alcohol is poisonous to human cells, whereas weed has never killed anyone, and an overdose of weed only results in some anxiety and possibly a fast heartbeat.  Also important to keep in mind is that alcohol is physically addictive, and a severe addict can die from the withdrawal symptoms alone, weed is not physically addictive, although people can develop a mental addiction to weed, it will not kill you if you stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is why I will continue to stand by the idea that alcohol is way worse on our society than pot: I have seen countless people come in from the effects of alcohol. More people come in for alcohol related causes than anything else. Whether it be seizing from Withdrawals, drinking too much, getting into fights or car wrecks because of it, or people who have been at the hands of someone intoxicated (spouses , children, bar fights etc). My personal favorite is the people delirious and withdrawing and telling me they're going to kill me, spitting on me, and physically and verbally abusing me. Pot on the other hand? Once. He was a high school kid that smoked up for the first time with his friends and greened out and threw up. Gave him some fluids and his dad took him home.

It could be recontextualized that low notes feel &quot;broad&quot;, while high notes feel &quot;sharp&quot;. Think of hearing thunder in the distance, versus a glass breaking. From there, the terms broad and sharp can be associated with tactile feelings. The feeling of warmth brings up ideas of being covered fully in a warm blanket, while cold is biting and sharp.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: The warm/cold association you're having with deep/high notes could come from deep notes having wider or &quot;thicker&quot; sound waves and high notes having thinner sound waves.</p>
<p>A note, as opposed to an atonal sound, is a sound wave that is rising and falling in perfect time, measured in Hz (Hertz), which is a unit of frequency. When the space between the peak and base of the sound wave is the exact same number of Hertz, it creates a note. In the case of an atonal sound, the wave rises and falls at different rates, creating a cacophony of frequencies we usually don't perceive as musical.</p>
<p>The classic example is the note A. A3 is measured at 220Hz (near the center of a piano's keyboard), A4 is at 440Hz (one octave above), A5 at 880Hz, and so on. This works going down as well, with A2 at 110Hz and A1 at 55Hz, and A0 at 27.5Hz.</p>
<p>The warm/cold association you're having with deep/high notes could come from the a deep or low note's sound wave being wider, or some would say &quot;thicker,&quot; whereas a high notes sound wave is thinner. This is the part where I stop saying fact and turn to speculation, but, much like air is perceived as thicker when warmer and thinner when colder, so could you be perceiving musical notes. There may even be a link between how sound is processed and temperature is processed either chemically or psychologically, but again at this point this is just me speculating!</p>
<p>Hope that helped :)</p>

<p>From my own college experience:</p>
<p>-There are multiple brands with a plethora of seasonings that you can try a different ramen every single day and still not get tired of it.</p>
<p>-You can practically cook it anywhere with little to no cooking experience. Only needs water and heat source.</p>
<p>-you can complement ramen with almost anything in the savory department or vegetables.</p>
<p>-some ramen can be eaten raw for a quick snack.</p>
<p>-takes about 3-5 minutes to cook.</p>
<p>-Doubles as soup</p>
<p>-Non perishable unless wet.</p>
<p>-are Independently packed so there is almost no waste.</p>
<p>-It fills you up</p>
<p>-Can be made into something fancy if you have proper equipment.</p>
<p>-If you buy the cup noodles you don't even need a bowl.</p>
<p>-Most cup noodles come with dehydrated veggies and meats.</p>
<p>-Tired of ramen, get the vermicelli noodles for a few cents more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A blender would likely just make a powder but to answer a more interesting question, what if we used an extremely fine grinder? </p>
<p>At some point we have a fluid of very fine particles left. They're still going to be enormous relative to a water molecule though so they'll contain many locked together. The powder will generally behave like a liquid though (think pouring sand but much much more finely divided). This won't have a bunch of water properties like dissolving things well) but it will have fluid properties. </p>
<p>What if we grind all the way down to the atomic scale somehow. Well if we managed to we'd end up with something more like a gas than a liquid since we've forcibly separated the atoms. Just prior to that we'd get something increasingly more water like (with a few caveats, letting them touch would tend to cause them to start sticking again but this process isn't instantaneous) but if you imagine this you can see there's not really a nice point where we can look at a small cluster of atoms and say &quot;these, these are definitely a liquid now&quot;.</p>
<p>Solid -&gt; liquid transitions only really make sense to talk about for bulk substances but the whole premise of mechanically dividing particles to try and force them to behave like a liquid fundamentally concerns itself with the microscopic</p>

There is no definitive answer if you don't define more parameters, since &quot;below zero&quot; could be -1°C or -250°C. As some people pointed out, ice will melt because of local increased mechanical pressure, and that will locally melt the ice, because if you look at <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/512px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">this diagram</a>, you will notice that above a certain pressure you go back to the liquid state, so depending on your temperature you might form some kind of slush perpetually melting and refreezing, or just some fine powder (even the best blender would make particles that are around 10000 times bigger than water molecules). Another interesting thing is that if you lower the temperature enough, or the blender is high power enough, you might provoke an allotropic transition of ice, and end up with a different crystalline form of ice, which is pretty damn interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If at all times the 'water' was kept below 0C then it would remain in a crystalline structure (Ice).
However, if you just said &quot;The air temperature was 0C or lower&quot; then it's a different kettle of fish.  (Friction of blades etc).<br />
So how about I answer your question like this:<br />
If at all times, every molecule of water was kept below 0C (Below freezing) it would remain ice, no matter how finely it was chopped up.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Naps count. I used to sleep 3-4hrs a night and 3-4 hrs during the day for 3 months.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brains are different, people need different amounts of sleep.</p>
</li>
<li>People lie. If you're an entrepreneur, it's very effective to lie to your workers and the public about how little you sleep, effectively branding you as a workaholic, thus injecting everyone with the idea of working hard so they can be as rich and famous as you.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few things that happen during sleep:</p>
<ul>
<li>the brain generalizes knowledge from concrete knowledge into abstract knowledge</li>
<li>the brain prunes old memories</li>
<li>the brain recycles waste and heals</li>
<li>the heart gets to beat slower and giving it a chance to recuperate</li>
<li>the muscles are barely working so they get their excess waste removed</li>
</ul>
<p>To &quot;feel sleepy&quot; there's a neurotransmitter. If you stop sleeping normally eventually your brain just gives up feeling tired because it knows this is the norm and nothing can be done. The brain then starts to compensate. It'll have more of itself asleep at any given time to try to give neurons a break and not die. It'll not give you as much energy to try to recuperate your organs, etc. If you push it you are functioning outside of the normal human operating conditions and the body can only operate like that for so long.</p>
<p>At best you will be at ~60% brain power. You will be dumber, learn slower, more tired, and unhealthy... but awake. You're basically going through insomnia... voluntarily.</p>
<p>Edit: As you get older, you need less rest. An adult can function well on 8 hours of sleep, but a child needs that 10-12 hours of sleep. That's why early bed time for kids is so critical, because they really do need it.</p>
<p>The <em>ONLY</em> exception are people with a special generic condition making them need maybe ~3 hours of sleep a night which is the equivalent to a normal person sleeping for 10 hours. These are about 1 in 100,000 or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every action you can do is done with the coordination of multiple parts of your brain. Your eyes, in particular, connect to many different parts themselves. </p>
<p>To read, you must track the text, interpret the symbols, interpret the words and grammar, consolidate that into meaning, and store that meaning. The part that tracks the text and controls your eye movements involves your muscles in a way that takes very little conscious effort. If you get distracted and that part of your brain doesn't get the order to stop reading, it will just keep going even if the other parts of your brain get interrupted. </p>
<p>Every part of your brain can only do one task at a time. Each part can do a different task, but they have to work together for complex tasks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So my PhD was kind of around this area. Can't give a clean answer, but can talk a bit about what might be happening in the brain. </p>
<p>First thing to know - this is largely based on experiments using a method for looking at what's going on in the brain called fMRI. Exactly what it does is beyond an ELI5 explanation (might be able to write one if anyone is interested), but you can use it to crudely figure out how hard areas of the brain are working at different points in time. Let's say that we have recorded this data for when someone is relaxing vs when they are reading a book. </p>
<p>There's a set of brain regions referred to as the &quot;Default Network&quot;. They seem to be doing more work specifically during awake relaxation than during reading, or any other mental task.</p>
<p>Folks have suggested that this might mean the default network is responsible for what's referred to as ‘undirected thought’ - in this example, let's call it ‘mind wandering’. Mind wandering tends to be thinking about yourself, recent memories, future plans etc. </p>
<p>This isn't the only explanation of what the default network does. It could also, for example, be making sure you're aware of what's going on around you - important for survival in a world that can be dangerous - but there are reasons to believe it is related to mind wandering based on evidence that I'd have to dig out my thesis to remember (being a bad scientist here, but I'm super lazy). </p>
<p>There's another set of brain regions that seem to be working harder during reading, or performing any other mental task, than during relaxation - let's call it the task network (it doesn't have a sexy name as far as I know). </p>
<p>The interesting thing about these networks is that they seem to exist in balance - if one is doing more work, the other is doing less. When you start doing something - reading, mental arithmetic etc - the task network starts working harder, and the default network chills out a bit. Vice versa when you finish what you're doing. </p>
<p>There's evidence that the point where you lose focus coincides with a shift in the balance between the networks, and the default network becomes dominant. </p>
<p>The interesting question then becomes why these changes in the balance happen, and this is not settled to my knowledge. All of this evidence doesn't tell us the why, but it does give us a potential starting point for some interesting research. </p>
<p>I realise that this doesn't explain why the task of reading continues despite the mind having wandered. I was all about the brain data, need an attention specialist to address that. </p>
<p>Caveat for the above - definitely a controversial area, so none of the above is intended to be presented as fact. </p>
<p>All of this is based on the research that was available up to a few years back, as I'm not in brain research any more this might be horribly dated now (anyone with more up to date knowledge feel free to call me out, appreciate references though). </p>
<p>Further reading: not aware of any really good non-technical summaries of this stuff, but I think Raichle who published the original work and named the Default Network wrote a good review article around 2011 if you're feeling brave. </p>
<p>(wrote this after coming back from the pub, may clean up tomorrow if the urge takes me, but see above re: lazy)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your mind tends to wander when you read something it could be for various reasons. If you dont read regularly on a daily basis then your mind will wander because it's used to other patterns. In most peoples daily life we only read for short periods of time, maybe a paragraph or two... road signs, McDonald's menu, etc..  So your mind parsing large amount of text at a time, will not be used to processing this message much text at a time. Also while you are reading part of your bra UK n goes into &quot;sleep mode&quot; so your sub conscious takes over...  </p>
<p>Also, if you have a bunch of other things to do, or some other daily routine, your brain tells you to f off it wants to wander to what it usually does (due to your conscious thought out of your control in some kinda asleep mode (I think my brain has like 37 different sleep modes)..</p>
<p>Anyways, your mind will also wander if your brain flags some interesting text as it is reading so u will start daydreaming about that subject instead of perhaps the scope of the text u are reading..  that is due to a.d.d type factors </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How &quot;at all&quot; are we talking here? Planck-length? Trillionths of a billionth of a second? </p>
<p>There are processes all around you that are so instantaneous and brief in their conception, execution, and termination that it's hard to say if it occurred at all.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson#Particle_physics" target="_blank">Higgs Boson</a>.</p>
<p>These particles are of fundamental order and don't really &quot;exist&quot; as a particle until circumstances essentially condensate them (like rain from a cloud) into being for almost undetectable periods of time. Otherwise, they are as more of a wave field of probable influence.</p>
<p>They don't typically interact though, they just... are. The larger particles they aid the composition of interact, but they themselves are an expression of the attenuated resonant vibrations that make up reality, and have influence upon it in an ascribed manner. </p>
<p>The LHC excels at their capacity to burp these particles into being in such a way that we can find them. In fact, prior to the LHC, the concept of the Higgs Boson was met with ridicule and scoffed at by some scientific communities because it was considered a sort of particle based &quot;Snipe Hunt&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
