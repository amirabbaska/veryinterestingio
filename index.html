		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it's samples per second aka the sampling rate of an audio signal. When you convert analog sound to a digital format it is done by sampling the analog wave thousands of times a second to convert it into a number like a voltage. The higher the sampling rate, the greater the frequency in hz that can be represented. It ends up needing about twice the sampling rate, to correctly sample a specific frequency of sound. </p>
<p>For instance if you need to record a 20,000hz analog soundwave, you need to sample it at 40,000 times a second or 44.1khz which is what music on a CD is sampled at. </p>
<p>The other factor is the size of each sample which effects how many levels of sound it can encode for each sample. This is analogous to how many colors an image has. An 8 bit sample allows for 0-255 levels of sound, or 256 colors if it were photographic data. Where as a 16 bit sample allows for 0-65,355 levels or voltages, or 65,356 colors if it were an image. </p>
<p>So a 16 bit 44.1khz wave file encodes 65,356 discrete &quot;loudness&quot; or voltages in each sample and it samples (or does it) 44,100 times a second. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several people have mentioned that the sampling rate of a digital audio signal needs to be at least twice the highest frequency you want to accurately capture. This is called the Nyquist limit, and <a href="http://imgur.com/a/PcWxd" target="_blank">I whipped up a quick graphic to explain why here.</a></p>
<p>The gist is that to produce a faithful representation of a continuous periodic function using finitely many data points, you need to have at least two points present in every period, or you won't have enough information to recreate the original signal. </p>
<p>Real audio signals have many component frequencies, not just one like the pure tone in those images, so you need to decide what the maximum frequency you want to capture is, and then sample at least twice that often. For most people, human hearing really drops off past 20-25 kHz, so sampling at 40-50 kHz will sound good, hence the CD audio standard of 44.1 kHz.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes - samples per second (s/s). &quot;CD Quality&quot; was set at 44,100 s/s. The reason for this that you need at least twice as many s/s as the highest frequency you want to capture, which for humans is about 20,000 Hz. These days a pro studio records at 96,000 s/s (96k).</p>
<p>The other major digital audio parameter is bit depth, which is a measure of the potential quality of each sample - like the film or frame size (35mm, 70mm, 1080p, 4K) determines the quality of film or video. &quot;CD Quality&quot; is 16 bit depth, now 24 bit depth is typical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The original inspiration for holography is black hole thermodynamics. Black hole entropy (which you can obtain from Hawking's expression for the temperature) is area-intensive, and has thus holographic character. In general, <em>any</em> gravitational theory (in which it is possible to create black holes) will display an area-intensive maximum entropy (see Bekenstein bound). This does not directly imply holography, but it's very hard to fit in any other framework.</p>
<p>Holography however starts really coming together only when you find explicit examples of holographic dualities, which started popping up in string theory (AdS/CFT and co.). Not only have we come to understand that string theory implies holography, but also that holography is necessarily stringy. Nowadays, we think of holography as providing the microscopic <em>definition</em> of a string theory!</p>
<p>So I would argue the role of your &quot;logical leap&quot; is definitely to be embodied by string theory. It's not a small jump.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This topic is not my specialty, but I can relay some things I've learned in various lectures. Holography seems to come in when you try to combine gravity and quantum mechanics, even from very general considerations.</p>
<p>In quantum mechanics, the notion of probability is inherently associated with various notions of infinity. In quantum-sensitive experiments, we tend to think of the system we're examining as &quot;quantum&quot;, whereas our instruments, measuring devices, laboratories, even our brains, are &quot;classical&quot;. This is wrong, everything is quantum. However the reason it's OK to practically think in this fashion is that our laboratories etc are macroscopic (composed of many degrees of freedom). Any probability of some weird quantum shit happening is exponentially suppressed, and thus practically negligible, but still technically there. If you want a truly &quot;classical&quot; object, it needs to have an infinite number of degrees of freedom. Thus well-defined quantum probabilities require infinitely large laboratories (conceptually speaking).</p>
<p>When you add gravity, things get weird. We know that if you put enough mass into a space, eventually it will create a black hole. Thus if we want to build an infinitely large laboratory (again, conceptually speaking), we must continually enlarge the volume it encompasses. Since we are taking the infinite limit, this pushes the laboratory to the boundaries of the space you're in, possibly to infinity. Thus we say that in quantum gravity there are no &quot;local&quot; variables; all of the things that conceptually make sense, <em>from the get go</em>, are variables that exist at the boundary of your space. This implies holography, because it implies the theory must be formulated in terms of boundary variables.</p>
<p>If you now consider that the universe is expanding, and that the expansion is accelerating, we lose even those boundary variables. In that case we're totally lost; what is the theory even <em>about</em> any more? However this point I don't totally understand. Keep in mind my comment is a hand waving relay of (frankly) a hand waving (but still very good) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87lz3U4CkPU" target="_blank">technical lecture</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What we know about the thermodynamics of black holes implies that the maximum entropy of a region in spacetime doesn't scale with its volume but its surface. Now because entropy is equivalent to content of information, it is principally possible that a theory describing physics in a space is equivalent to a theory on that space's surface (as the surface could in principle contain all information the space inside does due to the surface proportional maximum entropy scaling). Now because theories of quantum gravity can describe black holes, they might also tell us more about the holographic principle. </p>
<p>That's at least what I understand of it, but my knowledge on the topic is very superficial. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The holographic principle comes more naturally from information theory, which, just like other math, is playing a larger part in theoretical physics.</p>
<p>The speed of light is also called the speed of causality, and &quot;causality&quot; ties deeply into information theory.  A blackhole has gravity so intense that even light cannot escape its schwarzschild radius.  That also meant that information cannot escape, or so people thought.  Once Hawking radiation was theorized as a way for a blackhole to dissipate, a new problem was posed: can we destroy information by throwing it into a blackhole and letting it dissipate?</p>
<p>The resolution to preserve information was to let Hawking radiation carry the information from inside the black hole as it dissipates away.  For this to happen, the information of the volumetric space (spherical blackhole) had to be equal to the information of the surface area (Hawking radiation).  In fact, you can draw a sphere around the entire observable universe and imagine it collapses into a blackhole and therefore all volumetric information has to be equal to the surface information.  This is the holographic principle.</p>
<p>This has an interesting ramification due to the Planck length and Heisenberg uncertainty.   The information of the surface is at a coarse resolution (Plank squared) while the information of the volume is a higher resolution (Planck cubed).  This means the allowable information in a volumetric space is vastly less than implied by volumetric Planck scale, since it had to be equal to the surface resolution.  We don't know how the information is encoded in Hawking radiation, but we have encoded 3D wavefront information onto 2D paper called holograms and borrowed that name as an analogy when referring to dissipating blackholes and radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Try this little experiment. Open your mouth and don't allow your tongue to touch the roof of your mouth or close your throat. What I mean is with our mouth open if we make a &quot;guh&quot; shape with our tongue like saying the letter G (which seals our glotis) most people (some say they can. Who am I to argue lol) will be unable to breath in through their nose at all. This is because there is less resistance inhaling through the mouth. If you start closing your mouth or allow your lips to come together a little to create more restriction, then it will start to come in through the nose more. But wide open mouth and wide open tongue/throat you cannot breath in through your nose. </p>
<p>The usual resting position of the tongue is low in the back and curving slightly at the tip lightly touching the back of the hard palate in the roof of your mouth just behind the front teeth (usually not touching the front teeth at all) Although people of different native languages sometimes have slightly different resting positions for the tongue depending on the sounds they use with the tongue more forward or more back in the mouth. This may affect a comfortable resting position that is not always the same in different people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The authorities will be more worried about the very powerful mass media.</p>
<p>The idea is that voters should have time to think about who they're going to vote for without the distractions of political campaigning. They've heard all the arguments and speeches, and now they need time to digest all that and come to a rational decision, rather than be swayed by whatever headline they glanced at on the way to the polling booth.</p>
<p>It also means that one candidate can't undermine the other by releasing some scandalous revelation on the day of the election, or even the day before.</p>
<p>Other countries have similar measures to ensure a fair election. In the UK, for example, media outlets can't broadcast anything on the day of the election that might favour any particular party; also, from the moment Parliament is dissolved, the government enters into a state of &quot;purdah&quot; (a Persian word meaning &quot;curtain&quot;) and is banned from announcing contentious or controversial legislation. For example, a government that thinks it might lose the election can't introduce a bill for some popular measure that the next government will have to scrap as unworkable, in order to discredit the next government -- that kind of thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the US, Bloomberg's mayoral inauguration was delayed due to 9/11. That really helped Giuliani gain a lot of ground on his post-mayoral career.

<p>The press have criticized this a lot, however after following the US elections I find that somewhat healthy. Polls have a lot of &quot;cooking&quot; and they can affect the result of the election. The US campaign was 50% scandals, 45% horse race and 5% policy.</p>
<p>The day off before election helps to &quot;clean&quot; a little bit about scandals (however, everyone have decided their vote by then) and the polls shutdown also cleans the news about the state of the race. </p>

We frequently ingest organisms that could cause illness, but in small enough populations that, even if they survive, they can't get enough of a foothold in our bodies to actually cause symptoms of illness. When a large enough population is introduced all at once, there's not a lot your stomach acids will do for you, and some organisms will actually grow faster in a highly acidic environment.</p>
<p>On top of that, not all food-born illnesses are caused by living organisms. Listeria is a common cause of food born illness because the organism itself doesn't make us sick, rather it produces waste products that are poisonous to us. If a large enough population of Listeria is allowed to breed in food that is then cooked, the organisms themselves will die during cooking, but the toxic waste byproducts they created don't actually break down when cooked.</p>
<p>Microscopic organisms are extremely resilient, because they have to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The acid is produced by special cells. Some people, like me, have over active ones. We take drugs known as proton pump inhibitors, so we don't make too much acid (protons).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question. When we eat food the stomach helps break it down but not so much that we end up with elemental carbon in our gut instead of sugars fats and proteins right? So it helps break the food up but doesn't destroy everything like ripping apart protein chains. </p>
<p>Food poisoning may usually be caused by bacteria, but it's not a bacterial infection that makes us sick, it's the metabolic byproducts of that bacteria. Take botulism for instance; the bacteria create a poison as they multiply and it's the poison that makes us sick, not the bacteria. That poison ends up deposited in the food and so eating it is literally eating poison. And much the same way the stomach doesn't turn protein into carbon, it doesn't turn poison into carbon, it stays as poison. </p>
<p>Even from a bacteria stand point our stomachs don't sterilize the food we eat with acid. Living bacteria makes its way into the gut where it has to compete with the colonies already living there. Along with our own immune system we end up with a good balance of beneficial bacteria with malign invaders not gaining a toehold in our gut. We benefit from this because gut fauna help us digest our food even better and get more nutrients from it than we would without it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Microbes are quite a cool bunch with lots of adaptations that make them able to colonise quite a broad spectrum of places. Whilst the stomach is highly acidic, which is generally good enough to kill most microbes that enter the gastrointestinal tract. There are some microbes, such as helicobacter pylori that are able to evade this acidity by secreting neutralising agents, along with burrowing into the stomach cells and hiding in a sense. Other times, the microbes actually don't survive, but their exotoxins (the things they secrete that make us sick or cause injury to our cells) are stable enough to survive their time in the stomach. They then pass through into the intestine where they can cause a range of diarrhoeal diseases. I can't think of any off the top of my head. But hopefully this is helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can observe that the universe is expanding, so the hypothesis was that the universe used to be more compact in the past and expand.</p>
<p>So what they do is that they run back the clock. We have a density of mass and energy currently, if things were more compact in the pass, then the density would be higher. Higher density of mass and energy, change how matter react and temperature go up. </p>
<p>So you can test what happen to matter as you increase mass/energy density and temperature. All matter emit thermal radiation. The higher the temperature of the matter, the smaller the wavelength of that thermal radiation will be. But when atoms are hot enough, they lose their electron, atoms become ions and the material become a plasma. The thing is that plasma is really good at absorbing thermal radiation. That's what happen to the sun. It's a big ball of plasma and thermal radiation created in the core of the sun take thousand of year to get to the surface.</p>
<p>So if our hypothesis is right as the universe become colder, as some point it went from a universe of plasma made of ions to a universe cold enough for electron and photon to form atoms. Like I said, Ions absorb very well thermal radiation, but atoms don't. So at some point the universe became transparent and released a lot of thermal radiation in a relatively shot period of time. And we can see that. That's the CMB or Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. </p>
<p>But at some point the Universe was so dense and high in temperature that we don't know how matter behave. We don't have any example in nature. So we build particle accelerator. We made particle collide so fast that it show us how matter react in super high density and temperature. As we increase the speed of the particle that we acceleration, we simulate farther and farther in the past of our universe. </p>
<p>There is a lot of example like that about how scientist figure out how our universe expanded. Each are rather unique. Like how they realise that the CMB is way too smooth, meaning that the universe had to expand drastically at some point, which they call the Inflation. They calculated during how much time the universe was dense enough to make fusion and with that info, they calculated the ratio of hydrogen to helium and it match perfectly the ratio we see in our universe, we call the Big Bang nucleosynthesis.</p>
<p>But at some point, the universe was so dense that even the fundamental forces of the universe break down. So at that point we simply don't know how to understand how the universe behaved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This relatively small temperature change has already wreaked havoc on the great barrier reef, the largest living structure in the world, home to a staggering percentage of the Earth's oceanic biodiversity. If the world were cooling at the current rate that it is heating, the cold would kill the coral just as quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

How much would a big ocean-going vessel (say, a US navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier) notice a tsunami in the middle of an open ocean, thousands of miles from shore?<br />
Would it be a destructive wall of water moving rapidly towards the ship, or would merely be a (un)noticable rise of the water level which a ship could pass over?<br />
Assume the tsunami in question is the result of an earthquake with a rating of 9.0+ on the richter scale similar to the 1700 Cascadia or 2004 Indonesia earthquakes, both of which generated massive, ocean-crossing waves.</p></div></div>

<p>a tsunami does not really &quot;present&quot; itself as a wave until the water depth is about &lt;1.3x the height of the wave itself.  the drag on the bottom of the ocean slows the flow and the top moves ahead and creates the circulation we see.</p>
<p>When you look at a regular ocean, it looks pretty calm, but when it gets to shore, things become more violent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to think about it is that a typical wave in the ocean is generated by wind and only effects the top few meters. That can move along with the water underneath undisturbed until it hits land. Once the depth on shore is less than the wave it builds up and breaks (oversimplified here but stay with me).</p>
<p>A tsunami involves the bottom shifting so you get the entire depth of the ocean to shift up say one meter. </p>
<p>Big deal, a one meter wave in the mid ocean. The problem is that this wave will not stay put and now will travel at hundreds of kms per hour. Also it is not really a wave but a whole block of water from the surface to the bottom (say 2500 m) that was moved. </p>
<p>At smaller depths, this becomes a problem as the water wants to be 2500 m deep. All the displacement energy of the water at full depth must be absorbed so we end up with a much higher, wider wave in shallow water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A carrier wouldn't actively notice any change. A smaller class ship such as an Arleigh Burke class destroyer would hardly notice such a change depending on the sea state. Maybe if the water was glass, but most of the time it's too choppy for such a thing.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>fish is pale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most fish is &quot;white meat&quot; (even salmon, which is pink because of fish diet, not because it's made of &quot;dark meat&quot;).  This is because these muscles are used for occasional movements and not for constant swimming.  The most common exception is some tuna meat, since tuna are very active swimmers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and flakes apart </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The flakes you see are <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b162a317e5b89562d8074cae3c56493f" target="_blank">myomeres</a>, bands of muscle tissue in the body that allow the fish to swim with a fishy wiggling motion.  Most of the meat you eat from land animals comes from the limb muscles, and isn't segmented like this.  You can see the remnants of such segmentation on the body (eg, ab muscles) but even there it's not set up in the same way and doesn't provide the flake.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With regards to colour, mammals have red muscles because of the presence of myoglobin. This protein is absent in the majority of the muscles found in most fish. Myoglobin is an oxygen binding protein that is found in muscles (Similar to hemoglobin in blood).</p>
<p>In fish the majority of the muscles (white muscles) are used for bursts of speed and are anaerobic (do not require oxygen). Due to not needing oxygen, an oxygen binding protein is not needed.</p>
<p>The grey flesh of the fish near the skin, is the muscles it uses to swim constantly.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons for the difference, the main being the difference in lifestyle. The muscles of a fish are adapted for swimming, whereas muscles of mammals are adapted for moving on land. This means animals need larger, thicker muscles to combat gravity to walk around on land, instead of having natural buoyancy from the ocean. Therefore the muscles are flakier and less dense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned gravity in these answers. Fish have a much finer skeleton and different muscle mass mainly because they are supported by the water against the effects of gravity whereas land animals have to fight gravity using their muscles to support themselves in an upright position. Fish muscles are therefore used in a different way. This is why pound for pound, farmed fish add mass far quicker than farmed land animals</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
