<p>You might take a class at one University and the professor has absolutely no idea what they're talking about and just reading off slides that aren't even theirs.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When in doubt, draw a free body diagram. In case you are unfamiliar, this where you draw arrows for all the known forces on &quot;body&quot; or object. We do this because of Newton's Law, and use it to help us better understand motions or stress on objects. We also take advantage of the fact that F(orce)=M(ass) x A(cceleration)</p>
<p>On the hovering magnet, it is motionless, so we know A = 0. Same for the magnet resting on the surface. On both magnets, we have multiple forces acting, but they all must cancel out, because no objects are accelerating. Since the directions exactly oppose each other the forces exactly cancel out, and there is no acceleration. </p>
<p>For the hovering magnet, we know the force of gravity is equal to the mass of the magnet times the acceleration of gravity. Since it is stationary, the magnetic force is exactly canceling out the force due to gravity.</p>
<p>For the magnet resting on a surface, we know the force of gravity is also the mass of the second magnet times the acceleration of gravity. We also know, since every action has an equal and opposite reaction (think of it as the hovering magnet pushing back on the resting magnet), that this magnetic force is equal to the gravitational force in the hovering magnet. But, since the stationary magnet is also not moving, we know there is a force opposite in direction that exactly matches the sum of the gravitational force and the magnet force on the resting magnet. The &quot;normal force&quot; of the surface pushing back against the magnet is equal to the sum of the force of gravity on the resting magnet, plus the force of gravity on the hovering magnet. Normal force is the &quot;effective weight&quot;, as that is what you would see read out on a scale. But, normal force is not the weight. </p>
<p>Thought experiment: imagine both magnets lose their magnetism, and now are just resting on top of each other. What are the forces acting on each body now? What is different and the same between this scenario and the scenario you bring up?</p>
<p>Edit: So to explicitly answer your question, the resting magnet does not &quot;gain weight&quot; by repelling a hovering magnet. If you put it on a scale, this would appear to be the case, but in fact, but that is because scales actually measure the normal force they exert, not the weight of the object on them. The term &quot;weight&quot; is reserved for the force of gravity on an object due to <em>its own mass</em>. Consider when you measure yourself on a scale, and a friend pushes down on your shoulders. Do you weigh more because a friend is pushing you harder into the scale? Do you weigh less if your friend is slightly lifting you upwards? The answer is no, the scale is simply reading out the normal force it is exerting, which is simply your weight plus any outside forces it must counteract to stop your acceleration.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question has already been answered but I'd like to try a simpler explanation</p>
<p>Let's list down the forces involved </p>
<p>The <strong>top magnet</strong> is affected by gravity so it has a force going <strong>down</strong>. But it's also affected​ by the magnetic force of the bottom magnet so that's a force going <strong>up</strong>. Together they cancel each other out so the top magnet floats.</p>
<p>The <strong>bottom magnet</strong> is affected by gravity so it has a force going <strong>down</strong>. <em>And</em> it's also affected by the magnetic force from the top magnet, so that's another force going <strong>down</strong>. Together it totals the weight of both magnets!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is pulling both magnets down towards the center of the earth.  The electromagnetic force is then pushing as well - each magnet pushes on the other.  The force is strong enough at close distances (as they follow the inverse square law) to push stronger than gravity. But just as the bottom magnet pushes up, the top, hovering magnet is pushing down with the magnetic force. </p>
<p>So the bottom magnet has both gravity pulling it into the ground and the magnetic force pushing it into the ground. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best answer anybody can give is that some gene (or most likely genes) on chromosome 21 is responsible.  We don't have a specific answer to the question yet.</p>
<p>One known factor, however, that almost certainly plays a role is the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23452080" target="_blank">overexpression of a gene associated with collagen.</a>  Collagen plays a major role in the development of many different structures in the body such as bone, muscle, tendons, and cartilage.  Needless to say, anything that affects these is going to have a drastic affect on one's appearance.  It's also likely that this is responsible for many of the other issues associated with Down's such as muscular deficiency, weak joints, and cardiovascular problems.  There are many more factors involved but to my knowledge, this seems to be the one that's most responsible for many of Down's most identifiable traits.</p>
<p>It's also worth looking at the genetics behind the disorder.  First off, there is very little variation across typical humans: roughly 99.5% of genes will be the same when comparing one person to another.  Down's syndrome, however, is the addition of an entire chromosome.  Humans have 46 chromosomes so an additional chromosome equates to roughly a 2% difference from the norm.  This means somebody with Down's is effectively 4x more different from you or me than we are from each other.  Furthermore, since 99.5% of genetic material will be the same, virtually all of the differences due to Down's syndrome that are present in one person will also be present in the next.  In short, instead of just having a few random individual variations from person to person you have a large set of common variations from a normal person to a person with Down's.  Of course, this is a gross simplification but it illustrates the principles at hand.</p>
<p>As you can see, it's really 3 different questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>What mechanisms are responsible for the typical Down's morphology?
(We're not entirely sure but differences in collagen probably play a major role)</li>
<li>Why do we see a similar morphology across different cases of Down's?
(Because it's a common set of genes that are affected)</li>
<li>Why do these differences stand out more than the typical differences across normal humans even when looking at diverse populations?
(The variation associated with Down's is much larger than the typical variation from one person to another)</li>
</ol>
<p>That's the best I can do to explain it, hopefully it tells you what you wanted to know.  And of course, please correct me if I'm wrong on anything or add on if you see something important is missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Facial dysmorphologies are quite common among syndromes that affect the body globally (as opposed to only affecting one organ or body part). Sometimes these are highly recognizable but often they are quite subtle - deep set eyes or thin lips or a broad nasal bridge or low ears or other things that are within the range of normal, yet are typical of the condition. Clinical geneticists have a picture book (presumably online now but a book when I saw it) of photos that guide them towards possible diagnoses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers address the ways in which the face is changed by the genetic differences of Down syndrome, but you are asking why they are all similar in appearance, not just why they are different from those with two copies of chromosome 21.</p>
<p>The fact is that people with Down syndrome have quite different-looking faces from each other, too. Search google images for the syndrome and you'll find a bunch of faces and, while they all have to a greater or lesser extent those characteristic features, they are clearly discernibly different. It doesn't erase racial differences in facial structure either - there's an Asian kid on the first page who's obviously Asian (and who obviously has Down's) for instance.</p>
<p>Probably what's going in is a version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-race_effect" target="_blank">cross-race effect</a> which is the name of the phenomenon whereby it's harder to tell the difference between faces of people whose race you're less familiar with. (Hence the well-known racist remark, &quot;black people all look the same&quot; - an offensive exaggeration of a real effect.)</p>
<p>The faces of those with Down syndrome amount to a kind of &quot;race&quot; in that they share certain typical features which are atypical in the &quot;race&quot; you're most familiar with (i.e. those of your own race who don't have Down's, most likely.) So your brain is able to use things like subtle differences in the angle of a person's eyes, the protrusion of their nose, etc., to discern most people, those parameters are so different in those with Down's that they're off the charts as far as your brain's face-recognition is concerned. That makes them seem more similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I won't bore you with the specifics regarding aetiology, but essentially Down's is due to a an extra chromosome leading to significant neural and physical defects, one of which is their 'similar' appearance as you term it.</p>
<p>Those with Down's appear to have a significant degree of deficiency in midfacial area, mandibular area, and endocranial area1, perhaps due to muscular atrophy caused by the disease.</p>
<p>Otherwise, why they look similar is down to human conditioning. In simple terms, we are very adept at noticing facial differences in our own race, however often, we look at other races, black, asian etc. and cannot differentiate as well between the faces2. This is what occurs with those with Down's syndrome; we see a similar trait and assume they all 'look the same'. This is obviously not the case as those with Down's syndrome often have very different features, but we can't see past this human trait of recognising those similar to us, far better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uber loses money because they are investing in scaling their business...</p>
<p>They are spending a ton of money on litigation and lobbying to be allowed to operate, since most urban areas had strict regulations on taxi services. They are fighting law suits, they are hiring lobbyist to pitch legislation changes to allow them to operate.</p>
<p>Uber also needs to build a symbiotic network of drivers and passengers in order for their platform to work. Drivers don't drive if there's no passengers, and customers won't use this service is they can't dependably get a ride when they need one. This means sign-on bonuses to drivers and discounts/artificially low fares to lure in passengers to build up a base of supply and demand.</p>
<p>Once they've established that they can operate legally, and have a base of drivers and passengers, then those expenses taper off considerably and the make profits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I saw a study not that long ago (end of 2016?) that basically looked at how Uber can lose so much money. They found that if they stopped spending money on expansion, and just operated in their current markets, they would be profitable. They are constantly trying to grow into markets, which is very expensive. The idea is that they are &quot;investing in the future&quot; and once they are in all these markets, it gives them more avenues for profit. It's about growth basically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Uber is predicated, as a business, on the principle that human vehicle operators will soon become obsolete in light of AI transportation models.</p>
<p>Uber (and the sociopathic hedge funds that propagated them) will spend untold billions asserting market dominance to ensure that when the fall comes they are in prime position to profit from the eradication of human flesh from the transportation workflow.</p>
<p>It's a bit like that film The Matrix - every time you book an Uber ride you condemn human beings to a hunted existence of starvation and suffering. The upside being that a handful of already massively rich individuals get even richer.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I taught Improv for years and did a lot of research on what IS funny so I could be a better teacher.</p>
<p>There have been studies that show that the evolutionary need for laughter is to let everyone know it's ok.</p>
<p>Say something offensive, we all laugh because we are shocked and uncomfortable, but hey, we're still ok...no need to kill the guy.</p>
<p>Something surprise you? We will laugh to say it is ok, no need to attack.</p>
<p>Clever and witty responses are laughed at because we show that we get the connections, that we are part of the group.</p>
<p>So, I've found that most categories of funny can fit in this. An unexpected twist, a clever play on words, a shocking or offensive act or comparison. We all laugh to feel like we are part of the tribe. It is an involuntary response, but an evolutionary necessity.</p>
<p>Some people who have &quot;no sense of humor&quot; have different social constructs. If I make a funny joke about Jesus and his mom, and you're very religious, you need to NOT find that funny to stay a part of your tribe. You won't laugh and will probably be offended.</p>
<p>If you're of different cultural, intellectual, or socioeconomic backgrounds, you sometime &quot;won't get&quot; the joke. Think of a comedian you hate and a comedian you love. That comedian you hate but everyone seems to love - you're probably not his target demographic. The comedian you love probably jives more with you as a person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a few theories, here. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>A good joke usually subverts the conclusion you've been set up to expect. By surprising us, a joke might be triggering a sort of coping reaction to the realization we've been tricked. Rather than be angry or frightened, we laugh, since the situation holds no consequence. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Good jokes tend to address aspects of society and culture. We recognize the aspects of society the comedian addresses, and feel a sort of tribal connection through the shared recognition. The laughter then serves as a tool to bond with the tribe and assert your own awareness of the rules of that tribe. </p>
</li>
<li>We all like to feel above average. So, when jokes are crafted to illustrate somebody else's failures, we feel a sense of pride (for better or worse), and laugh out of relief that we're doing better than the hypothetical person in the joke. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, tough question. I was a cognitive science major in school, and I don't think anyone fully understands this. <em>Humor</em> is kind of bizarre, when you think about it. Doesn't serve any obvious evolutionary purpose.</p>
<p>You have to understand that the vast majority of the weird stuff our brains do is more or less accidental. It's a huge complicated system, and there is a lot that can go wrong. And even now, it's not really optimized for abstract thought. We can hypothesize that even our simpler primate ancestors would have understood a pie in the face as being funny...But a more complicated joke with a long setup? </p>
<p>Think how much neural background you'd have to have to make that work. You'd have to understand language, society, human behavior, all the words and concepts in the joke, be able to follow it as it's being constructed, have enough memory to be able to hold the whole thing in your head as the telling is completed...And then some kind of magic to make it all <em>funny</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This should hopefully be a detailed, yet simple enough explanation.</p>
<p>I cannot answer why something is funny. Nobody can yet. As others have pointed out, and as anyone who does a little bit of research on the topic will discover, humor and laughing are part of human behavior that we struggle quite a bit to understand. </p>
<p>However, the way a brain understands a joke is through multiple &quot;pathways&quot; in the brain. You may have heard that certain areas of the brain specialize in behaviors, such as the back of the brain (occipital lobe) specializing in vision while the front of the brain (frontal lobe) specializes in executive functions such as decision-making, morality, etc. In reality, these specializations are more complicated due to the presence of memory, which is in itself complicated, but not the topic of this discussion. For simplicity, we will say that memory is largely located in the hippocampus, even though the truth is much more convoluted. Neurons are the most well-known cells in the brain that serve the function of communicating with each other via electrical signals. The signals travel across our body and to your brain and vice versa if external stimuli are present (such as hearing a joke), and the neurons and areas of the brain the signal travels through creates a &quot;pathway.&quot; Models exist that show how the signal travels through our brain to reach its destination and how it is converted from meaningless sounds in our environment (someone telling a joke) to us understanding it (processing the content of the joke and deciding to laugh). Here is an example of what a model of a pathway looks like, specfically our auditory pathway. <a href="http://what-when-how.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/tmp15F73.jpg" target="_blank">http://what-when-how.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/tmp15F73.jpg</a></p>
<p>So, as the sound waves travel to our ears, through our brainstem, and to our auditory cortex in our temporal lobe, there is NO understanding of the sound yet. When the sound reaches the auditory cortex, the auditory cortex sends further signals to areas in the brain responsible for memory as well as to speech centers (to store the experience, to compare it to previous experiences, to recognize the language and words), and since we often catch ourselves laughing without planning on it due to the joke being funny, it is reasonable to say that there is also communication between the auditory cortex and other areas of your brain responsible for reflexes and motor control. </p>
<p>That is my attempt of an explanation at an ELI5 level. My credentials are a B.S. in Psychology, lab experience, and preparing for med school, just in case you doubt my words.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>In a recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4xWuRyZuDE&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=18m13s" target="_blank">interview</a> (in Spanish) comic writer Mauro Entrialgo described humor as a way to tell things based on omitting parts of the information that are necessary  to understand the discourse, parts that the listener already knows. The listener needs to actively seek and fit the missing parts to give a sense to it, it's a puzzle and solving it will create satisfaction and sometimes even joy.</p>
<p>That would be the base for every form of humor, he then talks about the literary mechanisms like exaggeration, metaphor... and cultural additives that can make a certain joke funnier to certain people.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Bretton Woods System. After WWII, at a conference in NH, the US surprised the world by not proclaiming an empire, but instead agreeing to provide free trade, protection, and safe deep water navigation. Understand at the time the US was the only world power. </p>
<p>Perhaps no country has benefited more from the Bretton Woods System than China, but nearly every country that is a part of the system has and continues to benefit in meaningful ways. The US has been required to engage in fruitless wars (e.g. Vietnam) as a result of holding up its end of the agreement. The Persian Gulf wars were derided as the US protecting its oil needs, but in reality this protected the needs of oversees allies. Maintaining this system costs the US dearly, while reducing the costs incurred by other countries.</p>
<p>Without perspective, it seems like the US is overly involved and imperialist, which draws criticism and pleas for the US to reduce its influence and presence. This needs to be filed in the &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot; category.</p>
<p>The US will likely start to withdraw, and no country will benefit more from this than the US. It is likely many other countries will revert to their pre WWII military, political, and trade squabbles with neighboring states and ethnic groups. The US will be a global power without global interests. It is the most defensible land, and most other countries will be too busy with regional fighting. Really, no country in the foreseeable future will have an ability to invade the US. Advances in 3D printing helps to reduce supply chain logistics, and Mexican labor is becoming as cheap as any overseas.</p>
<p>The US dominance in such a scenario doesn't emanate from any superiority of its people, rather its unmatched and unbelievable natural resources. More navigable rivers than the rest of the world combined, more contiguous arable land, more fossil fuels than the rest of the world with fracking, best positioned to withstand even the most dramatic global warming scenarios. These attributes are often overlooked, but their importance cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Until I researched Bretton Woods, and geopolitics before, during, and after WWII, I vehemently critiqued the US as a global empire, a hegemony, a nefarious, smothering power. Like most opinions I've ever had, the more I research, the more I have to adjust, and, frankly, the more questions and less certainty I walk away with. </p>
<p>A great book on this topic is the Accidental Superpower.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the gold, undeserved. It's a fascinating topic and it's fun to consider different thoughts and perspectives, so thanks to everyone for taking time to share theirs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people are posting various reasons, but I feel it is important to examine the numbers. When you say &quot;such a large amount of its budget on defence and military in relation to other countries in contrast to other departments&quot; - I think you might have been given a misleading set of facts regarding actual military spending by the US.</p>
<p>First of all, despite what all the political memes and 'facts' you hear about on military spending in the US, the reality is this: <a href="http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/year_spending_2016USbn_17bs2n_1000304020#usgs302" target="_blank">in the year 2016</a>, the US government spent $829.7 billion total on defense which includes the Department of Defense and defense-related Department of Energy activities ($604.5 Billion), Department of Veteran's Affairs ($178.8 Billion), foreign aid ($33.3 billion), and so on.</p>
<p>The US Federal Budget, as a whole, was $3,951 billion. Thus, total defense spending was 21.0% of the total US federal budget.</p>
<p>BUT, one big part that the US differs from other countries in the world is that state and local governments have a lot of power, and take in a lot of tax revenue. When we consider TOTAL US Government spending, which totaled $6,773 billion for 2016, that number falls to 12.3%.</p>
<p>In fact, military spending isn't even in the top 3 of total US government spending:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Healthcare - $1,534 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Pensions - $1,388 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Education - $956.7 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Defense - $829.7 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Welfare - $440.9 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How does this compare to other nations? Well, let's compare this to the <a href="http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/numbers" target="_blank">UK in 2016</a> where central + local government spending totaled:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Pensions - £158.6 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Healthcare - £146.4 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Welfare - £111.6 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Education - £86.2 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Defense - £47.0 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you see, the US and UK aren't far off in the order of priority of government spending. However, as a % of the TOTAL UK budget (£796.7 billion), defense at 6% is half of what the US commits as a total of its budget - which, by the way, is a contentious point in the UK, since critics say their spending cuts have gone too far on defense, to the point where the UK embarrassingly had to call in the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/french-patrol-plane-aids-uk-search-for-russian-submarine-detected-off-scottish-coast-a6744171.html" target="_blank">French</a> and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/mod-asks-for-american-help-in-searching-for-russian-submarine-near-scotland-9966080.html" target="_blank">Americans</a> to help find a Russian submarine in British waters - the very definition of not being able to defend one's own territory!</p>
<p>There's also a catch: the UK is primarily focused on European affairs. The US has <em>simultaneous</em> commitments to both Europe and Asia/Pacific.</p>
<p>In fact here are the <a href="https://www.state.gov/s/l/treaty/collectivedefense/" target="_blank">mutual defense treaties the US is a part of</a> per the State Department:</p>
<ul>
<li>North Atlantic Treaty (NATO) - signed 1949</li>
<li>Agreement Between the United States and Australia and New Zealand (Australia, New Zealand) - signed 1951</li>
<li>Philippine Treaty (Philippines) - signed 1951</li>
<li>Southeast Treaty (Thailand) - signed 1954</li>
<li>Japanese Treaty (Japan) - signed 1960</li>
<li>Republic of Korea Treaty (South Korea) - signed 1953</li>
<li>Rio Treaty (nations in the Americas) - signed 1947</li>
</ul>
<p>And I do mean <strong>simultaneous</strong> treaties - a war between North Korea and South Korea doesn't mean the US is no longer obligated to defend European countries if Russia were to attempt to take advantage of that situation.</p>
<p>As thus, the US has a two-ocean Navy. The US also has to have the means (the aircraft and ships) to actually make good on its commitments across the two vast oceans: after all, what good is a treaty if your forces are stuck at home with no way to get them overseas? If Europe were committed to Japan too, you bet they'd need a larger Navy to make good on that commitment.</p>
<p>Also, when one compares % of military spending by GDP, <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS" target="_blank">per the World Bank</a>, the US was at 3.3% of GDP. NATO, meanwhile, recommends its members spend 2.0% of its GDP on defense. So when one considers that the majority of European nations are only focused on Europe only (and occasionally neighboring issues in the Mediterranean), while the US is focused both on Europe and the Pacific and the Americas and yes, the Middle East - suddenly, the US being only 3.3% of GDP (65% more than the 2%) isn't so crazy.</p>
<p>As a side note, before people say &quot;but that's still such a big chunk of the US spending! That's ruining our advances/progress elsewhere!&quot; </p>
<p>I say, take a look at <a href="http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/year_spending_1969USbn_17bs2n_1000304020#usgs302" target="_blank">US spending in 1969</a>, the same year we were knee deep in Vietnam, went to the Moon, had just vastly expanded welfare under the Great Society programs, and even launched ARPAnet - the predecessor of the Internet: defense spending was $94.7 billion of the $183.6 billion federal budget, a giant <strong>51.5%</strong> of US federal spending! (From 1950 to 1970 or so, it was roughly 9-13% of GDP any given year).</p>
<p>Clearly, we've been able to accomplish great things in the past despite spending a magnitude more on defense. In fact, right now, per the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/defense-budget/trends-us-military-spending/p28855" target="_blank">Council on Foreign Relations</a>, US defense spending as a % of its GDP is at its lowest since pre-World War II - i.e., since before the US became a superpower.</p>
<p>Now, the part people say is:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;But the US spends more than the next 7 nation combined! Isn't that outrageous?!&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Except, we need to examine who we are actually spending against and what that money is being spent on.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2018/fy2018_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf" target="_blank">US DOD Budget Request</a>, roughly 25% of the US base defense budget is spent on JUST personnel wages. When one adds in benefits (like healthcare for active duty members and their families) and what not, the total comes out to close to 50% of the budget.</p>
<p>Why is this a matter?</p>
<p>Well, consider if the US started paying its soldiers Chinese wages - roughly an eighth to a tenth. The US would save $130 billion overnight!</p>
<p>But that tells us little about actual comparative power between the US and China, other than that China doesn't need to spend much on wages.</p>
<p>Also, compare this to developed nations with conscription: <a href="http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2013/12/a-dreaded-rite-of-passage-koreas-mandatory-military-service/" target="_blank">South Korean conscripts are paid less than $100 a month</a>.</p>
<p>This difference in wages goes throughout all facets of military spending. For instance, the US primarily buys weapons and arms from domestic manufacturers or nations that are close allies, like Belgium and Germany. China is barred from buying weapons from the US and Europe, for obvious reasons - so they build their own weapons or buy them from nations that will sell to them, like Russia.</p>
<p>End result? US weapons are made in US factories at US wages. Does an F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jet, which was recently sold to the Saudis at $120+ million a jet, mean it is four times better than the Russian equivalent Su-34 which sells around $30 million?</p>
<p>No, you can't use the nominal costs only to compare actual performance and capability.</p>
<p>Cost of living is thus a huge factor in why nominal spending doesn't mean anything when we compare the US to the next highest spending nations.</p>
<p>In fact, that's why when people say &quot;well China only spends about $200 billion on defense&quot; that instead of dismissing China, we should all be concerned: they're getting a LOT more with $200 billion than we do.  And the military and analysts agree: China has rapidly modernized their forces and are far stronger than they appear if one only does a cursory examination of personnel numbers and spending. (On the flip side, Western European nations aren't anywhere near as powerful as what their nominal spending suggests)</p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle to tie this all together is this:</p>
<p><a href="http://nssarchive.us/" target="_blank">The National Security Strategy</a> of the United States.</p>
<p>Since the Cold War, each successive presidential administration has penned its own National Security Strategy detailing the goals and objectives of its foreign and defense policy. This has a huge weight on the sizing (and thus spending) of the US military.</p>
<p>During the Cold War, the US policy was &quot;win two major wars at the same time&quot; - widely believed to mean beating the Soviet Union in Europe and China/North Korea in Asia.</p>
<p>When the Cold War ended, Clinton revised this to &quot;win-hold-win&quot; - win one major war while holding the line in another war and winning that one decisively after the first war concludes. As a result, the US military downsized rapidly: from 3 million active duty + reserve personnel to 2.25 million. Even its equipment shrank: the US aircraft carrier fleet went from 15 or more any year of the Cold War to retiring carriers which has resulted in the 11 we have today.</p>
<p>Even with changes by W and Obama, the military size has stayed relatively constant, with only changes in focus: the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2015_national_security_strategy.pdf" target="_blank">2015 revision by Obama</a> refocused on Russia and kept the 2009 refocus on China. </p>
<p>In other words? High tech foes were once again the focus, hence the <em>increase</em> in spending on weapons like the F-35, the new Ford-class aircraft carrier, etc. </p>
<p>I can go all day explaining exactly the details on where/why we size our military the way it is (like why the US has exactly 11 aircraft carriers), but I think it's important that people get a context/perspective for our spending, how it reflects our own role/responsibility in the world, and the where/why this spending happens - it certainly isn't randomly put together!</p>

<p>Military procurement has led to industries servicing said procurement horizontally spreading their production across as many districts as humanly possible, which means that to ice any program, you'll have a roomful of different representatives/senators screaming about jobs that their districts/states are going to lose.  </p>
<p>And they're not wrong to scream about it, in a way.  The largess that these programs have grown to occupy really do provide higher paying skilled work, many times providing the sole main employer of a geographic area which means that if one were to shut it down it would be catastrophic to that area's economy.  </p>
<p>That's before we start talking about actual military personnel.   The number of people that are actually directly on the DoD payroll is staggering...again, because it is essentially a works program with the patina of patriotism surrounding it.</p>
<p>Our military complex is of a scope that makes the Works Progress Administration from the New Deal look quaint in comparison. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There's Politics involved e.g. congressmen lobby to have military projects in their districts (&quot;pork barrel spending&quot;), since it provides jobs and thus increases their chances of re-election. They wouldn't like to approve anything that would cause a loss of jobs in their districts. So when the White House presents a Federal Budget to Congress for approval, you can bet that every line has been examined for its impact on every Congressional district.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are really a lot of factors involved here.  But first, let me point out: military spending varies from year but is generally less than some other domestic programs, particularly Social Security.</p>
<p>As to the reasons why spending is as high as it is, however:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The US military is actively engaged in warfare in multiple countries on a significant scale, unlike most others.  Saudi Arabia, whose military forces are also engaged in combat, has even higher military spending, as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US military is on the cutting edge of military research and development, meaning it pays much higher development costs than other nations--our allies often receive our technology and hardware at a later date, while our enemies have sometimes managed to steal it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US and its military, through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other alliances gurantee and protect the independence and security of much of Europe, allowing European nations in particular to spend less money on defense because the US more than takes up the slack.  While it's true that some allied nations (namely the UK and France) have their own potent nuclear deterrents, and the US could theoretically rely primarily on its nuclear weapons as well, that kind of situation severely limits flexibility.  If one nation were to invade another (such as how Saddam's Iraq invaded Kuwait), the US (and by extension the rest of the world) would be left with the uneviable choice of starting a nuclear war or doing nothing at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US has global interests, more so than most other nations, both in terms of allied nations as well as citizens and investments in foreign nations, and having the military force to protect these interests is expensive.</p>
</li>
<li>It has been said that you fight a war with the army you have, not the army you want.  As weapon systems become increasing complex and expensive, the development time and expense has skyrocketed.  Ensuring that weapon systems are numerous, up to date, and ready enough to fight a war successfully requires a large military budget.  In WW2, the US was largely unarmed at the outset and was not prepared to fight.  As a result, it took years to defeat the Axis, years during which millions of lives were lost by US friends and allies.  As the pace of warfare has continued to get faster, it is more essential than ever that militaries be ready at a moment's notice.  In combination with the previous points, this results in significant military expense for the US.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, in answer to your question about whether the money could be better spent:</p>
<p>I don't think it can be.  The US military safeguards the world's peace.  The fact that there has not been another world war since WW2 is evidence of that, among other things.  All great powers throughout history have had strong militaries to protect their citizens' lives and property.  The minute their militaries fell into decline (for any reason) their neighbors and enemies started to try to figure out ways to take what was theirs.  As the richest nation on earth, the US has much to protect.  Without a strong military and an emphasis on defense, none of the other benefits of civilization can be enjoyed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple and concise explanation </p>
<p><strong>Professional Boxing</strong></p>
<p>The scoring system used in professional boxing is called the 10-Point Must System. These are the basics for scoring a round:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Judges score on a 10-point scale. Most rounds will end 10-9, with the more dominant boxer receiving 10 points, the other receiving 9.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a boxer is knocked down, he loses a point. If a boxer is knocked down twice, he loses two points. If both fighters are knocked down, the knockdowns cancel each other out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While uncommon, if a fighter completely dominates a round but doesn’t score a knockdown, a judge can still score that round 10-8.
If a judge deems the round completely even, both fighters receive 10 points.</p>
</li>
<li>When the referee sees fit, he can take away a point or two for an intentional foul; he can do the same for unintentional ones, but that usually occurs after at least a warning.</li>
</ul>
<p>While you’d probably do well relying on the eyeball test to determine the winner of each round, it helps to know what a judge is looking for. These are the things that help determine which fighter won a round:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Effective Aggression – Being aggressive gives the impression of dominance, but unless the boxer is landing shots and not constantly getting countered, it’s not exactly “effective.” Judges look for effective aggression, where the aggressor consistently lands his punches and avoids those from his opponent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ring Generalship – The fighter who controls the action and enforces his will and style.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Defense – How well is a boxer slipping, parrying, and blocking punches? Good defense is important.</p>
</li>
<li>Hard and Clean Punches – To the untrained eye, it can appear as if a boxer is landing a lot of shots, when, in fact, most are being blocked or aren’t landing flush. A judge needs to look for hard shots that land clean.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a fight goes this distance, the result is determined by the scorecards. Here are the possible outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Unanimous Decision – All three judges had the same fighter scoring more points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Split Decision – Two of the three judges had the same fighter scoring more points (the winner), while the other judge had the other boxer scoring more points (the loser).
Majority Decision – Two of the three judges had the same fighter scoring more points (the winner), while the other judge ruled the contest a draw.</p>
</li>
<li>Draw – A draw can occur when either two of the judges rule the contest a draw, or it can happen when one judge scores the bout for one fighter, another judge scores it for the other fighter, and the third rules it a draw.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Amature Boxing</strong></p>
<p>Method of Scoring</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A judge is advised to fixate in between the two boxers; do not develop a tendency to study or follow just one of the boxers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Amateur boxing is scored on a point system, not on a round basis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The winner is decided on the majority of judges, i.e., 5-0, 4-1 or 3-2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a boxer, in the opinion of the referee, is being outclassed or is receiving unnecessary and excessive blows, the bout shall be stopped and the opponent declared the winner.</p>
</li>
<li>If one boxer has a 20-point advantage (for Open and Under 19/Junior men), or a 15-point advantage (for Women and Junior Olympics/Cadets) over their opponent, the bout must be stopped except in the last round, and the boxer with the advantage is declared the winner.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The scoring system works like this: every round, the judges will score both fighters. Usually, they award 10 points to one fighter and 9 to the other. If a fighter gets knocked down, they lose one point. The judges can score a 10-10 or a 10-8 when no knockdown has occurred, but it's less common to see that, and judges usually see something that will give the edge to one fighter over another in a potential 10-10 case.</p>
<p>As for what they're looking for, they're looking for the dominant fighter. The fighter who is controlling the pace of the fight, who's attacking effectively, who's getting clean shots in, who's defending against his opponent very well. A fighter may throw lots of punches, but if they're not connecting, or if the opposing fighter's defense is really good, then it doesn't matter. </p>
<p>Since the scoring is done per round, score winners tend to be the fighters that were consistently dominant throughout the fight. If a fighter was on the losing end for most of a fight, came back very strong at the end, but didn't get a knockout, then that fighter will still likely lose by score. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suspect many answers have been deleted by the mods because they don't deal with the technical aspects of how scoring should be performed.</p>
<p>However, the question posed here was &quot;How <strong>do</strong> judges determine who wins.&quot;</p>
<p>The word &quot;do&quot; is an important one, and makes the answer slightly different than if the question was phrased, &quot;How <strong>should</strong> judges determine who wins?&quot;</p>
<p>The top answer has done an effective job of answering how judges &quot;should&quot; score.</p>
<p>But boxing does have an extensive and well documented history of controversy, where how the judges &quot;should&quot; score does not always equal how they &quot;do&quot; score. There are many factors that contribute to the discrepancy between the &quot;ideal&quot; and &quot;real&quot; results. There factors can include limited viewing angles for judges, corruption (bribery), national favoritism (especially in the case of Olympic matches), etc. </p>
<p>These controversies are not at all rare in boxing. In fact, they are so common that the answer to this question would not be complete without acknowledging their existence.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apart from the one answer about engaging in &quot;play which builds muscle and muscle memory&quot; the answer is most likely &quot;no&quot;. Exercise for the sake of exercise burns up a lot of calories which in other animals is best preserved for acquiring food and reproducing etc. That humans engage in muscle building is a result of our societal evolution from that of hunter gatherers where we were just like other animals to today where division of labor has made food acquisition the least of our worries. So, we now have plenty of time and resources to waste working out to impress people (or most likely ourselves). When you look at the very few truly tribal societies still in existence today, you won't find too many people working out for the sake of it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Any animal engages in behaviors to increase the size and responsiveness of their muscles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you're looking for the human definition, that's tied to social displays, you could certainly look at male kangaroos and try to determine how much of their mass comes from behaviors they share with females, and those they engage in excess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Birds.  Birds practice their mating dances.  They develop and practice a range of moves that requires a range of muscles.  They practice those moves to build their muscles for a display quite similar in intent to many humans who work out.</p>
</li>
<li>If you're trying to determine the &quot;classes&quot; of animals that do a particular behavior, you're going to have a lot of trouble observing nature.</li>
</ol>
<p>Even amoebas gotta stretch their sacks, holmes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the question conflates two levels of 'purpose'.</p>
<p>One is a <strong>subjective</strong> meaning of purpose - what motivates you to play or build muscle (having fun, feeling attractive...)?</p>
<p>Another is an <strong>ulterior</strong> meaning of purpose - which mechanisms programmed people or animals to have fun or feel attractive when they play or build muscle (fight/flight training, social/sexual status)?</p>
<p>OP uses human muscle building as an example of an activity that exists 'for the sole purpose of muscle growth'.</p>
<p>If you interpret 'purpose' in the <strong>subjective</strong> sense, the example ignores any indirect, personal motivation someone might have for wanting to build muscle. That doesn't seem right.</p>
<p>If you interpret 'purpose' in the <strong>ulterior</strong> sense, the example ignores any indirect, ulterior reasons why people would want to 'instinctively' feel motivated to build muscle. That doesn't seem right either.</p>
<p>I think OP is looking for animal behavior that seems to solely build muscle (and not e.g. social relations) <em>while the animal is doing it</em>.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are examples of this on a small scale, but I can't think of another animal that systematically builds muscle while not also playing/hunting/looking for mates/travelling etc.</p>
<p>The main reason for this is pretty intuitive: Whatever your ulterior reason for building muscle, you're usually better off doing <strong>that</strong> instead of 'building your muscles' separately. Or, at the very least, you should combine your muscle building with activities that bring about other benefits while you're doing them.</p>
<p>Muscles are expensive to build and maintain, and it's much more efficient to have the work required to build them achieve other goals while you're building them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I've been reading XKCD for years at this point, and I like looking into things that appear in the comics. What is the resistance here, how would you work it out, and why is it so incredibly hard?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was given this as a homework problem in a graduate E&amp;M course. Interestingly, for two points next to each other in the lattice, there is a simple argument to show that the equivalent resistance is R/2. But as soon as you try any other two nodes - the knight move or even just a diagonal - you need much heavier machinery.</p>
<p>There is <a href="http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath668/kmath668.htm" target="_blank">this mathpages</a> article which goes through it. I haven't read their whole article; it seems rather long, as my handwritten solution is just over 2 pages (it looks like I did it differently). We were also allowed to use Mathematica for the integrals, so we skipped many of the steps. (I know how to do the integrals analytically using contour integration, but it's pretty tedious).</p>
<p>The trick is to set up an infinite set of equations using Kirchoff's law at every lattice point. Imagine you have inserted a current I at the point (0,0) and are removing a current at (2,1), where (x,y) are integer coordinates on the grid. Then at every lattice point, you need to have total current coming out of the node is conserved: I(x,y) R = V(x+1,y) + V(x-1,y) + V(x,y+1) + V(x,y-1) - 4 V(x,y) = 0. Except at the two points where you've inserted/removed current, you need to include this on the right-hand side: </p>
<p>V(1,0) + V(-1,0) + V(0,1) + V(0,-1) - 4 V(0,0) = I_in R</p>
<p>V(3,1) + V(1,1) + V(2,2) + V(2,0) - 4 V(2,1) = -I_in R</p>
<p>Here, I_in is the total current flowing through the circuit. I'm using R as the resistance of each resistor (so R = 1 Ohm in the xkcd comic). Then after explicitly solving this infinite system of equations for V(x,y) as a function of I, we can find the equivalent resistance as R_eq = (V(2,1) - V(0,0))/I_in (the I_in dependence will always cancel out, which you can prove via dimensional analysis).</p>
<p>Ok, but how do we actually solve this infinite set of equations? As a condensed matter physicist, I immediately recognize this as equivalent to solving some non-interacting tight-binding quantum lattice model, so I did what a condensed matter theorist would do. I introduced the discrete Fourier transform:</p>
<p>V(x,y) = ∫dk1 dk2 V(k1,k2) e^(ik1x + ik2y)</p>
<p>where the integrals go from -pi to pi. Anyways, placing this into the infinite set of equations reduces to a simple algebraic equation for the V(k1,k2). I think the mathpages is doing a very similar thing but using a slightly different method. Then to get V(x,y) you need to do a rather nasty integral, but it can be done in practice.</p>
<p>I can give more details on the intermediate steps above if desired. The answer is (4/pi - 1/2)R. We also did the diagonal case. I can check my solution later when I'm back in my apartment to see what that equivalent resistance is.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just pulled out my handwritten solution. I fixed some errors above. The equivalent resistance between two nodes connected by the diagonal of a square is (2/pi)R. To obtain the equivalent resistance between two arbitrary nodes, I have to perform an integral which I'm not sure can be done as a function of the nodes. (This integral is presumably equivalent to equations (9) and (13) in the mathpages article, since I got the same answer for the two special cases considered). </p>
<p>The mathematical procedure above can be thought of as obtaining the inverse (or &quot;Green's function&quot;) of the discrete Laplacian on the square lattice. This is very similar to solving the discretized free Schrödinger equation, which is how I recognized how to solve the problem once the system of equations was set up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is so frustrating! I started out by thinking of increasing path lengths in parallel, then treating each pair in parallel with what I had already. I then plugged in some numbers to combine them and see if it was trending toward an obvious endpoint. I got to 5 and got a resistance in total of 5 ohm (I think this a coincidence at this level) then gave up as a non-electrician/physicist/algorithm-writer.
One thing though, current flow would be concentrated around the shorter paths at the centre. Does this in fact mimic current flow down a solid conductor? I.e. Imagine the resistors getting smaller and smaller until they become the resistances within a solid conductor. </p>
<p>TL:DR wait for someone who knows what they're talking about to answer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
