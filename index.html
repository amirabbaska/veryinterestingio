		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, and one of the questions that led us away from the classical model of the atom and towards the quantum model. You are correct that the classical way we think of an atom (positively charged nucleus, negative particle in a circular orbit around it) would emit radiation, causing the electron to decay into the nucleus. The fact that this doesn't happen means this must not be the correct model.</p>
<p>We now know that the electron is not a point mass orbiting the nucleus at all, but a &quot;density cloud&quot; which constantly surrounds it. You've likely heard of the &quot;wave particle duality&quot; of light- well it's not just light which has this duality, all particles do (it's just most pronounced with light, since the less mass a particle has the more &quot;wave like&quot; it acts). So, the electron is in a wave around the nucleus (and actually, when it is in its ground state it is in a standing wave) so it doesn't radiate (in fact, when it is in an excited state it is no longer a standing wave, which is why it does radiate and then fall down to the ground state). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The previous answer explains a more complicated issue in that accelerating a charged particle does cause it to lose energy, and how the absence of this effect with electron orbits helped us understand that the typical chemistry book model of an atom is inaccurate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two answers here really:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, you are correct that acceleration <em>can</em> cause a change in kinetic energy. However, there is a special kind of motion called <em>circular motion</em>, such as the approximate orbits of planets, where the acceleration is roughly perpendicular to the direction of motion at any given time, so the kinetic energy is unchanged. So the electrons, orbiting in circular motion around the nucleus, should not lose energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>However: Electrons have a charge. Highschool-level physics should tell you that accelerating a charged particle causes radiation to be emitted, and that this radiation carries away with it some of the energy of the particle. Accelerating the electrons in a circle, therefore, should cause them to lose energy. The solution:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wave-particle duality. Everything is both a particle and a wave. When electrons orbit the nucleus, the orbitals behave as waves, and the electron does not truly accelerate, but simply exists in all possible places around the nucleus, with varying frequencies (we're pushing the limits of my physics knowledge here). Thus, no radiation is emitted, and no energy lost. </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: A letter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dont think of an electron as orbiting around an atom but being &quot;stuck&quot; in an orbital. An orbital is an area in or around an atom that due to the collection of forces around it, the electron will &quot;stay&quot; in this area unless given enough energy to get out of this area, ie. it gets hit by a photon, or another electron flys by.</p>
<p>In the simplest atom, hydrogen, the first orbital is called S1 and is an area around the proton where the electron is &quot;trapped&quot;. If you have more then one electron, they will become trapped in other orbitals with names like S2, P2, ... Search &quot;atomic orbitals&quot; and you will get some pretty neat pictures of where the electrons end up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is not electrically/mechanically perfect, and so there are little inklings of sound even when none really exists. And then you have the individual perceiving it all, shifting minute amounts of attention to this or that within the inklings... If you're familiar with a song that's even remotely similar to how the inklings fit into your perception, it can bubble all the way up into that song's chorus or bridge.</p>

<p><strong>Explanation</strong> We're not entirely sure, but it seems to be that humans assume people are staring at them even when only presented with partial evidence. This was tested in an experiment by the University of Sydney, which noted that when not given sufficient cues, the subject would still almost always assume they were being watched. </p>

I will light up the area and find a set of eyes looking in our direction. </p>
<p>I do not believe it's a mind's eye thing, it must be related to my peripheral vision picking up two orbs distanced far enough apart to simulate an animal. I know this because if a deer or dog is walking parallel to me I will not &quot;sense&quot; it, I can only see one eye. I have also been walked up on from behind while working and only made aware of my stalker by audible means (extreme noise or extreme silence). </p>
<p>I should actually do a study for this on YouTube or something because I can prove it daily. I could even use sunglasses to illustrate how removing the shape of two orbs will stop you entirely getting this sense. You can however still observe someone and tell they are stalking you. You will not get the hair raiser feeling though, that is a response for your nerve endings firing up getting ready to fight. Something I have felt every time a big cat is stalking me. Really really hate mountain lions, the chaotic silence that accompanies their arrival is difficult to describe, very fun to be stalked and reminded that we are not truly the top of the food chain when we are alone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question, but it's also really tough to answer because any in-depth explanation very quickly ascends to levels of terminology that sound like technobabble. The simplest answer is that the math requires the extra dimensions to explain the interaction of the quantum (subatomic) world with the macro (atoms, molecules and larger) world, to model them and the underlying rules they follow. This is obviously the least satisfying, because it's like a parent saying &quot;because I said so&quot;.</p>
<p>To back up a bit, it's important to redefine the term dimension. We think of dimensions as basically &quot;something you can measure&quot; - length, width, height. In physics terms, they kinda are that, but kinda not. It's easier to think of them as ways of defining a specific parameter or quality of an object. Our main three dimensions define an object's size, which is easy to make sense of. It can also be a way of defining how an object moves through space. With String Theory, you're trying to explain the movement of and interactions with subatomic particles, some of which are very strange. All of these extra dimensions are not physical ones, but are said to be 'wrapped up at the subatomic level', which I think of as meaning they can't be measured with a ruler because they don't define a given space. They're not defining a physical thing, the way length, width and height do. What they do is allow subatomic particles to behave the way they do - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunnelling" target="_blank">tunnel through barriers they 'shouldn't' be able to</a>, or the good ol' thing where they <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave%E2%80%93particle_duality" target="_blank">act like waves and particles at the same time</a>.</p>
<p>Really, rather than &quot;allow&quot; we should say &quot;explain why&quot;, but then &quot;dimensions&quot; is probably one of the most confusing terms they could have chosen for what was being described, because it relies on a definition of the term is that isn't the way most people think about it.** If a subatomic particle tunnels through a barrier that it shouldn't be able to, but you recognize that there is an additional parameter that applies to both the particle and the barrier - say, they only exist 99.999999% of the time in our universe, but pop out to a higher plane of existence than the physical (for the record, this is an extreme example made to illustrate the point, not what particles necessarily do), then you can say they have a measure of 99.999999 in the 'existence' dimension (again, made up for the explanation). If you combine these two numbers, you get the one-in-a-trillion chance of a particle 'tunneling' through the barrier.</p>
<p>It's also necessary to point out that ten dimensions is just the number that the kaluza-Klein Theory suggested (initially five, later ten). I've seen theories that extend to thirty dimensions.</p>
<p>For the record, I don't believe that String Theory is what it purports to be. I am only a failed physicist, and the people who are working on it are <em>far</em> smarter than I am, so if there is an empirical right and wrong on the issue, you'd be better off betting on them to be right. I come to explain String Theory, not defend it. String Theory fails to simplify the discussion, though, which is what the entire search for the Grand Unified Theory is supposed to be. Ultimately, the answer to the Universe - if we can ever discover it - will never be something you can adequately ELI5. I don't think it will rely on purely mathematical constructs for its explanation, and I think it is the purest of hubris to think that we can go from discovering atoms and nuclear forces to unlocking their underlying principles in (on the scale of the universe) a fraction of a blink of an eye.</p>
<hr />
<p>**Kinda like a scientific theory and a 'real world' theory - same underlying concept defining both terms, but they become very different things within their specific contexts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One very short and unsatisfying ELI5 answer is that if the number of dimensions is anything else, then certain undesirable infinities show up in the theory. Therefore the assumption of extra dimensions is made in order to avoid these bad things from happening. (The harder ELI5 is to explain why this assumption of extra dimensions is much more reasonable than a layperson would assume.)</p>
<p>By the way, just to clarify a point: The number of dimensions depends on certain specifics of the theory. Bosonic string theory requires 26, superstring theory requires 10, and M-theory requires 11. Superstring theory is what most people mean when they simply refer to &quot;string theory,&quot; since bosonic string theory is not realistic. However, superstring theory comes in various flavors, all of which are unified in some sense by M-theory. When we say that superstring theory has 10 dimenions, we mean 1 time dimension and 9 space dimensions, 3 of which are the ones we perceive and 6 of which are tiny, &quot;compactified&quot; spatial dimensions.</p>
<p>Important caveat: I am not even remotely a string theorist. </p>
<p>Edit: Maybe &quot;undesirable infinities&quot; is not the right phrase to use (though I suppose one can probably get away with calling it that). It's more like you need a particular undesirable term that shows up to be zero in order to have the required symmetry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not a physicist, but I once asked a physicist to explain to me this very thing. Below is a reformulation of what he told me:</p>
<p>What does it mean that there are more than 3 spatial dimensions, and what does it mean that they are &quot;curled up very small&quot;?</p>
<p>Imagine you're a billiard ball, living on the surface of table where the cover is on. Above you, just barely touching you, is the bottom of the cover. Below you is the felt. You and I know your world is 3D, but you perceive it as 2D, forward/backward and left/right. You and I know that the felt is not evenly compressible, so when a billiard rolls over it in a straight line, the balls moves ever so slightly up and down. This up and down motion though, is too small for you in billiard-ball-world to observe. You don't ever think about this though, because your 2D physics completely explains all interactions between other billiard balls that you observe.</p>
<p>Now let's take it one step further. Imagine you're a billiard ball physicist. Just as before, your 2D physics completely explains all the interactions between billiard balls you observe. Your &quot;bouncing-off-bumpers&quot; theories explain how balls change angle and slow down when they hit a bumper, and your &quot;just-slowing-down&quot; theories explain how balls are always slowing down a little bit, even when they don't hit a bumper. You can very accurately predict where a ball will go by putting these two theories together. Many of your billiard ball colleagues are unsatisfied with this situation though. Both of these theories involve billiard balls slowing down, but the theories themselves are separate. One day, a billiard ball physicist colleague comes to you with a crazy idea. This colleague says that they can unify the two theories of billiard ball movement if you imagine that a ball slowing down results from that ball losing energy to the surface that it's directing a force against. However, this unified theory requires that there is a force pressing balls <em>down</em> against the felt. Down is not a direction that exists! The theory only works if there is a <em>third dimension</em>.</p>
<p>You and I know your world is 3D and has the dimension up and down, but you, as a billiard ball physicist, cannot perceive this dimension. The hypothetical existence of this dimension though, allows for a theory of billiard ball physics that is simpler, more general, more elegant, and thus more appealing than the two separated theories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very few &quot;like you're 5&quot; answers available on this topic. I'll take my best swing.</p>
<p>forget what you know about dimensions and think of a video game being played by a kid holding a controller. </p>
<p>The character in the video game can move in all of the spatial dimensions it exists in, like us. Forward, back, side to side, up and down.</p>
<p>So the kid finds a menu option called &quot;timeline&quot; and presses it. Now the kid sees a panorama of events that his character has experienced throughout the game. The difference between the player and the character is that the character has to experience the whole timeline event by event, while the player can see the timeline as a single object.</p>
<p>Now you've moved up a dimension. We've collapsed direction, position, and time into an object that you can hold in your hands and manipulate. If you were able to hold a timeline in your hands like an object, you could change it and affect it like any other object you can interact with. </p>
<p>Being able to interact with an entire 3 dimensional timeline as if it were an object would make the kid playing the game 4 dimensional. </p>
<p>It gets weird when you start to consider that the entire environment that the kid playing the game exists in, must also be made up of existential versions of the ideas of existence similarly to how the character's three dimensional lifespan is simply an object in a fourth dimension.</p>
<p>It is much easier to explain a timeline as a chain of events rather than to try and tell someone that every event in their life exists as a single object in a higher dimension. </p>
<p>This is where math comes in. Mathematics and moreover physics deal with the footprints of these intangible creatures rather than the beasts themselves. And with our current understandings in mathematics, we see footprints which actually call for up to 11 dimensions. (including m-theory, there are 7, 10, or 11 expected dimensions). So it isn't so much that we've seen these 10-dimensional beasts making the footprints, it's more that we've seen footprints that must have been made by a 10-dimensional beast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mathematically, it has to do with group theory, more specifically representation theory of Lie groups. These things are tough to explain to someone without a background in these things, so I'll keep this short and not super precise:</p>
<p>Symmetries are of fundamental relevance in physics for numbers of reasons. This goes so far that you can basically define a symmetry and some other stuff and determine all the physics of the system from that. Large parts of the standard model of particle physics were found this way. Mathemetically, these symmetries are expressed in groups.</p>
<p>Now if we want to create a new, more general theory from our old ones it needs to reproduce all the symmetries the old theory has. So mathematically we are looking for dimensions where there are relatively simple (read: small) symmetry groups that contain all the symmetries we know. It so happens that 10 is the smallest dimension where there is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor#Terminology_in_physics" target="_blank">Majorana-Weyl spinor</a> which is a good candidate for a number of reasons. Most common string theories use this or related symmetry transformations.</p>
<p>String theories are then sort of constructed such that they have the imposed symmetry. So you start with 10 dimensions because your symmetries are nice there, and build the string theory around it - not the other way round.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

While my group tried to get access to to the foot, we were not successful. However, we spoke to dosimetrists who had access to the area. According to them, the gamma exposure rate on contact with the foot was ~600-1000R/hr depending on the spot. These measurements were taken in the last couple of years, so little has changed. </p>
<p>If you were to run into the room, touch it just long enough to get a selfie and then leave, you'd get somewhere under 10 Rad (if you assume a mean gamma energy of 1MeV ). This is a dose that would faintly show up in bloodwork, but would not cause noticeable acute effects. </p>
<p>Based on the linear-no-threshold model using data from BEIR VII (ERR=~.6/Sv), this experience would raise your lifetime fatal cancer risk from ~22% (male, US) to ~23.3%. So yeah, I'd totally do it.</p>
<p>Edited to change &quot;lifetime cancer risk&quot; to &quot;lifetime fatal cancer risk&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Covers naturally occuring uranium, it's history, the bomb, Chernobyl and everything in between. They even talk about radiation and photographs...you couldn't take a selfie with film. It's quite good. Everyone should watch it right through the end.</p>
<p>They go inside the Priypat Hospital near Chernobyl where the 1st responders where taken (to die). Radiation level varies completely throughout the facility. The firemen's boot and clothing are still very hot.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends how long you were exposed to it. I found an article that summarized it like this: &quot;After just 30 seconds of exposure, dizziness and fatigue will find you a week later. Two minutes of exposure and your cells will soon begin to hemorrhage; four minutes: vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. 300 seconds and you have two days to live.&quot;</p>

<p>I'm no expert on ALS, and again, this is only speculation. It is, however, an interesting perspective coming directly from the people who've directly experienced the disease. It seems to be discussed often among members of the ALS community.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Experts aren't really sure, but what happens with ALS is that the neurons that control your movements begin to weaken, and thus you gradually lose the ability to control your muscles.  Typically someone with ALS succumbs to the disease when they lose the ability to breathe or swallow.<br />
In Hawking's case, he has retained the ability to breathe and drink... and with some very attentive care to make sure he doesn't get bedsores from his immobility, this is what has kept him alive.<br />
I'm sure that [retaining the ability to communicate] (<a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-computer.html" target="_blank">http://www.hawking.org.uk/the-computer.html</a>) helps his prognosis from a mental health standpoint, as he controls his speech computer by moving a muscle in his cheek.  To me that is more fascinating than his ability to fight the onset of his ALS.  If that muscle movement were to go... it would be a sad day for all of mankind, as his contributions to the world of physics are nothing short of remarkable.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, an important thing to be noted is you are probably flexing a muscle called the tensor tympani. It is a tiny muscle in your ear that holds onto the bones in your ear which conduct sound. The ear drum kind of works like a hammer beating on a drum and the tensor tympani muscle is like attaching a string to the hammer, which only allows it to hit the drum so hard. The entire purpose of this muscle is to tense up before loud sounds in order to protect the inner workings of your ear. </p>
<p>When you stretch in the morning, this inadvertently tenses this muscle, which you can &quot;hear&quot; as a woosh, or it may just be quieting all other outside sounds. This muscle is usually under involuntary control, however some people can also do it voluntarily. Just like blinking is automatic, but you can also do it if you think about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
