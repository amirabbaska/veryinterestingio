		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question.
A few things that I'd like to point to which I think might contribute to the discussion.
The relative degree of consonance/dissonance is directly associated with the number of cycles that are required before 2 (or more) notes repeat their pattern. e.g. in a unison it is a 1:1 ratio and so the two notes are considered consonant. Whereas the tritone/A4/D5 is an irrational number which when we use the same criteria takes the biggest number of cycles before resolution/repetition of the pattern compared to other intervals. Some other intervals, depending on the tuning system used, are 5:4 or 3:2 which resolve faster than the tritone and so, are described as consonant. You can complete the mathematics for any chord and this holds up to any cultural ordering of consonance/dissonance that I am aware of.
When comparing the major key to the minor key in western music, we have a set of melodic and harmonic structures that are common to both. What is happening here is that these two keys, while both considered consonant have slightly different variations. They are tied together and comparable largely due to the dominant -&gt; tonic (V-I, whatever you want to call it) which gives us a cadence. When you compare the harmonies found in these two keys and the intervals used to create the melodies, the minor key is slightly more dissonant than the major key. Given this is the case, and making some assumptions that brains all process patterns in a similar way (big assumption, i know) I think we have an argument for a natural predisposition due to slower pattern recognition in the minor key. Perhaps the minor key lends itself to slower tempo so as to allow time for melodies/harmonies to process, this may make the association stronger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of the answers are quite complete / accurate.</p>
<p>Chinese characters can be ordered in two main ways, by pronunciation and by radical. The sound of each character in Mandarin can be written out using Roman letters (a phonetic system called pinyin), which can be arranged alphabetically, A to Z. For example, the character 你 (you) is listed under &quot;ni&quot;, and the character 她 (she) under &quot;ta&quot;. Mandarin also has 4 tones, so for each sound such as &quot;ni&quot;, there will be further ordering &quot;ni1&quot;, &quot;ni2&quot;, &quot;ni3&quot;, and &quot;ni4&quot;, where the number indicates tone. So 你 is actually under &quot;ni3&quot; and 她 under &quot;ta1&quot;. This ordering is useful when you know how to say the character, but don't know/remember how exactly to write it.</p>
<p>For radical, things are slightly more complicated. Most Chinese characters can be split into a &quot;main&quot; part and... the other part. The main part, called the radical, often gives a general idea to the meaning of the character. If you know Chinese, you can easily pick out which part is the radical (it can be on the left, right, top, bottom, left-bottom, top-left, 3-side-surrounding, 4-side-surrounding, etc!). At the start of every dictionary is an index -- a list of all the radicals. Under each radical, you see a list of ALL the characters having that radical (there are very very many). Take your time to find the one you're looking for, and it tells you which page to go to for that character. This kind of ordering is useful when you know what the character looks like but not how it sounds.</p>
<p><strong>Pros and cons</strong>: the radical ordering works everywhere, as long as you can read the written characters; the pronunciation ordering only works in a particular spoken Chinese language. Since Mandarin is the largest spoken language (not in Hong Kong!), that's what dictionaries always use.</p>
<p><strong>BONUS</strong>. You may ask, how do you arrange all the characters under the same pronunciation (for example 思斯絲司私撕廝 or 顆科柯棵苛)? Or how do you arrange them under the same radical (確礦碳碼 or 開關問聞)? Heck, how do you arrange the radicals in the first place (亻宀忄口火馬鳥)? In this case, we use the number of strokes. Basically, it's the number of times you have to lift the tip of your pencil to write the character, according to a standard way of writing that everyone must learn in school. This save you some time, but there can still be dozens of characters with the same radical and the same number of strokes. Check out and play with the <a href="http://unicode.org/charts/unihanrsindex.html" target="_blank">radical-stroke index</a></p>
<p><strong>BONUS2</strong>. Your title is not entirely accurate. Chinese is a language family made up of a wide range of different regional languages that cannot understand each other when spoken. Mandarin is just the name of a spoken language. There is only ONE written language, so the same character can be pronounced differently but still understood by everyone. (Except Mainland China writes most characters a bit differently than Hong Kong and Taiwan. We won't get into that here.) Since dictionaries are about the written language, you should write &quot;Chinese&quot; instead of &quot;Mandarin&quot; in the title.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Chinese characters can be ordered in two different ways:
(1) Romanised pronunciation -&gt; tone number -&gt; number of strokes
(2) Number of strokes of radical -&gt; radical -&gt; number of remaining strokes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some dictionaries are organized by radicals.  Most Chinese characters are made up of smaller characters called radicals.  好 being 女 and 子. Since 女 is on the left, you would search by that using the number of stroke.  Once you find all the 女 entries, they're organized by number of extra strokes.  So 女 is three strokes and 子 is also three strokes, so you can look it up that way.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The appearance of a character and its pronunciation has less correlation than other writing systems, so in Chinese the following two are both possible: knowing a character but not its pronunciation, and knowing a pronunciation and meaning but not knowing how to write it.</p>
<p>For the pronunciation to character index, some dictionaries have that as an appendix. The harder problem is looking up a character based on appearance with no knowledge of its pronunciation.</p>
<p>Every Chinese character is written using one or more strokes, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_order" target="_blank">stroke order</a> is more or less predictable. Furthermore, most Chinese characters are composed of simpler characters. Some of the simpler characters are considered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radical_(Chinese_characters)" target="_blank">&quot;radicals&quot;</a>, which you can think of as a &quot;meta character&quot;. There is a fixed number of radicals. </p>
<ul>
<li>First there is an index of radicals, sorted by ascending stroke count, since radicals themselves are also characters.</li>
<li>Then all characters are sorted first by radicals (in the same order as the index), then by the remaining stroke count.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are irregularities that come with the radical system, so here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>語 (&quot;language&quot;) has a total of 14 strokes. Its radical 言 (&quot;speech&quot;) happens to occur on the left-hand side. 言 has 7 strokes, so first you look up 7, and find arrive at the page where all 7-stroke radicals are. Once you locate 言, it tells you which page to start for all the 言-radical characters. Once you flip to that page, there are 14 - 7 = 7 strokes remaining, so you keep flipping forward until you get to the 言-7 section, and that is where you will find 語 as well as any other 17-stroke whose radical is 言.</li>
<li>情 (&quot;emotion&quot;) has a total of 11 strokes. Its radical 心 (&quot;heart&quot;) also happens to occur on the left-hand side. The inconsistency is that in radical form, it is 3 strokes, but in isolated form, it is 4. A lot of radicals diverge between radical form and isolated form, e.g. 水 (&quot;water&quot;) is the isolated form and the left-hand side of 河 (&quot;river&quot;), 氵 is the radical form. For the purpose of looking up the radical 心 itself, you use 4. But for the purpose of calculating the remaining stroke count, you use 3, so 11 - 3 = 8. The character 情 can be found in the 心-8 section.</li>
<li>慶 (&quot;celebrate&quot;) has a total of 15 strokes. Its radical 心 (&quot;heart&quot;) is in the middle of the character. Not every character's radical is on the left-hand side! In this case the actual occurrence is in regular form, so 15 - 4 = 11, so 慶 is in the 心-11 section.</li>
<li>花 (&quot;flower&quot;) has a total of 8 strokes. Its radical 艸 (&quot;plant&quot;, &quot;grass&quot;) is on the top of the character, in the radical form of 艹 with 4 strokes. This is a double whammy! Not only is the radical not on the left, but the radical itself has two different forms just like 心 (&quot;heart&quot;). Where you would find 艸 is a more interesting question: some dictionaries say 艸 itself is 6 strokes, while some prefer saying 艹 is 4 strokes. They are the same radical in two different forms, so it's a matter of preference and standards. The character 花 can be found in the 艸-4 section.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>The radical can reside anywhere in the character, but the most common locations are on the left or on the top. The right or the middle are less common, but it can happen.</li>
<li>A radical may have two different forms. One is the isolated form, when you write the radical as its own character. The other is in radical form, when you write the radical as part of another character. Depending on how common the isolated form is, one may look more alien than another. For example the isolated form 水 (&quot;water&quot;) is just as common as its radical counterpart 氵, but you seldom see 艸 (&quot;plant&quot;, &quot;grass&quot;) other than in the context of radicals and the radical counterpart 艹 occurs much more frequently as part of other characters, e.g. 花 (&quot;flower&quot;), 草 (&quot;grass&quot;), 藝 (&quot;art&quot;).</li>
<li>How many strokes a radical has is trickier if it has two forms. The Taiwanese Ministry of Education, for example, prefers the stroke count of the radical form.</li>
<li>How many strokes a character has is less contested, but can happen. This is due to disagreement between whether a stroke is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_(CJKV_character)" target="_blank">simple or compound</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Going back to the two different problems whether you know the character's pronunciation: on a desktop computer it is very common to input a character's pronunciation and let the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_method" target="_blank">IME</a> automatically choose and / or let you select the right character. Other IMEs work by letting enter a series of radicals (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cangjie_input_method" target="_blank">Cangjie</a>) or straight up let you use a trackpad or touch surface to handwrite characters for recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to have to come at this from the other angle:</p>
<p>The reason that poor people tend to get screwed by the Legal System is because they are saddled with a Public Defender. </p>
<p>Public Defenders aren't bad Lawyers, they're usually <em>shockingly</em> competent at their jobs. <em>However</em>, due to their small numbers, Public Defenders are required to take on an <em>insane</em> number of cases. Public Defenders <em>usually</em> don't have much time to prepare for a case. Most can't afford to spend more than 15 minutes on a single case, and are <em>insanely lucky</em> if they can afford an hour of preparation for a single case. </p>
<p>It's virtually impossible to win a case without time to prepare. You need to research the relevant Laws, and <strong>all</strong> of the Case Law that is binding in your Jurisdiction. Then you need to review the Prosecution's Evidence, and get Evidence that was illegally acquired or questionable thrown out. You also need time to coach your client on how they should behave in court.</p>
<p>It's <em>physically impossible</em> to accomplish <strong>half</strong> of the preparations required in an hour, much less 15 minutes. As a result, most Public Defenders recommend that <em>most</em> of their Clients just take whatever plea-deal is offered by the Prosecution. It'll be a lighter punishment than they'd receive if they go to court and lose, and the odds of not losing are <em>basically zero</em>.</p>
<p>The exception to that <em>most</em> are clients who <em>can</em> realistically be defended. This generally means that the Case against the Client is full of holes to the point where the <em>Jury Members</em> would probably catch the procedural errors, or relies upon evidence that's <em>blatantly</em> inadmissible in court.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, Wealthy People can afford to hire a Private Lawyer. These Lawyers can control their case-load, ensuring that they have <strong>all</strong> the Preparation Time that they need. They can take their time, do their research, coach their client, and pick apart the Prosecution's case.</p>
<p>Even if the client is blatantly guilty, the Lawyer can actually hold the Court to the Letter of the Law regarding sentences... but this is going to require some explanation.</p>
<p>Most Judges in the United States, outside of the Federal Circuits, are <em>elected</em>. Because of our current culture, it's best for a Judge to maintain a public image of being &quot;Tough on Crime.&quot; If you pass down a relatively light sentence on someone, you can bet your ass that your Opponent in the next election will plaster it all over their campaign ads. As a result, Judges are incentivized to be as harsh as possible when it comes to sentencing.</p>
<p>This trickles up to the Federal Circuit as well. Federal Judges are generally drawn from State Judges, and getting promoted up in the Federal Circuits requires you to be Nominated to that position by the President of the United States. <em>Being</em> a Candidate for a Federal Bench (which you can hold for life) requires you to hold onto your State Bench. Moving up in the Federal Circuits requires the President to move you up... and the President has incentives to put Judges that are &quot;Tough on Crime&quot; onto the Federal Benches.</p>
<p>However, a Good Lawyer can hold a Judge's feet to the fire when it comes to sentencing. Excessive Sentences can be used as a justification for Appeals, and having your judgements <em>overturned</em> by a higher court hurts your chances for advancement <strong>even more</strong> than not being &quot;Tough on Crime.&quot; A State Judge up for re-election can spin not being &quot;Tough on Crime&quot; as being &quot;Merciful,&quot; but it's difficult to spin &quot;Incompetent Judge's Decision Overturned by Appellate Court&quot; into something vaguely positive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue is that the letter of the law allows more lenient sentences, or lesser charges, or other mechanisms that allow a person to receive a preferable sentence.  A good lawyer is better at convincing a prosector or judge or jury that those mechanisms should be used to the benefit of their client.  That's what makes them a good lawyer. </p>
<p>Additionally, rich and famous people often have options less well off people don't.  A prosecutor might be willing, for example, to let a famous person off with &quot;community service&quot; because they think kids will actually listen to them and not, say, do drugs if they go around telling people not to, something that wouldn't be true of your average accused. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For ground round, we would take straight peeled knuckles from the back hip area, and add in the same trimmings.  We would run 85/15 for chuck, and 80/20 for round.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My butcher does math and then uses a scale. </p>
<p>A bit of information on the process.  Our grocery store gets beef in two ways.  One is a tube of ground beef, the other is vacuum sealed primal cuts.  From your primals you get items like a sizzler steaks, rib steaks, spencer steaks, bottom round roasts, et cetera.  In order to get these from the primal, we use an item like a band saw or a knife to cut them into smaller parts than the slaughterhouse sends us.  During this process we'll trim fat and bone from the meat and put it in a big plastic bin.  Now we buy beef by the case, but that case's prize is set by it's weight, so trimming trims from our margins too.  Because we have a meat grinder, however, we can buy tubes of grinds at 83/17 instead of 80/20, and then just add the extra 2% in trim.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matter <em>can</em> actually be created spontaneously in our universe, but only if it is immediately destroyed. In all empty space, particle-antiparticle pairs are constantly forming, existing for a fraction of a fraction of a second (ridiculously small time scales), and then annihilating. Normally this is not an issue and doesn't violate conservation laws, as the particle pair is immediately destroyed, before it can interact with anything, and so the total energy of the system is still 0. We call such particles &quot;virtual particles&quot; because they don't (or shouldn't) exist. </p>
<p>Interestingly, these pairs are the reason for Hawking radiation - if a pair is produced on the edge of the event horizon if a black hole, then it is possible for one to fall into the black hole while the other escapes. This causes a problem - energy has been produced from nothing, and that just won't do. To rectify this, the universe determines that if the particle which escaped is made of positive energy, then to keep the energy of the system at 0, the particle which fell into the black hole must have had negative energy. Thus, the black hole loses mass, which escapes in the form of the newly created positive energy particle.</p>
<p>In some ways, it's possible to view the universe in a similar manner. Our universe could be made of <em>loaned energy</em>, which will one day disappear or be destroyed and hence return the overall system to 0 energy. This is a very basic view of some very complex ideas and it's very speculative, but I hope it helped you to understand one of the possibilities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The caveat here is, we really don't know what happened to 'start' the universe. It's not something we can test or observe, and it doesn't appear to be a repeatable process still occurring today. So we can't say the same laws applied to that process, nor can we come up with a definitive alternative, nor can we say that there weren't circumstances unique to that event that the law as-it-is-now doesn't take into account.</p>
<p>For instance, the law could be, more accurately, &quot;Energy cannot be created or destroyed except when a universe is jump starting&quot; and we just don't know it. It would still be consistent with our observations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's first of a caveat that energy conservation probably does not apply on a cosmological scale. </p>
<p>But aside from that, there's a simple classical physics notion that might help. That idea is that there is no absolute scale for energy in classical physics. Let's take the example of a roller coaster, where you probably remember that the total energy of the system is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy: E = KE + PE. As the roller coaster descends from the top of the hill, the potential energy PE decreases, and the kinetic energy KE increases, but the total stays the same the whole trip. Customarily, one says the PE is zero at the bottom of the hill and positive at the top of the hill. But the kicker is that you could also say that the PE is zero at the top of the hill and negative at the bottom of the hill, and the physics of the situation is exactly the same. The only difference between these two choices is a shift in the overall value of the total energy E. This tells you that the physics doesn't depend on the total value of E, only the <em>changes</em> in PE and KE that happen while stuff goes on.</p>
<p>In a very rough sense, you could say the same thing about the big bang. You could suppose that prior to expansion there was a state that was all potential energy, and then there was a change in that state that converted it into other forms of available energy, which created the universe. Well, how much was the original PE to begin with? It doesn't <em>matter</em> because the only thing that counts is the exchange of that PE to other forms of energy.</p>
<p>This is so ELI5 that people might complain about its accuracy, but hopefully this gives some idea why it may not matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>black holes must be significantly heavier than the Planck mass M_P, which is about 22 μg. Anything quite heavier can form a (extremely short-lived unless it is really heavy) black hole, while anything quite lighter cannot. So yes, poppy seed is good, <em>E. coli</em> bacterium doesn't work.</p>
<p>Imagine you have an object lighter than M_P and you're trying to compress it to inside its Schwarzschild radius, which is smaller than the Planck length l_P. In fact, ignoring some pesky numerical factors, you have the formula</p>
<p>M / M_P ~ R / l_P</p>
<p>where R is the Schwarzschild radius of the mass M, the radius in which you'd have to compress M to make it a black hole. Since at the length scale of l_P smooth classical spacetime stops existing to give way to a quantum foam, for R to be smaller than l_P sounds already fishy. </p>
<p>But you try anyway. What you find is that well before your compressing mass even reaches the Planck length, in compressing it you have already given it a lot of energy, which increases its mass (through E = Mc^(2)). In the end, it turns out you have made it into a black hole with M &gt;&gt; M_P and R &gt;&gt; l_P. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yes, but it would blow up immediately.</p>
<p>Black holes emit Hawking radiation. The smaller the hole, the stronger the radiation, which makes the hole even smaller, which makes the radiation even stronger... repeat until KABOOM.</p>
<p>A poppy seed is pretty much at the size (I mean mass) where it goes kaboom in an instant. The energy equivalent of the mass of a poppy seed is a small tactical nuke. Do not try this at home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a scientist! So let me try to offer my insight:</p>
<p>So first of all, like every other job in the world, scientists need money in order to work on their projects/research. Unlike &quot;regular&quot; companies though, scientists don't really <em>sell</em> anything, so it's going to be hard to go to Wells Fargo and ask for money without being able to show them how you plan on paying them back.</p>
<p>Enter organizations like the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), NASA, the European Commission, and the list goes on. These organizations have many purposes, and one of them is to allocate researching funding to promising projects. What they'll do is, for example, put out a &quot;call for proposals&quot; and then allow scientists to apply for funding. For example, the NSF might put out a call for proposal on the subject of say &quot;childhood education.&quot;</p>
<p>So you're a scientist doing research in &quot;teenage education.&quot; You have a lot of experience on research in education in teenagers, and you think that you might be able to apply your work to education in children as well. You just don't have the time, or money, or staff, to actually do it. But now that there's this call for proposal, it's your chance! So you write a grant proposal which basically outlines what you are going to do, how you are going to do it, why you are going to do it, and a lot of other things are involved. Will your project involve any ethical considerations? You'll need to include documentation showing how you will follow ethical approvals, for example. You'll also need to submit some kind of budget guidelines. If you are requesting $500,000, how will this be used? $500,000 sounds like a lot, but in terms of research it's not really. The NSF might award you the grant for $500,000, but you need to keep in mind that this money is for the duration of the project. Do you need equipment (you will)? Do you need lab space (you do)? Do you need to hire new staff (you might)? New staff could be other researchers or grad students to help you. They need to get paid, after all, and so do you.</p>
<p>In the end: my point is: we <strong>need</strong> money just like everybody else. But unlike Boeing, and unlike Intel, and unlike Apple, or Google, etc... the money that I am asking for to do my project, actually has no promise of monetary return to my investors.</p>
<p>What I promise to return to the NSF, or to NASA, etc, is the promise of advancement in research. I do this by using the money to conduct experiments, and then publishing papers about it or giving talks at conferences. From the journal articles, other scientists will be able to follow my findings and either use it or try to test it etc and build upon their own research. From the conferences, I show things that are essentially &quot;works in progress&quot; but hey, maybe my idea is exactly what someone else was missing, and if they see me talk about it, they might come find me later on (or email) asking to collaborate. These are things that we <em>all</em> benefit from (we as in scientists), and these are essentially the &quot;returns&quot; that I promise to the NSF when I write my proposals.</p>
<p>When I publish or talk at conferences, I am talking to my peers. I am talking to colleagues. I am talking to scientists. When I talk to my peers, I would never make claims like &quot;this line of research can, <strong>will</strong>, definitely improve childhood education by 500%!&quot;</p>
<p>When I talk to my peers I am trying to discuss my work.</p>
<p>But when I am talking to media (be it the press, a TV program/interview, Twitter, my personal website/blog, message boards, or my university's press office, or hell, even my own non-scientist friends and family), I am not trying to discuss my work. <strong>I am trying to sell my work.</strong> I want to sell my work because, like I said, my work is entirely based on receiving money. Without money, there is no research, period. So I might exaggerate a tiny bit, or trump up all the benefits of what I'm doing and then throw in a very minute detail about how those gains are the theoretical maximum assuming that all the planets are aligned. I'm not really lying about anything, I'm just giving a, perhaps very, optimistic view of my research.</p>
<p>(After that, the journalists usually run off with it, and replace words like &quot;could maybe&quot; or &quot;might possibly&quot; into &quot;will definitely&quot; and so on.)</p>
<p>When I apply for funding, I like to think that the system is merit based, as in they'll review my track record and past research and so on. In general this is more or less true. So I'm not actually trying to sell my work to these agencies like NSF etc. Who I'm trying to sell to is to both the tax paying public and to the politicians in charge of appropriating money to the NSF. Since I am not making anything, or selling anything, I need to convince the public that their tax dollars are being used in a productive and/or beneficial manner. I need to convince the politicians not to defund the NSF, because I need that money to do my research. I need to convince the public that my work is crucial, vital even, so that they might complain loudly when a politician decides that they want to cut funding to the NSF.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond what people are writing about the huge investment these things take, the truth is often that these &quot;discoveries&quot; are nonsense.</p>
<p>For example, often you will hear a story about a &quot;miracle cure&quot; for such and such. But if you look deeper, the story is reporting on a lab experiment testing the drug in cells in vitro which may have a novel or promising mechanism of action...but that's a far cry from repeating its success in other studies, much less animals and much less demonstrating effectiveness in treating human diseases. While that does take years and some of these drugs are ultimately successful, the vast majority are abandoned down the pipeline because they aren't as effective as was hoped.</p>
<p>You see another version of this with claims about &quot;new drug treats so and so with virtually no side effects.&quot; That may be true in clinical trials when its given to a limited number of people...but once the drug hits the market, who gets it? Many many more people. Elderly. Children. Pregnant women. People of various ethnicities, not to mention just many more people with varying genetics. Everything has side effects and some of them are pretty darned serious.</p>
<p>You'll see articles about cures for cancer that are developed. But the stories are misleading because they are really talking about preliminary success in developing a new strategy to target one specific type of cancer. Even if it passes muster throughout its years of development its impact is going to be pretty limited. You'll probably never know of its usage unless you or someone you know eventually comes down with that specific disease.</p>
<p>For example, researchers in Glasgow and Hong Kong last year discovered that injecting a protein into mice brains could reduce amyloid plaques. That's important work. It's all well and good. But doctors aren't sure that amyloid plaques cause Alzheimer's or are just another symptom of the disease. In the unlikely event we find a way to increase the expression of this protein in human brains and in the unlikely event it removes 100% of amyloid plaques, it might turn out to have 0% effect on curing Alzheimer's...and it will be years before we find that out.</p>
<p>These stories are amazing because the media wants you to read their website so they publish interesting yet mundane stories in an overly sensational way.</p>
<p>EDIT: I did not mean the discoveries themselves were nonsense. I meant the media is overdrawing the conclusions of preliminary evidence to nonsensical levels. Should have phrased more carefully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was a 'journo' I'd use sources like <a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/" target="_blank">http://www.eurekalert.org/</a> to find nice stories that I could rewrite so they were unique and then promote them on social media sites.</p>
<p>Eurekalert is already Buzzfeedy in its headlines, and you can tell when you read a little deeper into the article that the research was not as groundbreaking as the headline makes it appear. It might be a mouse model, it might be just a survey of 2000 people, it might be a study involving 20 people. </p>
<p>Then when I wrote it up, I would purposefully try to avoid anything that highlighted how meaningless the study was, and I'd try to write something even more Buzzfeedy than the actual article. AIDS cure 'around the corner', 'Study: AIDS can be cured by bananas'. If I put some of the headline in 'snatch quotes', i.e. apostrophes, or put a colon indicating that someone had said something, i.e. 'Cameron: Fuck Daesh', then I would have covered my ass from misrepresenting the topic, provided I didn't totally misrepresent it.</p>
<p>And I was churning out 5,000 words a day, often researching and spinning a 200-word article in 20 minutes. I would honestly just skimread the original source, I'd only actually read it to fully understand it if I was personally interested in the research. Furthermore, my understanding of complicated science is nowhere near good enough to be able to criticise a scientific study, all I'd do is 'spin' it. Churnalism, it's called.</p>
<p>Shockingly, one of my skills is being able to push things to the top of Google search results. Quite often, when writing something more meaty, my research would be reading whatever was at the top of Google search results, which I know full well is written by someone who's just as big a moron as me and who's just as pressed for time as me.</p>
<p>tldr, the internet is a tapestry of bullshit.</p>
<p>....</p>
<p>Here's an example, in fact if I was spending 20 minutes on 200 words I would've spent 5 of them on Facebook.</p>

<p>See it's all full of confusing stuff but I might think 'this is the kind of thing people will read'. This doesn't comply with all the rules of news writing but it's pretty close:</p>
<p>Could e-cigarette users face a higher cancer risk than smokers?</p>
<p>Alternatives to tobacco, such as e-cigarettes, have become increasingly popular in recent years, and are much-touted for their health benefits.</p>
<p>However, a new study, which found that smokeless tobacco users have higher levels of carcinogens than smokers, could end any claims that alternatives to cigarettes are better for you than cigarettes themselves.</p>
<p>The research, which was published in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research, found people who use smokeless tobacco have higher levels of tobacco constituents cotinine, NNAL and other deadly toxins than people who exclusively smoked cigarettes.</p>
<p>Brian Rostron, PhD, an epidemiologist in the Center for Tobacco Products at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, said that these biomarkers show that smokeless tobacco users face &quot;adverse health effects, including cancer&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Our findings demonstrate the need for continuing study of the toxic constituents of smokeless tobacco as well as their health effects on the individuals who use them,&quot; he added.</p>
<p>As well as e-cigarettes, other popular nicotine-replacement devices include snus, snuff and chewing tobacco.</p>
<p>PS it's all bullshit man, the study's about smokeless tobacco products, and I strongly assume that this means snuff and snus and chewing tobacco and that ecigs don't even count. But nobody's gonna sue me and it's the kinda thing people would share.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is huge amounts of misreporting in the media of scientific results. Media outlets are interested in sensation and views - actual medical research is incredibly dense, technical and therefore boring to many people. </p>
<p>For example, you often hear about cures for cancer. The problem is that cancers are incredibly complex with a vast variety among them. There maybe thousands of tiny molecules, each with a name and chemical formula, that researchers are studying. The 'breakthrough' may be showing that one of those compounds is elevated in x disease. What actually needs to occur for a real life change? They need to then figure out the causal relationships - I.e. Is the compound elevated as a cause of the disease? Or is it as a result of the disease? If we lower it, does the disease get better? Or is it useful as a marker of disease? If so, how can we measure it in people? Can we use a medicine to improve it?
Once there's finally a possible therapy, it's tested in animals and people and that takes forever. You also often hear about the successes but not the scientific failures (there are more failures than successes).</p>
<p>Other researchers then painstakingly research other compounds, using different methodologies, all in hope of very very slowly piecing together a coherent picture in order to achieve therapy. So basically, medical and scientific research more generally, is akin to carving away a wall with a spoon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>At least in the field of medicine, all new methods of treatment must be &quot;evidence based&quot; meaning someone has to take that new thing and compare it to the one currently available. As an example, comparing the how well the $5 epipen works against a typical $30 one. </p>
<p>For this reply, let's ASSUME the $5 epipen actually works and isn't a sham.</p>
<p>This process is called a &quot;Clinical Trial&quot; and often costs millions of dollars because you need to recruit hundreds, if not thousands, of people to use your $5 epipen or the $30 epipen and check back for results and such. This often requires hundreds of staff members, facilities, tools, and even the pens themselves, and if I'm not wrong, not many high-school students or even adults have millions of dollars they can invest into this process.</p>
<p>It's the same for the new omega antibiotic, cure for cancer, or protein to cure Alzheimer's Disease. Regardless of whether it works or not, in order for it to be regularly used, it takes years of work and lots of money, which is why these &quot;amazing discoveries&quot; are rarely followed-up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your brain wants you to do something, it releases <strong>dopamine</strong> to force you to do it. The more dopamine your brain releases, the more you feel compelled to do whatever it is your brain wants you to do.</p>
<p>In other words, dopamine is your brain's &quot;gotta have it&quot; chemical. It is what makes you crave things to varying degrees. And the more dopamine your brain is outputting, the more uneasy and uncomfortable you feel until you act on its urges.</p>
<p>Then when you finally complete that task that dopamine has forced you to act on... and you've gotten whatever &quot;prize&quot; was waiting at the end of that task... your brain releases a rush of <strong>serotonin</strong> to match the dopamine it just outputted.</p>
<p>Serotonin is your brain's &quot;got it&quot; chemical, shutting off the fountain of dopamine that was compelling you to seek out whatever you wanted.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, the <strong>brief combination of high dopamine and high serotonin in your brain</strong> acts as a reward mechanism. It gives you a feeling of immense pleasure.</p>
<p>It's nature's way of rewarding you for taking a specific behavior.</p>
<p>Think about a time when you were a little hungry... then really hungry... then completely starved. It was dopamine being released in varying quantities in your brain that caused to feel those growing levels of hunger.</p>
<p>And think about how relieving it felt when you finally ate. You likely gorged yourself and you felt INCREDIBLE. That was the combo of high dopamine and high serotonin in your brain.</p>
<p>You experience the same thing when you build up the nerve to ask a girl out... and then she says yes. Or when you go on a long run and then make it home, safe and sound. And when you jump out of an airplane (followed by landing safely on the ground). And when you watch scary movies (then go back to &quot;safe&quot; reality).</p>
<p>It's all dopamine making you feel uneasy (escape! eat that food! make it to safety! get out of this awful situation!)... followed by serotonin when you'd achieved your mission... followed by pure unadulterated bliss in the brief moment when your brain was flooded with both chemicals at once.</p>
<p>Long story short, <strong>nicotine &quot;artificially&quot; creates this rush of serotonin in your brain</strong>. So if you're stressed (i.e. you have extremely high dopamine levels from something being incomplete or scary in your life), cigarettes temporarily create the surge of serotonin that turns off dopamine -- and leaves you feeling extreme pleasure.</p>
<p>But, since they're not <em>actually</em> solving the issues causing high dopamine for you, the dopamine just comes back... but eventually comes back at higher, and higher, and higher levels. It acclimates to your &quot;artificial&quot; serotonin source.</p>
<p>So the pleasure and calm you get from cigarettes (and their &quot;artificial&quot; serotonin hit) increases with time -- but your addiction (and stress) also grows.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to see what part of the nervous system it stimulates. There's sympathetic (which is fight or flight) and parasympathetic (which is rest and relax). It stimulates the parasympathetic part which gives the relaxing effect. Apart from that it increases blood flow leading to more blood to the brain making you more alert and focused. Hence why people smoke when they are anxious, to be more focused and calm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I started taking Wellbutrin for depression a while ago and the doctor told me that one of the side effects is that it could severely curtail your desire to smoke. He said that Wellbutrin was developed years ago to help people quit smoking but they also found that it could help people with depression, so that became the primary focus of the drug - I still smoked for several months before I decided to quit, but it was like forcing myself to smoke because I lost the desire to do it, the drug is so strong and so good at stopping the urge to smoke (at least for me it was) - In January, 2016 I stopped smoking after over 40 years (and many frustrating years of trying to stop on my own) and I have not had any urge at all to smoke since then and I am very grateful - I feel fantastic now just like everybody said I would. Quitting smoking completely changed my life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of crazy unsubstantiated nonsense posted so far. This is complicated so I'll try to give you a thorough yet layman explanation. Nicotine has different affinities for receptors in the brain versus the peripheral nervous system. It also does not bind all nicotinic receptors equally. What the result of this is: is that nicotine produces both a sympathetic type of effect, due to the actions of epinephrine, norepinephrine, and glucose released from liver, and also parasympathetic type actions that improve cognition and decrease stress through the actions in the central nervous system, chief among these being the release of dopamine.</p>
<p>In a nutshell it puts your body in fight or flight Mode, while putting your brain in a relaxed state that is better suited to cognition. There is also a weird pharmacokinetic property that the stimulant versus sedative effects reverse based on the level of nicotine in your blood. At a low concentration in your blood it will act as a stimulant, but at a high concentration like a sedative. This effect plays out not only due to the amount of nicotine ingested, but also the distribution of nicotine throughout your different body fluid compartments due to their varying permeability to the molecule.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nicotine acts on different receptors in the brain than the stimulants you're probably thinking of. A chemical's effect on the body can't be adequately explained in one word such as &quot;stimulant&quot; so you're bound to get nuanced effects that require greater understanding to differentiate rather than lumping everything into one category</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>your blood sugar has dropped enough to cause a mild case of hypoglycemia, which can be associated with nausea, shakiness, lightheadedness</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is a huge relief. My doctor also recommended a high protein diet especially first thing in the morning to get longer lasting stability. Mine is caused by the way my celiac's affects my hormones and endocrine system. Took a while to figure it out, but finally found a doc that focuses on auto immune diseases and how they interact with the endocrine system. Helped me so much to try to manage it, but it is still a constant battle to stabilize since hormones are so variable throughout the month. My hypoglycemia is much worse during ovulation and my period. Realized this after my doc made me track symptoms on a period tracker app. Connected the dots after that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
