		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many 'caves' that have no opening to the outside will likely be filled with hostile gasses from hydrogen sulfide near fossil fuel areas like the Permian Basin, or just regular carbon dioxide, so they would be fatal to visit simply because they can't exchange air with the atmosphere. These caves wouldn't have the stalactites and stalagmites as that also requires outside air for the CO2 to degas from the water droplets so they can drop their mineral content. These voids are basically toxic spaces, but there is no way to know how many there are. Some are quite deep too, like 1,000 feet below the surface. Carlsbad Caverns, for instance, has 5 main floors. They all formed with no connection to the surface until the uplift of the Guadalupe Mtns about 8-10 million years ago lifted the gypsum filled voids out of the acidic water table. Once the entrance collapsed in, air could exchange and the scenic formations began to grow, the bats moved in, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It turns out that public records are pretty extensive if you have the resources to automatically collect them. When I received my report, it had 2 lawsuits on it where I was the plaintiff in a very large and populous county, but it didnâ€™t have the 1 lawsuit I had as a plaintiff in a very small county. Thereâ€™s an easy to navigate website in order to access the court records for the big county but no way to do it online for the small one. This is where land, criminal, lawsuit, etc. information on the report comes from.</p>
<p>Insurance companies tend to report information in order to use the companyâ€™s reports when a new customer wants to join them. You should be able to see insurance information going back years.</p>
<p>Credit reporting bureaus are responsible for another big chunk of information and this is usually the most important. Credit card companies and places that loan out money will report your address to a credit reporting bureau. Those bureaus will then report that information to Lexis Nexis. Former addresses, collection accounts, credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, etc. all come from a credit reporting bureau. You can see whatâ€™s on your credit reports immediately by using <a href="http://annualcreditreport.com" target="_blank">AnnualCreditReport.com</a> If you want to dig even deeper, you can see whatâ€™s on your credit report, get your credit score, and get emailed when something shows up on your credit <a href="http://moneyographyadvanced.net/review-of-credit-sesame" target="_blank">through other free sites</a></p>
<p>There is some cross checking between all of the information sources such as matching up your insurance information to a car loan or getting your addresses from more than one place. Other information, such as where you went to college, comes directly from the schoolâ€™s bursarâ€™s office, or through the American Student List.
Lexis Nexis itself appears to work mostly as a compiler of information and either sells that information, or trades it for more information, making their reports more valuable.</p>
<p>What can you do to stay out of it? Not much. Opting-out on the Lexis Nexis website isnâ€™t an option unless there is a genuine danger if a 3rd party knew where you live (crazy stalker ex, etc.).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's not technically illegal for giant tech companies to &quot;digitally spy&quot; on their software users... Example - If you are continuously visiting amazon and buying dresses or shopping online for women's clothing - you're most likely a woman... If you're buying kid's clothes, you're most likely a mother... If you're on dating sites, you're most likely single... Microsoft or large tech companies can easily bypass &quot;identity laws&quot; and based on your internet history and browsing history digitally &quot;guesstimate&quot; your age, race and sex in just a few days, weeks of monitoring your traffic. One allows this when you use their browsers, use Office, use their OS, etc. 2.) Companies are also sleazy and often don't care about your privacy - they sell your info and detailed personal info to these companies and their affiliates. I claimed bankruptcy last year and for the next 6 months of filing received 100+ offers for cheap car loans and bad credit lendors offering car loans from local dealerships (had a car and was not looking at all)...

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea of psychopathy was popular in the 40s and50s as a diagnosis for people exhibiting a certain set of personality traits. Hervey Cleckley described a psychopath as someone who was a master deceiver, manipulator, etc. yet was able to function relatively normally in society, hence the title of his 1941 book, The Mask of Sanity. By his definition, you either were or you weren't. There were a series of traits one had to meet to earn the diagnosis which can be found with a little googling. </p>
<p>Psychopathy is not a current psychological diagnoses however, and has not been for a number of years. The concept of a psychopath is primarily perpetuated by the media, but holds no real weight in the psychological community as the pertinent symptoms refer to a family mental illnesses called externalizing disorders. Nobody has been diagnosed as a psychopath in many years. This is not to say that these traits are not present in individuals today, rather that more specific acute diagnoses can be made now. The mental illness that most closely resembles psychopathy in the current DSM is anti-social personality disorder. This is also a have it or you don't disordee, but different diagnoses exist for people displaying varying dehrees of anti-social behaviors</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UK Clinical Psychologist specialising in Personality Disorders here.
Great question! I think this might be simplified by offering a bit of context. The term &quot;psychopathy&quot;, unlike many others in psychological and psychiatric research, does not have an agreed-upon definition. It is probably simplest to broadly divide its use into two main areas - (1) clinical psychology and psychiatry, in which it has a chequered history as a diagnostic label and (2) non-clinical psychology research (perhaps most prominently criminology) in which it has an equally controversial history as a personality trait, dimension or characteristic.
In (1) - the clinical field - others on here have rightly pointed out that psychopathy was never fully accepted by the medical establishment as a valid diagnostic category. The so-called &quot;bible&quot; of psychiatry the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM, currently in its fifth edition) has never recommended psychopathy as a diagnosis to be dished out in real life work, and has instead created a category called Antisocial Personality Disorder. Antisocial PD is not, however identical to psychopathy because it is slightly more focused on identifying people with a propensity for criminal behaviour. In the case of (1), psychopathy (which an alternative to the DSM called the International Classification of Diseases or ICD, currently in its tenth edition, allows as an alternative name for Antisocial PD) is thought mostly of as a categorical thing - you either get the diagnosis of Antisocial PD or you don't.
Meanwhile in (2), researchers have busily been examining psychopathy as a personality dimension, of which we all might have a certain degree. Most famously, Robert Hare created a measure called the Hare Psychopathy Checklist, which became the basis for the pop psychology book &quot;The Psychopath Test&quot; by Jon Ronson. Another pop book worth a read for entertainment value is &quot;The Wisdom of Psychopaths&quot;, by the Cambridge University psychologist Kevin Dutton. He very much encourages us all to examine the degree to which we all have psychopathic traits - an ability in particular to stay calm under pressure and act decisively for example - which he points out can be a very helpful thing if you're a surgeon or special forces soldier for example.
When it comes to your papers, I would suggest that the best approach is to bear all this context in mind and look closely at what the authors mean exactly by &quot;psychopath&quot;. How have they measured or &quot;operationalised&quot; the concept? It may be that drawing on the history of (1), they are talking about people who have been diagnosed by psychiatrists with a mental illness. In this case, there is plenty to argue with and debate. More likely, they might be talking about people who exceed a cutoff or threshold on one of the popular inventories from (2), such as the Hare checklist. In this case, there is also a lot to argue with! Spectrums versus categories is a crucial debate in a lot of psychological fields and it sounds like you're on the right track with your thinking. Good luck!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Honestly it depends on what you mean by psychopath. The popular culture definition and the clinical definition have some similarities but are largely different. </p>
<p>With the advent of the diagnostic and statistical manual 5 there is no more psychopath or sociopath (never studied version 4 so not sure if it's in there). There may however be a coding in the ICD 10 ( an international coding and diagnostic tool). Now what we know as a psychopath or sociopath is referred to as &quot;anti social personality disorder&quot;.</p>
<p>From the clinical perception a person would not be diagnosed as &quot;slightly&quot; or &quot;sort of&quot; having anti social personality disorder. On a general basis any diagnosis is that you have it or you don't, with some exceptions for autism spectrum disorder. There are some major exceptions to this though.</p>
<p>The first exception is specific to personality disorders. The practitioners and instructors that I interact with often refer to people having &quot;traits&quot; or &quot;tendencies&quot;. Now I haven't come across any examples of this in research, it just seems to be widely accepted shorthand in my geographical area. Basically what they are saying is that the person has some key behaviors that coincide with a specific diagnosis yet they don't meet the full criteria of diagnosis. For instance when we are watching a case video in class they will often comment with &quot;client seems to have certain borderline traits with a primary diagnosis of disruptive mood disregulation disorder&quot; or something similar.</p>
<p>The second exception is how the DSM 5 functions. For certain disorders you can and sometimes are required to affix certain verbiage to a diagnosis. These &quot;specifiers&quot; can be subclasses of symptoms or severity. While a diagnosis for anti social personality disorder does not require this a clinician could still specify the severity as mild, moderate or severe. Severity specifiers are based out of how many criteria the patient meets beyond the bare minimum and to what extent the patients life is impacted negatively.</p>
<p>The last exception to the &quot;either you have it or you don't&quot; functionality is what they call &quot;unspecified personality disorder&quot;. This basically means that their is definitely a problem but the clinician would have to shoe horn in a diagnosis. So a therapist could see a client has some diagnostic criteria for anti social personality disorder but dosnt meet all the requirements.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in the back of the DSM 5 it shows a new model that's not implemented yet for diagnosing personality disorders. My personal opinion is that it looks a lot like they will be moving to a spectrum approach for personality disorders.</p>
<p>TLDR: the answer is yes and no. All human behavior can be looked at on a spectrum but diagnosis is a little trickier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with energy and electrons. The electrons in the material (eg. glass) can only have certain energy levels. If one of them can be at say 1, 1.3, and 2 (ignoring units here for a second), nothing that would bump it to an energy of say 1.6 or 3 would be allowed to happen.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with light? I'm glad you asked. Light in a material is absorbed by the electrons in the material. However much energy the photon of light had is used to raise the electron's energy by that exact amount. The amount of energy a photon has is dictated by its wavelength. Blue light has more energy than red light, ultraviolet has even more.</p>
<p>Glass can't absorb visible light because the electrons in glass have an energy gap larger than the energy of light in the visible spectrum, so the electrons aren't able to interact with it. Higher energy light (like ultraviolet) will be absorbed because it can match the energy needed for the electrons to jump up a level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absorption of light in a material typically relies on exciting elections in the material to higher energy states.  For a material to be transparent there must be a lack of availability of allowable energy states to transition to.   A material like glass has a large band gap between allowed energy levels so visible light is not absorbed.   </p>
<p>Light can also be scattered in a material at impurities and interfaces.  To prevent scattering a material should be essentially homogenous down to a scale comporable to the wavelength of the light.   Water and glass are both very homogenous in consistency.  Even though they do not have a perfect crystal structure (one is liquid and one is an amorphous solid) they have a consistent density and composition.  Milk on the other hand is a solution of small particles suspended in water, so is nonuniform on the necessary length scale.  Likewise glass which is broken and ground into a powder will lose much of its transparency and appear white due to increased reflectance.</p>
<p>Colorful materials typically contain dye molecules or atoms with discrete allowed energy levels.  This allows more selective absorption of specific colors of light.  Most of the energy from the absorbed light is lost as heat, but some materials are able to reemit specific colors of light by fluorescence.  A combination of these absorption and scattering effects produce the visual properties of the materials we are familiar with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have answered this question well on the specifics but I'd like to point out that light can pass through &quot;opaque&quot; matter. It all comes down to the intensity of light (or radiation in general) and the thickness and type of matter. You can try this at home:</p>
<p>Use a flash light (the more powerful the better) in a preferably dark room. Push it against your arm and you probably don't see any light trough. Then push it against your hand and you should see light shining through. If it doesn't work use a smaller and smaller stack of paper instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers in this thread are talking about absorption, but they really are missing half of the problem. The most important half imo. </p>
<p>Some materials absord more than others
because they have transition between energy levels that correspond to the energy of a photon. True. But that really doesn't explain why you can see through a cloud, water is transparent, air is transparent, yet a cloud isn't. </p>
<p>The reason you can't see through a cloud, and actually through most non-metallic materials, is diffusion. The light scatter (or bounce) on the inhomogeneities of the matterial like the droplets in a cloud. This forces the light to stay within the material for a long time, long enough for the light to be absorded even if the material doesn't absorb much. </p>
<p>This is also why you can see through most cristals even if they do absorb a lot. They don't have much inhomogeneities, the light goes straight through. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The feeling of numbness and tingling you get is called paresthesia, and it can be caused by many things that involve both the central nervous system (Brain, brainstem and the spinal cord) and peripheral nervous system (The sensory and motor neurons carrying information to and from your muscles, skin and pretty much your whole body). In this case the paresthesia is caused by deprivation of blood supply to the peripheral nerves. Peripheral sensory and motor nerves are supplied by small vessels called Vasa nervorum. These small vessels are particularly susceptible to mechanical pressure. When a certain amount of pressure is applied for a prolonged period of time, blood flow to the peripheral nerve they supply is compromised. Nerves require a constant source of oxygen to carry on oxidative phosphorylation and produce the energy that is required for creating action potentials (impulses that travel down the nerve cell). When you cut the required oxygen off, the nerve cells cease to function until circulation is returned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Teeth actually do work to heal themselves.  In the center of the tooth there are cells that try to protect the pulp, live tissue, from the material that cause cavities.  </p>
<p>The teeth are fromed in two directions at the same time.  From the middle to the outside, which is the enamel, and from the middle to the inside, which is the dentin.  Once the outside is formed the tooth begins to erupt. Once it erupts there are no longer any cells to form the crystaline structure of enamel. </p>
<p>The saliva does have healing properties, and can help with minor repairs, or remineralization.  </p>
<p>Cavities occur because our mouths are hosts to millions of bacteria. Since bacteria are alive, and everything that lives eats, they have to eat something.  But what? The bacteria eat whatever we eat; the remnants of food left on the teeth.  And since everything that eats poops, the bacteria eliminate their waste, poop, on our teeth.  The bacterial waste is an acid.  Since acids desolve things, the acids desolve the enamel and dentin of the teeth. </p>
<p>The chemical nature of the enamel's crystaline structure makes it susseptible to the acids.  Interestingly enough, the fluoride in tooth paste, and drinking water replaces a chemical group of the enamel and make the teeth more resistant to the bacterial acids. </p>
<p>And that is why, once a tooth has erupted, it cannot fix itself, and how a cavity is made. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some parts of your teeth can and do heal themselves, just slowly. </p>
<p>The greatest part your teeth are made up of dentine, which can in fact heal and regenerate over time. like bone, it can resorb and be re-laid, but to a much lesser extent, and unlike bone (which is dynamic and remodelled constantly), it only occurs after significant trauma. The layer covering the roots of your teeth, called cementum, can heal in a similar manner. </p>
<p>Enamel, the layer covering the visible portion (crown) of your teeth, doesnt really regenerate in this manner though. I suppose because it's in the outside, not in contact with the cells/blood supply that can do the repairing....I think it can absorb some minerals from saliva though? </p>
<p>There's a limit to how much/how quickly that regeneration can happen, so for larger chips you might need to fix them, but for small fractures on the roots of your teeth, it can be enough to stabilise the injury so it heals on its own (kind of like having a cast for a bone)</p>
<p>(Got most of this from my sister who is a dentist, I can ask her to double check later ...if you have any questions I'm sure she'd be happy to explain and I can pass the answers along)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The entire tube that is your GI tract has smooth muscle around it from your esophagus all the way to your anus. Once food gets into your intestines (large or small) there is something known as peristalsis (this happens elsewhere too, but let's focus on just the intestines). Wikipedia has a great <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/Peristalsis.gif" target="_blank">simplified image</a> of what it looks like.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Peristalsis. There are different layers of epithelium and muscles in our large intestinal wall and the two particular layers are the longitudinal and circular muscle. Within them there are two different neuron plexus: submucosal and myenteric plexus, one help with secretion and one help with movement.
When the food bolus/chyme reaches your large intestine, that mechanical triggering (having food brush up your LI) the neuronal plexus to send signals your brain and your GI, the brain and your GI then tells your muscles to move. Brain: PNS, GI: ENS (That itself is a whole another lecture)
Remember the two layer of muscles I talked about (longitudinal and circular)? Circular muscle is closer to the bolus than longitudinal muscle (don't forget they're layers). So Circular muscle contract and longitudinal relaxes to push the food forward near the oral surface while circular relaxes and longitudinal contract to hold the LI open on the aboral side. It is through these that generate the peristalsis movement which propel the food forward!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your GI tract has a nervous system all of its own! It probably predates the enlarged ganglion we call a &quot;brain&quot; by a considerable period of geologic time. Stuff that is ingested is pushed along the tube within your middle from mouth to anus by a neural plexus and ganglia that rhythmically squeeze the contents in a pattern that moves things along from mouth to anus. You are not aware of this process unless something goes wrong, we call it &quot;autonomic&quot; but it is independent of the 'brain' and predates the brain in an evolutionary sense. Some unfortunate persons have a GI tract that does not perform the action of peristalsis normally, and they will suffer from symptoms that vary from mild to fatal. </p>
<p>So bow down to the ancient gut nervous system, it serves you every time you eat or drink and expect to get a benefit from that action -- but if it is nonfunctional in some way, may the Lord have Mercy upon your suffering soul!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually not determinations, but rather predictions based on environment. </p>
<p>Everything on a planetary scale is very hard to judge. Since the objects are so small and doesn't have the aspects of stars. For example, we can easily predict a stats temperature based on luminosity and how it falls on the heat spectrum. Although, this isn't anything you can do over a night. But rather daily observations.</p>
<p>So now back to your question. Planets have different perks based on their conditions. Which can help to predict the climate. Also if you observe the host star you can also estimate distance and size based on passages. Because planetary passages block some of the sunlight, making the frequency unnatural. Larger planets have a larger passage when they pass in front of their stars compared to smaller ones. Not only that but the frequency of passages makes estimates for size and distance.</p>
<p>Now we let's touch on the atmosphere. Which works like a konvex lens and have properties for estimations. Which indicates what the planet can contain in terms of materia. And could show wind speed.</p>
<p>In concussion. It's estimations based on raw data and analysis. Some of the predictions are based on concussions drawn from the findings of coincidental factors based on our own solar system. But at the end of the day that's the best you can do with out current technology.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might be interested in asking this on /r/askscience for a slightly more detailed explanation.</p>
<p>To elaborate a bit on what was mentioned by /u/III_Cloud_III;</p>
<p>We can take a guess as a planet's temperature based on its distance from its host star and the star's temperature. This would have to be augmented by knowledge of what the planet's atmosphere is like, if it exists. For instance, without an atmosphere Venus should be colder than Mercury because it's further from the Sun. However, because of its atmosphere its surface temperature is ~740 Kelvin (~460Â°C), which is more than twice as hot as Mercury's ~340K surface temperature.</p>
<p>Determining wind speed is an interesting thing to do. If you've ever had an object such as a car quickly pass by you, you probably noticed the pitch of the sound it made increase as it approached you and decrease as it went away. This is known as the Doppler effect, and it can be observed in the light passing through the atmosphere of a planet (as the planet passes in front of its host star). We can use that to determine how fast the winds are going on the surface: as the atmosphere on the planet moves about the planet, on one side it will be moving toward us and on the other it will be moving away. A cool thing similar to this is that we can use the same technique to measure how quickly stars rotate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Freeze is definitely a common response to almost anything unfamiliar, particularly when noticed in normal routine. Most people who notice do a freeze to better ascertain both its characteristics, point of origin, and other beings reactions to it.</p>
<p>Slam the door, yell and scream, or watch a movie with explosions and guns and my cat wouldn't stir or flinch. Her reaction when ice machine quietly dropps its load of ice in the freezer would be a great startled cat gif. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Programmers know about the &quot;if/then/else&quot; way of processing a situation. Freezing may be the &quot;else&quot;. Thinking about sexual assault crimes makes me wonder if the &quot;freeze&quot; reaction is a form of mental flight. Imagine being in a situation where you cannot flee, and fighting may get you killed. Freezing may be the best route to survival.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fight or Flight response is just a name given to the physiological response under threat. Pupils dilate, blood is rushed to central organs from our exteremities, etc. It's basically describing what the BODY does to get ready to 'fight or flee' to deal with the threat. Whether we choose to fight or flee is a cognitive process. I believe it's the same thing for freezing, where it is more of a cognitive response than a bodily (physiological) response. I think that is why freezing is not talked about when talking about the 'fight or flight response' because really, this is just talking about what happens in the body, and thus comes before whether the person ends up fighting, fleeing, or freezing. The question of why we sometimes freeze is a separate topic to the physiological respons, but an interesting one for sure</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we encounter frightening situations, we either engage in a fight response, flight response, or freezing response. </p>
<p>The fight or flight response (in its original form) is about survival. It's about hope. We activate it when we believe there's a chance we can outrun or outfight our attackers. The freeze response however, gets activated when's there's no hope (usually). </p>
<p>The freeze response works differently. You can view it as an &quot;energy conservation&quot; mechanism, basically to just brace yourself up and prepare to endure the impending ordeal. This response is the most adaptive of the three.</p>
<p>The fight or flight response, on the other hand, tells the heart to beat faster, the muscles to tense, the eyes to dilate and the mucous membranes to dry up. As a result of which, you can fight harder, run faster, see better and breathe easier than you would without this response. This response kicks in for real threats and imagined ones in as little as mere fractions of a second: much less than the amount of time between two beats of the heart.</p>
<hr />
<p>That's why the fight or flight response is now called the fight, flight or freeze response. Because, sometimes, when the odds are overwhelming we neither fight nor flee but simply freeze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
