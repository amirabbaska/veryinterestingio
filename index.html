		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can observe that the universe is expanding, so the hypothesis was that the universe used to be more compact in the past and expand.</p>
<p>So what they do is that they run back the clock. We have a density of mass and energy currently, if things were more compact in the pass, then the density would be higher. Higher density of mass and energy, change how matter react and temperature go up. </p>
<p>So you can test what happen to matter as you increase mass/energy density and temperature. All matter emit thermal radiation. The higher the temperature of the matter, the smaller the wavelength of that thermal radiation will be. But when atoms are hot enough, they lose their electron, atoms become ions and the material become a plasma. The thing is that plasma is really good at absorbing thermal radiation. That's what happen to the sun. It's a big ball of plasma and thermal radiation created in the core of the sun take thousand of year to get to the surface.</p>
<p>So if our hypothesis is right as the universe become colder, as some point it went from a universe of plasma made of ions to a universe cold enough for electron and photon to form atoms. Like I said, Ions absorb very well thermal radiation, but atoms don't. So at some point the universe became transparent and released a lot of thermal radiation in a relatively shot period of time. And we can see that. That's the CMB or Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. </p>
<p>But at some point the Universe was so dense and high in temperature that we don't know how matter behave. We don't have any example in nature. So we build particle accelerator. We made particle collide so fast that it show us how matter react in super high density and temperature. As we increase the speed of the particle that we acceleration, we simulate farther and farther in the past of our universe. </p>
<p>There is a lot of example like that about how scientist figure out how our universe expanded. Each are rather unique. Like how they realise that the CMB is way too smooth, meaning that the universe had to expand drastically at some point, which they call the Inflation. They calculated during how much time the universe was dense enough to make fusion and with that info, they calculated the ratio of hydrogen to helium and it match perfectly the ratio we see in our universe, we call the Big Bang nucleosynthesis.</p>
<p>But at some point, the universe was so dense that even the fundamental forces of the universe break down. So at that point we simply don't know how to understand how the universe behaved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The average temperature during the most recent ice age in our planet's history was only about twelve degrees cooler than the average temperature today. As a short example, global warming and ocean acidification have caused a small increase in ocean temperature, only about a degree. This causes the dinoflagellates that live in the pores of coral to be expelled into the warmer water in a process known as coral bleaching. This relatively small temperature change has already wreaked havoc on the great barrier reef, the largest living structure in the world, home to a staggering percentage of the Earth's oceanic biodiversity. If the world were cooling at the current rate that it is heating, the cold would kill the coral just as quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

How much would a big ocean-going vessel (say, a US navy Nimitz-class aircraft carrier) notice a tsunami in the middle of an open ocean, thousands of miles from shore?<br />
Would it be a destructive wall of water moving rapidly towards the ship, or would merely be a (un)noticable rise of the water level which a ship could pass over?<br />
Assume the tsunami in question is the result of an earthquake with a rating of 9.0+ on the richter scale similar to the 1700 Cascadia or 2004 Indonesia earthquakes, both of which generated massive, ocean-crossing waves.</p></div></div>

<p>a tsunami does not really &quot;present&quot; itself as a wave until the water depth is about &lt;1.3x the height of the wave itself.  the drag on the bottom of the ocean slows the flow and the top moves ahead and creates the circulation we see.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way to think about it is that a typical wave in the ocean is generated by wind and only effects the top few meters. That can move along with the water underneath undisturbed until it hits land. Once the depth on shore is less than the wave it builds up and breaks (oversimplified here but stay with me).</p>
<p>A tsunami involves the bottom shifting so you get the entire depth of the ocean to shift up say one meter. </p>
<p>Big deal, a one meter wave in the mid ocean. The problem is that this wave will not stay put and now will travel at hundreds of kms per hour. Also it is not really a wave but a whole block of water from the surface to the bottom (say 2500 m) that was moved. </p>
<p>At smaller depths, this becomes a problem as the water wants to be 2500 m deep. All the displacement energy of the water at full depth must be absorbed so we end up with a much higher, wider wave in shallow water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>fish is pale</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most fish is &quot;white meat&quot; (even salmon, which is pink because of fish diet, not because it's made of &quot;dark meat&quot;).  This is because these muscles are used for occasional movements and not for constant swimming.  The most common exception is some tuna meat, since tuna are very active swimmers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and flakes apart </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The flakes you see are <a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-b162a317e5b89562d8074cae3c56493f" target="_blank">myomeres</a>, bands of muscle tissue in the body that allow the fish to swim with a fishy wiggling motion.  Most of the meat you eat from land animals comes from the limb muscles, and isn't segmented like this.  You can see the remnants of such segmentation on the body (eg, ab muscles) but even there it's not set up in the same way and doesn't provide the flake.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most exciting thing in a baseball game to me is not necessarily the outcome, but the process of watching a pitcher duel with a hitter.</p>
<p>There's so much more going on at the plate that a casual fan may not be aware of. All of the three main players in an at bat - the pitcher, catcher, and batter - have all studied each other. This leads to an intricate mind game that enhances the pure physical battle of trying to make bat meet ball. </p>
<p>The pitcher and catcher know the batter's tendencies in (1) what pitch counts he likes to swing, (2) where he favors the ball, (3) what types of pitches he tends to hit, and (4) his timing/swing/posture at the plate.</p>
<p>Likewise, the batter has studied them in the same ways, knowing (1) what pitches the pitcher has at his command, (2) when he likes to throw certain types of pitches, (3) where he likes to locate those pitches, and (4) his rhythm/motion/pace of pitching.</p>
<p>And - to add to the complexity - the guys know the other has studied them. So each has to be self-aware of their vulnerabilities and how they match up with the player they're facing. If the pitcher is a guy who likes to be a flame thrower and wants to get outs based on his fastball speed and location, but the hitter is superb at hitting fastballs, he needs to adjust. Conversely, if the hitter isn't a guy who is likely to catch up to a good heater, he needs to know when and where this pitcher might throw a secondary pitch, a change up or type of breaking ball, to have a chance to hit it.</p>
<p>The batter's base line strategy is to not make an out. Depending on the game situation that can be modified in any number of ways, but the battle between pitcher and batter always remains. The pitcher is trying to maximize his strengths and pitch against the batter's vulnerabilities, while the batter is trying to capitalize on his knowledge of the pitcher to wait for a pitch he believes he can be successful at hitting safely. </p>
<p>This leads to many batters going to the plate looking for &quot;their pitch.&quot; Like in the previous example, a batter who isn't adept at hitting A+ fastballs against a power pitcher will go to the plate knowing that in certain pitch counts - let's say with one strike - the pitcher likes to throw a low breaking ball. The batter will key in on that particular pitch and hope that its in a good spot for him as he'll be ready to pounce on it. The batter also knows he's weak at fastballs above the belt so he needs to either be ready to take his best swing at one during the at bat or be OK with letting it go and waiting for a different pitch. Of course with two strikes he's got to be mentally ready for it either way and needs to adjust physically - choking up on the bat, shortening his swinging motion - to have a chance. </p>
<p>The battles between pitcher and hitter are different every time, and a lot of starting pitchers will save one of their pitches for the second or third time they are going through a line-up in a game so that they can keep the batters off-balance and not let them feel comfortable at the plate. The batters, knowing their own tendencies, will at times change their approach at the plate - ie, a guy who never swings at the first pitch will pounce on the first throw hoping to surprise the pitcher who might be throwing a &quot;get over&quot; pitch early in the count. So, history between two players is as important to them and relevant as the current at-bat, each trying to build upon what they've learned from previous encounters to gain the advantage. </p>
<p>There are few things more intense in sports than watching a great hitter and a great pitcher square off in a high pressure moment in a game. There's so much more going on that simply &quot;I want to get a hit.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: obligated to say thanks for the gold! My first. Truly appreciate it. </p>
<p>And I walked my dogs and thought more about this and wanted to add - all of this mentality aside - you have to then appreciate the fact these guys have to physically perform. The pitcher can know the perfect pitch to throw but he's got to execute it. The batter can be looking for their preferred pitch but has to make the good swing when they see it. And the batter has to be ready to capitalize on a mistake pitch in fractions of a second. If he's mentally prepared for a fastball inside but the pitcher hangs a curve on the outer third of the plate the batter needs to react and pound that meatball. </p>
<p>There's preparation - and that's so important and can go a long way towards success - and then there's execution. God I love baseball. </p>
<p>2nd Edit: A few people have asked for video examples. I found a video from MLB Network where former players Mark DeRosa and Carlos Pena talk about how they would approach facing Cubs pitcher Jake Arrieta - who when this video was made had recently thrown two no-hitters and was the reigning National League Cy Young winner (aka the previous year's best pitcher). They preach going up against a guy like Arrieta as a hitter you have to have a game plan on what pitch you're looking for and where in the zone because if you don't - you're already out.
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZKZvVYfANw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZKZvVYfANw</a></p>
<p>And another MLB Network video where Bill Ripken breaks down the different effect a simple fastball &amp; change-up combination can have on a hitter. These are the two most &quot;basic&quot; pitches in baseball and pitchers can get people out simply combining them effectively. Now you see what hitters are up against... and this before you throw in curves, sliders, cutters, sinkers, etc, and vast combinations of them.

<p>Some batters try to swing for the fences, as you say. If there is a runner on third and less than <del>one out</del> <strong>two outs,</strong> a batter may try to hit the ball up for a fly ball, so that the runner on third can tag up and score (sacrifice fly), even if the batter is out.</p>
<p>If the defenders are in a shift, the batter might try to hit the ball to the other side, even bunting it that way at times.</p>

<p>The line is deenergized and divers will bring the cable up to surface and install a splice kit at the needed section.  If too deep (typically ocean repairs) remotely operated vehicles will make the repair by cutting the cable and bringing the ends up to the surface. If the river is small, they will cut the cable on dry land make the tie in there and run another cable to the other side and make the other tie in. No need for divers.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Daveed is correct sometimes. </p>
<p>Often the cable will be concrete encased, or in conduit. In that case, it will generally be cheaper/quicker to splice back on dry land and just pull a new run of whatever cable is failed. </p>
<p>Sometimes it might even be cheaper to use a boring rig to bore in an entirely new run of cable. </p>
<p>It depends on the situation; the depth of the river, the distance to the failure point, how many failure points are suspected, size of the cable, number of runs, etc can all have an effect on the decision made on how to repair. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible using the speed of electrons to estimate where in a line that a break has occurred. It sends out a pulse and measures how long it takes it to travel down the line, hit the break and bounce back which gives them an estimate of where in the line the problem is. TDR is an example of this and it relies upon a physical property of electromagnetism where the jump from a conductor to air at the end of a cable, or a break in it, will reflect some of this energy back in the other direction. It's the reason that old network and SCSI bus cables used to need resistor/terminators installed to absorb this back reflected  energy or it would cause noise on the bus. <a href="http://ecmweb.com/content/locating-underground-cable-fault" target="_blank">This is an excellent article on fault isolation using a few techniques</a></p>
<p>How it's actually repaired will depend upon how the cable is ran. If it's a buried cable they will have to dig it up on land and attempt either a bypass or a repair on site. For instance you splice in a new length of cable on one side of the river, and then pull it through to the other side pulling on the existing cable to feed the new length through.</p>
<p>Usually with underwater cable runs it isn't buried and it's possible for repair ships to pull the cable off the bottom and onto the ship, effect a repair and lay the cable back down when it's finished. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everybody else is correct that DNS servers are the main point of failure. For normal consumers using normal software, you need the DNS to locate and access other websites. </p>
<p>Thing is, there are 3rd party DNS servers. Many institutions maintain them as a way to block access to malicious or inappropriate websites for their employees or students. Google maintains some of them... for troubleshooting, security, or to bypass restrictions like I mentioned before, many people use Google's 3rd party servers already.</p>
<p>This makes it incredibly unlikely that the entire world could lose access to the entire internet. </p>
<p>But a power outage or natural disaster in exactly the right location could take out a large number of websites. We've seen this before, when Amazon web services went down and damn near everything slowed down or stopped working. Most small sites have a company like Amazon do the physical hosting of their websites. Most large sites distribute the hosting across multiple companies for redundancy. So if a giant company like AWS has a big outage, it will have at least a minor impact on a LOT of websites, and a major impact on some. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The service that allows you to pick stuff from the www just by using website names (like www.reddit.com) instead of the IP address is a critical point because it relies in a small group of servers in its core. But all the other millions of servers could still be accessed if you know their IP addresses. This is what is called the Deep Web, millions of websites whose names are not recorded in the &quot;city phone directory&quot;, only people who know their &quot;phone numbers&quot; (IP addresses) can phone call them.</p>
<p>So, in short, you can make very annoying and difficult for people to access the www temporarily but to really knock it down would require widespread destruction at planetary level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the internet was developed to be pretty much resistant against what you're suggesting.  </p>
<p>IIRC the story is that it was initially a military thing and the setup being that it's a giant web of connections would mean the communication network couldn't be completely destroyed.  Certain parts of it would be disrupted and inaccessible but overall it would still function and be able to relay information from one place to another (aside from the affected areas of course).  So if a nuke hit Boston for example, well you aren't talking to Boston anymore but info sent from DC to California would still be able to be transmitted. . . it would just have to ping off any of the servers that were still alive instead of passing through Boston.</p>
<p>So, I guess it COULD happen but it's very unlikely.  It would take a cataclysmic event to completely take down the entire internet. . . and at that point it probably means the human race is going to end fairly soon.  Pretty much every server on the planet would have to be either destroyed or cut off from anything else.</p>
<p>TLDR:  You could break parts of it but probably never the whole thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been several different problems affecting the entire Internet or just a part of it. Most of these are being solved one step at a time and some is not as easy. All the ISPs are constantly communicating with each other though automatic systems to determine how the traffic should be sent around the world. One of the earliest global outages were a technical problem with the protocol they used at the time which caused a packet to flood the entire network which meant that all the routers had to be restarted at once, however there were only a handful of routers worldwide at that point. But there is also lots of different outages related to this system. Some is down to mistakes by technical personnel and some are down to management decisions. For example if Hurricane Electric and Sprint is not willing to work together on an issue then  they may cause half of the Internet to be disconnected from the other half. It is also possible to publish a path to addresses you do not own and therefore make a network unavailable. This have happened to Youtube at no fault of their own. This last part is seeing technical solutions being implemented currently but it is slow going when you need to replace a lot of big expensive hardware to make use of the new features.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're inbetween the plates at the centre, and the plates are much wider than their distance, they are well approximated by infinite parallel plates and so the field lines are straight.</p>
<p>If you instead zoom out and look at the whole thing from a distance, they look like an electric dipole, whose field lines look like <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/81/VFPt_dipole_point.svg/250px-VFPt_dipole_point.svg.png" target="_blank">this</a></p>
<p>These are both approximations to finite parallel plates that hold in two opposite limits. Inbetween, the field lines will interpolate. So at the middle they look mostly straight, as you move out they start bulgin out and very far away they get the shape of dipole field lines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just finished up engineering physics at college.. the field lines are an average vector of the sum of the forces acting on a particle.  When the proton reaches the top it wants to get as far away from it's positive charged plate (like charges repel) as possible.  this initially sends the particle on the path of least resistance, or straight up (or down depending on where you're looking) from the charged plate.  However shortly after the intensity of the pull from the negative plate (opposites attract) grows on average as it gets further from the positive plate and gets pulled closer to the negative plate.  It still has enough initial velocity to break this intensity, but the plate bends the proton in the x-direction slightly, which subtracts from the initially strong y-direction forces.  Eventually you see the arrow seemingly perpendicular with the plates again because the momentum picks up and the intensity of the pull from the negative plate pulls on the proton at that point the same amount the positive plate pushes it.  </p>
<p>Finally the proton travels further slightly and now the pull of the negative plate is stronger than the positive plate and this curves it back to the negative plate.</p>
<p>Reminder that field lines are not direct paths but averages of the cross product of the vectors of velocity and the magnetic field. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EE wth electromagnetic expertice here. It helps to remember that like charges repel, and parallel currents in the same direction repel. The field shape is a combination of the opposite charges at the poles attracting and the like parts of the innards of the field repelling. Also, field lines aren't really lines, it is a smooth linear field. Lines make it easier to visualize, and the reason that iron filings make lines is that they form little induced magnetic domains in the presence of a bigger field and tend to attract each other on the ends and repel each other in the middles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The plate is just a line of many point charges lined up together. &quot;Summing&quot; the field lines across the gap between the two plates results in an even field distribution - we represent that using straight lines instead. The &quot;end effect&quot; on the other hand, doesn't have more charges to &quot;balance&quot; them out, so they curve</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about how nuclear fission works. You take heavy atoms and split them. The original uranium (U-235/U-238) used in a typical water reactor is a relatively weak alpha emitter overall. </p>
<p>When you split uranium, you get two or three smaller fission products. There is a distribution of products that you can get (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_product_yield" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_product_yield</a>). But these smaller atoms are often formed with energy distribution states and neutron to proton ratios that are not along the &quot;line of stability&quot; and can be extremely radioactive. Additionally these fission products are all contained in the fuel rods, essentially being concentrated. </p>
<p>The fission products are what tend to be dangerously radioactive. If you could separate the remaining U238/235 from the spent fuel, those portions are still very weak alpha emitters only. It's some of the new stuff that was created in the process that has strong radiation emissions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They are produced when uranium captures neutrons and does not fission, but decays to neptunium, plutonium, americium and so on. Their half-life is typically of the order of thousands of years. Too long to wait for them to decay on site, but short enough to have a high activity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like asbestos, It's a solid rock and a few little piece may break off but generally is pretty harmless so long as you don't lick it. If you start smashing it to all the little pieces and releasing all the small pieces it will get into your lungs and cause all kinds of problems while in there. That is why Asbestos is dangerous on jobs sites because it is being demolished/broken into pieces. </p>
<p>Uranium has all kinds of potential radioactive energy but its stored in a tight knit bundle that isn't very harmful unless you basically lick it. Smash it to pieces and all the energy gets released which also creates the harmful Beta and Gamma rays. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So actually declaring war and breaking off diplomatic relations are two separate processes. You can cut off diplomatic relations with someone without declaring war on them and you can declare war on someone without cutting off diplomatic relations. In actual fact usually you cut off diplomatic relations with someone in order to warn them, and avoid a war; once war is joined that strategy clearly hasn't worked and so you actually start to rebuild diplo relations, because you need them to negotiate peace etc..</p>
<p>Often you don't want to lose face by reestablishing relations in public with your enemy and so the first diplomatic contacts will be secret. So for example Kissinger's secret first talks with North Vietnam.</p>
<p>The UN is different though. One of the great values of the UN is that even when countries aren't willing to have relations with each other, they both have relations with the UN. And so the UN becomes a mechanism for enemies to talk. Mostly indirectly, but occasionally ambassadors will chat in the corridors, or address each other in/through GA or committee meetings.</p>
<p>Edit: you might hear people talk about &quot;track one&quot; and &quot;track two&quot; diplomacy. Track one diplomacy is official discussions between nations. When those nations are at war track one isn't really possible except by formal peace talks. Track two is informal discussions, or discussions by non-state actors (NGOs academics etc..) on the state's behalf. Most peace processes start as track two initiatives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
