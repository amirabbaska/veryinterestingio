<p>Warming oils makes them less viscous, making them more easily penetrate the porous plastic, staining it. This process is enhanced by the significant volume of pigment.</p>
<p>Since the pigment is easily seen, even small amounts are visible. To shift the stain you'll need patience, washing soap and more heat.</p>
<p>Seal your spag sauce in glass containers and never have this problem again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The way a yoyo works is this: the string isn't tight to the bearing which is how you can walk the dog etc. If you cause enough snap, it starts to wind, then due to the spinning, causes it to wind back on the string itself. Gravity plays no real part in basic yoyoing, only in certain tricks</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

To be honest, a Yo-yo in space would bounce back harder I believe.  The gravity would not be affecting the yo-yo's repercussion.
Long story short, yes, it would actually make a yo-yo more effective; or annoying depending on how you treat it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Because you can throw the yo-yo and when it reaches the end of it's string it will rewind itself.</p>
<p>The mere fact you can yo-yo horizontally proves that gravity has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>It is purely the yo-yo and the string interacting with the force of your throw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A yo-yo returns solely when the string catches on itself and rewinds. Gravity has no role in this process.</p>
<p>At times when the yo-yo is spinning at the end of a string without winding, the string is kept taut by the yo-yo's weight and/or swinging the yo-yo, preventing it from catching on itself. Once the string is loosened (by giving it a short tug or moving your hand towards the yo-yo), it will usually rewind.</p>
<p>On cheaper models, there isn't a bearing. The string can be knotted around the axle too tight for it to spin freely, and so may always rewind rather than hang.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For diamonds, we're talking 237,000 to 1,300,000 atm. The bottom of the Mariana Trench, one of the deepest parts of the ocean, has about 1,070 atm.</p>
<p>So we don't even need to get into the trouble of retrieving stuff from the deepest part of the ocean, because it's just gonna be wet coal. </p>
<p>As something of an aside, most diamonds are not actually formed from coal. Much of the carbon that went on to form diamonds likely predates any of the living material that would form coal altogether.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To tackle this question, let's assume that light isn't the universal speed limit. </p>
<p>(The speed limit being infinite).</p>
<h1>We Know:</h1>
<p>It takes an exponentially increasing amount of energy to accelerate an object of mass x.  </p>
<p>Think of this as a 100m long ramp that grows steeper (as a function of mass) until it's completely vertical.</p>
<p><strong>Ramp of Heavy Mass:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
<p>_/</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ramp of Small Mass:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/</p>
<p>&nbsp;__/</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ramp of No Mass:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><strong>__</strong></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>We Conclude:</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can travel fastest on the ramp that is level rather than one that's uphill. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is impossible to travel faster than the level ramp allows as negative mass and thus a negative declination cannot exist.</p>
</li>
<li>Therefore, When we have no mass, we travel the fastest.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Tying It Together</h1>
<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>  Light has a mass of 0!  Thus using the logic from above, it is the fastest any thing can move on our &quot;ramp.&quot;</p>
<p>Let's scale it down to easier to manage numbers.  The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s.  Let's Say instead that the speed of light is 100 m/s, traveling the ramp in 1 second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From my understanding of it, light travels at light speed, the speed traveling through space at which it stops traveling into the future. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Defining The Future:</h3>
<p>In the above scenario, on one end of the ramp I have a flashlight.  You are on the other end.  Light has a mass of 0, and our &quot;speed limit&quot; we defined for that mass is 100 m/s.  When I turn it on, you should see the light 1 second later.  For time t(seconds)  from</p>
<p><strong>My Perspective:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>t(0)</strong> -  Present</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Turn on the light.  It begins shining towards you, hitting you at: </p>
<p><strong>t(1)</strong> -  Future</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light hits you 100m away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Your Perspective</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>t(0)</strong> -  Past</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's dark.  No light.</p>
<p><strong>t(1)</strong> -  Present</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see my light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So our &quot;speed limit&quot; (light) caused:</p>
<ol>
<li>T= 0 to be both the Present and Past simultaneously.  </li>
<li>T= 1 to be both the Future and Present simultaneously.  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If light doesn't travel into the future, then wouldn't that mean that it would reach a location at the same time that it started somewhere else? Shouldn't it take 0 time for light to reach a new location, meaning its speed is infinite?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simple Contradiction Proof:</p>
<p>Assume:  Light has infinite speed causing it to not travel to the future.</p>
<p>That Means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>t(0) Present: I turn on the light.</p>
</li>
<li>t(0) Present: The light hits you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact both of our times are t = 0 contradicts the <strong>law</strong> we defined above saying the fastest light moves is 100 m/s.  So we need another time reference point 1 second later at t = 1. That would mean we have a &quot;future&quot;.</p>
<p>TL-DR; I took a ton of adderall to study for a test and did this instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By Metaphor:</p>
<p>If I freeze you, you <em>experience</em> no time.</p>
<p>When I ship your frozen body cross-country, the fact that <em>you</em> experience no time doesn't mean that the truck you are in doesn't take time to get there nor does it prevent me from drawing crude sentiments on your frozen face.</p>
<p>So the packets of light which we most simply call photons, do not <em>experience</em> time. That is if they had little minds those minds would not have any experience of existing. But the packet itself, with its wavy-ness and its particle-ness is moving and moving happens over time.</p>
<p>If a person were in a ship and they passed through the entire universe at the speed of light. The whole universe would come and go unnoticed because their sense of our time would be zero. They would be the ultimate frozen corpse, utterly untouchable by us. But if we had sensitive enough instruments we could note their passing as disruptions of gravity or whatever, and that disruption would go past us at the speed of light, so we'd know they'd passed, but we could never know they they were about to arrive because their passage and the signal of their passage are going the same speed.</p>
<p>So the old question: what happens if I'm driving a car at the speed of light and I turn on the headlights?</p>
<p>If you are going <em>almost</em> the speed of light then everything looks normal about you and the car, but the universe looks like a tiny speck right in front of you.</p>
<p>If you are going the actual speed of light you never turn on the lights because you have slowed infinitely. You don't even know you've frozen. If you ever slow down somehow you'd never know that you touched &quot;light speed&quot;... except for the fact that the universe is now gone from around you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is part of how time is experienced differently by different observers. If you accelerate close to the speed of light, you experience less time than an observer in your original reference frame. Light itself experiences no time. (Because of Lorentz contraction, the universe appears to have been flattened to a pancake. Anything it's going to hit is right in front of it.) To outside observers light is traveling, well, at the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The frame of reference for a photon or other object traveling at the speed of light is <em>undefined.</em> </p>
<p>We cannot talk about the experiences of a photon or other such object because that frame of reference simply does not exist, it would violate a fairly central tenet of relativity. If there exists a rest frame at c, then there exists a rest frame in which objects <em>which move at c in every rest frame</em> are stationary, which is contradictory. </p>
<p>Saying photons 'do not experience time' is actually going too far. Photons <em>have no perspective</em> from which we could even make that claim, or its opposite.</p>
<p>None of this, however, means that an external observer cannot observe a photon pass through a finite amount of space <em>in the external observer's frame of reference</em> during a finite amount of the <em>observer's</em> time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know there are already a lot of answers here, but I'll try to contribute by explaining time dilation without using too much math. I'll probably need to sacrifice accuracy for simplicity. </p>
<p>To understand the answer to this, you'll need to know and accept a few basic things. </p>
<ul>
<li>The universe has no preferred frame of reference. </li>
<li>velocity = distance/time</li>
<li>The speed of light is always the same from every frame of reference. </li>
</ul>
<p>The speed of light is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. To make it simple, let's call the speed of light <em>c</em>. Let's say you're a stationary observer standing on something in space, and you see a spaceship travelling at a constant speed of 0.5c relative to you.</p>
<p>Let's say someone stands at the front of the spaceship and throws a baseball at a speed of 10 m/s measured from his frame of reference. You will measure the baseball's speed as 0.5c + 10 m/s. The speed of the spaceship relative to the observer and the speed of the baseball relative to the spaceship are added together to find the speed of the ball relative to the observer. </p>
<p>This isn't the case with light. If the person at the front of the spaceship turns on a flashlight, you will measure the speed of the photons as c, but the person on the spaceship will not measure it as c - 0.5c (half the speed of light). The photons will go just as fast relative to him, at exactly c. </p>
<p>Since speed = distance/time, the only way for the speed of light to travel at c for the observer on the spaceship is if the light takes less time to travel the same distance from his frame of reference, making the time term in the equation smaller. The distance term changes too, through length contraction, but let's focus on time. </p>
<p>So from the observer's perspective, time is slower, and less time passes per measurement interval. This makes the time term small enough for the speed of light to be c for the spaceship instead of the expected 0.5c. This means that for every tick of your clock, &lt;1 tick has passed on the observer's clock. So even though time is moving more slowly for the observer on the spaceship, he is still travelling at the same speed relative to you. </p>
<p>As the spaceship increases its speed and gets closer to the speed of light, the clock ticks on the spaceship get slower and slower (0.1 clock ticks/1 of your ticks, 0.01 ticks/1 of your ticks), until it doesn't tick at all. If the spaceship could somehow reach the speed of light, no time would pass from <strong>its</strong> frame of reference. But from your frame of reference, time does pass, and the ship itself gets older, even though the person inside does not. So from a photon's perspective, it essentially travels infinite distance in 0 time, even though it does not from your frame of reference. </p>
<p>Hope this helped! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 Quick n' Dirty Overview on Formulation Chemistry</p>
<p>We've got a bottle of Type A Goo.  We've got a bottle of Type B Goo.  We want to make a product that contains A and B because the consumers find it convenient.</p>
<p>Both A and B turn out to be soluble in water.  Unfortunately, when <em>both</em> A and B get into the same water, you end up with two separate layers, and that's bad.  It's because A and B aren't fully compatible.  But the customer still wants the combination - what do you do?  There's a variety of things you can try!</p>
<ul>
<li>Use a surfactant.  Surfactants get between the layers when they try to form and mess with the layer boundaries so that they can't separate.</li>
<li>Use a mutual solvent.  A mutual solvent is attractive to both A and B.  Use enough and they stop fighting over the water.</li>
<li>Reduce the ratios of A or B.  Some of the time, this is really necessary.  Maybe B interferes with A's function even when they are well-mixed.  Maybe a certain level of A just will not work in a B mixture no matter how much mutual solvent or surfactant you use.  Or maybe the higher ratios are just not cost-effective!  Sometimes you need to compromise.</li>
<li>Play with the pH.  There's a decent chance that A or B is an ionic compound, meaning it splits into positive and negative bits in water.  Those bits can be chemically altered due to the pH (acidity or basicity) of the water.  Fine-tuning the pH can allow for better solubility.</li>
<li>Substitute.  Okay, so A and B didn't work together and getting them to play nice is like herding middle schoolers.  Well, if C has many of the same properties as B but likes A better, why not use C?</li>
</ul>
<p>So which strategy would your &quot;2 in 1&quot; use?  Unless you've got a company chemist to ask, you won't know.  But my guess would be at least 2-3 techniques off of the above list, possibly along with some trade secret goodness that I'm not privy to.</p>
<p>Is it possible that your &quot;2 in 1&quot; has the same active components (the ones that do the work) as a separate shampoo and conditioner?  Yes.  Is it also possible that it uses a different active component for compatibility?  Yes again.  It is possible that there is a difference in effectiveness in either/both parts when you make a combination product?  Oh yes.</p>
<p>But the fun part is that hygiene/cosmetic formulation is a <em>huge</em> industry, with lots of different combinations, methods, and trade secrets.  Studying ingredient lists is going to give you a huge headache.  If you're a consumer, my recommendation is... try the different products and see what works for you.  If it works, use it.  If it doesn't, use it for target practice.</p>
<p>As a last note, I will say that all of the formulation techniques I mentioned above have a very strong limitation: toxicity.  Since we're dealing with hygiene products, it has to be very safe for body contact and can't poison you if you accidentally ingest it.  This is why despite the huge variety of things that <em>could</em> go into your product, you will often see similar ingredients or variants of similar ingredients in products from different brands.  Ingredients that aren't health-friendly can be very good surfactants/mutual solvents/additives, and an industrial chemist like myself uses them daily - but a cosmetic chemist has to think about the human first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Chemist here</p>
<p>TL;DR: 2-in-1 contain the same main ingredients as stand alone shampoo and conditioner but 2 in 1 products have to use a trick to get the oil to stick to the hair. </p>
<p>Longer version:</p>
<p>Shampoo cleans away the grease on your hair,  including your natural oils that give it shine and keep it healthy.  If your hair is stripped of its natural oil coating it looks dull and all fluzzy (tech term,  sorry ELI5)
Conditioners contain oils aimed at restoring the shine and condition.  Stand alone conditioners also have a positively charged ingredient that helps the oil drops stick to the negative charges on hair, but we can't use this in a 2 in 1 as the shampoo molecules are negatively charged and you'd get a snotty gloop if you mix them, as the +ve and -ve molecules stick together.  Try it. </p>
<p>2-in-1 products DO contain both the shampoo AND the oil.  They work less well than stand alone conditioners because shampoo is designed to clean away oil,  and yet you are at the same time trying to deposit new oil, but they do work.</p>
<p>So how do you get conditioning oil to stick hair when the product you're using is designed to remove oil? </p>
<p>2-in-1 products achieve this with a trick.  When the product is in the bottle the conditioning oil drops are very small;  too small to stick to the hair efficiently.  The trick is that when the 2 in 1 is diluted in the shower, the small drops stick to each other to make bigger drops.  Bigger drops are much better at sticking to hair.</p>
<p>That's how you get both REMOVAL of oil and DEPOSITION of oil at the same time. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How shampoo and conditioner work (am a hairstylist):</p>
<p>So, think of a strand of hair as a tree. Inside there are all the parts that make it grow. This is the cortex layer. The outside is covered with shingle like bark, this is called the cuticle layer. It lays tight against the cortex for protection from brushing, heat styling, and so on.</p>
<p>In very healthy, non-chemically treated hair, the cuticle makes the hair feel smooth. Chemical processes and other damage cause the cuticle to be ruffled or some of the shingles to break off. This causes dry, frizzy feeling.</p>
<p>Shampoo by itself contains surfactants which are oil/dirt seeking. The molecules open the cuticle layer slightly and surround dirt and oil particles. The other side of the surfactant molecule is attracted to water. When you rise, the cleanser leaves, taking the dirt and oil particles with it. You should rinse completely to get it all out.</p>
<p>Next, conditioner can be applied to smooth and close the cuticle. Some reconstructive conditioners also contain keratin, which will replace the broken protein bonds in the cortex and also build a temporary replacement shingle on the cuticle.</p>
<p>This is why in decades past, women would do a final rinse with vinegar. The ph helps seal the cuticle shut and makes the bark lie tight against the tree.</p>
<p>Conditioner should be applied in a small amount-About the size of a quarter. Start at the end and work to the scalp. By the time you get to the scalp area, the conditioner should be mostly diluted. This provides more help to older, more damaged areas while preventing dull, greasy scalp area.</p>
<p>Shampoo and conditioner in one doesn't do a great job of cleaning or conditioning. It is gentle cleanser with a moisturizing agent and something like panthenol, which leaves a wax like coat on the strand, making the cuticle lie flat for a little while.</p>
<p>Products like V05, leave in conditioners, and smoothing oils work in a similar manner by smoothing the shingles on the cuticle and coating them so they close. Use too much, the hair strand becomes dull, heavy, and greasy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really all you're getting with those is a moisturizing shampoo. It's pretty difficult to find a product marketed as a 2-in-1 in salon quality brands, which says something. (Consider high quality clothing lines that sell both well-made jeans, and also leggings. So a Walmart, or whatever, brand says, &quot;look, jeggings!' It is not really to your benefit to buy those jeggings instead of the separate, better quality items. )</p>
<p>However not everyone needs conditioner, and many/most people use it incorrectly. Hair, skin and nail needs vary by person, and also with time, changes in hormones or environment, etc.</p>
<p>EDIT: Just woke up, I'm sorry for trash-talking jeggings. Someone else pointed out that the jarred pb&amp;j combo would be a better analogy, so... that.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm sure as soon as I'm done typing this someone will come in here and tell you I'm wrong.  But I'm sitting in a factory that makes 100% of a very well known 2-in-1 line of hair products.  The chemical engineer who works with all the formulations reports to the same guy I do, and he's a good friend.  I work with these products every day.  I've been doing this for almost 23 years now.</p>
<p>2-in-1 shampoo and conditioner is just the usual shampoo formula plus silicone.  It contains no part of the usual conditioner formula except the things shampoo and conditioner already have in common.  The silicone basically coats your hair and makes it slick, thereby less prone to tangles and it feels &quot;conditioned&quot;.  We are well aware of this because getting processing equipment clean after making a formula with silicone in it is a lot harder than the normal cleaning process.  It's a huge pain.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Prior to domestication sheep would have grown a much smaller amount of wool up to the point where it served their needs, like the hair on a bear or a wolf. It doesn't grow indefinitely.</p>
<p>Then humans came along and found these relatively docile sheep sitting around and someone realised their wool was very useful to make things like clothing out of. Over many generations humans captured and bred these sheep to harvest their wool from. Humans also realised that by breeding the males and females with the most and best wool, the offspring would usually end up with even more wool than the parents. By repeating this process over time we ended up with the types of sheep we have today, who are completely reliant on humans to regularly shear them and remove the wool. This is domestication and selective breeding. Without us they would suffer many problems like overheating and being far too heavy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They look <a href="https://cherylyoung.files.wordpress.com/2011/04/45.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a> and have long, nappy hair. As they run through the woods, bits of their dreds/hair get caught on branches and twigs and pull off in little tufts. The result is that their hair gets long, but never, like, crazy long.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Even long-haired sheep in the wild don't have that long of hair. It dreds up a bit, and is &quot;trimmed&quot; over time by getting pulled off by trees/branches that sheep run into.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: money.</p>
<p>It takes $10,000 to send 1lb of stuff to space. ISS weighs 925,000 lb and it only serves research purposes. If you would like to perform any kind of manufacturing or processing and house a reasonable amount of people (ISS currently houses 6) you can easily multiply that by 100x. And already we're getting close to trillion dollars. Add some money for food, water and other supplies and the cost is astronomical.</p>
<p>An undertaking like that would require multiple governments to combine their powers and throw trillions of dollars in an very uncertain investment. Which will probably not happen in the near future because humans just don't play along nicely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This does happen in arid climates like the Southwest more than you might think. There are special native frogs and toads (like the New Mexico Spadefoot) that will sit underground for a long time, sometimes years*, until a heavy rain hits the area. They can stay underground for so long because they coat themselves in mucus and enter a torpor (very deep sleep) state. Once that perfect rain hits, they'll come up to mate and spawn. This whole process is very quick (on the order of a week or so!). They need to mate, spawn, and the tadpoles need to grow up quickly enough to be independent of standing water. After the mating-fest, the adults will dig back down several feet and wait again.</p>
<p>EDIT: Decades might be a bit of an embellishment here...more likely just a few years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Toads typically don't live near bodies of water, however they still prefer darker/wet climates to prevent their skin from drying out, so post rainfall is the perfect opportunity for them to come out and eat/mate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food is usually heated prior to being filled into cans, but it doesn't have to be.  Once the can is filled it is sealed, then it is heat processed.  The severity of the heat process usually depends on the pH of the food.  Below a pH of 4.6 it can be pasteurised - given a heating process at 100°C or less.  </p>
<p>Foods above a pH of 4.6 are considered &quot;low acid&quot; foods.  Commercially canned low acid foods are heated to an equivalent of 121°C or 250°F to the centre of the food, for a minimum of 3 minutes (though usually longer). Because it takes a long time to heat the right through the food it will often take about an hour to process something like a can of baked beans at 121°C. This is done in a pressurised vessel called a retort. The pressure prevents the can from bursting or distorting and can allow the use of water for processing (though steam is also commonly used for heating the cans). This temperature and time combination is enough to kill the highly heat resistant spores of clostridium botulinum. If any survive the process they can reproduce and kill the consumer of the food. The legal minimum processing time for a canned food is designed to produce &quot;12 log&quot; reduction in the number of these spores, so if there's a single spore in the very middle of a can it'll have a 1 in 10^12 chance of surviving. Virtually zero.</p>
<p>This bacterium produces botulinum toxin (botox) the most lethal neurotoxin known.  Interestingly it doesn't need oxygen to grow, in fact it is actually an obligate anaerobe - it needs an absence of oxygen.  It prefers the absence of other bacteria, it doesn't produce gas as it grows (so cans don't swell indicating that something is wrong) and the spores often germinate after a significant heat treatment.  It's also the most heat resistant pathogen, which is why it is the target organism of the canning process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In home canning (which, if there were any justice in the world, would be called home jarring, because nobody uses metal cans at home, but there ain't no justice), you put your food- tomatoes, asparagus, jam, whatever- into a jar, seal up the jar, and then boil the jar, whole, for several minutes, until the jar and everything in it has been at boiling temperatures, killing any germs that might have been inside. Afterwards, there are no (live) germs inside to spoil the food, and since the jar is sealed, no germs from outside can get in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physically, male humans develop slower because they are larger and more massive (mass wise) than females. Growing takes time, and growing too fast isn't good for the body.</p>
<p>Emotionally/intellectually this is more challenging. But it is a fact that women(girls) mature faster than men. Girls learn to &quot;prune&quot; information and generate more effective brain connections at an earlier age than boys. This means perhaps boys have longer to learn and form views and ideas on the world, but they take longer to do so.</p>
<p>Why is this? We're now onto a bit more speculation. In the wild, back when evolution was being selective, it was beneficial for girls to mature quickly so they can start reproducing (girls are the limiting resource in a populations growth rate much more than boys are, because men can have sex with multiple women) and in general the downsides for this (being smaller, perhaps being less creative or forming faster world-views) were acceptable.</p>
<p>However, men take the role of &quot;hunting&quot; or &quot;fighting&quot; (size needed for both). There was also probably typically more pressure on men to be innovative and different (in good and bad ways) due to the likely nature of early-human societies where women predominantly were suited to child care, and men were worth taking a &quot;risk&quot; on, due to them being more expendable. If you have 50 men and 50 women, and 30 of the men die because they experimented with something stupid, or because they were killed by an animal/other tribe, the tribe is still okay because the number of women determine how good the future is. But conversely, it is a bad evolutionary  idea if you design women to all be a bit nuts and reckless. </p>
<p>** - I sincerely hope I haven't offended anyone with the above, I am trying to be impartial.</p>
<p>In answer to your last question - in species were males are larger than females, yes males will grow slower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
