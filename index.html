		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a school psychologist, so I giving kids IQ tests is actually a big part of my job.</p>
<p>Every test is a little bit different, but the ones worth their salt are typically based on CHC theory, which divides intelligence into different broad and narrow bands, and then uses different subtests to measure those. So, the gold standard in most parts of the country right now are the Weschler Tests of cognitive ability. There is one for preschoolers, school aged kids, and adults. </p>
<p>For the most part, the test is divided into ten subtests, with the option to do more if needed. They subtests range from answering vocabulary (measuring crystallized knowledge and long term retrieval skills) to recreating 2-d images with 3-d blocks (visual processing abilities, fluid reasoning skills). When scored, there are five subtests that correspond to the broad bands of intelligence based on CHC theory, and then the full scale IQ which is generally considered he best estimate of overall cognitive abilities and typically corresponds to spearman's g, which is another intelligence theory where g is general intelligence.</p>
<p>All of these tests are normed on a huge sample that has been stratified to resemble the population that it's measuring. So, in the US, the school aged test, is given to thousands of kids ages 6-17, races, economic levels, with differing parental education levels, handicaps and disabilities, etc. Based on all of that information, the scores are put on a bell curve so that dead average is 100 with a standard deviation of 15. Within that, the test is normed for different age groups- so a kid that is 7 years and 3 months old could get all of the exact same answers right and wrong as a kid who is 10 years 7 months, and the 7 year old will have significantly higher IQ than the 10 year old because the test is normed based on age group.</p>
<p>No matter the test, it is always true that if you score 100, you will have done better than half the population. If you score a 70 you performed better than 2 percent of the population, and if you scored 130 you did better than 98 percent. </p>
<p>There are other types of IQ tests that don't correspond to the theories mentioned. Oftentimes they're for a specific population. For example, there are nonverbal tests for those who don't speak the language or are severely autistic. Those tests can't measure crystallized knowledge (the knowledge we learn and retain based on exposure... historical facts, vocabulary, etc), so they rely much more heavily on fluid reasoning abilities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My training is mainly from the use of cognitive assessments (IQ tests) for schools, but there always seems to be such controversy and misinformation about their use and interpretation I hope to lend some of my knowledge. </p>
<p>A good IQ test, defined by what I would use in practice and trust it's validity, reliability, psychometrics, etc., should be individually administered and standardized. These group IQ assessments that I see some people are given in the comments do not fit what I would use. In my opinion, those should not be considered IQ test, they seem more like academic assessments, but I'd need to know more. </p>
<p>As for the test supervisor, these people can be from a variety of professions as long as they have training in how to administer that specific test. My profession and training mainly addressed psychologists, but it may differ where you live, etc.</p>
<p>Standardized means that the test would have been given to thousands of kids (again my training is in schools) of different ages (broken down by year and month) to get the scores that the test maker applies fancy statistics and the normal bell curve to standardize the scores, which we can then present as an IQ score.</p>
<p>The test maker applies the bell curve because they expect an average amount of intelligent behavior in the general population. This would mean there are people who scored in the &quot;tails&quot; of the bell curve who are much higher than the majority of the kids tested and much lower. Since the test maker have made a test, they usually base it on previous tests and new research.  They also have to update them to the new population every few years due to outdated material, inefficient material, and the Flynn Effect (there's a good TED talk to look up on this).</p>
<p>Intelligent behavior can be measured many different ways and as previous commenters pointed out, it can be different within cultures. There are many different cognitive assessments. Some attempt to remove language from the assessment where directions are given non verbally. Some are intensive neuropsychological batteries that require a lot of little tasks. </p>
<p>I think that's where the controversy comes from with cognitive assessment. As part of a comprehensive assessment, I would administer much more than just an IQ test to help understand a child's functioning. For example, a child who has difficulty with language or severe anxiety will not perform as well on the assessment. We were trained to spot that by using other assessments and informal data. </p>
<p>We don't use IQ as some sort gate to a child's future. However, as many studies have shown there is a correlation with IQ and academic performance. Probably because a lot of the tasks can be generalized to tasks or concepts we are trying to teach in schools. If you want to debate what is intelligent behavior, please go ahead. It's a contentious topic even within our own community. But IQ assessments aren't inherently evil or used nefariously in my profession. We use them to try and help kids get an adequate education and use strategies and interventions that are best tuned to their many abilities. </p>
<p>I'm sorry for any errors or strangely worded sentences, I'm on my phone. The comment section will probably get pretty divided and ugly if the past serves as an example. I would be happy to answer any questions people have/ elaborate further on topics. I do like what I do ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually, and that holds true for all good psychological tests, there is an inital large pool of questions/puzzles. An initial sample of people works through these. The assumption, of course, is that one factor, intelligence, explains most of your performance on those items. In other words, your final &quot;IQ score&quot; should correlate highly with the performance on individual items. That is, if you are highly intelligent, you are more likely to solve this problem and vice versa.</p>
<p>However, there might be items that do not actually test for intelligence (maybe they just test creativity or mere knowledge). Performance on these items should not correlate highly with intelligence. Moreover, performance on these items should not correlate highly with performance on other items that test intelligence.</p>
<p>It's like in school: An intelligent kid will have good grades in math, physics, chemistry, english, etc. We can say that these are correlated. However, the grade in physical education (and music or arts) does not correlate highly with those grades because they are dominated by a different factor, physical fitness.</p>
<p>You can analyze the performance for all items with a so-called factor analysis. Ideally, this analysis should yield one factor that explains most of the performance. We can label this factor &quot;intelligence&quot;. Items that &quot;do not load highly&quot; on this factor (i.e. correlate with it) should be eliminated from the test. In the end, you should have a test, with one dominating factor.</p>
<p>Performance in this revised test should correlate with performance in another, already estabilshed IQ test (there are, in fact, several different IQ tests in use). Of course, if both tests test the same thing, you should have similar scores in them. In addition, the IQ score&quot; should correlate with things that we generally assume are correlated with intelligence. Often, this is school performance. In fact, early IQ tests were designed to predict school performance (to identify children who need support).</p>
<p>Using another large sample, you can determine the mean performance. Assuming that intelligence is affected by multiple factors, it will be normal distributed. That is, most people have an average intelligence, few have such a combination of factors that leads to a very high or very low intelligence. Under this assumption you can set mean performance in the sample as &quot;IQ 100&quot; and use the variance in the sample to determine which score is how far away from the mean with respect to the population. That is, with an IQ of 130 you will be two standard deviations away from the mean, meaning that about 2 percent of the population have a higher IQ than you.</p>
<p>There are, however, several things to consider. For instance, most IQ tests (if not all) do not assume or find just one factor. Often there is a distinction between mathematical intelligence and verbal intelligence, spatial reasoning, etc. Although these usually correlate to some extent, this correlation is not too high. Therefore talking about just one IQ score is not telling the whole story. Moreover, an IQ test is not there to push your self-esteem, it is a scientific and diagnostic instrument with a specific purpose. IQ tests are, for instance, needed to determine whether certain circumstances (environment, background, interventions, etc.) actually have consequences on this general factor &quot;intelligence&quot;. There are needed to make groups in experiments comparable. They are used to identify specific deficits. If you have normal intelligence but a low score in reading comprehension, you might have dyslexia. In contrast to low reading comprehension and low intelligence. Both cases need to treated differently.
Finally, an intelligence score is always defined in relation to the population from which the initial sample was drawn. Since intelligence - or rather, performance on intelligence tests - increased over the decades, an IQ score in a non-updated test from the 60's isn't your actual IQ, because it does not relate to the current population. And you being &quot;smarter than 98% of the population&quot; is nothing to brag about if you are constantly surrounded by the remaining 2%.</p>
<p>Concerning &quot;half correct answers&quot;. It is harder to construct and validate IQ tests with these. There are different flavors of IQ tests and as far as I can recall there are tests that have that - however, the widely used tests usually don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I commented this on a similar thread a while back, but here's my two cents again:</p>
<p>Although it is not entirely known why we even sleep and/or dream in the first place, there are a few rather well accepted theories.  First, theories on why we even sleep:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The restorative theory:  Being awake and active takes a lot of energy.  Aside from eating, one of the ways that our bodies conserves and restores energy and rejuvenates our body is simply by sleeping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The evolutionary theory:  This is slightly linked to the restorative theory in that it revolves around survival and efficiency.  When we sleep, we're not expending much energy, and we don't require much energy.  Thus, by sleeping, we conserve resources to help reduce the amount of food we need to eat.  Additionally, it is thought that early humans and our ancestors  benefited by sleeping at night because it allowed them to rest while also remaining motionless so that predators couldn't find them.</p>
</li>
<li>Memory consolidation theory:  In short, sleep functions as a way for us to take our memories from throughout the day and sort and consolidate them so that we can remember them better.  This has a rather large degree of support because some studies show that napping after studying can help increase information retention.</li>
</ol>
<p>Onto dreams now; first, the nature of dreams.  Dreams tend to be (as many I'm sure can agree with) rather emotional, not very logical, and full of sensory stimuli.  These seemingly intrinsic properties can be explained with a variety of other theories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The problem solving theory:  Dreams are a way that our minds take unsolved problems from throughout the day and attempt to unconsciously sort through them and look for answers.  One reason this has some support is because since dreams aren't very logical, the abstract approach dreaming can lend to problem solving can sometimes provide unexplored answers by letting you think about something in a way you would've never tried otherwise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wish fulfillment:  Our dreams manifest latent desires.  (Good) Dreams are a place where you can do anything, be anything, and potentially be better (in your own eyes) than the real you is.  A professor once told me that &quot;everyone is great in their dreams&quot;.  Dreams can be a way for your mind to reassure itself and fulfill unlikely or impossible desires (which explains why many people fly in their dreams.</p>
</li>
<li>Activation-synthesis theory:  This is the most scientific theory that attempts to explain dreams.  Essentially, it states that while you sleep and as your brain recuperates, it does whatever work it needs to do along with a little &quot;exercising&quot; so that your mind stays active despite your being unconscious in the form of randomly stimulating neurons.  As a side effect of the random neuron firing, your cortex receives random nonsensical &quot;messages&quot; (for lack of a better work), and tries to make sense of the nonsense and in the process produces what we experience as dreams.</li>
</ol>
<p>Onto the real topic of nightmares.  It's a fact that people have bad dreams, but there's (are you sensing a theme here) multiple explanations for why.  The strongest explanation has to do with the parts of the brain that are most active during dreams, and partially links back to some of the theories mentioned earlier.  Note that all of the brain is active while we sleep, some parts are simply more or less active than others.  First, recall that it is the cortex that generates the content of our dreams (that is, the cortex is what interprets the signals it's getting and turns it into something it/we can make sense of).  Another part of the brain especially active while we sleep is the amygdala, which is (ding ding ding) the part of our brain most active when we are in a state of fear.  This explains why nightmares are possible, because the part of our brain that responds to fear is essentially on overdrive for one reason or another.  Lastly (though there is much more that can be said, I'm simply covering the most important parts of the brain in sleep), the least active portion of the brain during sleep is the frontal lobes, whose job it is to enable critical thinking - this explains why dreams are nonsensical and why we don't often realize it was a dream until we wake up because the frontal lobes aren't active and assessing the situation.  All of these physiological processes combined are not only what allow dreams in general, but what give us a predisposition for bad dreams purely from the parts of the brain that contribute to dreaming in the first place.  Another consideration to take is that, returning to the evolutionary theory and the problem solving theory, dreams can be considered a way for our brain to play out and determine how to react in crazy, dangerous situations without actually being in that crazy, dangerous situation, so that if it ever does occur, your brain knows how to react without thinking much.  Additionally nightmares can simply be caused by stress, due to the stress temporarily wearing out the part of your brain that manages and regulates emotions, allowing your dreams (that are already emotional and nonsensical) to be a lot more spooky.</p>
<p>Lastly (for real this time), a brief note about why we are sometimes afraid of our thoughts, not only when looking back at a dream, but when conscious as well.  All people have weird, scary thoughts sometimes.  Not only about absurd dangerous hypothetical situations, our mortality, etc., but also things just like &quot;If I did this this and this, I could rob this bank and get out totally safe and sound&quot; for one example.  It seems silly to say, but our brain essentially thinks things like this so that it has time to consider it and realize that it's what you SHOULDN'T do, and to prevent you from actually doing it.  Another example is that just because sometimes you think about hitting someone that's annoying you or really want to, that doesn't mean you have anger problems, it's just your brain acknowledging something that it knows it shouldn't do but would really like to do, and making you aware of how it would play out so you realize the absurdity of the action(s) so that you DON'T do it.  </p>
<p>Hopefully I addressed everything satisfactorily, feel free to respond with more questions that I'll do my best to answer, and if you actually read everything I said, thank you for your time.  Have a nice day everyone.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  Sleep happens, dreams happen, we have a few ideas why, no one is entirely sure, and though your brain just really likes to watch you suffer, it also is doing its best to help you survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to the question is that we do not know yet, but we are working on it.</p>
<p>Maybe something simpler will be fun and assuage your disappointment at us not having figured nightmares/dreams out yet:<br />
Our brains use a lot of energy. Like, the most energy in our bodies. Since it costs so much to run a brain, each night we put it into a sort of mode where everything re-configures itself to spend less energy.</p>
<p>Lets say you were trying something new, like learning to throw a dart. Well, throwing a dart is complicated! Your brain has to calculate where to look, how much to move your hands, how to orient your hands in 3d space, how much finger-pressure you use to grip the dart, when to release the dart, and so on. Very complicated! A lot of stuff to calculate!<br />
Well, lets say those calculations on when to release the dart required that your brain fire a thousand neurons a thousand time. Each time a neuron fires, that costs energy. That means you are using up energy to do things, using up food. Well, your brain wants to be efficient, so at night, it does more calculations and figures out how to calculate when you should release the dart by firing a thousand neurons five-hundred times. Then you practice some more, and the next night it figures out how to do it with five-hundred neurons firing five-hundred times. Way more efficient! Costs you less energy to do, which means you can do more. </p>
<p>In this way sleep is super-important and literally makes you a better person!<br />
That's a super-simplified version of what happens when you sleep.</p>
<p>Now, what about dreams and nightmares? Well, we do not really know!<br />
Here's my idea; the rest of this is my speculation/pet theory...<br />
I think that dreams/nightmares are our brains testing the changes they made in their attempt to make things more efficient! The idea is that your brain needs a sort of &quot;simulation space&quot; to test out whether or not the changes actually work, i.e. make you better at throwing the dart. The brain also needs to use this &quot;simulation space&quot; to make sure that it does not &quot;break&quot; something else, i.e. that by getting better at throwing the dart you do not get worse at using a fork to eat. So, when we are super-young babies, we sleep a lot because our brain is trying to sort through the stimuli, figuring out vision and audition, trying to sort out how to move limbs, sorting out language, and so on. As we get older it still tweaks things, but more of our complicated issues are social in nature, or perhaps emotional. We probably have these goals we are trying to achieve, and the brain is trying to find ways to integrate how we act in the world and how that interacts with our goals, and how to prioritize them. Then, it &quot;simulates&quot; changes to make sure it does not break some other functionality.</p>
<p>More broadly, my &quot;pet theory of consciousness&quot; is actually that this &quot;simulation space&quot;, well, that's the first place it happened. The dream was a way to simulate stimuli from the world before there ever was an experience of the world. That was so useful that it was ported over to an &quot;online simulation&quot; that we experience as our daily waking life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctors believe most nightmares are a normal reaction to stress, and many clinicians believe they aid people in working through traumatic events. Nightmares become something else when they impair social, occupational, and other important areas of function in our lives, and may be a disorder. Recurrant nightmares in childhood are considered 'normal' until such point that they significantly interfere with sleep, development, psychosocial development, etc. In adults, they're associated with outside stressors, but they may also exist alongside a mental disorder (anxiety disorders, PTSD, schizophrenia, etc). Nightmares are usually associated with anxiety and/or trauma. </p>
<p>Some scientists believe dreams are the brain...specifically, the cerebral cortex...trying to interpret the random signals from the pons during REM sleep, creating a &quot;story&quot; out of fragmented brain activity. The cortex is the part of the brain that interprets and organized information gathered from our environment during consciousness. The pons is an area at the base of the brain. This area sends signals that induce REM sleep. These signals travel to the thalamus, which relays them to the cerebral cortex. </p>
<p>There are different types of bad dreams and they occur at different stages of the sleep cycle. Night terrors, for example, tend to strike midway through the sleep cycle during the deep sleep phase. They have no clear form or plot, but can cause you to wake with an intense and unexplainable feeling of fear or terror that may take several minutes to abate. </p>
<p>Nightmares occur during REM, and that's at the end of the sleep cycle, which is why people often remember them, at least briefly, upon waking. Other causes, besides stress, that can lead to nightmares are PTSD, hormonal imbalances, certain medications (particularly those that disrupt hormones and neurotransmitters that regulate REM sleep), and psychological disorders. </p>
<p>Some researchers believe nightmares can be helpful, giving you insight to what's going on inside your brain. We live in a society where stress is just a given, and nightmares may help us to understand our own psyche and what's happening in there. They can also be a problem, especially when a person develops a nightmare disorder, whereby frequent nightmares prevent them from sleeping properly and begin to have detrimental effects on waking hours as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain activity can be measured in waves, these waves are measured by an EEG. When we are awake and active, our brain produces beta waves. When we are deeply relaxed but still awake, we produced alpha waves. Theta waves define the first sleep stage. You could say that you could base the moment you fall asleep on the appearance of theta waves. Stage 1 and 2 have them, if you woke somebody up in these stages they may say they weren't even asleep yet, you've probably experienced that feeling before. Stages 3 and 4 become deeper sleeps and the brain produces delta waves. These are the longest waves and signals a deep dreamless sleep. After you move through stages 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, a person generally goes back through the stages backwards except instead of stage 1 they go into what's called REM sleep. REM stands for rapid eye movement and that is what characterizes this sleep stage, you may have witnessed this in someone else. This is the stage where you will dream. This whole cycle takes about 90 min. You will continue cycling though the stages this way but REM stage will get longer and the time you spend in stage 3 and 4 will get shorter as the cycles go by. </p>
<p>I apologize if this is messy, I'm exhausted and on my phone. Looking forward to cycling through these stages myself in a moment </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the existence of a magnetic monopole would imply the necessity of electric charge quantization -- the phenomenon that all electric charges are integer multiples of some fundamental charge, a property which is observed but for which we do not have a confirmed explanation.</p>
<p>Secondly, many unified theories imply the existence of monopoles.  So if you found a monopole, you could ask, if this is a unified theory monopole, what would it tell you about the unified theory?  The mass of the monopole would allow us to determine the energy scale at which unification occurs.  Also, in unified theories, the monopoles have a radius determined by the unification scale.</p>
<p>One last thing: The density of monopoles in the universe is related to the expansion rate of the universe and when that expansion occurred.  Inflation -- a period of rapid expansion -- appears to be needed in the context of grand unification, because otherwise there'd be a much higher density of monopoles and we should have seen some already.</p>
<p>BTW, you might be interested to read about Cabrera's experiment that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#Searches_for_magnetic_monopoles" target="_blank">appeared to detect a magnetic monopole</a> in 1982, although since that signal never occurred again, it seems doubtful that one event was real.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add that the connection between the existence of magnetic monopoles and quantization of electric charge was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#Dirac.27s_quantization" target="_blank">realized by Dirac</a> in 1931. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynn" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynn</a></p>
<p>That runes was sometimes replaced by the combination uu - a double u - for the same sound.</p>
<p>In german, the letter v changed in sound to be pronounced as f in most cases (it still is). In a few cases the v-sound was retained. To distinguish these cases, scribes began to write vv for these.</p>
<p>When printing was developed in what is today Germany (and to some extent Italy, but that is less relevant here), the printing press manufacturers made types for the letters that they had. Since the combination vv was very common, they made a letter for it - w. In most languages letter is called &quot;double-v&quot;.</p>
<p>These printing presses and the letters for them were exported everywhere, including to England. The English quickly realized that they didn't have types for all their letters, so they made do with what they had. Since English didn't have the w before printing, they simply reused that letter for the Wynn rune, which was missing. It is called &quot;double-u&quot; because it was also sometimes written as &quot;uu&quot;</p>
<p>Similar story for the letter Thorn, which was also missing when printing and became the &quot;th&quot; combination.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At one point, U and V were not regarded as different letters (and in fact, F, U, V, and Y are all ultimately derived from the same Phoenician letter). You may be familiar with this to some degree if you've ever seen a picture of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Arch.of.Titus-Inscription.jpg" target="_blank">a Roman inscription like this one</a>, whose first two lines read <em>senatus populusque romanus</em>. A holdover of this usage appears in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgari" target="_blank">branding of some Italian luxury products</a>. UU and VV, the ancestors of modern W, were similarly interchangeable. In Middle English (during the Middle Ages), the pointed V was used at the beginning of a word, while the round U was used elsewhere.</p>
<p>As time went on, English and other languages began assigning more discrete, well-defined roles to what started off as two visual representations of the same letter. By and large, V has become a consonant and U has become a vowel, but W is a bit of an odd case. The [w] sound it makes in English is a kind of consonant often referred to as a &quot;semivowel&quot;. In German, it is strictly a consonant (representing [v]). In Welsh, W is a vowel. It is also <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/w#Welsh" target="_blank">a word</a> in Welsh, and you can even put an accent mark over it, like in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/d%C5%B5r" target="_blank">the Welsh word for 'water'</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you call it &quot;double-U&quot; or &quot;double-V&quot; varies from language to language. In upright type, it tends to have a pointed appearance, but in italics (as in cursive handwriting), many typefaces give it a more rounded look, a relic of when it was written <em>uu</em> in a calligraphic hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon here, from UK. Excellent question! And one that I didn't know the answer to until actually went through it! I previously worked in a hospital in London when there was a large fire within the building, in the basement.</p>
<p>Although there was no fire actually within the operating theatres, it affected the ventilation system and smoke was entering the ORs.  The Clinical lead (head doctor of the hospital) informed all theatres that all operating to cease ASAP. </p>
<p>What ended up happening was: Those that were almost finished hurried up, those that had just started stopped, those that were literally half-way through just covered up as best they could (made it as a safe as possible, cover the wound etc) and the still-anaesthetised patient was wheeled to a &quot;pop-up&quot; ITU somewhere safe &amp; away from the smoke. </p>
<p>As it happened the fire was quickly brought under control, ventilation system was disabled and the few (1 or 2) patients that needed it went back to theatre the next day I think. </p>
<p>Although less than ideal patients can be kept anaesthetised for quite a while and could even be transferred to other hospitals if required (which is what I'd imagine you'd have to do if someone was actually on CPB (cardio-pulmonary bypass). Would be a massive pain in the arse logistically, but when there's a need these things get sorted. </p>
<p>There wasn't any cardiac at this hospital so that particular scenario wasn't encountered... </p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many hospitals have their fire alarms set up in zones. So each wing/floor/area is its own zone. When the fire alarm is activated in a zone, either from a pull station or a detector, the audible alarm will only sound in the affected zone. It will also close all the fire doors in the area, which are held open by magnets. The fire department receives the activation and responds while hospital security will go to investigate if there is a fire. Hospital staff or the fire department can expand the activated areas as needed, and usually the rest hospital will be notified of a fire alarm somewhere in the hospital by an announcement for a &quot;Code Red.&quot; along with the area of the hospital that is affected. Because of this set up, its unlikely the surgical procedure would be impacted at all. Even if the activation was in the same zone, they would most likely continue as long as no flames or smoke were seen.</p>
<p>This may not be the set up in all hospitals, but has been in the ones I have worked with.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone in the hospital is taught race and pass before you even get to your station. Hospitals are built to compartmentalized fires so race:</p>
<p>R = Recuse &amp; remove anyone from immediate danger
A = activate alarm
C = Contain - close the doors, most systems do this for you these days
E = extinguish small fires or evacuate if in harms way</p>
<p>P = Pull
A = Aim
S = Squeeze
S = Sweep</p>
<p>You do not evacuate a hospital because a fire alarm is triggered. It is common to be triggered because of the lab and other departments. Like a high rise in a major city, unless immediate damaged presents itself you wait for instruction before evacuating. The only difference between a hospital and any other building is the design to compartmentalized the fire and not allow it to spread. Other buildings besides hospitals are erected this way but not your standard house or high rise due to cost.</p>
<p>You could ask what happens during surgery and a power outage. The simple answer is very expensive generators with flkywheels. You won't even see a blip in the lights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I'm on placement, hospitals are designed with this in mind using a concept called compartmentalisation. Each ward/section/area is a different 'compartment' separated by fire resistant walls and separated by fire doors with an estimated time of 60 minutes (i.e. They are theoretically able to withstand a direct flame for a total of 60 minutes). This both buys time for moving patients and limits damage caused in the event of a fire. </p>
<p>Therefore, throughout the hospital there are two fire alarm types:</p>
<p>1) Continuous: the compartment you are currently in contains a fire. In this event, if it is not a false alarm, measures may need to be taken in order to stabilise and move the patient into another compartment, in order to continue the surgery there. </p>
<p>2) Intermittent: a compartment adjacent to the one you are currently in contains the fire. I imagine in this case, the surgeons would attempt to continue with the operation in the assumption that they are not under any immediate threat, as in theory even in the event of a serious fire, their compartment will not be at risk for another 60 minutes, in which time emergency services will notify them of the very real danger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Larger particles are absorbed by mucus and swept up the respiratory tract by what's called the ciliary elevator, a system of tiny hair-like projections of endothelial cells that beat upwards in unison to move things up and out of the lungs for exactly that purpose, where you will eventually cough it all out as phlegm.</p>
<p>Smaller particles are ingested by macrophages within the lungs and bronchi. The majority of this is essentially carbon soot, which our cells cannot metabolize, so it just builds up in the lungs as black <a href="https://www.microscopyu.com/assets/gallery-images/_galleryThumbnail2x/pathology_anthracosis20x04.jpg" target="_blank">anthracotic pigment</a>. It looks gross and harmful under a microscope but it really doesn't do anything, it just sits there and gradually accumulates as you get older with no ill effects.</p>
<p>Other inhaled substances can have immediate cytotoxic effects on lung tissue, other local effects such as bronchodilation/constriction (asthma inhalers), or be absorbed into the blood for systemic effects (smoking, anesthetics), but it really depends on the substance. The majority of inhaled particles are handled as above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pollutants can mean many things but I'm going to assume you mean the pollution that accumulates around cities and populated areas (usually from traffic/factories etc).</p>
<p>Some gases do direct damage to your lungs and that is managed by the same inflammation and healing process that happens anywhere else in the body where there is injury. Other gases can be absorbed directly into blood plasma or hijack the haemoglobin and bond with that on your red blood cells. The gas will either pass out through your lungs or your kidneys will process it and you will excrete it through your urine.</p>
<p>Dust particles will normally get trapped in the cilia that lines from your nostrils to your lungs. The inside of your nose is somewhat convoluted to make the air more turbulent. This give dust particles more opportunity to get stuck to the mucous on the walls of your airways. The cilia will uniformly beat to move particles to the back of the throats where they are usually swallowed. Depending on amount of particles or other pathologies, sometimes your body will need to cough to move the mucous to the right place where it can be swallowed or spit out.</p>
<p>Sneezing is another way your body has of expelling foreign material. This is normally due to something stimulating mechanoreceptors in your nasal cavity causing a sneezing reflex. Interestingly, you do have some conscious control over the repression of sneezes due to the circuitry involved in sneezing.</p>
<p>Hope this answers your question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Tamiya acrylic paint takes about 10 seconds, soldering 15 seconds, sawdust totally kills me and I can't deal with traffic because the exhaust fumes go straight up my nose. It always feels like there is a rope tied aroung my eyeballs pulling them together. I wash my sinusses with saline 2 or 3 times a day and it does help. I often wake up in the midddle of the night with a blinding headache and it seems that it is because my sinus cavities dry out. A desk fan or fan running while I sleep also gives me a headache very quickly. I really don't understand why air moving around me gives me such a headache. I've seriously considered getting a mask and an oxygen tank to be able to do the things I love (building scale models, electronics etc) Do you have any advice or thoughts on what I could do to make life easier.

<p>The reason one does not feel pain while they sleep is because when you sleep, “most neurons in the brain stem immediately above the spinal cord, reduce or stop firing.” The brain stem is composed of the medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain. The brain stem is in a way, a highway where the motor and sensory system passes through to the brain. Therefore, while awake, the nociceptors, which is a type of sensory neuron which is active when there is tissue damage, and is what causes the pain sensation, is traveling from the point of damage through the brain stem to the brain. So, while asleep, there is no brain stem connection to the brain from the sensory neurons, ergo no pain perception. You can think of it as connecting Christmas lights. When you connect one series of lights to a second series of lights, it will allow electricity to flow through both sets. If you disconnect the second series of lights, then the flow of electricity will only flow though the first series of lights. As opposed to 1998 when the undertaker slammed mankind through the hell in the cell on a 16 foot drop.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why should we?</p>
<p>Sleep is important, maintaining that bit of extra awareness of our comfort is taxing.  Consider obstructive sleep apnaea.  This is essentially your body occasionally just waking up just enough to move slightly and correct your neck's position so you can breathe clearly.  </p>
<p>But it's a serious sleep disorder that can cause all sorts of performances issues during the day.  And it's all caused by being minorly woken up due to a condition that would otherwise cause you to suffocate. </p>
<p>Now, with being unable to breathe, yes, we do wake up, readjust and don't die in our sleep.  But it has a huge toll, and a pretty obvious trigger.  Are we becoming hypoxic? Ok, then trigger something to rouse us a bit and gasp for breath.</p>
<p>If our body were to do that every time we got uncomfortable, first of all, it's much harder to define discomfort, especially stiffness that isn't obvious until you actually get out of bed.  Secondly, it would ruin our sleep quality almost every night. </p>
<p>So we fall asleep in a position that is comfortable when we fall asleep, and unless we have some other sleep issue, we don't move around too much when we sleep.  We wake up with minor aches maybe if we were in a weird position, but we walk it off.  </p>
<p>The alternative is to wake up constantly in the night and never sleep properly.  As someone who suffers from sleep quality issues, I would always take a better night's sleep over a few aches in the morning every time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Your body moves into one of these awkward positions because it feels great at the time, and it's not until you regain some level of consciousness that your body will adjust.</p>
<p>Your brain is in sleep mode and is not thinking through &quot;what is the most comfortable position I can sleep in that won't cause me pain when I wake up.&quot; Your body is just finding a position that feels good right now, and does it for you to deal with the consequences later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar engineer here. Let me explain some of this that's been covered by some people already.</p>
<p><strong>Why Not Solar In Deserts?</strong>
If we are talking a new array away from people, someone has to lay out all of the infrastructure for it to deliver power to the grid. At the same time, someone also needs to figure out how to shut it down when the largest source of power on that power grid fails because pumping electricity into a powered down grid can have disastrous results. This is typically solved in home solar with a fast disconnect, in which if power to the home stops the array ceases function to help the main power company in the area get things going again.</p>
<p>Next is maintenance on the panels. The thing about large constructions in remote areas or even out of the way spaces is that most companies that put something out there intend not to have to come back to it unless they absolutely have to. The issue with this and solar is panels may die, panels need cleaning, sun tracking mountings are expensive as fuck, and you'd have to pay for all the equipment and people to facilitate taking care of all this. The same fast disconnect isn't a great solution at this kind of scale either. Large power systems like this require a lot of extra engineering and planning and sometimes implementing solutions that don't even exist or cannot just be found off the shelf. (Gonna also drop that you'd have to landscape the desert unless you find a really nice flat spot and even then, you may want to have a leveler come through anyways.)</p>
<p>Ultimately, there is a lot that needs to be managed that just aren't realistic to manage. At the same time, anyone who puts an array out somewhere needs a way to make money off it. They probably aren't going to be able to get the power company to pay for large sums of solar power without it being discounted a lot. After all, if I was a power company I don't need to buy power from someone else. The city may not because they are already getting power from the already existing grid owner. Leaving you only able to sell to new developments and offer power along side the power company to homeowners, at which point, why aren't you just an extension of the power company? And the power company does not have an industry interest in solar because fossil fuel is a bigger money industry. (This statement is wrong, check out /u/Halfway_Bayesian <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5woe50/eli5_why_cant_we_just_cover_a_proportion_of_the/decu3tf/" target="_blank">post</a>.) At the same time, your power needs to be as always available as a regular power company for emergencies and panels do not produce much at night.</p>
<p><strong>Future of Solar then?</strong>
I honestly think that the future of solar right now is in residential. Most homes can hold enough panels on their roof to offset all of their electrical costs and for a pretty fair price (about the cost of a car, between $10,000 to $40,000. Consider pricing is on average, $3.50 per watt on a panel.) I've seen in just the last two or three years alone panels going from 225w panels to 290w along side batteries and even solar shingles. The technology is improving fast and we will see a lot more of it in the next few years. However keep in mind too, not every place in the world is geographically suitable for solar power. Locations too far North and too far South won't get great benefits from solar power. Neither would a place that you could essentially call a forest. Solar I don't believe sells well in Canada or states and countries along the same latitude as Washington or Oregon state. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5woe50/eli5_why_cant_we_just_cover_a_proportion_of_the/dect48o/" target="_blank">Check out Huppie's post here.</a> where they discuss solar at these more northern latitudes, I learned something new.</p>
<p>To put things in perspective, if you live in Utah with a good South facing roof, 8 modules of 290w are enough to offset 3,000-4,000 kWh of usage at your home. For a lot of small homes, this can be all you use for a year. A lot of solar companies offer their own maintenance services or even equipping an array with other necessities like &quot;critter cages&quot; to keep birds and squirrels out from under your panels. Otherwise, you may have a ton of fried birds under your panels. They get hot.</p>
<p><strong>Problems that Face Solar</strong>
The biggest issue with the solar industry for individuals is electrical companies because they are virtually untouchable. The reason is that they technically own the power grid and if the entire city depends on it, there is nothing that can really be done. A lot of power companies lobby to keep solar out as well. If you do some research, Nevada was a booming industry. Then Warren Buffet's Pacificorp, changed how solar customers pay their bill for having solar. Essentially, they put up a premium that brings your power bill to, still less than before, but not as much savings. On top of that, you're now also buying power from a solar company or paying for panels under a loan or lease. Pacificorp, claims that they lose millions of dollars per year on administrative fees and are recouping that cost from solar customers with this premium. Some electrical companies won't even allow residents they service to have a solar panel system.</p>
<p>There needs to be more policies for solar friendly developments and incentives for the industry. There are some, but there are also powers in the world that are cornering the market on power and do not want solar coming around because so far, solar companies are already undercutting profits from the grid owning electric company. I think there needs to be a lot more cooperation between power companies and solar companies rather than the electrical companies governing and restricting how power is being provided to consumers in an area.</p>
<p>Tldr: <strong>Solar panels require a lot of maintenance, the idea itself has a lot of business and municipal policy issues, and these same issues extend to the entire solar industry. Its much more feasible for residential solar to be happening for society as these same problems tend to be cheaper when costs can be levied on a private customer.</strong></p>
<p>If you want to be the one to do that though, do it.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So electricity. It needs to be moved and can only be used as generated without significant infrastructure. So lets just look at moving Electricity from Arizona to say Maine.</p>
<p>Line losses. Electricity needs to be at high voltages to move it. that is why AC won out over DC. Not because Tesla rocked and Edison was a jackwad, but because DC has a limited transmission range. Literally in the couple miles range. </p>
<p>So we need AC. Solar generally makes DC. So the DC needs to be put into a converter that makes the DC into AC. Because we live in reality and not theory or make-believe there will be losses in converting the DC to AC. </p>
<p>Also a line 100 miles (160 kilometres) at 765 kV carrying 1000 MW of power can have losses of 1.1% to 0.5%. A 345 kV line carrying the same load across the same distance has losses of 4.2%. So if we ran 765KV line from Arizona to Maine is like 2800 miles long. That is a considerable amount of losses. That comes out to about a 25% or better loss in the transmission of that power. </p>
<p>So to combine the losses in the generation and swap to AC and the line losses you end up losing a huge amount. Additionally at the beginning and the end you have to step up and then step down the voltages. That incurs more losses. So overall the losses from the Sun hitting the PV panels to someone turning on their TV in maine incurs a huge efficiency penalty.</p>
<p>So while the solar source is free, the transmission equipment, transformers, and all the other equipment is not. So now if you take the standard that solar runs at: about 10-25% and apply that and the losses you get huge generation numbers for what would need installed. 11 million MW hours of power were consumed. </p>
<p>So to math this 11,000,000 MWh of power needed. So we need to up the production to account for the losses. So let's divide that up into 365 days of use and 24 hours per day. That comes out to needing an average of 1255 MW of production. Now we add the losses we have to make up for. That comes out to 1794 MW of production. Then we have to throw in the Capacity factor of solar. The industry runs low compared to other power systems. But a plant in Arizona has been hitting 29% so we can use that. that means we need to start with 6185 MW of faceplate capacity. </p>
<p>And we need to be able to store that power. We haven't added storage in yet. Since the solar must be stored some place for when the sun is down. That will add in more losses and therefore more base capacity to meet the needs of the end user. </p>
<p>Agua Caliente is 84 MW of faceplate capacity on 2400 acres. So we need to multiple and we come up with 176,735 acres give or take. That is about 276 sq. miles of solar. </p>
<p>The problem is not with the production of solar electricity. The problem is with storing and moving the solar electricity. The other thing we have not talked about is maintaining grid stability. Thousands of small PV site feeding into a huge grid with nothing to anchor the grid will make it unstable. When a large industrial plant starts a bug line up or a aluminum recycler starts the induction heating process that load has to be absorbed and these small PV suppliers cant handle it. </p>
<p>There are vast engineering problems that need to be solved here. NO it is not impossible, but it needs to be looked at as a whole, not just little pieces. Too many people assume the only thing that needs power is homes and basic lighting and ignore the rest of the grid and the businesses and industry we have in this country. We need a grid they can rely on. The problems are solvable, but not by activists pushing their favorite flavor of solution or the neat product of the day. </p>
<p>Power walls are great. Except for all the drawbacks they have that we ignore. Solar is great except for some of the drawbacks. nuclear is great except for some of the drawbacks. </p>
<p>Ask your self why we are shutting down already operational and carbon free nuclear plants, but are willing to pay extra in taxes to build carbon free NEW renewables. It is stupid. And it ignores the facts of the grid and engineering. Solar cannot be used as abase load. And the technology for storage is more in its infancy than renewables are. And before we can really have any chance of renewables really supplying the whole of the grid, storage has to be solved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Who would be doing it? If you're doing it for the public good that's a government project and you need to convince stubborn politicians that it's a good idea. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>If you're expecting to make money you need to deal with ongoing maintenance costs as well as the initial setup (even if initial setup is relatively cheap these days). And then you need to make they money back by selling the power, but what if the price of power goes down because you're providing it in such large amounts?</p>
<p>There are some practical concerns though.</p>
<p>Moving electricity is not free or completely efficient. Distributing power around an entire country ends up wasting a lot of it and requiring strong infrastructure and these problems would be even worse with one central source a far distance from where the power is used.</p>
<p>And what about nighttime? Storing electricity is a problem that has NOT been solved on the type of large scale such as &quot;powering a whole country&quot;. And solar panels on opposite sides of the world somehow covering for each other when one side is in the dark increases the problem of distribution even further. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Storage and transportation.<br />
You can keep a barrel of oil for months and it will still be good.<br />
You can cart a barrel of oil halfway across the world and it will still be good. And we do this. A lot.<br />
A barrel also doesn't cost much to make and can be made out of cheap materials.  </p>
<p>Getting solar power from the Sahara to Stuttgart is going to be difficult.<br />
Once it's electricity it has to be used immediately.<br />
Batteries are really expensive and made out of things that are bad for the environment.<br />
Other cheaper things like boiling salt lose energy very quickly.<br />
Building power lines that far will cause a lot of power to be lost on the way.  </p>
<p>Some scientist are working of a way to turn the energy into oil and burn it later, but it's still in the experimental phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cost, maintenance.</p>
<p>And the real kicker:  transfer losses and storage.</p>
<p>Not enough people would live near by to be able to maintain it cost effectively.</p>
<p>Sand can cause wear and tear on &quot;things&quot; so you would have to engineer around that.</p>
<p>And no major population centers nearby deserts, typicall, so the amount of power lost on the wire would be very high.</p>
<p>And storage:  would still need to produce power at night.</p>
<p>So a hybrid approach would be cool.</p>
<p>I don't know why they don't put solar collectors on the outsides of the windmills.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
