<p>Let's say you try and reverse engineer an iPhone. </p>
<p>You need to know what each component is made of, this is NOT easy at all and requires some fairly high level analytical skills. </p>
<p>You also need to know how each component talks to each other. An iPhone isn't just the solid stuff, and then OS installed; there is firmware that controls how say the capacitance from the screen is delivered to other bits of circuitry. There is software that controls the battery.</p>
<p>Another example would be say a grain mill! You could build something that looks the same easily; a stone with an axel and then another stone on a pivot that can roll along in a circle. But if you don't know how to use it (the software) it's useless. </p>
<p>With modern stuff the material becomes a big factor!! Touch screens are made of very special materials for one. Military hardware? Can also be very exotic composites, it's not just steel etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It depends a lot on the complexity of the object and if there are critical parameters or tolerances.</p>
<p>Reverse-engineering a simple table with square legs is easy. Now think of a nice table with a pattern lathe-turned into the legs and a stain. It may be difficult to determine the wood under the stain and the stain color. It will also take much longer to figure out the lathe tooling setup to replicate the legs. If the replica isn't exact, it could still be a nice table. </p>
<p>When you consider mechanical and electronic items,  the process is more difficult for a number of reasons. Electronic components are exponentially more complicated. If you can identify all the pieces, you still have to arrange them precisely. Imagine trying to copy a complete road map of Texas with a pencil and protractor - no tracing. If you manage to build the thing correctly, you still need to develop firmware and software so that it runs as closely as possible to what you are trying to reverse-engineer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is talking about the manufacture of something, and they are explaining why copying things isn't easy...but that isn't reverse engineering.  That's just trying to duplicate something.  Copying stuff is easy.  </p>
<p>If you look at a piece of electronic equipment, a good chunk of the chips and processors are off the shelf.  You can go and buy them and slap them all together and there you go.  But that isn't reverse engineering, that's just assembling something.</p>
<p>If company x builds a cool thing, and company y can't figure out how they did it on their own, company y then needs to buy the thing from company x and do a complete analysis of it.  Reverse engineering isn't about copying something.  So company y brings in the engineers to look at every single component and wire, and then write up the full specs based on what they see in the hardware.  Going back to everyone's house analogy, it's basically looking at a house and then drawing up blueprints.  It's not nearly as complicated as figuring out how to manufacture steel, but it isn't easy.  It's time consuming and tedious.</p>
<p>This is what reverse engineering is.  Looking at a product, and then figuring out exact specifications for it.</p>
<p>After you get your full list of specifications, you hand that off to another completely clean and brand new team to actually design something based on those specifications created from the original product from company x.</p>
<p>Now company y has a product similar to company x, but they have plausible deniability that they copied anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said about the work monks do to support themselves (teaching, making jams/fruitcakes/coffins/honey, etc.), there is the daily running of the Abbey.  </p>
<p>Sacristans take care of the church and religious services.  Guest Master welcomes and sees to the guests.  Kitchen Master oversees the meals/menus/kitchen staff.  The porter answers the door and maybe the main phone line.  The business manager oversees the financial office(s).  There is often an Infirmarian who may be a nurse or nurse practicioner who oversees the in-house infirmary and/or nursing home.  Then you've got the choir master who outlines the liturgies (religious ceremonies) and works with the choir and instrumentalists.  You've got an Oblate Director who manages/organizes programs with people who live on their own, but have a strong, committed tie to the Abbey.  The Development director oversees things like endowments and publicity.  Then there's the monk who oversees the groundskeeping and maybe indoor maintenance, though they may be two jobs, depending on how large of an Abbey it is.  There is the Abbot who is like president/rector of the community who is overseeing it all and has the big picture in mind.  Also, there is the Novice Master who works with new members who join, and the Vocations Director who engages with people out in the world who are interested in learning more about joining the Abbey.  I am sure I am forgetting some others...</p>
<p>In Catholic monasteries, which I'm mostly talking about, some monks are priests, so they will often serve in priestly roles at local parishes, hospitals, prisons, schools, convents, etc.  </p>
<p>So, you've got the stuff that the monks do to support themselves and then the basic housekeeping stuff that is required by a religious community.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pilot here. The weather has a serious effect on aviation so it's extremely important to understand how it works.</p>
<p>Many of the answers in here are either saying &quot;It's because clouds only form in warmer air&quot; and &quot;The clouds insulate the ground preventing the heat escaping. Believe it or not, they are both as accurate as much as they are inaccurate and neither explanation is technically incorrect.</p>
<p>Here's the straight dope though: Clouds have no bearing on whether or not it will be hot or cold, regardless of the time of year or where you live. So what dictates whether it will be hot or cold? That would be the sun and it's position.</p>
<p>In short, clouds are a symptom of a warm day, the clouds themselves do not cause it to be warm. Equally, a lack of cloud does not cause it to be cold. A lack of clouds is <strong><em>because</em></strong> it's a cold day.</p>
<p>So to your question then. Why does it always seem colder when the sky is clear during winter? And why are people insisting that the clouds insulate the earth and make it warmer?</p>
<p>It's actually all to do with air pressure.</p>
<p>Air like all forms of gas has mass and weight. You can't see it but its a physical thing you can touch and move. And like most gassy things on earth, if you heat it up it expands. And by expanding it becomes thinner. This means hot air is thinner and less dense than cold air.</p>
<p>So cold air is thicker and heavy, thus the &quot;pressure&quot; of its weight is high, therefore we have &quot;High&quot; air pressure. Warm air is lighter and less dense and rises more easily, therefore it weighs less and thus its pressure is low, so we have &quot;Low&quot; air pressure.</p>
<p>Us pilots love cold days because the air pressure is high and the air is nice and thick. It makes for some good flyin'. Especially if your in a smaller aircraft, you get to save some fuel too as you can lean your fuel mixture back a bit more! Your also at reduced risking of icing up to a certain point on a cold day (Which surprises most people) which is important because icing is very, very bad on a plane.</p>
<p>The other reason that we like cold days is because clouds cannot form generally below a certain height. This is a massive simplification but clouds form when moisture in the air rises with warm air higher and higher until the air begins to cool down and cools to a point where it can no longer carry the moisture. This is referred to as the &quot;Dew point&quot;. It then forms a cloud. If this process continues long enough to a critical mass within a certain amount of time it becomes rain at some point.</p>
<p>Warm air carries more moisture than cold air because its thinner (Thus lower air pressure). Beyond a certain temperature cold air carries very little moisture indeed. If the air is too cold to carry this moisture (Water vapour) up in the first place, clouds simply cannot form and thus this is the reason you never see clouds on a really cold day.</p>
<p>So why are people banging on about clouds insulating the ground and why are they both right and wrong??</p>
<p>Firstly, as the sun shines on earth, it heats the earth up and some of this heat is radiated back out to space, this much is accurate. However whether clouds have any bearing on this process depends on the time of day.</p>
<p>During the day, if cloud forms it actually prevents the majority of the sunlight from reaching earth and thus absorbs or radiates the heat back into space at the cloud level. The heat never makes it to earth and the effect of this is the day feels cooler. However during the day, cloud itself does very little to insulate the earth's heat because that's basically where clouds are coming from as a I described above.</p>
<p>At night though it's a different story. As the part of earth you're on moves out of the sun's rays and starts to cool, the heat that was absorbed by the planet radiates back out to space. With no cloud coverage, this process happens very quickly and the night becomes quite cold.</p>
<p>However if there are clouds, they absorb some of this radiation and slow the process down and the night feels warmer because it's taking longer for the absorbed heat to be released back to space.</p>
<p>However the rules of cloud creation still very much apply, so if it was cold to begin with during the day, there is likely to be very little cloud in the night. It all depends on how much moisture is in the air.</p>
<p>In order to simplify this I have left quite a bit out of this including how wind is formed from differences in low and high air pressure and hot and cold fronts which complicate things tremendously but you now have a base knowledge of cloud formation in a static atmosphere.</p>
<p>I hope that gives you a greater understanding of it but if you need a TL;DR then that would be this: Clouds form because its warm and do not form when it's cold. If it's a cold day, that is the reason your not seeing any clouds, it's not cold BECAUSE there are no clouds.</p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT: Thank you for the gold kind stranger. Also thank you to /u/devilscolonic who pointed out a paragraph I've messed up somehow by deleting part of it when I added a comma which totally changed its meaning, it was supposed to read:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Especially if your in a smaller aircraft as the plane just wants to climb and its performance is enhanced versus a hot day, though riding thermals on a warm day is fun and you get to save some fuel too as you can lean your fuel mixture back a bit more!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To those who asked (Many!) I mostly fly a Piper PA28 Warrior II and a Cessna 182 these days.</p>
<p>THE EDIT'S EDIT: Many asking various questions so I will respond here. I can't recommend any particular school to learn to become a pilot because I am in the UK and most of you asking are in the US or elsewhere. Also I am biased. However what I do recommend is if you are able to do so, learn on a &quot;Intense&quot; course where you have your lessons as close as possible. There's nothing worse than having a lesson once a month or something like that and your flying instructor has to go back and cover old ground with you because it's been so long since your last lesson. Sporadic lessons probably ends up being more expensive because you need more lessons to cover old ground, even if intense tuition costs more initially.</p>
<p>The best source of information to learn aviation meteorology is the documents your flight school give you or official aviation publications. We tend to use <a href="http://imgur.com/a/yDKCB" target="_blank">this one from AFE</a> (It changes its appearance a lot so this is what it looks like currently) but bear in mind it's got a European slant (Pressures in millibars, UK/European air laws) but the met in it is valid everywhere.</p>
<p>How much to learn to fly? Varies massively depending on skill level. There's a minimum flight time requirement too. I can only quote for the UK but it's gonna be around £6'000 to £8'000.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm simplifying because we are talking about radiation, wavelengths and it may be complicated but long story short it's a matter of radiation balance: the air temperature is the result of the radiation received from the environment. All the radiation comes from the sun  BUT part of that is reflected by (basically) the soil, back towards space and part &quot;stay&quot; on earth (again we're simplifying) . </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>on a cloudy day the reflected part begin a table tennis game between earth and the clouds, effectively being &quot;trapped&quot; and heating the environment</p>
</li>
<li>on a clear day the reflected part isn't blocked by anything and , bye bye, begins its journey in space to infinity and beyond</li>
</ul>

Generally, a clear day is preceded by a clear night, and without a protective cloud blanket, heat escapes into space. Snow would add to this, as on a sunny day the heat from the sun is reflected and not trapped.

<p>Most heat arrives from the sun, and leaves from the surface of the Earth. The ground and water act like big rechargeable heat batteries, soaking up heat from the sun during the day but is ALWAYS releasing it back into space (both day and night).</p>
<p>The amount of heat that the Sun emits is fairly constant (ELI5), and the amount of heat that escapes the surface is fairly constant to a particular location (leaving wind out of the equation and sea level). </p>
<p>Temperature varies with how much heat is arriving minus the amount that is leaving. Practically speaking, assuming you are at a constant location the rate at which heat leaves is constant. So how much heat is arriving is more important. The closer to the Sun more heat arrives (closer to equator/summer). If you are further from the Sun less heat arrives (poles/winter).</p>
<p>Clouds change both the amount of heat arriving at the surface of the Earth and the amount of heat that can leave. They reflect some heat from the Sun back to space and trap some heat close to the surface. How much heat they reflect versus trap depends on how thick they are and how close to the surface they are. High, thin clouds don't trap much heat. Low, thick clouds trap a lot of heat. </p>
<p>When you have a day that is cold and clear it is not because there are no clouds. More heat is getting to the surface than would be trapped (by about 20%). It's because (again assuming no wind and at sea level) you are experiencing the unadulterated balance of heat for your location/time of year/time of day. </p>
<p>Clouds are a symptom of how much water there is in the air and what the temperature is at that point in the atmosphere. Since heat moves through the air both vertically and horizontally it is difficult for someone on the ground to correlate the presence or absence of clouds with the temperature they experience at ground level. It could be warmer or cooler above you and there could be more water or less water in the air in layers above you as well. You will experience cloudy days that are colder than clear days and vice versa.</p>
<p>It's because people think of heat rising straight up (boiling water on the stove) and that you can't see how the air above you is moving without clouds revealing wind speed and direction that it gets confusing to try to correlate the two.</p>
<p>If you live somewhere like Seattle it's even trickier because there is a lot of water and mountains nearby that can cause the air to compress (and warm up) or expand (and cool down).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on where you live, cloudy/overcast days may correlate with wind direction coming from a large body of water. Large bodies of water are usually warmer in the winter than land, so the air coming from that direction will be warmer. Sunny weather correlates with dry continental air, which will be cold.</p>
<p>Another reason is that clouds trap warmth. On clear days, all the warmth gets radiated out into space quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets do some math, per the wiki there <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_trojan" target="_blank">are 1 million</a> that are over 1km in size. They orbit at 5.2 ± 0.15 AU, there are two swarms that are 26° long, and they have orbital inclinations of up to 40° with a width of 0.6AU.</p>
<p>Anyways, those numbers don't agree too tightly to me (orbits should match swarm size, but they don't seem too close, I think the 40 degree number is an extreme and the orbital radius is a small number. So assume each swarm is a cylinder, 26 degrees long (2.4 AU), and 0.3 AU in radius (half the width). That makes each swarm 0.68 AU^3 in volume, and the density of asteroids is 1 million/1.4 AU^3 or 714 thousand asteroids per AU^3.</p>
<p>To get an average distance, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_inter-particle_distance" target="_blank">using this</a> I get 0.874*(3/(4*pi*714000))^(1/3) = 0.006 AU  (someone double check me). Anyways, that works out to just under 900,000km between asteroids which sounds right to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A color changing LED isn't one LED in a package but three LEDs along with a small computer to drive them. The LED is made up of red, green and blue LEDs each of which can be controlled by a microcontroller. Since the two legs on the LED that supply the power are connected to the microcontroller and not the LED elements a current limit resistor is not required.</p>
<p>The microcontroller is able to turn each of the colors on or off, so if the red LED is turned on then the output from the color changing LED is red. When the blue LED is turned on it is blue, if both the blue and red LEDs are turned on then the color changing LED is a shade of purple (called magenta). Similarly combining red with green gives yellow and blue &amp; green gives cyan.</p>
<p>Although the color changing LED uses the six colors mentioned above, it slowly changes from one to another. This is still done using the three basic red, green &amp; blue elements. If the red LED is combined with the blue LED, but the blue LED is only driven at 50% of its normal brightness then a color half way between red and magenta is generated.</p>
<p>Whilst the red LED is left turned on, if the blue LED is slowly taken from 0% brightness to 100% brightness then the color will gradually change from red to magenta.</p>
<p>If a standard LED is turned on and off very quickly, say 100 times every second then as far as the human eye is concerned it looks like it is constantly on. If the amount of time the LED is on for is the same as the time it is off for then it will be on for 50% of the time and 50% of its full brightness.</p>
<p>This same method can be done with the three LED elements inside the color changing LED. This means it is possible to combine any amount of the red, green and blue to give the desired color. Looking once again at the change from red to magenta, if the blue LED starts mainly turned off, goes to being on and off in even amounts and then to mainly being on then the the color will change as required.</p>

You then light a specific one my applying power to the color you want. If you look at large LEDs that can do RGB, they have 4 prongs coming off. You then power the prong you want an bam! Color.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rantonels explained the most important aspect of the answer, that fields are like a fabric and exist without need for constant input. However since you asked specifically about photons I'll try to explain a little bit about why the picture of a charged particle emitting photons is a bit misleading in this situation. </p>
<p>Photons are the &quot;force carrier&quot; particles of the electromagnetic force. However in that role the photons involved are virtual photons which means they only exist temporarily during the interaction of two charged particles. And in a sense these virtual particles should not be thought of as being a real physical picture of what is happening. They are really representations of terms in a large sum. The important thing is that this representation only makes sense in the context of the interaction of two or more charged particles. So in a situation with a single particle there is no sense in which virtual photons are being emitted.</p>
<p>Reading back over that answer I imagine that you will not be satisfied with this explanation. The question of &quot;Yes but how does the photon KNOW the context its in??&quot; still seems reasonable. Without diving into the math the best way I can summarize it is that the force carrying photons are only involved in situations where we assume from the start that there are multiple charged particles involved. They shouldnt be considered to be generating the field but as being generated by the field of interacting charges.</p>
<p>(Yes there are contributions to the self energy where a single particle emits and reabsorbs virtual photons by itself but I can think of absolutely no way to describe this that isnt extremely confusing)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Electromagnetic waves are in some way equivalent to photons flying around and indeed, energy is transported in this case.</p>
<p>But I think for electromagnetic fields you are only allowed to imagine virtual photons as is mentioned in other answers. And they don't inherently carry energy. &quot;Virtual&quot; is a heavy word here and one has to take this seriously.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some other commenters have covered really well how it's still <em>transmitting</em>, so I'll cover a bit of how we're <em>receiving</em>. The signals Voyager transmits are really weak when they get here, and there's a lot of noise in the electromagnetic spectrum, so the signals are way weaker than the noise. &quot;But wait&quot; you might say, &quot;if the signals are weaker than the noise, how can we hear them?&quot; It's a challenge comparable to hearing your friend whispering from across a room full of people talking. We came up with a really clever way to hear them, though.</p>
<p>Basically, it's like this: we take two giant receiver antennas. We point one directly at Voyager, and one just a fraction of a degree off. Both receivers get all of the noise from that area of the sky, but only the first gets Voyager's signal as well. If you subtract the noise  signal from the noise + Voyager signal, what you've got left is just the Voyager signal. This methodology is combined with a lot of fancy error correction coding to eliminate reception errors, and the net effect is the pinnacle of communications technology: the ability to communicate with a tiny craft billions of miles away.</p>

It turns out that if you take something that's really radioactive and has a long half-life, you can use that &quot;cooking&quot; to generate electricity for half a century.  This is called an RTG (Radioisotope thermoelectric generator), and Voyager 1 was launched with one decades ago.  It's not perfect - the plutonium core has decayed enough to force NASA to shut down some instruments for lack of power - but it still works.  The same type of generator powers the Curiosity rover, and many other spacecraft.</p>
<p>As for radio, that's a little more straightforward:  we have really big receivers and powerful transmitters on Earth, as well as really smart error correction.  </p>
<p>EDIT: Here's a picture of a similar plutonium core - it actually glows red-hot:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say a website is using an SSL certificate. That certificate is just something that says something like &quot;I am reddit and nobody can impersonate me&quot;. Now obviously SSL certificates websites offer up can simply be copied, so to authenticate themselves, the certificate includes a public key, and they have their private key which isn't shared, and the keys are mathematically linked, but the one can't be derived from the other (feasibly) they can only be created together, and the odds of you randomly generating an already existing key is miniscule, and when something is encrypted with one key, the other can decrypt it, and vice versa.</p>
<p>So what's to stop websites from simpy generating their SSL certificates? Nothing, so to actually prove that the website you're connecting to is the real deal, they have their certificates signed by a higher authority, and you automatically trust that authority, even though you have no idea because it comes preloaded in your browser. It's like government issued IDs, if someone shows you their driver's license, you have reasonable cause to believe their age on that card is the truth. The certificate authority signs other people's certificates with their own private key, which is also not shared, but can be verified with their public key.</p>
<p>So how does signing work? It's basically hashing and encrypting put together. Hashing is a function where you take a block of data and trim it down to a unique result that it isn't feasible to find a different block of data that returns the same result, so hashing can't (generally) be broken. Then it works like this, websites have their certificate, the certificate authority hashes it, and then encrypts the hash with their private key, which in turn spits out the digital signature</p>
<p>Now when you connect to a website, they serve you their signed certificate, which includes their public key and their digital signature which was signed by the certificate authority's private key, and you have the certificate authority's public key already preloaded in your browser. You take their certificate, hash it yourself, and then you take their digital signature, decrypt it with the certificate authority's public key. If they both match, then they're legit. Now this only proves that the website you're connecting to has a certificate that's correctly signed by a certificate authority. To prove that it is actually them you're connecting to, they send a verifiable block of data signed with their own private key, which you test with their public key. </p>
<p>So at the end you have reasonable cause to believe that the website you're connecting to is who they say they are, and their story is confirmed by a higher authority at the same time. At this point you know you're actually connecting to the website you're trying to connect. So how is any further data you exchange protected?</p>
<p>You generate a key, this time a symmetric key that's used for both encryption and decryption. You encrypt it with the website's public key and send it, and the website decrypts it with their private key, which only they can. This key can't be compromised because you confirmed the website's certificate (which contains their public key), and only that website can decrypt anything you encrypt with their public key, so at the end both you and the website have a key that was encrypted during transmission and it's used to encrypt any data you exchange from this point on.</p>
<p>Which brings another question, after the certificate is verified why can't we just continue encrypting stuff with their public key? Why do we have to generate a symmetric key and send it to the server? Because while you'll be able to send data securely to the server, the server in turn can't because anything they encrypt with their public key will be readable by anyone, and also because the algorithm used for the public/private key encryption is very slow, so it's only used at the start, after a which a faster algorithm is used. What algorithm to use is decided during the initial phase by both the browser and server telling each other their capabilities.</p>
<p>For some real world example, let's take reddit. If you click on the top left green locked key sign, you should be able to see reddit's certificate, and that it's signed by DigiCert Inc. If you go into more detail and view it, you should be able to see reddit's public key, and their digital signature signed by DigiCert Inc.</p>
<p>Edit: Minor correction, thanks /u/a_2</p>
<p>Edit2: Added another reason for using symmetric keys for encryption, arguable the main reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like passing encrypted notes back and forth to a friend in class. You use a cipher so the teacher or other students cannot read the message. Except your 3rd friend who is really good at math, created the cipher and is the only one who can verify if the note that you received was actually sent from your friend.</p>
<p>It should be noted that you can trust this 3rd friend to verify the notes correctly because you guys have been best friends basically forever, and everyone else trusts him too because he is so trustworthy.  </p>
<p>Edit: As a follow-up to your other questions, SSL is technically crackable, it's just not feasible to do so because with modern SSL, each packet would take days or weeks to crack. So the more feasible thing to do is setup a proxy server that intercepts SSL traffic, decrypts it, records it, and re-encrypts it the same way so the receiver never knows it was intercepted in the first place. Businesses do this to spy on their employees encrypted traffic, and the NSA basically does this at major internet relay points so they can spy on everybody. </p>
<p>SSL just makes it so the average computer nerd can't spy on you, you have to have money to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may no longer be the case, but this style of encryption was explained to me like this.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a message and you want to send it to your mate.</p>
<p>You have a box with the message inside.  You add a padlock to the box and lock it, then send the box to your mate.</p>
<p>Your mate then adds his own padlock to the box and sends the box back to you, now with both locks locking it.</p>
<p>You remove your padlock from the box and send the box to your mate (now only with their padlock locking the box).</p>
<p>He removes his lock, opens the box and reads the message &quot;FU MFER!&quot;</p>
<p>So, you've exchanged a message, no one in between was able to intercept it, and neither of you had to give each other sensitive stuff like keys and passwords.</p>
<p>Replace the box with a packet of data (or a frame or whatever the term the network bods are using these days) and the padlocks with encryption and it's sort of the same thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much of the public key encryption part of SSL has been covered.  However we should discuss SSL Offload and SSL Intercept, which are both methods that can be used for both legitimately and maliciously.</p>
<p>SSL Offload is used to store the server's SSL private key and issue the server's public SSL certificate on a proxy device that is not the server itself.  There are multiple security and scaling reasons why a site may use a proxy to terminate SSL sessions.  For example, the proxy may be a load-balancer that is distributing traffic across multiple servers that share a common SSL certificate.  The proxy may also be a deep packet inspection device that needs to decrypt the SSL traffic and inspect it before it send it on to that actual server.  But with SSL Offload, the SSL certificate used belong to the intended server, even if it is stored on the proxy</p>
<p>SSL Intercept does a similar function, except the SSL certificate belongs to the proxy device and not the end server.  For example, your company may want to inspect outbound SSL traffic from your computer, to ensure you and not transmitting sensitive information.  With SSL Intercept, the proxy device terminates your SSL session using its own certificate, inspects the unencrypted traffic, then re-encrypts the traffic into an SSL session with the actual server you're communicating with.  It may be that you company requires you to install its own SSL Cert Server certificate used to generate and sign the proxy's SSL certificate, so that you don't get a bunch of nasty warning messages about an unverified SSL certificate.</p>
<p>Two other things to think about.  First, many Android/iOS apps use SSL to encrypt sessions, but rely on 'anonymous' SSL.  This is when neither the client nor the server verify the authenticity of the presented SSL certificate, they just do the encryption.  Unfortunately, anonymous SSL is a lot more common than people think, and is subject to man-in-the-middle attacks</p>
<p>Second, many sites are now making use of certificate pinning, where a session to a server will fail unless the SSL session is verified end-to-end.  With certificate pinning, methods like SSL Offload and SSL Intercept will fail</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The &quot;certificate authority&quot; holds the official other half of the pendant for whoever owns the certificate. So you take your half of the pendant to the certificate authority and ask them if it fits.</p>
<p>If the two sides of the pendant match, you know for sure you must've got the original message from the real deal. If they don't match, you know someone tried to fake the pendant.</p>
<p>If the pendant is very complex, with hundreds of tiny interlocking parts, then bad people can't make copies that fit the hidden half perfectly, even if they can steal your half. That's how the math behind SSL certificates work: the part you get combines with the other parts to make a &quot;whole&quot;, but the part you get isn't enough information to guess what the other part looks like. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In most any legal proceeding, there are questions of <strong>fact</strong> and questions of <strong>law</strong>. My answer will focus primarily on criminal law. Let's look at an example of a man who was arrested for selling what he thought was cocaine, but lab tests later revealed that the substance was only baking powder. </p>
<p>Here we have a question of law. Does somebody commit the crime of intent to distribute cocaine if the substance they were selling wasn't cocaine, but they thought it was? Or must the charges be dismissed? The judge is the <strong>finder of law</strong>. His or her job is to answer the legal questions posed by the situation. </p>
<p>Let's say that the judge determined that thinking that what you have is cocaine is enough for the charge to stand. The case proceeds to trial, and a jury is selected. The jury is the <strong>finder of fact</strong>. Their job is to listen to the evidence, and decide if the government has proven, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the defendant did intend to distribute cocaine. They don't deal with the legal issues. Their only job is to consider what actually <em>happened</em>.</p>
<p>Judges also maintain other roles. They maintain order in the courtroom, rule on the admissibility of evidence, and deal with everything that happens before and after the trial (taking guilty pleas, setting dates, hearing motions, considering sentencing). In some situations, the defendant will ask for the judge to decide the entire case, without a jury. In other situations, the defendant is not even entitled to a jury, and the judge is automatically the finder of both law and fact. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a public defender (trial attorney) for 5 years, here's a short (I'll do my best but attorneys tend to talk a lot) version of what judges do.</p>
<p>First thing's first. There's A LOT that happens that aren't trials. Depending on where you live in the states 95-99% of criminal cases are resolved with plea deals and never have a trial, and therefore no jury is ever assigned. Judges in these situations typically just keep things moving (make sure the police files are getting sent over in time and that lawyers are doing what they need to do in a timely manner), make sure that the accused understands their rights and the plea they are taking or rejecting, and then sentencing. </p>
<p>Sentencing is a big part of the judge's job. Unlike television most states don't let people agree to a specific sentence in a plea, you have to have a range of sentencing (i.e. you don't sign a pea to four years in prison, you sign a plea to 3-5). Judges decide the sentence within that range and are required to give sentences &quot;specific&quot; to the circumstances. This typically means they read briefs from both attorneys on the facts and additionally have the accused submit to an interview regarding their life circumstances, which can be quite time consuming given that a judge is probably giving 5-20 sentences a day. </p>
<p>Trial actually doesn't have a ton of work for judges (I've had judges fall asleep in trial), their main responsibility there is to rule on objections. 90% of these are very straight forward and literally take seconds to resolve. The other 10% are supposed to be handled before trial (called motions in limine) and take maybe an hour, though I have seen the occasional one take an entire day. Other than that they don't do much in trial, it's pretty much the attorney's show (A lot of judges don't really like trials, they have a lot of work to do and don't really like just sitting around watching the trial).</p>
<p>Another redditor mentioned &quot;questions of law,&quot; and while they are technically correct it's worth pointing out that questions of law are generally handled by appellate judges not trial level judges. Trial level judges don't really have the authority to decide questions of law, instead attorney's brief them on the state of law and then the judge applies what appears to be the most relevant and recent law to the current situation. For example if you go to a judge and say 'the police searched me illegally' the judge doesn't say the police should or shouldn't have done what they did, they just find the most similar existing case-law and follow that decision. </p>
<p>Appellate courts at the highest level (Supreme Court of the U.S. and various states) will decide true questions of law. They are the only ones with the authority to change existing legal rulings and decide what the rule is in new unheard-of situations. This is all pretty simplified though.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Am lawyer, would guess 90% of what a judge does is sentencing and making sure cases move through the system quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Judges still make many decisions. They rule on motions, they can dismiss jurors, decide what juries can see or hear. Judges have to make sure that all of the procedures and rules are followed so that a guilty verdict will not be reversed on appeal.</p>
<p>And a judge has the power to throw out a jury verdict if he thinks they got it wrong.</p>
<p>We need judges since there are bench trials, no jury, the judge decides the verdict. </p>
<p>Although due to mandatory minimums and sentencing laws limit judges power, they still have some power in sentencing.</p>

<p>It anchors the small intestine (9m of tubing!) to a small area (about 15-30cm in length). It also conveys blood vessels to supply the small intestine along its course. </p>
<p>The fan structure is then pleated like a Scottish kilt to fold into the abdomen. Having played around with it in the dissection room, it's a very smooth structure which allows some sliding and makes it difficult to tie knots in the small intestine.</p>

<p>The only reason this 'news' is surfacing is because it has been rebranded from supporting tissue to organ. The definition of organ is: a part of an organism which is typically self-contained and has a specific vital function.

It's function so far is to hold the intestines in place so they aren't sloshing around your abdomen. Whether it's an actual new organ remains to be seen as apparently most have a unique function and cell type distinguishing them from connective tissue or muscle etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
