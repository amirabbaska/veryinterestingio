		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egg yolks are incredible emulsifiers; they help fat-based and water-based substances form finer blends. If you took a (pasteurized) raw egg yolk and added to it your salad dressing of oil and vinegar, you'd find that the the whole thing would form a creamy suspension that would stay together for a while. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the egg white are basically water and protein, which as /u/mb34i said can do some pretty impressive tricks. The bonus is that the fat in the yolks, and the water in the whites already have an emulsifier in the yolk; the egg is a complete kit to emulsify itself and anything else. An omelette, or scrambled eggs, is just such an emulsion, cooked. On its own, the white can also be whipped up into a tight froth and used to add air and volume to something that would otherwise not be raised, such as meringue, souffle, or mousse. </p>
<p>When you add all of those things and use them in different combinations, you have the reason for eggs popularity in cuisine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

But what makes them useful is that the proteins in the egg white unfold and bind to each other when heated, congealing from liquid to a jelly-like solid.  Thus, adding egg whites to a recipe is like adding a non-toxic (and actually quite nutritious) glue that will hold together whatever the other ingredients are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egg whites specifically are pretty unique in that it's largely made up of protein, but it's not all bunched up and stiff. When you heat it, the water evaporates and the proteins stiffen up. That's why you use eggs so often in baking; it's like the glue that keeps baked goods together.</p>
<p>The yolks, however, are mostly fat, so it's usually used when you are looking for more flavors or for an egg wash to make baked goods shiny.</p>
<p>And of course there are many recipes that call for eggs just for the sake of having them; many people like the taste and texture. I personally don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

When you take away the flame, it has enough embers and residual heat to continue smoldering, but without the heat of the flame the result is incomplete combustion resulting in smoke and soot. </p>
<p>Details: </p>
<p>What is smoke? It's soot, and carbon compounds, tar, aerosols, un burned fuel, and other components of incomplete combustion. When a fire burns brightly and hotly, it efficiently combines oxygen with carbon to make carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide, and with hydrogen to make water vapor. </p>
<p>If all of the hydrocarbons and organic material being burned are done so cleanly, then there is very little smoke and instead an almost pure reaction resulting in carbon dioxide and  water which are odorless and transparent gases. IE not smoke. </p>
<p>When a flame is extinguished but there is still a lot of latent heat, the process of burning is snuffed out resulting in incomplete transformation into the water and carbon dioxide, leading to incomplete compounds which create the soot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Fire requires 3 pieces to exist: heat, oxygen, &amp; fuel. Water reduces the heat of the fire. Halogen removes the oxygen. The fire may be reduced in its ability to reignite but the fine particles of ash already produced can still become airborne, hence smoke long after the fire is out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A candle is a good example of why this happens. </p>
<p>The liquid fuel gets drawn up into the wick, gets hot, vaporizes, and if there is fire, it burns, turning most of the fuel into invisible gas.</p>
<p>The wick is really hot though, so if you blow out the fire, it still makes the liquid fuel evaporate, but it doesn't burn, it just cools off in air and forms smoke particles.</p>
<p>The same thing happens for other things that burn. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking like putting water on it to put it out,  it's a lot of steam from the water. Otherwise a fire is a chemical reaction. The heat breaks it down into other chemicals. Always H2O and CO2, and then whatever else the material is made out of. Which is why when you use a lighter or BBQ you don't get a lot, if any smoke. The fuel is made of hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon. If it has, say zinc, that isn't a part of CO2 or H2O, so you are seeing the zinc. But also in early and late stages, the fire is not enough to keep up the full reaction, so that smoke is actually the tree it self. Very fine particles, the sap being turned to gas, etc. Firm that reason the smoke is very dangerous. Not only is it flammable, but since it's all spread out it has a higher surface area, and is even more so flamable. Almost to the point if explosion. You can see this in flower mill, or sawdust catching fire. Or the mythbusters episode when they blew up coffee creamer. Or in the case of a fire/smoke a flash over or back draft. Watch a video on YouTube of that and you can see the smoke itself is burning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Commercial ice makers form ice from the bottom up, this lets the gas escape. Additionally they may use water that was additionally filtered through a carbon tank to remove off flavors, water softener to reduce calcium and other minerals, or reverse osmosis to make it &quot;pure&quot; water.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clear commercial ice is made in a machine called a Clinebell chiller. It freezes water from the bottom up, and as the ice freezes it forces dissolved air and other impurities upwards into the unfrozen water above the ice. Before all the water is frozen, the &quot;dirty&quot; unfrozen water is discarded, and the clear frozen column is then removed and cut up.</p>
<p>You can approximate this at home by taking one of those styrofoam coolers and filling it with (filtered then boiled then cooled to room temp) water, and then placing it (without the lid) into your freezer. It will freeze from the top down, and will force any impurities into the remaining liquid water, like a Clinebell in reverse. When about 2/3 of the water is frozen, remove the block of ice. It should be almost perfectly clear. Discard the remaining water, which will look dirty beyond belief.  Then cut up the block of ice into 1&quot; cubes for your artisinal-style cocktails.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The short answer for commercial Ice Machines is that they circulate water over the evaporator (where the ice is mace) so that Ice forms almost like an icicle. This means that no air bubbles are in the ice: it's pure water. </p>
<p>In an ice cube tray or an ice maker in a residential freezer, cups are filled with water and frozen. The air is frozen in with it. This is why sometimes the ice tastes bad: whatever odors are in the air in your freezer are being frozen in with the ice.</p>

The best way to accomplish this is a small insulated container filled with water placed inside of the freezer. The ice will form from the top down, driving the air into the liquid water below. When the layer of ice on top reaches the desired thickness, (which may take 24 hours or more), remove it from the freezer and cut it into cubes. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/7CuaIt9.jpg" target="_blank">my cubes</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tend to disagree with the premise of this ELI5 on the whole. Specifically, I believe there may be a stigma about the goal of 'getting drunk' in certain groups, but there are certainly those who 'party hard' for the sake of being drunk as a group. Age has nothing to do with it. I've been out with 40 somethings that party harder than I can handle. And frankly - That's ok. As long as they aren't a public nuisance or a danger to themselves/others... have fun!</p>
<p>Cultures also vary. Someone mentioned pulling out a joint at a party of kids - it has a stigma associated with it in some circles for the same reason that (at least today) smoking cigarettes around kids has a stigma. But there are also groups who don't care about that either...</p>
<p>I also think that lumping all recreational drugs into a singular 'getting high' and separating out alcohol as a different state (i.e., 'drunk') does a disservice to the positive aspects of certain drugs. Caffeine, for example, is a drug that is almost universally socially accepted. The 'wakefulness' is its high, and the impacts on productivity are dramatically positive, and there are (as with all things) some negative aspects that have to be considered on an individual basis. But we don't see headlines about the epidemic of coffee addicts in this country, because on the whole we perceive it as a positive thing. </p>
<p>I think another perspective I disagree with are the comments on the 'historical societal value' of alcohol vs. other drugs. While there is going to be some fundamental truth to the fact that the flavor and experience of drinking an alcoholic beverage is inextricably linked to culinary culture, I think comments like that seem to dismiss the appreciation that cultures have had in history for those 'other recreational drugs'. There are numerous accounts of creative people who have found themselves better able to find that sense of 'flow' when they've smoked pot. Some liken it to the ancient greeks 'muses', and there are many ancient historical references to the use of cannabis in Greece (<del>Bacchus</del> (thanks /u/Hixhen) Dionysus knew how to party - yo.)</p>
<p>It might also help to separate out unproductive 'stoners' from 'marijuana enthusiasts' because that distinction is lost on most people, who seem to lump the two together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The only difference is that there's a level above drunk when you take it too far, which is getting wasted, which is not the goal (usually). With alcohol, people are searching for that perfect level where you lower your inhibitions, it's easier to socialize, everything seems very fun and you're still in control of yourself for the most part.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I belong to neither culture, but I have been drunk and I have been high. </p>
<p>Every time I get drunk, the situation varies. Most times, say like 80%  I get super happy, super outgoing, and become just a generally jolly guy. Say about 17% of the time, I get super emotional, crying, laughing, crying more, yadda yadda. Then say about 3% of the time I get angry and mean. This is rare, and generally it's based on some stimuli, like the time my ex picked a fight with me that led to her being my ex. </p>
<p>Now, every time I've gotten high, the same thing has happened: I get super mellow, have a brief moment of panic, then I get mellow again, and I enter a chill mode. I've never gotten angry, I've never gotten sad, it's always basically been chill. </p>
<p>I've hung out with people you could say are part of drinking culture.  For some of them, the end goal is to get drunk. For most though, it's just to get buzzed. I've also known people who just like to drink a beer or some type of liquor for the taste. </p>
<p>I don't know if this is what you were looking for but I hope it helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The effective time that a president can actually govern is a lot shorter than most people think it is.</p>
<p>Congress is elected every 2 years, and they are fairly unlikely to actually get anything done in the year before an election (since everyone's focus is on campaigning, no one wants to take direction from the president during this time).  So your second year is basically toast.  The last year you are running for reelection, so it's toast too.  You only really get your first and third years to do shit.</p>
<p>So the president starts January 21st as their first full day.  Congress is basically useless after December 31st, but nothing happens over Christmas so let's make it Dec 1st. And you lose August since that's Congress's summer break.  So you only really get 9 months in that first year.  </p>
<p>So when it comes down to it, the number 100 is selected basically brutally but it's around 1/3 of your total effective time in the first 2 years.  It's long enough that you should have had time to build your government and get your people confirmed, then move on to the most important parts of making legislation. </p>
<p>In a normal (nontrump) world, legislation is a LONG process.  You start it by proposing a bill, then there's endless debate and amendments before the damn thing actually gets voted on.  For big plans, this can take a long time.  Obamacare took something like 18 months.  So if a president wants to make something happen in their first term, they REALLY need to have already started on it within that first 100 days.</p>
<p>So while the actual 100 number is somewhat arbitrary, having a measuring point for a new president is actually quite useful.</p>
<p>As for why it's not shorter, it takes a few months to get the confirmations through with.  So making it something like 60 days does not have much time for the president to turn their attention to legislation.  Longer might make sense, but really a president does not get very much time and if you make it longer you start to get away from their &quot;beginning&quot; of the presidency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The very first line in the book, &quot;The president of the United States gets 100 days to prove himself; you get 90.&quot; It goes on to assert that success within those first few months can go a long way in setting the stage for later success or failure. Part of that onboarding period is when you build your team, start developing and aligning your strategy with how things actually work, earn some early successes, etc. So while the 100 days number may be arbitrary, the concept of &quot;early wins&quot; should not be a foreign concept to a businessperson.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>-0 K. No, that's not a typo.</p>
<p>So every answer that you've gotten here concerning the Planck Temperature or the motion of atoms is, bluntly, dead wrong. This is because temperature <strong>does not</strong> correlate directly with motion; that approximation only works on the lower end of the temperature scale, and is a result of the way in which we typically measure temperature. Bear with me cause this gets <strong>weird</strong>, but is the correct answer (inb4 muh 5 year olds).</p>
<p>The <em>actual</em> way in which temperature is defined is through the interrelationship between a piece of matters' entropy (a measure of how &quot;disordered&quot; or &quot;useless&quot; it is, for lack of a better word), and its energy (which would include its motion). Don't worry about precisely what entropy is (that is honestly and ELI5 in-and-of-itself, and involves one of the more sorcerous scientific fields that confuses the hell out of everyone who studies it), just take it on faith that it's just a measurable thermodynamic quantity. If you're familiar with calculus, the actual definition is;</p>
<p>T=dU/dS ~ ΔU/ΔS</p>
<p>where U and S are the energy and entropy, respectively, and ΔU and ΔS are the <em>changes</em> in those quantities as you increase the temperature (or, more accurately, temperature is caused by how those two changes occur alongside one another).</p>
<p>Starting at the low end of the temperature scale, as you increase an objects temperature, you gradually increase its entropy <em>and</em> its energy, but the entropy increase actually starts to diminish as you get to higher and higher temperatures. This is why temperature increases, mathematically; for constant steps of dU, the dS gets smaller, and so you're dividing a given number (say, 1) by another number that's getting smaller and smaller with each step you take. Thus, there is a given state where you add some finite amount of energy, and the entropy change is near zero. At this point, you're approaching a temperature of infinite, as the dU is basically not changing, while the dS is getting smaller and smaller, approaching zero.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/578/024/a8c.jpg" target="_blank">Now lets get weird</a>; give it more energy, and the entropy will <strong>decrease</strong>. Thus, you'll have the same dU, divided by a <em>negative</em> and very small dS, giving you a temperature approaching <em>negative infinite K</em>. Give it even more energy, and the dS term (while still negative) continues to get smaller and smaller in magnitude; thus, as you heat the object more and more, the temperature decreases in magnitude. Eventually, you reach a state where the entropy decrease becomes arbitrarily large, thus you get a finite dU divided by a really big dS, which will approach -0. As a result, the hottest possible temperature is -0 K, and the ordering from coldest to hottest is as follows;</p>
<p>0 K &lt; 300 K &lt; ∞ K &lt; -∞ K &lt; -300 K &lt; -0 K</p>
<p>This has shown up in both advanced thermodynamics and quantum mechanics, and has also been <a href="http://physicscentral.com/explore/action/negative-temperature.cfm" target="_blank">experimentally verified.</a></p>
<p>It's important to note that this is a screwy scale that makes a lot of the math we use fall apart, but this is largely due to the fact that our entire concept of temperature, and how we measure it, is actually hilariously complicated and flawed (although still very useful, because you don't see those negative temperatures in your day-to-day existence).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Secondly electromagnetic modelling software has made amazing jumps in the ability to model complex structures, like HFSS and Feko. So designers can embed antennas in places they never could before, like most cars have the fm antenna in the wind screen. </p>

<p>Profit is the answer you're looking for. In 2000 I designed the rear backlight (rear window) of the Bentley Continental GT.
It had 26 (near invisible) antennas built into the laminated glass and obscuration band.</p>
<p>Those 26 antennas captured all radio (analogue and digital), TV, Satellite, WiMAX etc signals for every overseas continent. All options.</p>
<p>The cost to Bentley was £450 ($600) per window, back then. So the technology was available (and had been for some time) back in 2000, it just didn't come cheap.</p>

<p>Antennas resonate with radio wavelength. They can resonate on different ratios of wavelength, those ratios are 1/4, 1/2, 1 and maybe 3/2.</p>
<p>Electrical length and physical length of antenna arent the same, even thought they are closely related.</p>
<p>There are techniques to increase or decrease electrical length of antenna. These techniques take capacitor or inductor added to antenna.</p>
<p>So you pick 1/4 wavelength antenna, you can add inductor to its base which will increase its electrical length, so the physical length can be shorter.</p>
<p>With radio frequency of 100MHz wavelength is 3m. 1/4 is 75cm, which can be shortened further.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

A sprain affects the ligaments that connect bones to joints and can vary from a snapped ligament down to just a ligament that has a twist. What I believe you're thinking of is a strain and the easiest way to understand that is to look at a picture of striated muscle tissue and imagine all those little lines as rubber bands, when you strain the muscle some of the rubber bands snap.</p>
<p>[edit] I'm an EMT by the way and we basically treat sprains, strains, and closed non angulated fractures all the same way. The treatment is basically the same, immobilize it, ice it, and go easy on it. If you have concerns go get an X-ray cause that's the only way to be 100% sure if it's fractured </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned before, you don't &quot;sprain&quot; a muscle.  Generally speaking you &quot;strain&quot; a muscle.  When you sprain/strain a muscle you damage the muscle fibres - you stretch, break, bruise, mash, etc the tissue of the muscle.  When you damage the muscle tissue (soft tissues) you will then get inflammation.  </p>
<p>What is inflammation?  It is essentially a fluid.  What's in the fluid?   The fluid consists mainly of a matrix made up of dead cells and repairing or rejuvenating cells.  Initially this matrix of cells is very liquidy - the area of muscle becomes swollen (bigger), hot, painful and difficult to move.  Over time (after about 1 week) the inflammation then becomes thicker and stiffer.  This thicker and stiffer substance is called scar tissue.  This scar tissue has  formed from the initial liquidy inflammation around the injured muscle.  The scar tissue then &quot;patches in&quot; the strain/sprain area of the muscle.    </p>
<p>The scar tissue is just like a scar on your skin, but is like a scar on your muscle.  Your muscle cannot grow new muscle fibers, so it repairs/heals itself with scar tissue that is formed from the initial inflammation.  The whole process, generally speaking, takes about 4 to 6 weeks depending on the severity of the injury.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to other well written replies here : in old Latin they would call inflammation caused by events such as sprain as follows : calor (heat) dolor (pain) rubor (redness) tumor (swelling). They are all basically caused by the infiltration of immune cells (white blood cells and others) to &quot;clean up&quot; any damaged tissue or strained muscle that can lead to loss of tissue integrity. Because​ immune cells from the lymph have to squeeze through to get through the cells lining the lymphatic or blood vessels, they cause this swelling followed by fluid from the lymph accumulating as a result. This causes the pain and redness as well. Once they repair the damaged cells they die or migrate back to local lymph nodes subsiding the swelling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Significant spot reduction of fat isn't a thing.</p>
<p>There was a 2007 study by University of Connecticut that had people exercise one arm for 12 weeks and measured the fat on both arms before and after the 12 weeks, and showed the fat loss was general over the body. There was also a 1971 study that looked at tennis players (who use one arm a lot more than the other) that found both arms had similar thicknesses of fat.</p>
<p>There has been another study from 2007 that suggest a slight link between heavier exercise and minimal spot reduction, but I haven't read that paper or seen it reported in a scientific magazine so I don't have much confidence in that study as evidence spot reduction works.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of really good answers and this will probably end up buried, but for the couple of redditors that do read this. </p>
<p>The geist of everything that's been written is, don't bother with spot reduction, your body loses fast all around at the same time. This is a good enough ELI5.</p>
<p>Bringing the explanation up a notch.</p>
<p>When fat it's first stored, it will go to specific parts of your body first. This will depend on 2 things: Your DNA and your Sex Hormones at that moment.</p>
<p>This makes it possible, for example, if a man gains fat at a period when his estrogen is high ( puberty, environmental factor, medication, disease, etc ) he can put fat in places where woman usually put on fat, on the hips, ass and breast areas.  </p>
<p>A general tendency it's that male sex Hormones creates a tendency towards belly fat and female sex Hormones creates a tendency towards hips, ass and breast. Low on both gives more tendency for evenly distributed fat all around including arms and chin.</p>
<p>Now knowing that there is an order in which your body puts on fat, there is also an order in which the body metabolises the fat. This is the reverse of when you put on.</p>
<p>So here's a practical example.</p>
<p>Let's imagine a man put on some fat when he is 13 years old and got fat is his breast area, because his estrogen was high during puberty. Then at 22 he put on more fat on his belly. </p>
<p>At 25 he wants to lose the fat is his breast because he is self conscious about it. Doing chest exercise will not help. For him to lose the fat in his breast he will have to first lose the fat in his belly and only then he will lose it in his breast.</p>
<p>The order is Last fat In First fat Out ( LIFO ).</p>
<p>Of course keep in mind that rarely does the body put on fat in just one spot, usually it puts on in one place more than all the rest, but we are keeping it simple for the sake of the explanation.</p>
<p>As far as we know right now, there is no way to change the order in which we lose fat. We also don't know how the body identifies which fat cells put on fat last.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are either in anabolic state or catabolic state.  That is to say, your body is absorbing and or storing what you just ate OR you are catabolic and your body is taking from its stores.</p>
<p>These two states are regulated by little messengers in your body called hormones. Certain ones tell fat cells to release energy, others tell them to store. </p>
<p>Thing is, those hormones are released in the blood stream and travel all over the body. You can't really pick and choose where they go.</p>
<p>When you are anabolic, those hormones tell fat cells &quot;hey bro, we have more energy floating around than we need, store this up for later.&quot;</p>
<p>When you are catabolic, those hormones say &quot;hey we need more energy, hook us up fat cells.&quot;</p>
<p>This is also why it's hard to gain lean muscle but not fat. You have to be anabolic, your muscle cells need to be all like &quot;we are swole bro, we need protein.&quot;</p>
<p>So your anabolic hormones will be running around storing up anything, proteins in muscle cells AND energy in fat cells. </p>
<p>It becomes a tricky but not impossible line to walk.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood circulates everywhere all at once, only definitely passing through the heart and lungs in a particular order (edit: and the gut to the liver). Different areas of fat can have different quantities of receptors for different hormones. Some cells are more sensitive to testosterone or estrogen or cortisol or insulin or adrenalin or whatnot than others. This is why your ass gets fat but your forehead doesn't. Which receptors go where is determined by both genetics and environment/lifestyle.</p>
<p>How fat you get is determined by how many excess calories you eat. How many excess calories you eat is determined by your hunger. Your hunger is determined by a lot of things, but the hormones leptin and ghrelin, which turn off and on hunger, respectively, are the big two. Leptin sensitivity seems to be closely related to insulin sensitivity. Insulin sensitivity seems to be closely related to viceral fat, particularly liver fat. Liver fat is mostly a function of fructose and polyunsaturated fats, but alcohol contributes, too. The fructose and alcohol because they're processed there, the fat because unsaturated fats are unstable and oxidize readily and the liver holds on to those rancid fats until it can decontaminate them, which it's not that great at.</p>
<p>It gets more complicated from there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The salaries of celebrities (be it an athlete, actor, musician, etc) have outpaced those of traditional workers/employees precisely because celebrities aren't traditional workers. Celebrities attract unique attention, and that attention can be leveraged and monetized. And over time, celebrities have gotten better at leveraging that attention, and brands/companies have gotten better at profiting from it. It has, in other words, to do mainly with visibility. </p>
<p>Someone who is 'traditionally' employed by a company gets paid relative to the role they occupy, to what they're tasked with. An athlete might be hired and paid in a similar fashion, in theory, but the key difference is that their role, and what they're tasked with by default has an <em>audience</em>. This makes them more valuable, in a number of ways. Put simply, celebrities exhibit desirable talents and traits in a very visible way. Because these talents and traits are desirable, and often idealized, what celebrities commonly do plays upon emotions. </p>
<p>Musicians and actors give a voice to what people are feeling, or wish they could themselves say, or how they wish they could look or behave. Athletes exercise physical and mental acuity in sports, pull off great feats, etc. And because sports have over time become popular to the point that they're tied to people's identities and dreams, they likewise act as an example of who people wish they could be. TV personalities and models and whoever else also offer a fantasy or a target for people's aspirations - how they want to look, how they want to behave, how they want to be seen, how they want to live. And on a lighter note, all of these people offer entertainment and even distraction.</p>
<p>So you might see how this can all be monetized. What marketing does is play into people's emotions - &quot;Buy (x) to be more attractive,&quot; &quot;Buy (y) to be faster&quot;. And to attach a product which plays upon these desires to a person who epitomizes them? Doubly powerful. As for more traditional jobs, no one is idolizing a lawyer sitting in their office working on a brief. No one (or not many) people are going to want the clothes <em>that lawyer</em> is wearing, or go see a movie that lawyer is in, were they somehow, for some reason, hired for a role in a movie.  </p>
<p>What's interesting about today's world, though, is that we're basically seeing experiments in this. In today's world, a lawyer can start a youtube channel. A teacher can have an instagram. They can find the people who might in fact idolize them, want to be like them, live like them. I think that's great. Maybe they won't be handed a $30-mil a year contract, but they can certainly find ways to make money. There are people in all walks of life and professions making a pretty penny by way of the platforms out there, and the attention they can net. </p>

Cleaners work very hard and long hours, but you can get someone else in to take over a job immediately with little training if someone quits, so they are paid crap money. Doctors/nurses/teachers are always in high supply because they are jobs that people want to do regardless of the pay, so they don't get paid much either. </p>
<p>Celebrities that bring in lots of money for companies because of who they are as individuals are quite hard to replace. If you don't pay Dwayne Johnson enough to do the job you can't get another Dwayne Johnson. With movies, particularly, up until around the 60s (not exactly sure) there used to be a studio system where an actor/musician/director/writer etc. would sign a contract with the movie studio and they couldn't do a film for another studio until their contract was up or the studio allowed it - it's a bit like comic book movie franchises at the moment. Because actors were contractually tied to studios they couldn't demand ridiculous salaries or threaten not to make the movie, and when there are only a handful of studios the bidding wars can't really get that high when contract renewals come around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As actors/athletes/anyone stipulate that they are worth $X, and a studio/team/employer pays that, then that's the going rate.</p>
<p>If the movie is a runaway blockbuster, or the team wins the championship, that contract is likely to be renewed or extended. The price goes up.</p>
<p>If the movie flops, the player tanks, or (more often) the latest/greatest star/player is coming up and will work/play for less, out with the old, in with the new.</p>
<p>In the movie and sports business, the &quot;market&quot; is inflated relative to Joe Schmoe, but as long as the studio/team is making money, the price will be paid. And the staying power of a few &quot;stars&quot; (Alex Rodriguez, Jennifer Aniston) that exceed the standard curve are not indicative of the more &quot;rank and file&quot; members of the group. They are &quot;sure bets&quot; and are worth a premium. Look at the average career of an MLB/NFL/NBA/etc player, or how many &quot;huge&quot; roles an &quot;average&quot; actor had. Those &quot;careers&quot; are short, perhaps sweet.</p>
<p>The &quot;A-list&quot; is incredibly small, even compared to the  small group of people that make it to the mainstream level. They are paid well above a &quot;market&quot; rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
