<p>Inspiration for the € symbol itself came from the Greek epsilon (ϵ) – a reference to the cradle of European civilization – and the first letter of the word Europe, crossed by two parallel lines to ‘certify’ the stability of the euro.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>The best documented explanation holds that the sign evolved out of the Spanish and Spanish American scribal abbreviation &quot;pˢ&quot; for pesos. A study of late eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century manuscripts shows that the s gradually came to be written over the p, developing into a close equivalent to the &quot;$&quot; mark.[3][4][5][6][7] A variation, though less plausible, of this hypothesis derives the sign from a combination of the Greek character &quot;psi&quot; (ψ) and &quot;S&quot;.[8]</p>

Heat is not a substance, or thing, or even really a distinct form of energy in its own right. “Heat” as a scientific concept belongs to the early empirical days of thermodynamics when atoms and radiation were not at all well understood. </p>
<p>If we put a hot thing and a cold thing near one another in a vacuum then the hot one will cool and the cold one will warm. The amount of heat, the internal energy, in each object will change but heat as such is not transmitted between them—energy is. Overwhelmingly this is in the form of electromagnetic radiation. The result of this is that after a time the hot thing will have less heat in it, and the cold thing will have more, but the “heat” never was in the intervening space. That space contains an electromagnetic field that holds some energy, and that energy goes in and out of the things, but it isn't the right kind of energy to be considered “heat”.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But how does the strike know where the highest points are if he goes from top to bottom?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It turns out that lightning doesn't know where the high points are, although there isn't obviously a reason why they wouldn't since both the cloud and the ground are oppositely charged.</p>
<p>When the cloud conditions exceed some threshold (or there is some other initiation process e.g. cosmic rays, it isn't well understood exactly how it starts) then small scale discharges start. These discharges are called leaders and they come from the cloud downwards along the largest electric field gradients. </p>
<p>What they physically are is the visible artifact of the ionization of the gas along a path. As electrons are accelerated by the high fields of the strike they ionize and excite gas they encounter, this makes the gas glow and also leaves behind a conducting trail that takes a short while to dissipate.</p>
<p>The leaders travel something like 40 or 50 metres before stopping, this is the distance it takes for the motion of the charged particles in the streamer to cancel out the initial electric field and thus halting the streamer. Charge continues to accumulate at the end of the streamer though and eventually the field once again reaches a level where a new leader can be launched. Often the same point can emit several leaders in different directions which causes forking of the bolt, although they will always be roughly directed down since that is where the field gradient is pointing.</p>
<p>In this semi random way the strike works its way towards the ground, until it gets close to something, preferably something conducting. Now it is far far more likely to strike if the object is already charged enough to be emitting something we call a corona discharge, this means there are already charged particles in the vicinity of the object which lowers the resistance of the air and thus becomes a preferred path for the leaders. It is for this reason that both tall and conducting objects are likely lightning strike points since that is where charge on the ground will want to accumulate.</p>
<p>Once a leader reaches the ground/tree/church then there is suddenly an electric connection between the ground and the cloud (remember each leader left behind an ionized, conducting channel). This path of low resistance allows a huge amount of charge to be transferred between the ground and the cloud and that is the very bright part of a strike, called the return stroke. While the leaders have tens or hundreds of amps the main strike will have millions. Also even though the leaders may have formed many branches only the first to connect with the ground will have a return stroke, another reason why high objects get struck is that they can be reached quickly by leaders. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dukkO7c2eUE" target="_blank">I would highly recommend you watch this incredible video (or any others) of the leaders and the return stroke in slow-motion that should make the whole thing clear.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cloud actually sprouts &quot;feelers&quot; ahead of the actual lighting strike. These are lower strength/higher resistance paths because they don't connect much of anything: just the cloud to the air. They tend to branch out like a bush, in random directions. </p>
<p>Air itself is a pretty good insulator. What these feelers do is ionize a path through the air, thus making it much more highly conductive. </p>
<p>Once one of these random feelers makes contact with the much higher electrical potential of the ground or a solidly grounded object like a tower or tree, the full lightning &quot;strike&quot; actually travels from the ground upwards towards the clouds.</p>
<p>Story Time:</p>
<p>I was once in a small boat on Lake Oahe with my father and brothers. We were surprised by how rapidly some storm clouds blew in and were putting away our fishing rods when my father yelled &quot;get down!&quot; and nearly dropped his graphite fishing rod in his haste to put it away. He had received an electrical shock in the palm of his hand from the rod. A feeler had touched him. </p>
<p>We all feel very lucky that none of us got struck by lightning as we rushed to shore that day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does lightning strike from the sky down, or the ground up?</p>
<p>The answer is both. Cloud-to-ground lightning comes from the sky down, but the part you see comes from the ground up. A typical cloud-to-ground flash lowers a path of negative electricity (that we cannot see) towards the ground in a series of spurts. Objects on the ground generally have a positive charge. Since opposites attract, an upward streamer is sent out from the object about to be struck. When these two paths meet, a return stroke zips back up to the sky. It is the return stroke that produces the visible flash, but it all happens so fast - in about one-millionth of a second - so the human eye doesn't see the actual formation of the stroke.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certain things are not in fact sweet, but are highly associated with &quot;sweet&quot; in our culture - and thus when we smell them, we smell &quot;sweet.&quot;</p>
<p>Vanilla, cocoa, cinnamon are great examples: not one of these is sweet. Put them on your tongue and they're all bitter. Put them under your nose: do you smell sugar?</p>
<p>But a huge swath of western cooking only uses these things in sweets, and so we've drawn that association. Start using them in other dishes for a while, and you'll notice they no longer smell &quot;sweet&quot; to you.</p>
<p>edit: Non-ELI5, since people seem intent on calling bullshit on this. Sweet is mediated predominantly by hT1R2 and hT1R3 g-protein coupled receptors on the tongue, largely found on the tastebuds of fungiform, vallate, and folliate papillae. These receptors are not found in the nose, and odorant receptors for glucose have not, to my knowledge, been identified. In fact, in animal model experiments, glucose vs. other sugar oligomers have been used as rewards/punishments coupled to smell stimuli - because glucose and the other carbs <em>did not themselves influence the experiment through smell.</em></p>
<p>But, hey, if you don't like the ELI5 explanation, by all means, provide a refuting source. Just saying &quot;nah, bruh, bullshit&quot; is somewhere between useless and worse-than-useless.</p>
<p>edit2: /u/notebuff kindly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5mtj2d/eli5_why_do_certain_foods_ie_vanilla_extract/dc6ghn6/" target="_blank">provided</a> a link to a paper documenting the existence of &quot;sweet&quot; receptors to the nose - linked to immune regulation ('cause glucose is the primary foodstuff for bacteria), but not taste! That can plausibly provide a mechanism for impaired upper respiratory immunity in diabetics. Thanks to /u/notebuff for teaching me something new today. </p>
<p>And for completeness' sake, I'll add a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005273609002405" target="_blank">link to an NMR analysis</a> examining hT1R2/3 interaction with sweeteners. It's hard to find a source that just bluntly says &quot;this is how sweet works,&quot; 'cause it's far from a &quot;new&quot; discovery - it was in the physiology textbooks by the time I reached grad school. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You can't really smell something as salty, sour, bitter or sweet. Those are tastes, and your tongue is responsible for detecting those.</p>
<p>The way these molecules interact with your olfactory nerves and your taste buds is different, and they are interpreted differently. With time you may learn to correlate certain smell/flavors with tastes, but these are merely based on experience.</p>
<p>Try sniffing around a bunch of salt, for instance. Or try smelling strong chocolate or coffee with and without sugar if you can, without knowing which is which. (They have to be similar brand/type). Before you touch it with your tongue you won't really know if it's sweet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Also, pharmacies only need to keep enough of any given medication in stock as long as they get frequent shipments every few days. They determine which medications are the most highly used by local physicians and stock those up enough to last until their next delivery with a safety supply always in reserve. And if they get dangerously low all they need to do is make a special order that comes a few days early. But pharmacies are getting shipments of medications all the time so this really shouldn't be a problem. Another thing that helps is that shelf life of most medications are at least a year. So even if you have to stock some exotic medication that no one really ever gets prescribed you can keep a small supply tucked away somewhere and have a computer system track when it is going to expire and you need to toss the old stuff out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

For example, coming up to bank holidays we order in surplus antibiotics, morning after pills and other contraceptives. We try to have a nine month supply of the more popular contraceptive pills so if someone comes in and wants their six month supply we can give it and still have enough for three other women to get a one month supply. At the end of August we get a big delivery of our flu vaccines, which we can top up if needed. Our computer system keeps track of sales statistics for each of our medications, we try to get people to leave in their prescriptions on file. It makes it easy for them, we get it ready, text them when they can collect and text them again of they havent collected after two weeks. But it also helps us predict what medications will be needed each month/week. Our pharmacy gets twice daily deliveries from our main supplier, and once daily delivery from our other suppliers so if the customer is in early and we dont have their meds in stock, we can have it for that afternoon. But we would still have a lot of medication readily available on the shelf, some of which we haven't dispensed in a year. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am an EMT and it is a combination of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Training time. An EMT is 6 months of training. A Medic is usually another 2 years after that. So in a little over the time it takes most to get an associates degree you can be a paramedic.</li>
<li>Supply and Demand. While your medic isn't as prevalent as say an EMT and those aren't as in supply as people who can work an entry level job without training the pay does go up as you become more sought after. This is partly to do with how fast Medics and EMTs can be trained. There are just oodles of EMTs and still many Medics and only a limited number of jobs.</li>
<li>Community Resources. Big cities have more resources and can pay Paramedics more than smaller cities. Every firefighter, police officer, and EMT/Medic wants to make big money in the big city. However, for the majority of Medics in the US that work for smaller towns they simply have to cut costs where they can and this usually comes in the community service part of things. It isn't just medical, fire, and law either. Schools are seeing their budgets tighten all the time. This is just the case across the board.</li>
<li>Medicaid/Medicare and the Uninsured: The law says that ambulances have to treat and transport you regardless of your ability to pay and that's the way it should be. But it also puts a strain on ambulance districts in two ways and this causes or doesn't help the bullet point above. The first way is that when Medicaid and Medicare pay they don't pay full price. Surprise, the government wants to keep its costs down and will only pay a certain amount. Sure, ok. At least we get paid from those programs. But the worse thing is people without insurance because we sometimes don't see a dime from people and have to send them to collections - which is terrible to ruin someone's credit over medical bills. But at the same time it would be equally terrible to see an ambulance district not be able to afford good equipment, hire competent staff and reward that staff appropriately, or, curse the thought, close down for good, because they didn't have an income. Most community ambulance districts aren't out to make a ton of money but that extra money is nice to afford better and safer equipment and afford training for the employees.</li>
</ul>
<p>And it really is a shame too because EMTs, Police, and firefighters usually have to pay for their own training (at least some if not all) and are really great pivot points of the communities they serve. I decided to get into EMS because it was a good job to have through college and I was helping people. It gave me purpose and made me feel good (and a little bit of money was nice too) but I ultimately did not feel it was a lifelong job I could do and make a real living at because of the low wages and near nonexistent benefits in that line of work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic here, checking in late to the party, but I can offer some perspective. </p>
<p>There are too many EMS services in the U.S. Those who do the best pay/benefits wise are those who work for large, urban or county-wide EMS systems that are funded (at least partially) by the tax base of the area that they serve. I am fortunate enough to work for a municipal system that is funded via the tax base and billing for our services. With OT, I make over $100k. Since we are a municipal system, we are ran as a public safety bureau and not like a for-profit business. Why that is important is that the finances are viewed differently than the for-profit services. My Chief's salary doesn't change based upon how much profit he can squeeze out of the budget. We are viewed by our government as a necessary public safety service instead of a money making venture. Our government knows how valuable of a service we provide to our city and understands that in order to attract good people, they need to offer a good pay/benefits package. It's the cost of providing a service, not the cost of doing business. On top of that we are unionized, which is a big help. With every contract negotiation the union is working to improve the pay and benefits that we receive. </p>
<p>The for-profit, small town EMS systems that rely on subscriptions and billing to survive just cannot afford to offer good pay and benefits. They don't have the call volume to generate the billing revenue to bring in a ton of money, and they have to keep costs in line to remain profitable. As a result, they cannot afford to pay their employees a whole lot. That being said, many medics and EMTs will take these jobs because even though the pay isn't great, the workload is typically pretty easy, compared to what the city medics are dealing with day to day. So even if the pay is only $15/hr, a lot of guys won't mind working a slow 24hr shift once a week and then work their other jobs. </p>
<p>Others have touched on the other issues. The relative ease of education I think is a factor, however I don't necessarily think it's as big as some other people believe it is. I don't think the answer to poor pay is requiring a bachelor's degree. The million little EMS services that are barely financially afloat cannot afford to pay much more than they currently do, regardless of if their employees have a degree or not. They simply don't have the financial resources to do so. The flip side to that is that if paramedic became a bachelor's degree, you'd end up with paramedics who would have more student debt with only a marginal increase in pay. The increased student, coupled with the still low pay, would result in even less pay to live off of due to more money being spent on student debt. </p>
<p>TL;DR - There are too many small EMS services with poor revenue coming in that are barely surviving financially. What we need are more large, municipal, unionized, tax-funded services that are operated as public safety bureaus and NOT like for-profit businesses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>former paramedic for 10 years</p>
<p>A. Private ambulance service. Most community ambulances transportation occurs via private ambulance service that is dominated by American Medical Response. Profits drive that company and it's better to have high turnover, less experienced paramedics at lower pay scales over ones with more experience and will demand higher wages. Also the community ambulance 911 systems contract out emergency responses to a single company so that ambulance service is really the only game in town for a paramedic to work for.</p>
<p>B. Lack of a nationwide or state level association/trade union. Firefighters, police and nursing have had strong associations to help protect wages and politically push for more protections. Most paramedics/EMTs don't have a strong association and either get a small local union representation (like SEIU) who are not specifically set up to handle the needs of first responders or none at all. </p>
<p>C. Most people coming out of paramedic schools are young and the wage scale is set accordingly. It's a demanding job. The hours suck, the physical demands are high and the stress is unbelievably high. I was an EMT at 20 and a paramedic at 21. After 10 years I was in the top 20 on the seniority list out of 350 paramedics. The last 5 years I worked was hell I can't imagine working into my late 30s.</p>
<p>D. Most career advancement paths involved moving into the fire service. Moving into a clinical setting is often blocked by a lot of factors including the nurses who don't want to give up duties to yet another healthcare profession. I never wanted to be a firefighter.... I hate heights and the smell of burning buildings. </p>
<p>Most of my colleagues who stayed in the field got jobs with different fire services. I chose to get out of it completely although stayed in healthcare for about 20 years in medical devices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I have conversations like this quite frequently with people who say shit like &quot;it's so unfair that pro football players make more than brain surgeons&quot;.  It's all about supply and demand of the labor force. Somebody like LeBron James has a much more marketable skill than a brain surgeon,  even though it could be argued that the brain surgeon as a more important job. However, the brain surgeon does not have a more <em>valuable</em> job from an economic sense.  A brain surgeon is not going to sell out a stadium multiple times a year with fans willing to watch him  perform surgery. And this is what you understand: the labor force in a capitalist  economy is paid what they're worth economically, not morally. EMT's  are common, low skilled employees that are easily replaceable. Yes, they are important, but they are nothing special.  If you want a good counterexample though, there is a big shortage of nurses here in America, and therefore the salaries of nurses has gone up because hospitals have to compete with each other to attract nurses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to be very cold, for a long time.  Most people know moving water can't freeze, but in real life scenarios, there's always a spot where water comes in contact with a solid surface (The rock or ice) that momentarily brings the fluid to a stop, in that short amount of time it has to be cold enough to freeze the water, this spot is called a nucleation spot (where things start).  From there it just basically builds outwards until the whole thing is frozen, the water freezing like a column as it flows down and hits the ice below, layer by layer.</p>
<p>Edit: I am surprised by how many people find this interesting/upvoting, it's ice to see so many people take an interest</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>If the water is continuously falling at a rapid pace</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many places where you get fantastic frozen waterfalls, the water is not falling at a rapid pace but is instead a slow trickle that keeps building and building from a single icicle into an entire frozen wall. Keep in mind that river levels will drop when temperatures are below freezing since there is no runoff to feed it, so they won't be running full tilt just prior to freezing.</p>
<p><a href="http://merge.canada.travel/sites/default/files/styles/page_gallery_main/public/photo/exp/se098_01rr_mike_gere_photo_mar_08_366.jpg" target="_blank">Maligne Canyon in Jasper, AB Canada</a> is a good example of that. If you go by in the summer time the walls are leaking but there is no waterfall there. In this case at least, there are parts of the river &amp; karst system that run underground and keep the water warm enough that it will continue flowing to the surface even when temperatures are -20C and colder.</p>
<p>Of course, when something huge like Niagara Falls freezes, that's a different story and u/Skaffer's explanation covers that scenario better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A waterfall gets the water from many small water bodies upstream from the waterfall itself. </p>
<p>If the area with the waterfall was the only area with freezing temperature, the mass of water would move to quickly to freeze. But this is not the case. As it gets colder the smaller streams upstream freezes. And all the water in the ground that eventually would make it to the river freezes solid in the soil. This brings the river that leads to the waterfall to also have less water, and eventually this also freezes. </p>
<p>This again reduces the amount of water feeding the waterfall, making it easier for the low temperature to take hold of the water and slowly freezing it bit by bit. Where it eventually is just a trickle of water reaching the once majestic cascade, that is now a solid frozen pillar of ice. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The generalisation would be that education creates opportunities for people to get into stressful job situations, like in the comment from /u/Qui_est-ce_qui about lawyers.  In this case, it's not the education that's the proximate cause, but it's a catalyst and correlate.</p>
<p>Of course, you could also find lots of anxiety and depression and so on among people who aren't well-educated -- in particular they may be prone to another kind of deadly stress if they have trouble finding a job.</p>
<p>An interesting research question would be whether the mental illnesses of the educated and un-educated are different, not just whether they're more prevalent in one group than another.  I don't know the answer to that question off hand.</p>
<p>Another thing that comes to mind is the role of <em>inequality</em> per se in driving mental health problems, along the lines of:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends whose population estimates you look at, as every organization will have its own methodology. Firstly, even national population numbers in developed countries will never be 100% accurate. You have a never-ending mortality and birth rate, and presumably a steady immigration and emigration rate. Once you understand and can calculate the growth or declining rates of the latter noted elements of population, you can better calculate the representation of the country. Developed countries might also have a government facilitated census, and this helps at tightening the numbers. But they will never be perfect, I would say that most developed countries have a +/- 2% discrepancy. When you look at population numbers from a developed country's government, you can assume that they're correct.</p>
<p>Lesser developed countries have more difficulties when it comes to calculating the above noted figures. As a result, you want to use a proxy, or best guestimate. There are multiple approaches that you can take and this goes back to what I said about it depending on the organization. Some will have an agreed upon formula that encapsulates many factors (e.g. employment, real GDP, GDP PPP, gross exports and imports, energy consumption, etc.), And ultimately spits out a number. Other organizations might take the posted numbers from a developing countries, if they even have them available, and apply a +/- rate to adjust the accuracy and discrepancy.</p>
<p>Note: I'm writing this from my phone and there are many more things that I want to add. I also haven't proofread much of what I wrote above. If this post sticks and you want further clarification I'll add what I can when I get home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
