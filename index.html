If the release of dopamine is too low you will end up being sad, if it ends up being higher you will be glad.</p>
<p>Essentially you release the dopamine based on a subject then once you get that subject if it pleases you less than imagined you are sad due to being use to that level of dopamine or less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who are not happy, especially those who are just incapable of genuine, self-generated happiness, believe that something else will make them happy. The next toy, the next car, the next house, the next job, the next SO, whatever. It's always some other thing that will cause their happiness. They're not unhappy because they're unhappy people; they're unhappy because they don't have the right external thing. </p>
<p>When they get the next thing, after experiencing a brief &quot;happiness,&quot; they realize that it only makes them happy for a little while. It brings fleeting joy, at best. It isn't an answer, it is merely a distraction. </p>
<p>That thing stops making them believe they are happy, so they need to move on to the next thing. Worse, the first thing reminds them that they can't be made happy by the things they thought would do it, so they want to discard it entirely. </p>
<p>In a child, with a toy, this is understandable and good. Adults should, but unfortunately often do not, grow out of the expectation that the rest of the world should cause their happiness, rather than expecting them to find their happiness within. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<li>
<p>A case of be careful what you ask for, because when you get it, you may not like it. Like how Rick Perry wanted to be Secretary of Energy, and once he got it found out it wasn't about regulating energy but maintaining a nuclear weapons arsenal. Or how the Republicans wanted to win the presidential election at any cost, but the candidate from their own party that won may do more damage to their party than anyone expected. Or the management position you always wanted, but once you got it you realize the stress of being a manager isn't as personally rewarding as you thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love and excitement of a challenge or power grab, but once you get it there is no challenge to get excited about. Like the guy who hopes to date a specific girl, but once he does looses interest.

I used to be a sound engineer and then a hearing aid repair guy for a few years after so here's my input anyway. It may be tinnitus, but just to be sure, check your electronics in your quiet room, It could be a telly or a power adapter or something as well.  You could try unplugging everything and seeing if you still hear it, you'd be amazed the noises some of these things can make. Also if the noise goes away after while on its own then its an effect  being around too much noise during the day and your ears are readjusting, as someone else mentioned in the comments (You should still take precautions if this is a regular occurrence). If however it doesn't go away you should look at making some adjustments, like turning your headphones down, or wearing earplugs if your workplace is too loud etc..
Tinnitus is in fact repairable to a certain degree, but if the damage to your ears does go too far, it can be irreversible and cause you a lot of trouble in the future.</p>
<p>So TLDR theres no need to panic, but you should start looking after your ears</p>
<p>Hope this helps you</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a medical professional, but my best guess would be that your ears are acclimating to the silence (relatively...it's never completely silent). You're bombarded daily with a cacophony of noise and when it suddenly goes away, your brain is trying to makes sense of the lack of sensory input. Another idea might be just the blood flow in your ears, like when you &quot;hear the ocean&quot; in a sea shell. Since there isn't something to amplify it, you just get a general wall of unidentifiable sound. I think another thing to consider is the fact that most of us live in close proximity to many different electronic devices. They make noise, albeit small noises. Even the lights themselves make noise. When the power goes out in your home, you hear that 'pop' and a sound like the noise draining from the house, everything powering down. You may hear the &quot;silence&quot; of electrical static in the background. Just a few thoughts though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, PhD student working with honeybees here. First, it's worth noting that honeybees have largely bounced back from the Colony Collapse Disorder (presumably what you're referring to by &quot;dwindling population&quot;) epidemic of ~2006-2013. CCD was a weird, difficult problem and we may never truly understand what caused it, but neonicotinoid pesticides combined with varroa mite infestations and subsequent disease seem to be the general suspects.  </p>
<p>We have indeed genetically modified honeybees for desirable qualities using good ol' fashioned selective breeding. Bees are considered domesticated, and there's several major lines in production that are cold-tolerant, honey-producing, etc. Noteworthy to decline is we have produced lineages which are termed &quot;hygienic&quot; and behave in such a way to reduce the impact of varroa mite infestation. We can and do artificially inseminate queen bees, but it doesn't seem to take well. We probably could genetically modify bees with modern gene techniques to be even better, but honestly that's a load of paperwork, effort, and funding to fix a problem that's not really a problem.  </p>
<p>Lastly, honeybees are already an &quot;invasive&quot; species in the United States. They were brought over from Europe a couple centuries ago. You could release a ton of them but there's really no point. There are already feral colonies pretty much everywhere filling the available niche. Interestingly, they don't seem to compete with native bee species but actually have synergistic effects in some areas such as pollination. Right now dwindling native pollinators are the big issue and there's a bit of effort to conserve them and utilize them in agriculture, but by and large honeybees do a great job so there's little economic incentive and probably not much hope in the long run.</p>
<p>Edit for Clarity: Bee populations tanked rapidly over ~6 years due to CCD which stopped in 2013. Populations of bees have recovered and remain stable <em>HOWEVER</em> bees are failing to overwinter or otherwise die early at increasing rates. Right now, we can compensate by simply producing more bees. We don't know exactly why, and as CCD showed us, we don't want to be caught in a situation where we suddenly have no bees and no alternatives. It <em>is</em> a cause for concern, but we are not presently in any sort of &quot;beepocalypse&quot; <em>for the moment</em>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we will kill them again! And because bee populations aren't as endangered as they are portrayed.</p>
<p>Anyway half-related story time: My parents own a house that was owned by an extremely old couple. The back yard had raspberries, roses bushes and sunflowers etc all neatly kept. Well the lady that sold the house to my mom told her not to kill the bees under the shed and to protect them from the neighbors, because they were the reason she had the most beautiful flowers in the neighborhood. This bee hive was massive, and the bees would form a constant black cloud in the far corner of the yard, but they never hurt us (four young kids), so my mom left them. The nosy neighbors next door complained about the danger constantly (I would guess that they were 50-60, never any children around) but their entire back yard was an industrial garage and five feet of patio where the set up chairs facing our yard and watched us play all day (creepy nosy fucks). We moved and my mom let her brother (who also has young children) rent the house. Same complaint from the neighbors about his kids being in danger, but nobody ever got stung so the bees stayed. Eventually the neighbors waited for them to leave the house and went into the yard and killed every single bee, even though the bees were on the opposite corner of the yard from where their patio bordered and they never went near their plantless yard. The house has crappy plants now, and all the fruits and vegetables in the yard stopped producing. Bees will be fine if people would let them live. I think all the endangerment fuss is aimed towards stopping needless destruction (not creating more bees) because they would be fine if everyone wasn't so hell bent on killing every bug in sight. In a way, it scares people into stopping their stupid behavior, rather than putting money into making them people proof.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We basically can/are. As a beekeeper here I can tell you that while there was and is still massive death, we have the ability to create more bees quite easily. The total population isn't so much down, as the death rates are massively up. </p>
<p>Bees are constantly dying year round. We try and start the summer with around 1000 hives, by fall we usually have about 800 left, and after a few months in California we usually hit a low point of about 600.  For some bad years those numbers would be 1000, 600, 300. </p>
<p>Once spring rolls around we split one hive in half, buy a new queen for the &quot;baby&quot; hive, and turned one hive into two. On a good year we can split hives once and by the time spring rolls around our remaining hives are get back up to 1000. On a bad year we might have to split all our hives, wait a few months and then split them all again. </p>
<p>Splitting one good hive results in two weak hives, and spitting a weak hive results in two barely alive hives. The more times you have to split a hive, the longer it takes to reach a productive size. They spend the whole summer growing to the size of a good hive and don't end up making as much honey as a larger hive would. </p>
<p>TL;DR: The CCD problem isn't as bad as it was made out to be. We do have the ability to create new hives but it is expensive and results in less efficient bees.However, If the downward spiral gets out of control it may become impossible to keep up the bee population. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

However, I've puzzled over many strange results of evolution and how they got to be where they are. Carnivorous plants are one example. How can a plant GRADUALLY evolve the ability to trap insects and absorb them without use of its roots? Did it just start out as a mutation that made a plant kind of sticky? It seems like such a radical change and the intermediate steps don't necessarily seem beneficial enough to ensure greater than average reproductive success.</p>

The carnivorous trait did not happen at a single event, but rather occurred multiple times. Theory for enzymes: plants needed to develop chitinase and proteases to destroy fungus pathogens from invading their tissue. The enzymes and the glands producing them ended up being used in carnivorous plants to breakdown insect exoskeletons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most plants are capable of absorbing at least some nutrients through their leaves, which is why foliar feeding works. There are also many plants that evolved the ability to stick insects to them as a defense mechanism, and in areas with low nutrient levels such as sphagnum bogs or up in trees the plants that were able to trap and absorb insects most efficiently survived very well compared to their cousins who could not.</p>
<p>This is why carnivorous behavior has evolved in several different kinds of plants that are not that closely related to each other, such as Cephalotus and Nepenthes looking very similar despite not being related, Pinguicula using a similar mechanism to Drosera, and Byblis, and so on. There's even an orchid that's debateably carnivorous, but it needs more study to confirm or deny this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing you have to remember is that the &quot;adaptation&quot; is what causes the advantage, unlike Lamar's theory. </p>
<p>The ancestor of the Venus flytrap was probably a plant like any other, but down the line one of it developed a sticky substance around her &quot;flower&quot;, by a conjunct of &quot;random mutations&quot;. Some did something similar, but one that wasn't too sticky let the fly flew away, other was too sticky, and not even one fly got away, preventing it from polimerazing. Others had leaves that close when touched, something other plants can do actually, and when a fly was trapped by this it died and feed the plant. With the past of time, whatever change was tested, and the &quot;better suited&quot; (wrote on the broad spectrum) had descendants that could have a new change. This is a very simplistic explanation though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cortisol is a hormone released when you are stressed. It’s produced in the adrenal cortex in response to stress (physical or emotional) and to natural cycles that tend to correlate to circadian rhythms. Cortisol makes the body respond more to normal levels of epinephrine and norepinephrine, and can therefore cause vasoconstriction which in turn can cause chest pains (which can mimic angina). </p>

I had surgery done back in November, and it had been healing without a peep the whole time, until someone I used to know suddenly popped back into my life in early January. It had been years since we last spoke, so I welcomed him back, hoping we might be able to get along. Unfortunately, it soon became evident that nothing had changed, and we started arguing over the same stupid crap we always used to. Sometimes the arguments would become so escalated, I could feel the area where my surgery had been done starting to feel sore. That freaked me out to the point where I knew this person and I needed to stop communicating again.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MD with significant clinical experience with pain and close relations with world renowned pain researchers here.  The simplest answer I can gave that it's very complex and any answer on Reddit will be at best incomplete if not totally wrong.  The simplest &quot;wrong&quot; answer is that there is a process that can be simply termed hyperalgesia, which means noxious stimuli that causes pain in a &quot;normal&quot; person causes more pain in a person that has undergone a hyperalgesic process.  So my pain score is 2 and yours is 8.  The process can be so significant that non-noxious stimuli can be interpreted as pain (allodynia).  This process is complex and has a lot to do with central (nervous system) and peripheral sensitization of the nervous system.  Another element of hyperalgesia can come from mood disorders (such as depression).  The biological framework of this is extremely complex and cannot be simply explained by any single process.  To be even more simplistic and incorrect, but kinda true, is that when you feel emotionally down you are more aware of noxious stimuli that was always there but now your threshold for experiencing this as pain decreases.  On top of all this is pain is subjective and placebo effects in treatments are far higher than that of other medications, again tying emotional cognitive aspects to the experience of pain. Hope that helps.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>1) older people generally have more stress and things to juggle. In the west at least, most adult are chronically sleep deprived. So the body is more vulnerable in general to alcohol's assault on its system.</p>
<p>2) older people often have commitments that prevent 'sleeping it off'. Personally, it's been more than a decade since I've slept past 8am...much less sleeping til noon. So even if you feel bad, you're getting up anyway. </p>
<p>3) the downside of routine: many older people often have set routines. That's normally good. But once the body is acclimated to a certain routine, deviation is more difficult to take. Talk to anyone who is a frequent flyer across large time zones. They don't get hit as hard by jet lag as infrequent fliers. Why? Their body is accustomed to regular and bizarre changes to sleep patterns and they've just learned to deal. Just like a college kid that parties and pulls all nighter study sessions. The very lack of routine is helpful. On the flip side, anyone who has cared for a baby with routine nap times knows how bad things can get when you miss nap time altogether.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey Redditor!</p>
<p>My degree background is in Psycholinguistics, which is basically put: understanding how language functions in the brain. </p>
<p>I actually did a research project on dyslexia and hope I can be a help explaining it.</p>
<p>So, symbol languages, in linguistic terms, is called a logographic system. This basically means that the language is communicate (in writing systems) through logos, or symbols, representing - usually - a &quot;chunk&quot; or what is called a morpheme. A combination of these morphemes in a particular pattern and combination represent a word or phrase.</p>
<p>Languages like English are considered alphabetic (cause - you know - the alphabet).</p>
<p>There's a lot of different things to consider you'd need more information from studying to field, but basically our ability to read has mapped on to previously developed parts of the brain, utilizing their functions to process language. For alphabetic system, they are usually called &quot;t-junctions&quot; meaning before modern times, letter like the &quot;o&quot; weren't actually round, but were a series of lines making almost a diamond shape that has altered over the years to the circular &quot;o&quot; we all know and love.</p>
<p>Alphabetic languages actually access a part of the brain (which I can't currently recall) that has to do with your lexical phonetic storage system - meaning you link the letter to a specific sound (with has its variations between words in English... but that's a different topic all together). That is how it is simply organized.</p>
<p>Logographic systems actually activate parts of the visual cortex not activated in alphabetic systems (or only activated minimally). There are actually MRI testing that has been done on this demonstrating the results.</p>
<p>What's really cool is the fact that because these two systems of writing/reading don't full connect, a person who is dyslexic in one system, such as English, could be fully able to read and write with easy in another system, like Japanese, because of this lack of overlap between logographic and alphabet systems (you can find case studies on this which are actually pretty rad!) </p>
<p>There is much debate as to why dyslexia happens in the first place, but some of the best journal articles dispute that it has to do with the fact that writing and reading is a relatively new systems to our brains, and might have to do with the fact we are utilizing previous skills for other task that have evolved in our brain, to map the ability to read and write and make it accessible.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that dyslexia is primarily (in about 80% of cases) a disorder of phonemic processing; i.e. the capacity of the brain to order sounds into meaningful chunks. I assume that languages which represent <em>meaning</em> with characters such as Chinese and Japanese take some of this work out the equation: for example the Japanese character for fire (火) can be pronounced a few different ways, but it always has the meaning &quot;fire.&quot; This versus English and other languages whose writing only carries meaning <em>after</em> you've done the phonemic assembly required, meaning that &quot;f.i.r.e.&quot; means nothing until you've put the letters together and translated them mentally into a sound. I would assume that what you would see in languages like Chinese and Japanese is people with dyslexia having an easier time unless something was written in the phonetic Pinyin or Kana (for Chinese and Japanese, respectively) at which point presumably some of the phonemic processing issues would emerge. </p>
<p>There is also a small subset of dyslexics (20% or so) where the issue lies in visual/spatial processing, and has to do with the brain not being able to correctly mentally orient letters. I imagine for these folks Chinese might be a little easier because the complexity of the characters would help you to find the meaning regardless of its perceived orientation, but you would probably still have a hard time. </p>
<p>Source: I'm a pediatric occupational therapist who has read some books and articles in addition to working with lots of kiddos with language-based learning disabilities. The piece about dyslexia being based in phonemic and sometimes spatial processing is well-established neuroscience. The piece about why it might be different in pictographic languages is my educated speculation, so let the reader beware. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have dyslexia and have studied about dyslexia previously. Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty similar to dyspraxia, dyscalculia and ADHD. All of the overlap and it is extremely common to have more than one (I have dyslexia and dyspraxia). </p>
<p>Dyslexia has a lot more to it than just have difficulty reading and writing, it come with difficulties in memory, attention, word finding, organisation, time management and so many other areas. Other language difficulties can include difficulties knowing which sentence particles to use, confusing similar or opposite words (e.g. Left and right), difficulty structuring sentences so that they make sense, and knowing which tense to use and the different conjugation of words (e.g. What is the past tense of 'write'). These are all things that would be experienced regardless of the language you speak/read. </p>
<p>As an adult my main difficulties are not to do with reading and writing, they are to do with memory and organising my though processes. I make a lot of speech errors, I find it very hard to explain things in a logical way even though they make perfect sense in my head. In terms of writing my difficulties are in structuring my ideas. I do still have difficulty with reading and writing but I've learned to manage this over the years. </p>
<p>TL;DR there is a lot more to dyslexia that spelling and reading, most of which would happen regardless of the language used. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert in dyslexia but am a Chinese speaker.</p>
<p>Written Chinese is not an alphabetic or syllabic language so dyslexia in Chinese is not really related with how sounds are represented but how the symbols are written. You know, Chinese characters are actually made up of components put in specific positions and written using a specific stroke order. If any of those components/strokes are <strong>1)</strong> missing or superfluous (e.g. 天 &quot;sky&quot; vs 大 &quot;big&quot;, 日 &quot;sun&quot; vs 目 &quot;eye&quot;), <strong>2)</strong> put in the wrong place (e.g. 太 &quot;very&quot; vs 犬 &quot;dog&quot;, 本 &quot;book/root&quot; vs 未 &quot;not yet&quot; vs 末 &quot;end&quot;), or <strong>3)</strong> wrongly written (e.g. 田 vs 由 vs 甲), it could cause problems for the readers.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/jB7ZX81.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/jB7ZX81.jpg</a>
In the the circled character above, some strokes are missing. (The correct form would be 麗 )</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/tyqyfm1.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/tyqyfm1.jpg</a>
Here the upper part of the character is horizontally mirrored.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/fWXeril.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/fWXeril.jpg</a>
In image 1.9, the second character (夫) has an extra horizontal stroke.</p>
<p>In image 1.11, the characters are supposed to be 唱歌 , which means in this case the left and right of the first character got reversed, and the wrong component is used in the right hand side of the second word.</p>
<p>Apart from the mistakes in how a character is written, there are also problems with the mixing up of characters similar in form or related in meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/lNnGoN1.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/lNnGoN1.jpg</a>
In image 1.1, 橾 (ancient wheel hub) is used instead of 澡 (bath).
In image 1.2, 炮 (a cannon) is used instead of 跑 (to run).</p>
<p>In image 1.3, 回學 should be 回校 . This happens because 學 and 校 are often used together. (學校 means school)</p>
<p>Of course there are a host of other symptoms but I guess the above are several of the more obvious.</p>

In 2011 if you where a refugee or requesting asylum in the U.S while in Iraq you could apply but none of the info would be process for during a six month time period. This was brought on by 2 terrorist found in the united states that most likely came in as refugees.</p>
<p>Trumps ban pretty much restricts all non-u.s citizens coming from several middle eastern countries. The original order actually calls for the deportation of people coming from the specified countries that are in transit or already hold visas, however this was denied by several judges. Basically the key difference here is that during Obama's you couldn't get a visa to get into the states. during trumps it doesn't matter you just cant get in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Carter apparently did a similar thing during the Iran crisis. There are, apparently, similar precedences in history.</p>
<p>The obvious objectionable (it seems) difference is that these were enacted in response to specific incidences and somewhat limited in scope.
Trump's targets several countries and city states but excludes certain religious minorities . This gives it the definite quality of his fulfillment of tge &quot;Muslim ban&quot; promised in his campaign. </p>
<p>If it were backed up with a credible intelligence report on a specific threat it might go down easier. But as it is it's a pretty blatantly discriminatory fulfillment of divisive and fear mongering rhetoric and only part of a larger agenda. </p>
<p>So people who oppose that are reacting powerfully to try and nip it all in the bud... So to speak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's extremely different. The claim your buddy is making is one that is a Republican talking point voiced by Spicer this morning and also echoed by various republican operatives on the news today, which is why it seemed to erupt all at once from every Republican talking head and any supporter who watched the news at all on TV in the past day. There's really no truth to it, it was just designed as a response to basically blame Obama for the things that Trump has done, or else to make it seem like democrats are hypocrites for not protesting it then, but protesting it now. Here's why it's not a valid criticism but really more resembles propaganda and is a gross misrepresentation of what has happened:</p>
<p>Trump's executive order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bans entry to the US for people born in seven majority Muslim countries - Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - including holders of legal green cards and visas - for 90 days.</strong> It's almost unprecedented to ban people with green cards and other legal visas on a blanket basis with no cause against them, and against people who had <em>already</em> gone through the &quot;extreme vetting&quot; that Trump claims he wants to institute (but that is already being done). Obama did nothing remotely like this. No other president in living memory has done anything remotely like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suspending the Syrian refugee plan indefinitely</strong> -- this is a humanitarian disaster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suspending entire refugee plan for 120 days</strong> -- this is a humanitarian disaster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bans entry to the US for dual-nationality passport holders - meaning citizens of the above countries who also hold, for example, a British passport, are also banned for 90 days.</strong> Obama did nothing like this. What he did do was require people who meet these criteria to have to apply for a visa (rather than be automatically allowed into the US), but only if they had been to any of the listed countries in the last few years. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritize Christian refugees over Muslims</strong> -- this is very likely unconstitutional, as there's not supposed to be a religious test of this kind. And incidentally, Trump lied when he said that it was &quot;impossible&quot; to get a visa if  you were a Christian refugee from these countries, but if you were a Muslim, you could get a visa.  In fact, overall for these countries, a larger percentage of Christians got visas than Muslims. That is, Christians make up a tiny percentage of the population, but a larger percentage than that got visas. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He capped the refugee total to 50,000.</strong> This wasn't done by Obama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He did it out of the blue.</strong> Not done by Obama, as explained below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Did it via executive order</strong>, with no consultation/input with other departments or experts, and without any (or almost no) warning to any agencies who handle these things, like Homeland Security. Bannon and Trump overruled things like having this not apply to people with green cards.</p>
</li>
<li>There's a smoking gun, in that <strong>Giuliani says that Trump asked him how to ban Muslims, but legally</strong>, so any denial that this is a Muslim ban, is clearly false. And a commission was assembled to figure out how to do that. This is distinct from a commission of experts figuring out how best to detect terrorists and keep them out as described below as having been done by Obama. The commission Giuliani described as having assembled for Trump was of lawyers to figure out how to ban Muslims in general, but legally.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, Obama: </p>
<p>Paused approvals of refugee applications from Iraq for a period of six months after two Iraqi al-Qaeda terrorists were discovered living as refugees in Kentucky. So it was a very particular and narrow ban based on a hard evidence example, not a blanket ban and not targeted at Muslims in general with a specified preference for people of a certain religion. Also, it was done after careful consultation with the security experts in these matters to see how best to screen people to find potential terrorists. Trump banned all refugees for a certain period of time and severely limited the number we'd take in. This is quite cruel as a huge number of refugees have been created recently.</p>
<p>Another thing Obama did was put several countries on the list of countries that wouldn't get automatic visa waivers. That is, suppose you're from Japan and you want to go to the USA for a visit. You can just come--get on the plane with your passport, land in the US, get the passport stamped, done. It's easy, as a courtesy for two countries that trust each other and have friendly relations. You don't need to go to the US embassy in Tokyo and fill out an application and send in your passport and money and then get a stamp that allows you one entry and one exit to the US during a particular time period and for a certain number of days.  But with some other countries, you do need to go to the embassy and fill out a form, etc., for a tourist visa (you have to fill out forms and apply for almost all countries if you want a non-tourist visa to work or something). And Americans need to do that when in turn going to those other countries. So Obama put a few countries, responding to events occurring at that time, on a list of the many countries where they don't get the easy way to get a visa--they have to apply at the embassy, etc. Not <em>everybody</em> from those countries (Somalia, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen, but just people who have passports from those countries and have visited those countries <em>recently</em>. </p>
<p>The concern is that terrorists living in, say, Britain, might get radicalized on-line and then visit those countries or a few other countries we are watching, and take terrorist training camps and make plans with enemy groups for terrorist activities. So people with those specific characteristics need extra vetting by our security forces to make sure they're not going to be a problem. </p>
<p>But newborn babies and 5 year old kids and disabled 85 year old women in wheelchairs who have lived in the US for decades and doctors who have lived in the US for decades didn't end up, with Obama's action, getting trapped at the airport without food or water for many hours, not allowed to see a lawyer or, in the case of the 5 year old, alone and not allowed to see a parent or guardian. Nor did anyone have green cards confiscated. That's what happened with Trump's plan. And Obama's thing wasn't an executive order--it was in a much larger bill proposed by congress and signed by Obama. So there are numerous very specific and very nasty reasons why Trump's Executive Order is a nightmarish abuse of power, unconstitutional, as well as cruel, and none of those reasons apply to Obama's actions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The term &quot;noble gas&quot; refers to chemical properties, and element 118 doesn't exist long enough to really do chemistry (in a real, macroscopic sense). Secondly, as you go down the periodic table to heavier atoms, all of the &quot;rules&quot; that terms like &quot;noble gas&quot; and &quot;halogen&quot; are based off of become a lot less fixed. For example, the noble gasses go from &quot;doesn't react&quot; to &quot;yeah, you can make stable compounds of this and put it in a bottle&quot;. By that point, the term itself doesn't mean a heck of a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other commenters have said, it is too unstable to really have chemical properties. Another issue is that with these very large electron clouds, the highest energy electrons begin to behave differently due to relativistic effects and instability. If you have a rock on a hill, it is in a high energy state and &quot;wants&quot; to go to a low energy state, and will do this by rolling down the hill of possible. A small force on the rock causes its position to become unstable and the rock falls down the hill. The taller and steeper the hill, the smaller the force required to destabilize the rock. </p>
<p>The same thing happens (kind of. Quantum effects make it a bit harder to explain) with electron clouds. High energy electrons want to go to a low energy state. However, the lower energy states are already filled in a big atom, so the electrons tend to transfer to other atoms instead. Because of this, it is very possible that oganesson would actually be reactive if it were not so radioactive. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that even with more familiar so-called noble gasses, the distinction is more of a suggestion than a rule. Xenon can be made to react with fluorine, for example. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by noble gas. If you mean that it's p-orbital is completely filled with electrons, then yes, it would be. The reason most noble gases are not as reactive as the elements near to them is because they are electronically &quot;comfortable&quot; because their p-orbital orbital is completely filled. Conversely, that is why halogens are so reactive. They only need to take one electron away from some other element to become &quot;comfortable&quot; and they really really really wanna become comfortable.</p>
<p>Despite this, as you move down the periodic table, the characteristics that define groups of elements become less concrete. This is because electronic orbitals form father and father away from atomic nuclei as the elements get heavier and heavier. Because of this, the electrons are more able to interact with, and be taken away by, other reactive elements. This is why noble gases like xenon can form compounds with some very reactive elements like flouride.</p>
<p>Due to the reasons stated above, whole element 118 will technically be a noble gas because it's p-orbital orbital will probably be filled, it will be most likely be pretty highly reactive, giving it's classification as a noble gas very little meaning. </p>
<p>Also as some others have pointed out, there's some speculation that it might not even be a gas at STP, so I guess you could call it a noble metal at that point?</p>
<p>P.S. I typed this on mobile, so excuse typos.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: heavy element chemistry is weird and doesn't follow periodic trends. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Curious why my answer rec'd 3 negative votes given that it is correct. Note that I do not  assume that the &quot;last&quot; p orbital is filled, or even, crucially, that it makes any sense to put them in order; and am saying that the system that we've arranged the periodic table makes assumptions based on observations that we've made of existing elements of low atomic number. There could be an extension to atomic numbers of any integer, including atoms that have not been observed,  it wouldl be interesting to do this, but it is not likely that the 'aufbau' extends in the combinatorial way it is now sometimes understood.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For instance, if we compare  the artifically excited states 5g186f147d108p59s versus 5g186f147d108p6  of of Cadmium (or more correctly actual excited states of Cadmium 71) we see that the one with the filled p orbital has higher energy, not lower, than if a 9s  electron is allowed <a href="http://spectrograph.uk/index.html?domults.checked=true&dofine.checked=true&autocorrect.checked=false&finecorrect.checked=false&doConfig("5g186f147d108p59s;5g186f147d108p6",1,0" target="_blank">http://spectrograph.uk/index.html?domults.checked=true&dofine.checked=true&autocorrect.checked=false&finecorrect.checked=false&doConfig("5g186f147d108p59s;5g186f147d108p6",1,0</a>)</p>

<p>&quot;Unbilinium has atomic number 120= 8 choose 3 so would be an alkaline earth metal, and atomic number 118 being two less would be a noble gas if the periodic table continued its system...
It also is true, however, that this structure in the periodic table depends on not only Schroedinger's equation (which implies the Hund rule), but also the Aufbau including some aspects of it which are unproven/unexplained. That is, the order in which orbitals tend to be filled as far as we can observe follows a pattern consistent with Schroedinger's equation, but not logically deducible from it, nor are the precise solutions of the equation known.  One can also try Hartree-Fock, but the ground state configuration of atomic number 118 is likely unknown still.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
