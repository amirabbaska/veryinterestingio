		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an educator, the biggest change has to do with the availability of jobs for unskilled labor. If you look at public high school education, we designed a system for the 50's. A person who wasn't &quot;college material&quot; would take easier classes, get a high school diploma, and work in the coal mine or factory. These jobs offered respectable wages and often union protection, so a person in those days could still live a comfortable life by the standards of that time period. If you went to college, it was pretty cheap (compared to today) so although it was a strain on some families, the possibility of your parents paying for it or working a job through college to pay for it was much higher.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today. Due to automation and a shifting economy, a lot of those unskilled labor jobs are gone. The response, then, by the population that isn't &quot;college material&quot; is to go to college. This has led to a supply and demand boom for colleges who have jacked up tuition prices (well past the pace of inflation) while simultaneously devaluing a college diploma. If everyone has a BS, then having one isn't special. Many jobs that didn't require a college degree in 50's now do. With the tuition rising but salaries not, the return on investment is drastically shrinking for a college diploma. If you don't get a diploma, however, your earning potential is significantly lower, so everyone still goes to college even though now it causes most people to go into extreme debt.</p>
<p>Additionally, with the devaluation of a standard BS degree, many people now feel pressure to get graduate degrees in order to differentiate themselves. If you want to look special on a resume, you need something extra to put you over the top. As a result, many individuals are getting Masters degrees when they wouldn't have needed it in the past, once again devaluing those degrees.</p>
<p>TL;DR - The lack of unskilled labor jobs has created a drastic devaluation of college degrees because everyone &quot;has to&quot; go to college. This leads to many people having tens of thousands of dollars of debt upon graduation. Since wages have increased a lot slower than tuition, this is creating an ROI black hole. Much of wealth people are earning is going to paying back tuition rather than to living.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the gold, stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here are 35 astounding facts about inequality that will fry your brain.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In 81 percent of American counties, the median income, about $52,000, is less than it was 15 years ago. This is despite the fact that the economy has grown 83 percent in the past quarter-century and corporate profits have doubled. American workers produce twice the amount of goods and services as 25 years ago, but get less of the pie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of money that was given out in bonuses on Wall Street last year is twice the amount all minimum-wage workers earned in the country combined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The wealthiest 85 people on the planet have more money that the poorest 3.5 billion people combined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average wealth of an American adult is in the range of $250,000-$300,000. But that average number includes incomprehensibly wealthy people like Bill Gates. Imagine 10 people in a bar. When Bill Gates walks in, the average wealth in the bar increases unbelievably, but that number doesn’t make the other 10 people in the bar richer. The median per adult number is only about $39,000, placing the U.S. about 27th among the world’s nations, behind Australia, most of Europe and even small countries like New Zealand, Ireland and Kuwait.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Italians, Belgians and Japanese citizens are wealthier than Americans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The poorest half of the Earth’s population owns 1% of the Earth’s wealth. The richest 1% of the Earth’s population owns 46% of the Earth’s wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More locally, the poorest half of the US owns 2.5% of the country’s wealth. The top 1% owns 35% of it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inequality is a worldwide problem. In the UK, doctors no longer occupy a place in the top 1% of income earners, London plays host to the largest congregation of Russian millionaires outside of Moscow, and also houses more ultra-rich people (defined as owning more than $30 million in assets outside of their home) than anywhere else on Earth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The slice of the national income pie going to the wealthiest 1% of Americans has doubled since 1979.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 1% also takes home 20% of the income. This figure is the most since the 1920s era of laissez faire government (under Republicans Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The super rich .01% of America, such as Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, take home a whopping 6% of the national income, earning around $23 million a year. Compare that to the average $30,000 a year earned by the bottom 90 percent of America.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The top 1% of America owns 50% of investment assets (stocks, bonds, mutual funds). The poorest half of America owns just .5% of the investments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The poorest Americans do come out ahead in one statistic: the bottom 90% of America owns 73% of the debt.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tax rates for the middle class have remained essentially unchanged since 1960. Tax rates on the highest earning Americans have plunged from an almost 70% tax rate in 1945 down to around 35% today. Corporate tax rates have dropped from 30 percent in the 1950s to under 10 percent today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since 1990, CEO compensation has increased by 300%. Corporate profits have doubled. The average worker’s salary has increased 4%. Adjusted for inflation, the minimum wage has actually decreased.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CEOs in 1965 earned about 24 times the amount of the average worker. In 1980 they earned 42 times as much. Today, CEOs earn 325 times the average worker.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wages, as a percent of the overall economy, have dropped to an historic low.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In a study of 34 developed countries, the United States had the second highest level of income inequality, ahead of only Chile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Young people in the U.S. are getting poorer. The median wealth of people under 35 has dropped 68% since 1984. The median wealth of older Americans has increased 42%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The average white American’s median wealth is 20 times higher ($113,000) than the average African American ($5,600) and 18 times the Hispanic American ($6,300).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>America’s highest income inequality is located in the states surrounding Wall Street (New York City) and the oil-rich states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since 1979, high school dropouts have seen median weekly income drop by 22 percent. Ethnically, the highest dropout rates are among Hispanic and African American children.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1970, a woman earned about 60% of the amount a man earned. In 2005 a woman earned about 80% of what a man earned. Since 2005, there has been no change in that figure. African-American women earn just 64% of what a white male earns, and Hispanic women just 56%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Over 20 percent of all American children live below the poverty line. This rate is higher than almost all other developed countries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Union membership in the US is at an all-time low, about 11% of the workforce. In 1978, 40 percent of blue-collar workers were unionized. With that declining influence has come a concurrent decline in the real value of the minimum wage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Four hundred Americans have more wealth, $2 trillion, than half of all Americans combined. That is approximately the GDP of Russia.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1946, a child born into poverty had about a 50 percent chance of scaling the income ladder into the middle class. In 1980, the chances were 40 percent. A child born today has about a 33 percent chance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Despite massive tax cuts, corporations have not created new jobs in America. The job creators have been small new businesses that have not enjoyed the same huge tax breaks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More than half of the members of the United States Congress, where laws are passed deciding how millionaires are taxed, are millionaires.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Twenty five of the largest corporations in America in 2010 paid their CEOs more money than they paid in taxes that year.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the first decade of the 21st century, the U.S. borrowed $1 trillion in order to give tax cuts to households earning over $250,000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1970, there were five registered lobbyists working on behalf of wealthy corporations for every one of the 535 members of Congress. Today there are 22 lobbyists per congressperson.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In 1962, the 1% household median wealth was 125 times the average median wealth. In 2010 the divide was 288 times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the Great Recession, the average wealth of the 1% dropped about 16 percent. Meanwhile the wealth of the 99% dropped 47 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>Between 1979 and 2007, the wages of the top 1% rose 10 times more than the bottom 90 percent.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in the Detroit area, so I can provide a Detroit-related answer to this one. Not sure how or if it was true other places.</p>
<p>After WWII, our economy was in great shape, Asia's was shit. The manufacturing industry in the US had yet to be automated to a significant degree, so there were lots of very good factory jobs. Detroit made a lot of cars, the cars were made from steel refined in the US, and there was little competition to either industry. Auto manufacturing jobs, in particular, paid a lot of money and didn't require education.</p>
<p>After a while (70s), Asia's economy was doing much better. The Japanese were making high-quality cars that cost less than American cars. The Japanese cars were manufactured with cutting-edge technology and techniques that required fewer and fewer workers. In order to be competitive, the US started emulating Japanese manufacturing techniques. It was popular in the 80s to send US executives to Japan to learn how they were so successful.</p>
<p>Part of the success led to more and more automation at home. Auto manufacturing jobs disappeared. The Chinese started making low-cost, high-quality steel. Steel jobs in the Midwest disappeared.</p>
<p>There were other parts to the puzzle, too. Part of the Republican revolution started by Reagan in the 80s greatly decreased the strength of unions. Both the steel and auto industries relied on strong unions to keep wages up. Weakened unions meant decreased bargaining power, which meant wages didn't increase.</p>
<p>The oil crunch in the 70s also contributed to a drive for smaller, lighter, cheaper cars. Japan was on top of this, but it took Detroit a long time (some would say we're still waiting) to make smaller, lighter cars.</p>
<p>I know you're 5, but I'll throw this in there as well. Part of the Reagan revolution was to change the tax code to eliminate <em>very</em> high taxes on the highest paid individuals. The highest tax bracket was 70%. Reagan reduced it to 28%. This helped concentrate wealth to the top. This was very good for wealthy people, but not so good for the middle class.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many others have posted this, but in 5 year old language the reasons are these:</p>
<p>1) After WWII, there were no other industrialized countries to compete with us (and many countries lost a significant portion of their young men to the war), BUT they all needed to buy things, so they imported from us.  With no competition, profits ran high.</p>
<p>2) Automation and much cheaper international shipping has taken away many of those factory jobs, because people were either replaced by robots, or by people in other countries who would work for 1/10th-1/5th of the wage.</p>
<p>3) When society went from 1 income families to dual income families, the first people to do it gained a lot in lifestyle.  Eventually, though, inflation adjusted prices to the extra money households were making.  Now we just work more and get less.</p>
<p>4) Our tastes went through the roof.  Your grandparents lived in small 900 sq. foot homes with two bedrooms and maybe no garage.  A basement was a luxury that families finished off when more kids came around.  Cars were basic.  Today, families demand homes twice that size with two car garages and a standard Ford full size sedan like the Fusion (at $30k) feels more luxurious than a Cadillac or Packard from the 50s.  &quot;Comfortable&quot; has changed.</p>
<p>5) Most people in the Fifties didn't go to university.  Only 5% of men and about 2% of women got a 4 year degree.  That is now over 35%  <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/184272/educational-attainment-of-college-diploma-or-higher-by-gender/" target="_blank">https://www.statista.com/statistics/184272/educational-attainment-of-college-diploma-or-higher-by-gender/</a></p>
<p>6) Healthcare costs and communication/TV costs have taken an enormous bite out of our monthly budgets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your idea of the 50s is a little off.
I was born in the 50s. My dad was in the army in the Korean war and came back with his new wife to a three room sharecropper house with no running water (a hand pump outside), no toilet (outhouse) and certainly no air conditioning. He worked the land by day and worked in a factory by night for several years to save enough to buy a small four room house and a little land. That house had no bathroom facilities either and was heated with a little coal grate in the living room.</p>
<p>My siblings and I were born in a little clinic hospital (physician clinic with a few beds for patients needing inpatient care). We had no health insurance and did not need health insurance. Health care was affordable and unusual costs were paid on an installment plan.</p>
<p>I wore hand-me-down clothes for years. </p>
<p>Slowly, working day and night, Dad began to get ahead, but ahead was not anywhere near the level of comfort that I and most others enjoy today.</p>
<p>One factor which allowed my dad's generation to prosper was that the economy was growing and there was constant inflation. Any home and/or property purchased would increase in value. A 3000.00 house would soon be worth 15,000.00. </p>
<p>Our economy has been slowing for years as jobs have been relocated overseas. During the last eight years, economic growth has been severely held back and inflation rigidly halted. </p>
<p>All the factors which made the 50s and 60s prosperous have been severely limited. Health care costs have become heartbreakingly
burdensome. And the cost of post secondary education is leaving a generation of people with a lifetime burden of student loans.</p>
<p>It is not so much that pay has not kept up as the costs of a middle income life are so much more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here are correct, but the question is actually much deeper than it might seem, and touches on that which sets Humans apart from Animals. Strap in, because I have insomnia. </p>
<p>Some of the defining features of language proper are that it is arbitrary, infinite, and voluntary.  Some forms of animal communication resemble language in some of these ways, but that actually makes it harder to decipher in most cases. </p>
<p>Language is arbitrary in that the words, sounds, or symbols are not necessarily obviously understood by someone who does not already understand the language. For example, the word &quot;danger&quot; does not convey a warning to a person who doesn't speak english, but the angry barking of a dog is obvious in its meaning. The exceptions to this are called onomatopoeia, where the word phonetically resembles the meaning, and are often used to describe animal sounds, like &quot;bark.&quot; Animal noises and signals that aren't arbitrary are easily understood and imitated by humans to communicate with animals. Likewise, a dog can be conditioned to respond appropriately to commands, but the dog will always understand shouting means anger, happy noises are playful, and quiet noises are calming. </p>
<p>Language is infinite in that you can use as many words, or create new words, to describe a limitless set of meanings. Take the example sentences, &quot;A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man,&quot; and &quot;'embiggens' is a perfectly cromulent word.&quot; Now, even if you weren't familiar with the Simpsons, the meaning of both words can be inferred from context. &quot;Big&quot; is a familiar word, with a familiar prefix and suffix that serve to define the word as &quot;to make one big.&quot; But &quot;cromulent&quot; only has a suffix to indicate it is an adjective, yet the humor of the joke relies on the fact that a person knows exactly what it is supposed to mean. New words and new ideas are the main point of contention that linguists and biologists use to differentiate between human language and  mimicry. A bird might learn to produce thousands of words, but it will never create new words, and will never learn to describe new stimuli. Likewise, the tail positions of wolves might convey a variety of arbitrary meanings to other members of the pack, but those meanings are limited to the pre-defined learned messages. </p>
<p>Language is voluntary in that we choose to say &quot;that's scary&quot; rather than screaming in horror.  Animal mating calls can be arbitrary, and in the case of a mockingbird, theoretically infinite. But the mating call itself is biologically compulsive.  That is, you can induce an animal under the right circumstances to make specific noises. Humans, on the other hand, choose what to say, when to say it, and how to say it. We also choose how to respond to communications from other members of the species. Our developed forebrains allow us to plan and scheme and analyze information in ways that are not available to most species. Thus, we can observe and experiment with animal communication to decipher their sounds and signals in whatever form they take, but that becomes much more difficult if the subject can choose not to cooperate. </p>
<p>All of these aspects actually make it much more difficult to understand foreign communications. Anthropologists spend lifetimes translating dead languages, and it makes discoveries like the Rosetta Stone so precious. Explorers discovering isolated civilizations have relied on visual communication that is not arbitrary, i.e. pointing, gestures, animal sounds, etc, to learn and teach each other's langauge. Simple words are then used to translate complex concepts. &quot;Me&quot; and &quot;you&quot; becomes &quot;mine&quot; and &quot;yours&quot; becomes &quot;I'll trade you this shiny bead for your 1st Edition Holographic Charizard (sucker).&quot;  </p>
<p>Humans have an innate ability to pick up language with minimal instruction, but we lose that ability as our brains develop and our cultural linguistics solidify. But even if we could figure out a way (ethically and logistically) to raise a baby in the company of whales, we would not likely have an easier time unraveling the complexities of different songs. Without a two-way communication, we aren't able to learn or teach the meanings of arbitrary sounds or symbols. We have a hard time even determining if dolphin sounds constitute language because we are limited in what we can observe and convey. </p>
<p>In the fascinating case of Koko the gorilla,  experts disagree on whether she was actually able to combine sign words to create language and describe new feelings, or if she was merely adapting conditioned responses to achieve desires. Unfortunately, Koko couldn't teach us Gorilla because the grunts and hand waving that gorillas use don't convey complex messages. Despite the fact that gorillas don't have a true language, we were still able to learn quite a lot from Koko. We were able to observe Koko trying to teach sign language to other gorillas. We learned from her that gorillas, and likely other animals, have the capacity to learn to communicate in a way that at least closely resembles language. But the closer any natural animal communication is to language, the harder it becomes to translate. Whether it is a visual signals like the movements of an octopus, the clicks and whirrs of a dolphin, ant pheremones, or some other previously undiscovered means of communication, the arbitrary and infinite nature means we cannot guess at the message, nor can we brute force our way towards mutual understanding. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/Finleychops has brought up killer whales which is an excellent example of animals using complex and specific languages. Each separate killer whale pod has its own language...Not just it's own dialect, but it's own specific language. This is known because when captive killer whales have been released back into the wild alone, we know from observations that these killer whales are unable to integrate into any wild pod because they are unable to speak the language of a new pod, and vice versa.</p>
<p>We also know that killer whale pods in the wild are able, through their vocal and body language alone, to successfully orchestrate together, very complex symphonies of group behaviour in order to successfully kill large groups of fish. Each member of the pod has specific duties to complete in these group activities in order to bring groups of fish together, to move them from the depths to the surface, and to stun them as a group, and then feed in an orderly fashion. It's absolutely incredible. And they can repeat the same hunting and killing as a group, and change the symphony of body language and vocal language as needed in specific situations, to get the job accomplished. </p>
<p>Scientists have been studying wild killer whale pods for decades in order to decipher their languages but we still don't know how to break down their conversation and translate it into the equivalent of human language, so that we can fully understand what these complex and intelligent groups of creatures are conversing about.</p>
<p>We need a killer whale scientist in here to explain more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't any doubt that certain animals communicate using language to some degree. However, animal languages seem rather arbitrary <em>compared to human language</em>, and there have been decades of research into the sounds made by mammals and birds to identify words or grammar <em>in the sense that we recognize them.</em></p>
<p>Italics above to emphasize the differences there will necessarily be between animal and human hardwiring. A lot of animal <em>communication</em> (which is a broader category than &quot;words and grammar&quot; <em>language</em>) is based on body language, smell, electric impulses or even colour as with certain squid that can change their hue. Bees will &quot;dance&quot; to describe to the hive where they found a load of nectar.</p>
<p>The fact that many animals use senses to communicate that humans don't, or don't even have, requires a special effort on our part to understand mindsets that may be fundamentally alien to ours. That, and we may find that if we at some point are able to talk to, say, dolphins, they might not be interested in conversing about much else than fish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The census classifications change based on the wants and needs of the United States government at the time.</p>
<p>At varying times the census has included options such as &quot;Chinese&quot; (for all Asians), then separate options for &quot;Japanese,&quot; and &quot;Hindu (for Indians),&quot; &quot;Mulatto,&quot; &quot;Quadroon,&quot; Octoroon,&quot; &quot;Mexican,&quot; among others. Increased immigration from other Asian countries, for example, prompted the government to separate out Japanese from the Chinese, for example.</p>
<p>Filipinos and other Pacific Islanders were probably separated out because the United States controlled the Philippines for quite some time, and also still controls many Pacific Island states.</p>
<p>Alaskans were separated out in 1940 but I don't know what could have prompted that.</p>
<p>Otherwise, ideas of race are mostly made up, with a strong emphasis on superficial traits and a weak basis from genetics, linguistics, and culture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The racial descriptors present in the US census are an attempt to draw a clean line between all the ethnic groups of people that may be living in the country for the sake of collecting data, but they're obviously not perfect, since they (to provide a few examples) ignore indigenous peoples from outside the US, lump everyone in Asia save Russians and Middle Easterners into one group, and roll Arabic people into the &quot;white&quot; category, which some Arab immigrants aren't pleased about.</p>
<p>You'll never find a system of racial classification that makes everyone happy, since race is a cultural phenomenon, not an objectively measurable biological one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Now they'd be classified as Southeast Asians, along with a bunch of other countries like Cambodia, Vietnam, etc. But that's not different than China, Korea, Japan being classified as East Asians. Still all Asians.</p>
<p>As far as Hawaiians, well they're not called Asians because... they're not Asians? Hawaii is thousands of miles away from Asia, right in the middle of the Pacific. Really about as close to the United States as it is to Asia.</p>
<p>Also I'm gonna give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you meant no offense by it, but that statement &quot;What's the point of the Pacific Island Race?&quot; is very culturally insensitive. Many Pacific Island natives have <strong>very strong and proud</strong> Pacific Island heritage and traditions that they identify as their own distinct group. Lumping them in with Asians is not only grossly inaccurate but diminishes their own heritage, as if they're not worthy of their own designation. No, Pacific Islanders are distinctly their own group and trust me, as someone who is South Korean but raised in Hawaii, to think for a second that &quot;eh, it's all kinda the same right?&quot; is just outright laughable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>With sexual reproduction mutations from across the species can combine into one individual. Evolution is much, much faster.</p>
<p>Bacteria actually have ways to share DNA. That is how antibiotic resistance spreads. It is not sexual reproduction but it works.</p>

When you're around a fire the smoke passes through clothes and hair and sticks to it. Thus, hair and cotton often absorb a lot of the smell. This is also why the items/people that smell the most usually have a notable black dusting. The same idea is applicable to smoking in a car. The smoke resin smells and sticks more-so to items with a breathable fabric. This is why if you get into a smokers car with cloth seats it is obvious, but when they have leather seats it's hard to notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Which side of Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil should I use, the shiny or the dull side?
Actually, it makes no difference which side of the aluminum foil you useboth sides do the same fine job of cooking, freezing and storing food. The difference in appearance between dull and shiny is due to the foil manufacturing process. In the final rolling step, two layers of foil are passed through the rolling mill at the same time. The side coming in contact with the mill's highly polished steel rollers becomes shiny. The other side, not coming in contact with the heavy rollers, comes out with a dull or matte finish.</p>
<p>The exception is when using Reynolds Wrap® Release® Non-Stick Aluminum Foil. The non-stick coating is applied during manufacturing to the dull side of the foil. Always place the non-stick (dull) side toward the food.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are already a lot of good answers here, but I wanted to add something that a lot of them seem to be missing. Yes, it requires a <em>lot</em> of overhead to convert the instructions used on PS2 hardware to normal PC hardware, but there's something else that makes it difficult as well. The ELI5 of that being, imagine how hard it would be to translate someone very, very quickly speaking Mandarin at you, to someone who only speaks German, while you yourself are a native English speaker. And you have to be exactly correct, and really, really fast.</p>
<p>However, what people are missing is the fact that the PS2 (or any console) has a very specific way of doing essentially everything. The memory is laid out in a certain way, disks are accessed in a certain way, instructions are executed in a certain way, etc. And, because console games are developed to only run on that <em>specific</em> console, they will often take advantage of those things. To borrow my metaphor from before, two people speaking in the same language to each other will very frequently use idioms and common sayings, that are total nonsense to a non-fluent speaker! Being able to translate those idioms (or, in the space of emulators, all of the strange quirks of memory and hardware) perfectly, into something that a non-speaker understands, is imperative in being a good translator. </p>
<p>The same is true of the emulator. If a game takes advantage of a certain way of handling memory on a console, that same handling method <em>must</em> be present in the emulator, or the game will not function. And some of those special methods are inefficient to implement, so it further slows down an already arduous translation task. </p>
<p>EDIT: Obligatory &quot;this blew up.&quot; I recommend checking out r/emulation if you want to learn more in depth about emulators! Also I recommend <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2016/09/06/booting-the-final-gc-game/" target="_blank">this</a> article on how hard it was for the most prominent Game Cube emulator to boot a specific game. Further down I also link <a href="https://youtu.be/-AoHGJ1g9aM" target="_blank">this</a> talk on why the PS4 is an incredibly weird machine, and so would be extremely hard to emulate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Then, the emulator also has to take your input from the computer and turn it into something else that the emulated CPU can understand as well. This all requires a TON of processing power. </p>
<p>A very good analogy is to imagine the console and computer are two different people who are talking to eachother, but speak two completely different languages. In this case, the emulator is the translator, which can be slow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference in hardware is the issue. The PS2 game was developed to run on PS2 hardware. This hardware natively supports a set of instructions; simple instructions like move, add, or subtract are widely supported, but instructions like division may not be. The difficulty is when the PC doesn't support all the same instructions as the PS2. When an instruction isn't natively supported, it can be emulated using a large number of other instructions. Even a subtle difference can require a large number of extra steps to accommodate. The downside of emulation is that the number of instructions to be completed necessarily increases, often dramatically.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>^(I don't think metaphors made using &quot;languages&quot; really convey the difficulty of emulating one piece of hardware on another, because we already use the metaphors for &quot;languages&quot; in computing, and they equate to programming languages.  Converting from one coding language to another can be a challenging task, akin to translating from archaic Latin to modern Mandarin, but at least you're still communicating from the same species to the same species - human to human.  We generally think the same way, our brains function the same way, and we have lots of experience doing language translation.  Using language translation as a metaphor for computer only really gets us as far as trying to convert Cobol to C++ while still using an x86 system.)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>ELI5</strong>:</p>
<p>Imagine you put your brain into a centipede.</p>
<p>Your brain is way more powerful than a centipede's brain.</p>
<p>But you have no idea how a centipede's body works.  You've never had to move dozens of legs simultaneously (or in a rythmic pattern) before.  </p>
<p>The way a centipede moves is as foreign to you as the way it thinks and communicates.  This is so far beyond simply translating a language.  This is translating an entire way of thinking and perceiving and organizing the world around you before you can even begin to hope to understand centipede communication.</p>
<p>To do anything as a centipede, you'd basically have to learn to emulate a centipede's brain.  Imagine how difficult that would be for you, even though your brain is probably several dozens of orders of magnitude more powerful.</p>
<p>A computer basically has to emulate the brain <em>and the body</em>, <em>and the language</em> of the centipede, <em>without fully understanding every detail</em>* about how the brain and body works, and the computer is only, maybe, an order of magnitude (or two or three) more powerful than the system it is trying to emulate.</p>
<hr />
<p>*^(Emulators often have to do a lot of <em>guessing</em> achieved via reverse-engineering, but we don't usually have complete engineering plans of the hardware that is being emulated.  That lack of complete understanding is often why emulators don't get everything &quot;just right&quot; - because they're doing a poor job of pretending to be a centipede.  Sometimes, even when we do have complete understanding, hardware limitations prevent perfect emulation.  Just like you might completely understand a dance move in theory, but not have the actual skills to pull it off in practice.  Even if someone gave you a complete schematic of a centipede's brain, you probably still wouldn't be able to emulate it in real time because even as simple as it is, it would still be mindboggling complex, and your brain couldn't handle it even though your brain is significantly more complex.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exclusivity costs more. The online services <em>want</em> to be the only place you can get something, because that will drive people to subscribe to them. So they enter a bidding war to get content with exclusive rights.</p>
