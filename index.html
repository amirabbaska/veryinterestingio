While they are combusting, they are not all completely converted to small gaseous molecules like CO2, but rather you get &quot;volatilization&quot; of some larger organic molecules that can collect when they cool down - like on your clothes.  These molecules and particles are what you see in smoke, and in fact you can collect smoke by making a small distillery and that is how you get &quot;liquid smoke&quot;.  You are literally getting smoke to stick to your clothes.  When you collect them, they are sticky and greasy, which makes them hard to wash out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you're around a fire the smoke passes through clothes and hair and sticks to it. Thus, hair and cotton often absorb a lot of the smell. This is also why the items/people that smell the most usually have a notable black dusting. The same idea is applicable to smoking in a car. The smoke resin smells and sticks more-so to items with a breathable fabric. This is why if you get into a smokers car with cloth seats it is obvious, but when they have leather seats it's hard to notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Which side of Reynolds Wrap® Aluminum Foil should I use, the shiny or the dull side?
Actually, it makes no difference which side of the aluminum foil you useboth sides do the same fine job of cooking, freezing and storing food. The difference in appearance between dull and shiny is due to the foil manufacturing process. In the final rolling step, two layers of foil are passed through the rolling mill at the same time. The side coming in contact with the mill's highly polished steel rollers becomes shiny. The other side, not coming in contact with the heavy rollers, comes out with a dull or matte finish.</p>
<p>The exception is when using Reynolds Wrap® Release® Non-Stick Aluminum Foil. The non-stick coating is applied during manufacturing to the dull side of the foil. Always place the non-stick (dull) side toward the food.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are already a lot of good answers here, but I wanted to add something that a lot of them seem to be missing. Yes, it requires a <em>lot</em> of overhead to convert the instructions used on PS2 hardware to normal PC hardware, but there's something else that makes it difficult as well. The ELI5 of that being, imagine how hard it would be to translate someone very, very quickly speaking Mandarin at you, to someone who only speaks German, while you yourself are a native English speaker. And you have to be exactly correct, and really, really fast.</p>
<p>However, what people are missing is the fact that the PS2 (or any console) has a very specific way of doing essentially everything. The memory is laid out in a certain way, disks are accessed in a certain way, instructions are executed in a certain way, etc. And, because console games are developed to only run on that <em>specific</em> console, they will often take advantage of those things. To borrow my metaphor from before, two people speaking in the same language to each other will very frequently use idioms and common sayings, that are total nonsense to a non-fluent speaker! Being able to translate those idioms (or, in the space of emulators, all of the strange quirks of memory and hardware) perfectly, into something that a non-speaker understands, is imperative in being a good translator. </p>
<p>The same is true of the emulator. If a game takes advantage of a certain way of handling memory on a console, that same handling method <em>must</em> be present in the emulator, or the game will not function. And some of those special methods are inefficient to implement, so it further slows down an already arduous translation task. </p>
<p>EDIT: Obligatory &quot;this blew up.&quot; I recommend checking out r/emulation if you want to learn more in depth about emulators! Also I recommend <a href="https://dolphin-emu.org/blog/2016/09/06/booting-the-final-gc-game/" target="_blank">this</a> article on how hard it was for the most prominent Game Cube emulator to boot a specific game. Further down I also link <a href="https://youtu.be/-AoHGJ1g9aM" target="_blank">this</a> talk on why the PS4 is an incredibly weird machine, and so would be extremely hard to emulate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The emulator has to translate the CPU instructions of the console and game you're emulating into something your own computer's CPU can understand. Then, the emulator also has to take your input from the computer and turn it into something else that the emulated CPU can understand as well. This all requires a TON of processing power. </p>
<p>A very good analogy is to imagine the console and computer are two different people who are talking to eachother, but speak two completely different languages. In this case, the emulator is the translator, which can be slow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference in hardware is the issue. The PS2 game was developed to run on PS2 hardware. This hardware natively supports a set of instructions; simple instructions like move, add, or subtract are widely supported, but instructions like division may not be. The difficulty is when the PC doesn't support all the same instructions as the PS2. When an instruction isn't natively supported, it can be emulated using a large number of other instructions. Even a subtle difference can require a large number of extra steps to accommodate. The downside of emulation is that the number of instructions to be completed necessarily increases, often dramatically.</p>
<p>What it really boils down to is optimization.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Some games (most notably, the Ratchet and Clank series of games) are virtually unplayable. Edit: (According to u/JMC4789 this particular issue was not due to the EE!

Converting from one coding language to another can be a challenging task, akin to translating from archaic Latin to modern Mandarin, but at least you're still communicating from the same species to the same species - human to human.  We generally think the same way, our brains function the same way, and we have lots of experience doing language translation.  Using language translation as a metaphor for computer only really gets us as far as trying to convert Cobol to C++ while still using an x86 system.)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>ELI5</strong>:</p>
<p>Imagine you put your brain into a centipede.</p>
<p>Your brain is way more powerful than a centipede's brain.</p>
<p>But you have no idea how a centipede's body works.  You've never had to move dozens of legs simultaneously (or in a rythmic pattern) before.  </p>
<p>The way a centipede moves is as foreign to you as the way it thinks and communicates.  This is so far beyond simply translating a language.  This is translating an entire way of thinking and perceiving and organizing the world around you before you can even begin to hope to understand centipede communication.</p>
<p>To do anything as a centipede, you'd basically have to learn to emulate a centipede's brain.  Imagine how difficult that would be for you, even though your brain is probably several dozens of orders of magnitude more powerful.</p>
<p>A computer basically has to emulate the brain <em>and the body</em>, <em>and the language</em> of the centipede, <em>without fully understanding every detail</em>* about how the brain and body works, and the computer is only, maybe, an order of magnitude (or two or three) more powerful than the system it is trying to emulate.</p>
<hr />
<p>*^(Emulators often have to do a lot of <em>guessing</em> achieved via reverse-engineering, but we don't usually have complete engineering plans of the hardware that is being emulated.  That lack of complete understanding is often why emulators don't get everything &quot;just right&quot; - because they're doing a poor job of pretending to be a centipede.  Sometimes, even when we do have complete understanding, hardware limitations prevent perfect emulation.  Just like you might completely understand a dance move in theory, but not have the actual skills to pull it off in practice.  Even if someone gave you a complete schematic of a centipede's brain, you probably still wouldn't be able to emulate it in real time because even as simple as it is, it would still be mindboggling complex, and your brain couldn't handle it even though your brain is significantly more complex.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am surprised at the number of comments that focus on the alpha dog model of behavior which is pretty debunked now.</p>
<p>To answer the OP's question, dogs have a lot of non-verbal cues leading up to the actual contact. The rules one learns about approaching dogs (don't approach head-on, don't make forced sustained eye contact, etc.) apply to dog-to-dog interactions too. For example, my friend's dog charges in to meet new dogs rather than first stopping a little bit away so the dogs can observe each other, so she makes other dogs nervous this way. This is why people talk about socializing dogs, so their pets can learn social cues and get along with others.</p>
<p>Similar to how dogs that have anxiety or poor impulse control display aggressive behaviors to humans, dogs that are nervous or impulsive can appear aggressive. Dogs can also reflect the energy they get from other dogs, so one anxious dog that is snapping will make another dog anxious and aggro too.</p>
<p>Basically, a dog is communicating with another dog long before they actually make contact, so what to you is a 2 second interaction is already a five minute convo and that's enough to establish how you feel about someone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many people seem to believe the pack theory of dominance,  but I believe this has been debunked and <a href="https://apdt.com/pet-owners/choosing-a-trainer/dominance/" target="_blank">isn't believed by most experts who study dogs and wolves</a>. I linked one source, but it is easy to find multiple other sources on this online. I think this is illustrated very well in the fact that the best trained dogs are not beat or hit when they do wrong (negative conditioning) but are instead rewarded when they do right (positive condition) because there isn't any need to establish &quot;dominance&quot;. </p>
<p>Dog &quot;introductions&quot; really come down to territory, protection, social skills, and personality. If a dog feels their territory is being invaded, they may show aggression. If they feel in danger or that their friend (owner) is in danger, they may show aggression. If they have poor socialization amongst other dogs, like not meeting any before, they may show aggression. A dog's personality usually comes down to experience and training. If they have been trained to be aggressive, it is more likely they will be aggressive to others. </p>
<p>I also think the &quot;little dog syndrome&quot; has a bit of truth in it. Little dogs probably feel threatened more when near a big dog while the big dog doesn't feel threatened at all. To compensate, little dogs act batshit crazy. This has been my experience with little dogs at least.</p>

We told them many times that they need to slowly acclimate the dogs, over at least a week's time, with a ton of supervision, but so many people have the &quot;awww the doggies are best friends!!&quot; idea in their head.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about body language. Dogs don't really become friends or enemies but they do establish an order when they meet. Who is the leader of the pack when they meet. Some dogs will fight to be the leader, some will roll over on their backs immediately with every dog they meet as a sign of submission. Most dogs fall between and check each dog out. </p>
<p>Two dogs that haven't figured their order out tend to cover each others pee, one will hump the other, or put their head over the neck of the other. These are all signs of establishing dominance. They'll tend to become more and more aggressive with the signs until the one they're trying to dominate submits or has had enough and they fight. </p>
<p>My husky used to be really dominant aggressive before I got him fixed. I had to learn his signs and jump in to get him to back off before a fight. He still sends dominant messages when he walks in a park but doesn't fight unless he gets bitten first. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Whales are becoming entangled in fishing gear and marine debris at an increasing rate and scientists are unsure why. Scar studies in U.S. waters show that 83 percent of all right whales and 70 percent of whales overall have been entangled in fishing gear or other marine debris at some point in their lives. Fortunately, the efforts of whale entanglement response teams are paying off. There are endangered North Atlantic right whales alive and reproducing today because of successful disentanglement efforts of NOAA Fisheries and our partners. </p>
<p>Whale entanglement response teams must be available at a moment’s notice and they deal with a variety of cetacean species, from the largest to the smallest, in a range of different ocean and weather conditions. These teams are highly skilled and use specialized equipment to cut whales free from tangled lines, buoys, and other debris. They can also administer on-site medical care to treat wounds and promote continued recovery.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Jamison and Ed. Thanks for doing this.</p>
<p>I'd like to talk to you about lobster gear marking.</p>
<p>I own a marine and hardware store in Downeast Maine. Let me say up front that none of the fishermen around here have an issue with protecting the whales in their waters. But I have watched the lobster fishermen struggle to comply with the gear marking rule for two years. The rule requires 3 twelve inch marks (top, middle, bottom) on each buoy line.</p>
<p>The fishermen have tried the following, with varying success: sewing twine into the rope, wrapping/weaving in colored cable ties, using plastic heat shrink electrical tubing, wrapping in electrical tape, soaking in thinned oil-based paint, using spray paint and plastic-bonding spray paint.</p>
<p>The fishermen have the following challenges:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Making marks by hand:
Fishermen take a 600'-1200' coil of float rope--depending on the thickness of the rope--measure out and cut the lengths they need based on where they fish and how many traps they have, and then need to mark each rope three times. That's why a lot of fishermen here went to spraying with or soaking in paint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making marks on different lengths of rope:
Buoy lines vary by the depth of the water, anywhere from 5-120 fathom (30-720 feet). And fishermen move their trawls throughout the season to different depths, so they either have to keep multiple sets of rope and change out their gear each time they move, or have one set of rope marked in more than 3 places so they can lengthen or shorten the rope as needed. (This is a good overview of lobster gear configurations: <a href="http://www.bycatch.org/sites/default/files/Lobster_Gear_Report_0.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.bycatch.org/sites/default/files/Lobster_Gear_Report_0.pdf</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Making marks that do not interfere with their haulers:
For those who don't know, the buoy lines are usually pulled up by an electric winch. Surface variations on the rope can put the hauler off balance causing damage to the rotating plates and motor.</p>
</li>
<li>Making the marks permanent:
The hauler puts friction on the rope, eventually rubbing the marker away.</li>
</ol>
<p>So my questions are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Has NOAA heard any successful techniques from fishermen that I can share with my customers?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can you clarify what the purpose of the markings are? Folks around here say that it's either so the whales can see the ropes more easily or so NOAA can identify where a rope came from if a whale gets tangled.</p>
</li>
<li>Could NOAA work with rope manufacturers to produce rope that achieves the desired result? For example, if rope was pre-marked every 2 fathom, would it have the same effect?</li>
</ol>
<p>Thanks for your time and keep up the good work!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/tsuuga has done a decent summary. I'd like to explain it in a little more detail:</p>
<p>With net neutrality in place, your ISP is obliged to provide you with an internet connection, the speed of which is determined by how much you pay for that service.<br />
And no matter which website you go to, the speed at which you receive the data (load the website, stream the audio or video) will be the same.</p>
<p>Without net neutrality, the ISP is free to decide at which speeds you're going to be receiving data from various sites. For example, your ISP might decide that it doesn't want youtube videos to load so quickly, because reasons, They might say &quot;Well our infrastructure can't handle video data at that amount. Yes we can upgrade, but it will cost more money. Youtube can pay us an amount and we'll make sure their data goes through smoothly.<br />
And they can extend the same kind of deal to anyone. With diffrent prices.  </p>
<p>Seems fair so far right? Well not entirely, a lot of ISP's have other interests as well. For example, in the US Time Warner has it's own video streaming service. And Netflix has one as well.<br />
In this case it's a very good idea for TW to throttle the bandwith of Netflix to a point where it's no longer possible for you to watch Netflix. But their own streaming service will work like a dream. So it gives ISP's unfair oppertunities to stop competitors from doing business.</p>
<p>And the same thing could happen for other things as well. Perhaps removing/restricting access to websites which go against the interests of the company. IE you can't see the site for a competing ISP because well, that's competition. You can't go to the site for political party X because they're going to try and push through legislation that the ISP doesn't like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Internet access could become more subscription based. You'd have your 'base internet' access, but for only $19,99 you could subscribe to the Social Media Package™ and have unrestricted access to Twitter, Facebook etc. Alternatively those sites would pay the ISP to give users access to their websites. If you like videos, for an additional fee you could also subscribe to the YouTube Package™ - you get the idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I pay for internet service.  That service is a certain speed and may include a data cap (or not).  For my payment I am entitled to &quot;equal&quot; access to the entire internet.  My internet provider is NOT entitled to give priority to certain traffic over others.  This is a world with a neutral internet.  The ISP's network is natural to the traffic it carries, it does not give priority to some over others, it simply gives me exactly what I requested at the maximum speed it is able. </p>
<p>In a world without a natural ISP, the internet provider (for example, Virizon, Comcast, Time Warner ect) is able to give priority to certain traffic over others. At first, that seems OK, but once we start looking at it in pratice things look much darker.</p>
<p>What the ISPs want, is the ability to charge the company that you are connecting to for the right for a good connection.  So in addition to charging you for internet service, they'll be charging companies like Youtube, Netflix, Facebook and so on so that those companies can access the highest speeds.  Keep in mind, these companies are already paying their own ISP for their internet access.  But now they would also be paying your ISP for special access to you. This is particularly important for HD video content as it uses lots of bandwidth for good quality. </p>
<p>Any website that does not have a special deal with your ISP, would be delivered at a slower service.  This again seems kind of fine, but kind of not.  Where it really falls apart is in the world of innovation.</p>
<p>It was not that long ago when streaming video games was just not really a thing people did.  Then along came twitch (and others) and the popularity exploded.  Not streaming games is extremely popular. </p>
<p>In a world of a not natural internet a start up like Twitch could never have survived.  It pays for it's own internet access.  You pay for your internet access.  But baby Twitch can't afford these extra fees to every ISP in America, so they are on the &quot;general access&quot; network.  But they don't have enough bandwidth to deliver HD content over that network, so everything is pixilitaed and of poor quality. Some users use it anyway, other's don't because the service is so poor.</p>
<p>In a natural intent, the users would choose to use the bandwidth they've paid for to stream from Twitch at the highest quality possible.  In a non natural world, Twitch would have to pay for that privilege and the users would not be the wiser. </p>
<p>It gets even more nasty.  Netflix is a BIG competitor to your cable company.  For most users, their cable company is also their internet provider.  In a non natural world, the cable company could tell Netflix &quot;OK, no more HD streaming for you, we're just not going to allow that&quot;. Then turn right around and offer their own streaming service that DOES stream in HD. So if you want HD streaming you'll be forced to buy it from the cable company. </p>
<p>You already see a little of this in the Cell Phone world.  AT&amp;T owns Direct TV.  If you subscribe to Direct TV now (Direct TV's streaming service) and use it on your AT&amp;T cell phone, it does not count against your data.  If you use Netflix, it does.  So if you have to choose what streaming service to subscribe to, you'll chose the one that you can actually use while on mobile data. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How is this bad: You already know this, but for speculation and prospective purposes, but basically it can (and will) be corrupted for political/financial agendas.</p>
<p>E.G. Your ISP leans to the right, I mean FAR right like Breitbart right. Your ISP has the right/capability to basically prevent you from accessing any news site that isn't far-right or Breitbart.</p>
<p>You like streaming movies on Netflix. Your ISP happens to have a deal with Time Warner Cable. Your ISP prevents videos from Netflix, Youtube, or any other service that loads videos from working on your computer. The only time you can stream is content from TWC because your ISP controls what data and how much you have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The MPAA has a shadowy &quot;ratings board&quot;.  No one can find out who's on it, anyone whose name becomes known is removed.</p>
<p>How they got appointed is unclear.  The actual profiles don't seem to fit what MPAA described.</p>
<p>The MPAA believes this represents the viewing market.  They may not be that far off.  Sex IS seen as shocking and a moral threat but not violence by many people.</p>
<p>Other things of note:
Specifically, WOMEN enjoying sex or even being an active participant is seen as 10x more serious than just sex.  Seriously, a guy getting a blowjob is NBD.  Even the guy moaning out an orgasm is more or less ok for a family-ish comedy.  But a woman getting eaten out and enjoying it with equal focus on her reactions is just porn... a moral threat.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There is an episode called &quot;Sex in Monochrome&quot; which is very relevant to this.</p>
<p>There is a period in Hollywood called &quot;Pre-Code&quot;.  During this period, before what we call the Golden Age films had a lot more sex and violence</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Code_Hollywood#Creation_of_the_Code_and_its_contents" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Code_Hollywood#Creation_of_the_Code_and_its_contents</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1929, an American Roman Catholic layman Martin Quigley, editor of the prominent trade paper Motion Picture Herald, and Father Daniel A. Lord, a Jesuit priest, created a code of standards (which Hays liked immensely[11]), and submitted it to the studios.[7][12] Lord's concerns centered on the effects sound film had on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure</p>
<p>The Code sought not only to determine what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values.[18] Sexual relations outside of marriage could not be portrayed as attractive and beautiful, presented in a way that might arouse passion, nor be made to seem right and permissible.[14] All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience.[4] Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, as long as it was clear that they were the exception to the rule.[14]</p>
<p>The entire document contained Catholic undertones and stated that art must be handled carefully because it could be &quot;morally evil in its effects&quot; and because its &quot;deep moral significance&quot; was unquestionable.[16] The Catholic influence on the Code was initially kept secret.[why?][19] A recurring theme was &quot;throughout, the audience feels sure that evil is wrong and good is right.&quot;[4] The Code contained an addendum commonly referred to as the Advertising Code, which regulated film advertising copy and imagery.[20]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also I would recommend that podcast again and also it's sister podcast &quot;Attaboy Clarence&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short Answer: Because the MPAA says so, they have a monopoly on the rating process. </p>
<p>Also, part of the distinction lies with the simulation of the act versus a graphic depiction of it. For instance, graphic violence gets you an R rating, but simulated violence doesn't (so if you see lots of blood it goes to an R but otherwise you can blow up as much stuff as you want.) Likewise, sex receives a lower rating the less graphically you depict it. </p>
<p>Edit: For instance you can have Austin Powers and Two and a Half Men talk about sex all the time, but as long as you don't show anything besides a shirtless man and a woman covered up in bedsheets then you are in the firm PG-13 territory. </p>
<p>Likewise, Wolverine can stab and slash tons of soldiers without any blood and stay PG-13, but if you show a realistic portrayal of war like in Saving Private Ryan then you move up to an R rating. </p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2KXVizOUQVY&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank">An example of a PG-13 sex scene from the Notebook</a></p>
<p>Also, somehow Top Gun managed to stay PG with this <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uy6MseHSToI" target="_blank">love scene</a> although granted they still hadn't ironed out the kinks for what the PG-13 rating was going to be yet (it was only introduced 2 years prior to Top Gun). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's the norm to bathe in sauna - you have seen your entire family naked every week ever since you were a little kid. Childrens' programs on TV can have nudity when it is not sexualized.</p>
<p>Cursing is considered rude but is in no way censored, not even on shows meant for everyone.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuvaohjelmien_ikärajat_Suomessa" target="_blank">rating system</a> has this scale:</p>

<p>Examples of the what causes the rating jump from appropriate for all ages to min. age 7:</p>

<p>Much of it is cultural as well.  As a Francophone Canadian, I see the dichotomy on a regular basis.  Our state broadcaster is the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation/Société Radio-Canada (anglo and franco divisions, respectively).  The English language side will have violence (though nowhere near as much as US productions) and zero nudity and sex.  Tbe French language productions have plenty of contextual nudity, but very little violence.  And the violence that is shown is essential to the plot.  Breasts and full rear nudity are not hidden even if the show is during primetime.</p>
<p>As another example, English radio stations censor some works like bitch and fuck.  That same song played on a French language station will not be censored.  In short, French Canada still holds European standards (to an extent) while English Canada holds American standards (to an extent as well) possibly due to the massive media import from the US which that segment of the population consumes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In our systems there's a fine line between fact checking and censorship.</p>
<p>In the US if the lie doesn't amount to libel or defamation, virtually anything can be said.</p>
<p><em>Legally</em> there is a very good reason for this. Some statements are simply incorrect. Some are mistakes. Some are meant to be rhetorical hyperbole. Some statements are made based on facts that may be proven false at a later date.</p>
<p>No one would argue for punishing someone who made a simple mistake. Correct? Ok so if someone says a false statement, who decides if it was a mistake or malicious? Whose the arbiter of this decision?</p>
<p>Do you see how this could get political real soon?</p>
<p>If there is a Republican running for mayor who states that the city lost 16 million dollars last year. What if the sitting democratic mayor orders the police to arrest the Republican for presenting false information? What if the fact was 16.6 million dollars? The Democrat just imprisoned someone who made a simple mistake or a rhetorical shortcut.</p>
<p>Now what if the Republican goes to court and the presiding judge is a democrat? What if the populous is overwhelmingly democrat and doesn't care about injustice, they just plain don't <em>like</em> the Republican?</p>
<p>Do you see how this could slip into a very damaging problem for free speech? Everyone would be afraid to speak out against the government for fear they'll be arrested for false information. </p>
<p>This is why it's dangerous that our president wants to expand libel and defamation powers.</p>
<p>Now back to our Republican candidate. Even if he fights and wins in court, he's lost Alot of money, time and Capitol fighting those charges. Now he has to answer questions about jail time to voters when he could be making his case for why he's the better mayor. </p>
<p>All of this differs from corporations who cannot present false adverisement. As this is a law for consumer protection. Because of industry trade secret, it's difficult for consumers to absolutely know all information regarding a product.</p>
<p>In contrast, our system entrusts the voters to properly &quot;punish&quot; those who &quot;lie.&quot; That's why you need a strong Press with plenty of leeway to report. That's why we need access to proper education so that we can develop problem solving skills. That's why we need more visibility for what government officials are doing on behalf of us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it is almost impossible to make sure you are telling the truth 100% all the time, simply because person can not know everything but has to make assumptions and guesses. So we have to leave a bit of grey area to get some communication done in time. We can't always wait how thing turn out and then knowing what should've been done is kind of stupid.</p>
<p>Politicians just started running wild with that excuse more and more in the last 2 decades and voters do not seem to care. Media has not done good job either, establishment half truths spread in mass media has been the norm for.. for ever actually. I'm not on any sort of &quot;fake news&quot; crowd on any side but large part of the problems we see now is the lack of challenge on the part of commercial news media. In countries where there is nothing else, the situation is the worst, countries with stronger national, publicly funded broadcast is much better. Not good but better. it is much harder to pass so bold lies, allthough Brexit is good example how little people actually want to know and how much they want to believe.</p>
<p>It's getting worse, globally. And we are the ones that should do something about it but aren't.. Don't keep voting liars to power is my plea. Much rather put the boring dude who has no radical ideas how to improve anything than the one who swears he is goig to change everything but has no rational plans to do so. And under no circumstance should one vote for people who want to destroy government's power as they are going to sabotage the whole thing; that is their agenda ffs, &quot;government doesn't work and we should get rid of it. Vote me in the government.&quot; It for SURE will not work after that guy is in power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When i talk with friends and family about their political positions, they will support a politician who is caught in a blatant lie.  In addition, we do not reward politicians when they do tell the truth. Politicians have learned for example, that they should over promise both more spending and lower taxes and that doing so will not keep them out of office.  But if they said &quot;we have to raise taxes to pay for the services we provide&quot; they won't get elected. So I think our whole society needs to be willing to elect honest people.  Then, the free press has been eroded. One of the reasons for that is the flattening of expertise and the amount of noise on the internet. Anyone can claim anything they want  and people will listen to them. The public needs to support scientific integrity for example and say - I will support scientists' right to not be political tools in order to get better information from government agencies. Or- I won't look at random blogs and then conclude that hundreds of thousands of experts around the world are lying to me. Because people have spent a lot of time undermining the reputation of the press,scientists, and others who might have more insight,  some people will believe anything.  I think fake news is a huge problem. Its like we have purposely infected our whole society with a parasite.   Overall, our society does not punish lying, and cannot sort truth from fiction </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the media, which would be the primary check against this behavior by the politicians, has settled into a pattern of not being &quot;pushy.&quot;</p>
<p>The papers, stations, sites, whoever, prefer to not &quot;burn the bridge&quot; with both individual politicians and larger organizations like state and national parties.  If the bridge isn't there, they don't get interview or quote requests granted, they don't get tipped off with advance information on things the politicians are doing, and so on.  The media outlets have collectively more or less demonstrated they'd rather have the access than to act the way most people <em>assume</em> media would act; as an information channel and check on what comes out.</p>
<p>We're seeing it right now with how Trump and his administration are treating a large number of media entities.  Closing off access, not calling on them for questions; that's just what we can easily see.  If that's happening in view of the public, then it's extremely likely that none of the outlets are able to receive replies to phone calls, emails, whatever, from the folks on the far sides of the burned bridges.</p>
<p>Does it suck, that they value the bridge over doing what most of us would assume to be their job?  Yes.  Will it change?  At this point, probably not; because it's <em>easier</em> to keep that bridge so they don't have to work as hard.</p>
<p>In the current situation, possibly we might see some of the excluded outlets see increased ratings as they revert to pre-bridge behavior and start pushing for confirmed information.  If they do get more ratings, well, news isn't a service (though most people assume it is, or at least should be); it's a business.  If they make more money acting properly, then they'll start acting properly.</p>
<p>Which also sucks, but these enormous media companies have a lot of power to control the information flows.  They use it to enrich themselves, and rarely even pay lip service to actually disseminating real info.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Everyone puts 100% of the responsibility on the politicians.  It's up to us (the people) to research them, keep them accountable and make sound choices.  And when there are no sound choices, it's up to us to step up and either field a candidate or become one.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
