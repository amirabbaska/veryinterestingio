<p>Human buildings provide lots of ledges for nesting. </p>
<p>Combine that with the fact that they're harmless, (so we don't kill them for being pests) not tasty (so we don't kill them for food) and their natural predators cannot hunt well in cities (falcons end up nose diving into walls using their usual tactics, larger predators avoid humans) and you've got the perfect combination for a species to cohabit our cities with. </p>
<p>Seagulls are also very common in cities in the UK for the same reason. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most cities do have a surprising number of birds, but pigeons simply don't give a sh*t about hanging out right next to you.</p>
<p>For most birds, they want to be in trees, or up on a ledge, or in a park somewhere. On a pond. These are areas we may not visit, or at least not pay attention to in regards to birds.</p>
<p>But pigeons hang out on sidewalks and benches and bus stops where we are, so I think we notice them more often.</p>
<p>In the wild they live on big lumpy cliffs near oceans, so high rocky/stony environments with lots of noise and lots of transient visitors (humans and other animals) coming and going are right up their alley, so to speak. This is their thing!</p>
<p>If you're curious, here are a few rather exceptional photos (worldwide) and the story with them: <a href="http://www.audubon.org/news/check-out-these-fantastic-photos-birds-urban-spaces" target="_blank">http://www.audubon.org/news/check-out-these-fantastic-photos-birds-urban-spaces</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most pigeons you see in cities are the semi-feral descendants of pigeons that people once bred (for food, for show, for letter-carrying, etc).</p>
<p>They have centuries of humans breeding them to be functional and useful around people, including and especially in cities, so even the ones that are mixed with wild doves &amp; wild pigeons still have some of that inheritance to them. We may have mostly stopped keeping pigeons for food &amp; show, but the pigeons didn't just vanish when we stopped intentionally breeding them.</p>
<p>Think of how wildly varied the pigeons you see in a town centre are - there are some which are grey, some nearly all black, some mottled white and brown, etc. That's a HUGE amount of visual range, especially when you compare them to wild birds which all tend to look very very similar. The only animals with as much diversity of appearance are human-bred, not fully wild (think of all the different kinds of fancy sheep, or many kinds of dogs, or all the different looking breeds of cow).</p>
<p>TL;DR - pigeons thrive in cities because humans bred variants of pigeons to be good in cities. Then we stopped looking after them, but we'd already made them good at city living by then.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I used to think I had some kind of deficiency, or that it might be sleep apnea (I have sinus issues). I've even tried going to the doctor, but nothing has made a significant difference. </p>
<p>Sometimes something will help temporarily (like taking vitamin D, or when I started taking estrogen) but it always goes back to 'normal' after a few weeks.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell it seems to be genetic. Some people are 'morning people' and others are 'night owls'. In my experience morning people wake up early and have lots of energy in the morning, but they wear out fast and by the early evening are starting to wane. Night owls on the other hand wake up later and take a long time to build up energy in the morning, but then can keep going long into the night without feeling tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You mentioned below that you wanted an explanation of the genetic factor, so I can try and provide one for you. I'm something of an insomniac, ditto my father and sister. We all share similar tolerances to lack of sleep, to staying up, and to waking up without much effort. </p>
<p>There are a variety of endogenous hormones in your body that mediate sleepiness, and the sleep cycle. One of the most common is called &quot;adenosine&quot;. It promotes sleepiness, and suppresses arousal (sciency term for how awake you are). It's the receptor subtype thats influenced relatively well by a cup of coffee, or some other caffeinated substance.  </p>
<p>Variations in your bodies natural adenosine receptors can make you more or less receptive to the effects of this substance, in much the same way as some people have a greater or lower tolerance to alcohol or weed or even just basic dopamine / seretonin. Your bodies receptors aren't all identical to those of other people, and small variances in the genetic code can influence the effect of these receptors. These don't neccessarily have to all be based on the receptor - they could also relate to more/less efficient post-synaptic cleanup of neurotransmitters etc, but the end effect is the same : you can vary from other people in terms of how you react to the same input of neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>Me + my family all appear to have a variation in this receptor (amongst other things we're not very fond of caffeine), and as a result seem to be much more &quot;awake&quot; on average than most people. I think of it as being naturally two coffees up on the average person. Some variation like this (or others, there are a lot of these chemicals that influence sleep) could account for the variation between you + your SO's sleep patterns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans need surprisingly little variety to just live. You can live 80+ years eating an extremely narrow diet if you don't die in an accident or from illness. Now, you won't feel good, you'll probably have a weaker immune system, etc. But if you get lucky enough to not get sick in spite of weak immunity and such, you can live a long time. Eating a healthy diet allows you to be bigger, stronger, less likely to get sick, etc, but it is hardly a requirement to live. And even then, what most people I have met think of as 'eating a healthy diet' is WAY in excess of what is necessary to be big, strong, and, well, healthy. You don't need to eat nothing but vegetables to get enough vitamins and such. For example: if you have some french fries at every lunch and dinner and you eat them with some ketchup, the ketchup alone has enough vitamin C that you will never get scurvy. You could do this for 80 years and never get scurvy. Eat a good sized orange every morning and you don't even need the ketchup to get <em>all the vitamin C you can possibly use</em>. Seriously. </p>
<p>The amounts of other vitamins that you need are pretty similar. In the developed world, if you just make an effort to eat a broad diet <em>at all</em>, you are unlikely to have any kind of noticeable deficiency. Vitamin deficiencies are most common in people with very narrow diets, such as extremely picky eaters, people with a lot of allergies, and vegans. Or in pregnant women because they need more of everything than other people.</p>
<p>Ancient humans ate whatever they could get, which could mean a 'healthy' diet if they are lucky, but it could also mean nothing but meat for a stretch of time, and then nothing but plants for a stretch of time, and then nothing at all for a short stretch of time, and they survived because 1) you don't need all that much of any specific thing, 2) everything you need can be gotten in a variety of ways and 3) your body holds onto some important stuff, so it takes a while for the negative effects of deficiencies to set in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very few animals have extremely narrow diets, and animals tend to eat things that we don't. For example, carnivores will eat organs and entrails, while most of the time humans throw these out. Those organs often are packed with nutrients which are almost impossible to find in muscle tissue, which is most of what we think of as &quot;meat&quot;. Plant eaters usually eat a lot more by volume and often have lots of helpful microbes in their gut to help digest their food. </p>
<p>It is possible to stay alive on a very limited diet. It's healthier to eat more whole foods and get a broader range of nutrients. Also, eating &quot;just one food&quot; is a little misleading. If that one food is whole cooked potatoes, you can probably survive indefinitely. If that one food is white bread, you'll suffer from metabolic issues due to a lack of essential nutrients (white flour is made by removing the most nutritious parts of the grain, so it's missing a lot of good stuff)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are omnivores, which means we can eat a varied and balanced diet, but that doesn't mean we have to.</p>
<p>For one thing, the definition of &quot;healthy&quot; for a human includes a lot of stuff like being the appropriate height and weight for our age, not suffering from illnesses, a reasonably high level of comfort, and even sexual attractiveness.  But unless you're a biologist or a vet, you can't assess the first two; you can't assess the last one unless you're a member of the same species, and the remaining criterion is impossible to assess because an animal can't answer the question &quot;where does it hurt?&quot;  So when we say an animal is &quot;healthy,&quot; that basically means &quot;it ain't dead,&quot; and maybe &quot;it don't look like it's actively dying, either.&quot;  I'm not dead, and I don't look like I'm dying, but I eat like shit.</p>
<p>We also don't live the same lifestyle that animals live, or even that we lived during our own evolution.  Most people on Reddit probably have sedentary jobs and don't burn a lot of calories, despite being  member of the species that evolved to be persistence hunters.  Most people on Reddit can probably also go down to McDonald's and buy three double cheeseburgers easily, which is the amount it takes to be full and also probably more calories than a sedentary person needs in a day.  Animals just eat as much as they can of whatever they can get, and it's usually fine because they're as active as they evolved to be.  They don't have the ability to get in a car, go somewhere, hand over a few pieces of paper and just not be hungry anymore.  We can, so we're used to not being hungry.  To eat enough that you're not hungry, while also taking in an appropriate number of calories, requires eating a lot of low-calorie plant matter.  Since most people don't enjoy that, eating that in addition to the food that they do enjoy leads to a balanced diet.  Vegans don't eat a balanced diet, but they can eat a healthy diet.</p>
<p>Lastly, our idea of what a &quot;balanced diet&quot; is has been influenced by marketing.  The majority of humans can't even digest dairy, but the milk lobby don't fuck around, so in the US it's included in the government-endorsed concept of a &quot;balanced&quot; or healthy diet, and the 75% of the world's people for whom it doesn't really even qualify as food because their systems can't process it are deemed &quot;lactose intolerant.&quot;  They should just call folks like me &quot;lactose tolerant.&quot;*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Full disclosure: I love me some dairy.  I love cheese.  I love ice cream.  I'm a middle-aged man and I still drink milk sometimes!  But if 75% of the species gets sick from eating it, then it ain't really required for a healthy diet, is it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it can actually have a pretty significant effect on communications. <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/2aed/1ae6a8739069d3bc6f638758458425b079ca.pdf" target="_blank">In particular, if S(f) is the spectrum of your original signal, S(<em>a</em>f) will be the spectrum afterwards (PDF).</a> Here <em>a</em> is relatively close^(1) to 1, basically 1 - v/c where c is the speed of light and v the velocity of the object. At most the shift will be a few Hz.</p>
<p>The shift in Hz is not a problem, in fact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-locked_loop" target="_blank">phase lock loop</a> are already usually applied so that the receiver can reap the gains of using coherent demodulators (PDF) <a href="http://wireless.ece.ufl.edu/twong/Notes/Comm/ch2.pdf" target="_blank">see here (PDF)</a>. Phase lock loops help to account for artifacts such as signal drift, and so on. The point being this is not where the problem comes in.</p>
<p>The big problem is what occurs with multi-path communications. If your signal has multiple reflections (like, if you are in a room of some sort instead of in an open field). When moving now, there will be a different velocity shift depending on the angle of arrival of the wave. And because of this the signal, being the sum of the different waves, can experience a wide arrange of channels. <del>Some of these channels will begin to have different interference patterns.</del> This is problematic though as the capacity (maximum amount of bits/second that can be sent over it) basically defaults to the minimum rate achievable over all possible channels simultaneously (see <a href="http://www.ece.umd.edu/~prakash/papers/Csiszar_Narayan-IT_1991.pdf" target="_blank">Theorem 1 (PDF)</a>). <del>Thus if one of those bands you pass over has a really bad channel, there goes your ability to connect in general.</del> While the variation due only to doppler shift will be small (about 80 Hz for 5 mph over 5GHz), it is just on the edge of what is considered to not be completely trivial.^(2)</p>
<p>Anytime you transmit a code with a higher rate than the capacity of the channel, an error will occur. As a result a moving source does increase the probability of packet error, with the probability increase depending on the speed and strength of the reflections. </p>
<p>The same principal applies to AM and FM radio. Although both of which are horribly inefficient in terms of transferring information, so it is unlikely that it would have a noticeable impact. To put it in perspective, a WiFi router is trying to transmit at the very edge of comprehension, while AM and FM require the signal to be easily understandable. Adding a little bit more noise to the WiFi signal will move it past the point of comprehension, while for AM and FM the added noise will still result in a large enough SNR for it to not make a difference. </p>
<p>Edit-- </p>
<p>1 - correction due to /u/devman0 </p>
<p>2 - Added later, as was pointed out by /u/dirtyuncleron69 and /u/dayzstu. Crossed out what is not directly attributable to the doppler shift.  </p>
<p>Also, while on the edit, for a much more in depth discussion about how we model movement and the impact this has on communication, please see <a href="https://wsl.stanford.edu/~andrea/Wireless/SampleChapters.pdf" target="_blank">Wireless Communications by Andrea Goldsmith</a>. She is the most prominent authority on the subject. Chapter 3 in particular talks about this exact scenario in realistic environments, and chapter 5 the impact on capacity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're confusing modulation frequency and the wave frequency. The wave frequency is in 2.4GHz or 5.8Ghz. <em>That</em> is what would change if you were to run towards or away from the router. So you would be slightly shifting the frequency away from it's channel but you would have to move very fast for this to exceed the lock range of the receiver. The modulation rate (how fast the waveform is changed to encode data) would not be affected. So there is no way to make it go faster by moving. But if you move fast enough (way faster than running) to cause transmission errors and trigger retransmissions, you might make it slower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So... okay, wifi uses radio waves (at a particular frequency) to exchange information between your computer and your router. Radio waves are a kind of electromagnetic radiation, just like light, X-rays, etc. but their frequency is much lower. This means they carry less energy, so they're not harmful, unlike gamma rays at the opposite end of the <a href="https://cdn.miniphysics.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/electromagneticspectrum.jpg" target="_blank">spectrum</a>. </p>
<p>Now, because radio waves are electromagnetic radiation, they travel at the speed of light (c = 3 x 10^8 m/s) which is... really fast. The speed is slightly lower in air, but this is still a good approximation. </p>
<p>Doppler shift is when, due to relative motion, a wave is &quot;squished&quot; or &quot;stretched&quot;. In light, when the wave gets &quot;squished,&quot; since the speed at which it travels remains unchanged but either the object receiving the wave or the object emitting it are in motion, the frequency increases and the wavelength gets shorter. <a href="http://images.tutorvista.com/cms/images/83/frequency-wavelength-image1.PNG" target="_blank">Here</a> is a visual explanation of what frequency and wavelength are, just in case anyone reading this doesn't know. When the frequency of a light wave increases, the color you see is closer to violet. This is what blue shift is. The opposite happens when the wave gets &quot;stretched&quot;: frequency decreases and wavelength gets longer, so we see it as closer to red (red shift). </p>
<p>So supposing you were to run toward you wifi router, since the radio waves traveling from it to your computer don't change their speed, the frequency at which they reach your computer's antenna would be higher (but only very slightly) because you'd be &quot;squishing&quot; the waves, so to speak. If you ran away, the frequency would be lower.</p>
<p>Unless you were able to move at very high velocities relative to your wifi router, the difference wouldn't be very meaningful. Remember that these waves are traveling at the speed of light, and that's 300,000,000 m/s. A person walking moves at about 1 m/s. As far as the radio wave knows, there isn't much difference between you staying still and you moving at, say, 3 m/s. (I actually don't know how fast people run, but this is simply a random number). For the wave, you're pretty much essentially staying still anyway. This is why we can't actually <em>see</em> red shift and blue shift, even though we hear it. Sound waves travel at much lower speeds than light does, so the difference there is audible, but since light moves so fast, our eyes can't really detect the slight (very slight) difference in color. </p>
<p>So your computer receives the wifi signal at a very slightly different frequency. This wouldn't affect download speed in a noticeable way. If you were moving fast enough, then it may cause errors, though. The reason is that wifi is basically a kind of radio, so your computer receives the signal through an antenna. The antenna is capable of receiving signals at a range of frequencies. I'm not sure how big it is in wifi antennas, but my handheld radio uses the same antenna for a range of about 4MHz and another one for a range of about 30MHz (this one is at a higher set of frequencies). In other words, your computer will be able to receive the signal and should be able to interpret it unless you're able to move fast enough that the change in frequency falls outside the channel it's &quot;listening&quot; on. Due to nature, a radio wave at a frequency in particular actually &quot;spills over&quot; onto neighbor frequencies (and you may even hear harmonics on farther away frequencies), so it's not a neat signal that exists exclusively at that specific frequency. There's a bit of leeway.</p>
<p>I'll answer the bit about AM and FM in the afternoon, though, I'm late for class. But short answer: it shouldn't matter either, unless you're moving really fast. Then, the FM signal would have issues that the AM signal wouldn't- but if you're moving fast enough for that to happen, then you're not gonna be receiving the signal correctly to begin with because it'll have changed frequencies beyond what the radio can receive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked on 3g/4g mobile phone baseband. Doppler effect has a major role there. Exactly as the other posters said, the multiple paths that the signal takes to get from the base station to your mobile's antenna combine in ways that make resulting  received signal fluctuate wildly both in phase and amplitude. Dealing with this is one of the main tasks of the &quot;baseband&quot; processing chain. In fact, the mobile phone performance test specs have different test cases to cover a range of conditions, including different values of Doppler shift.</p>
<p>One other note. Doppler shift is significant even when there is no multipath. Imagine a mobile phone on a high speed train in Japan. Base stations are sometimes located near the train tracks. So the Doppler shift changes rapidly from, say plus 2kHz to minus 2kHz as the train zooms past the base station. So the AFC (automatic frequency correction) in the phone gets exercised heavily.</p>
<p>EDIT. I want to add that many of the other posts here, including the top post, have minor inaccuracies or misleading statements. The main missing piece of information that everyone has missed so far is that all current wireless systems use phase modulation. Either QAM or at least QPSK. This means that the information is encoded in the phase of the signal. Even the smallest amount of Doppler shift makes the phase rotate over time. The receiver has to constantly compensate for this effect. This is also one of the reasons why the mobile radio signal structure (encoding and modulation) is quite complex. This is also why Wi-Fi can't be used when mobile. Wi-Fi can't cope with high speed Doppler.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Because of this, the centers of the wheels extend past the edge of the rim. This means you can put two wheels face to face, and bolt them together to the hub. When you look at a set of dual wheels mounted, you see the concave side of the outer wheel, so you see the lugs as being recessed. Since the front wheels are single, they mount them the same way they do the inner wheels of each dual pair, meaning with the convex side facing out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey guys, first time commenting here on ELI5. Truck mechanic here and I wanted to take a chance to clear some misconceptions up that some people have as well as confirm others. The front (Steer) wheels are singular and are turned essentially the same way that any car or truck wheel faces with its concave facing outwards. The inner rear axle dual also faces this same direction if you look closely at a set. The second rear wheel on each hub is placed there because the axle is rated to hold a higher weight than that of single rear wheels. </p>
<p>If a vehicle has what is called a &quot;super single&quot; (A single overly large rear axle tire) it has the same weight capabilities as a axle with duals. The benefit to this is fuel economy which tires play a factor in. While at one time they were very expensive in there early years they have drastically come down in price to actually be cheaper than replace 2 tires in some areas of Canada and the US.   </p>
<p>I was reading some of the comments about interchangeability of the Steer tires vs the rear drive tires. To say that people are wrong and you cannot interchange wheels and tires would be incorrect. But to be clear though, most Highway tractors have different steer tires vs drives. Again fuel economy is a factor. The steer tires are generally smooth grooved with more of a streamlined pattern. At the end of the day they are there for just that. Steering. there is no driving force being applied to them so they are designed to provide minimum rolling resistance with optimal steering capabilities. The drives usually have a more aggressive tread pattern for a balance of grip, wear control and you guessed it fuel economy. Also side note here, retreaded tires are illegal as steer tires here in the great white north. Not sure but it is likely the same in the US.</p>
<p>Lastly as far as wheel torque goes this is something of a myths/legends vs science question. A lot of mechanics I knew of coming up in the trade believed that torquing a lug nut on a car was as easy as listening for a the right amount of bangs coming from their impact gun when tightening a set. Some believed in the &quot;hit em hard with you gun and then torque em after&quot; approach while others swore if they did not use a torque wrench on every lug nut a wheel was sure to come off. The correct answer is the last one but with a procedure of assuring each lug actually moves when torquing. If they do not and your torque still clicks you have torqued nothing. The lug nut is already over tight which can be as dangerous as under tightening. Over tightening stretches the wheel studs which the illustrious engineers worked so hard to design. This one of the big causes to wheel coming off on trucks and cars as the studs can shear or time allowing the wheel come loose. </p>
<p>TL:DR Amounts of tires and sizes are all put into the design of the vehicle when ordering it for maximum efficiency. In some cases the customer can go against recommendations due to cost or applications. As far as maintenance goes. If your the one working on it. Torque it. The cost and damage of a 150+ pound tire and wheel into someones windshield costs far more than the time it takes to use your torque wrench. As far as everyone else goes. choose a reputable dealer/shop for your tire needs.</p>
<p>p.s. Those shiny pointy things some drivers put on lugs are just for show. For show and for me to slice my leg on when servicing a truck... but they do look cool ;)         </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The rims on a semi truck, all ten of them, are the exact same wheel. Most standard is 22.5&quot; overall diameter and 8.25&quot; wide. These wheels can be run on any position on the trucks, even the trailers. </p>
<p>That means, that the rear wheels on a truck (known as the drive wheels) are mounted face to face. If you take the outer most wheel on a drive axle of a semi truck, and then turn it around, you could install it to the front (or steer) axle. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A seizure occurs when there is out-of-control electrical activity in your brain. A seizure can take many forms, ranging anywhere from an involuntary muscle twitch, to &quot;blanking out,&quot; to losing consciousness and convulsing on ground uncontrollably (which most people think of when they hear the word &quot;seizure&quot;). Seizures can take many forms because they have many causes.  They can be focal (i.e. propagating from one area of the brain, such as with a brain tumor or a brain bleed), or can be global (seizure activity everywhere in the brain at once, such as with metabolic disturbances).</p>
<p>If you suspect somebody has a seizure, the first diagnostic test to get is an EEG (electroencephalogram), which is essentially an EKG for the brain. It graphs the electrical activity of the brain. A trained neurologist can interpret normal brain wave activity and differentiate it from possible seizure activity. If you are certain that there is seizure activity, you get an MRI to look for any structural abnormalities that can cause seizures (trauma, tumors, AV malformations, etc).</p>
<p>Seizures are treated in many different ways. Ideally, you treat the underlying cause (get rid of the tumor, correct the metabolic abnormality, etc), but sometimes this isn't possible. You can also treat them with medications called anti-epileptic drugs. There are many AED's, with different mechanisms of action and different side effects (agitation, suicidal ideations, dizziness, risk of taking when pregnant). Choosing the right AED can be tricky, because you have to know what type of seizure you're treating, and weigh the risk of side effects with the benefit of hopefully stopping the seizures.</p>
<p>Almost everyone will have a seizure at some point in their life, and most of us don't remember having one. Needless to say, not everybody is on an AED. We reserve treatment for people who have had multiple seizures (epilepsy), or are at risk of having multiple seizures.</p>
<p>Identifying triggers and avoiding them is a must (avoiding sleep deprivation, bright/flashing lights, etc). Ketogenic diets have also been found to be beneficial in reducing seizure activity in some patients. Also, patients with epilepsy must know how to avoid certain activities in case they have a seizure while doing them (driving, climbing ladders, cooking with gas, stepping into bath tubs).</p>
<p>If you see somebody that you suspect is actively seizing, the best thing to do is give them room, keep others back, and call 911. Do NOT try and hold them down, and do NOT stick anything in their mouth. It is a common misconception that people with seizures will swallow their tongue. This is physically impossible.</p>
<p>Epilepsy is a very common neurologic disorder. Fortunately, we live in a time where we have so many different ways to treat seizures. New medicines are being invented all the time. Vimpat, for example, was just approved by the FDA 8 years ago, and is now used in hospitals all around the United States. We still have a long ways to go, but we're making great progress in treating epilepsy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone has actually explained what happens to your body and brain when you have a seizure. </p>
<p>The neurons in your brain are constantly firing small electrical signals and impulses at different rates and times. When you have a seizure, these signals begin to fire at the same time, creating large excitatory waves that can spread throughout the brain. Depending on where in your brain the seizure is, your body will be affected differently. If it is in your motor strip, those signals may travel down through your body, causing focal convulsions or shaking. If the electrical activity spreads to both hemispheres of the brain or &quot;generalizes&quot; you lose consciousness and can have bilateral shaking, or what we usually call a generalized or grand mal seizure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you get more tired you're body tries harder and harder to send you to sleep. You will then reach an 'optimal' state of tiredness where you will probably be able to sleep within 30 mins.
However, if you stay awake past this point your body thinks there is something wrong for you to still be awake, e.g. You're in danger.
As a consequence and survival mechanism it gets rid of the drowsiness by releasing adrenaline to increase alertness as well as other mechanisms to make you alert.
This state of temporary alertness can't be maintained for long and you still need to sleep eventually so you become tired again.
The cycle can repeat but not for too long, maybe around a day or 2 at most.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Same thing: your body's sense of acceleration doesn't stop when you go to sleep.  Your body knows and wakes up when it suddenly accelerates (like if it's about to fall off a bed).  You probably stop yourself from rolling off a bed more often than you know, because most of the time you go right back to sleep and forget the whole thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a flood engineer i wish i came here sooner to answer a few questions. </p>
<p>But the main thing is that a number of vectors will remove the water due to gravity.   Namely sewers, ground drains, good old evaporation, lay of the land, local ground geology, tidal differences to name a few.  Once the hurricane has passed though then levels will drop fairly quickly.</p>
<p>The biggest problem will be both the environmental (mobilised sewage etc...) and physical property damage that has occured.</p>
<p>Lots of standing water means mozzies and vermin.  Contaminated waters means polluted ground water sources, damaged agriculture infrastructure, dead livestock, crops wiped out and quarantined/destroyed  (certain crops absorb harmful nasties). </p>
<p>Infrastructure wise lots of work gutting out the drainage system and clearing hurricane damage will take place. Damaged electricity/phone/gas infrastructure will need checking too.  </p>
<p>Now let's talk about the houses that are damaged. </p>
<p>There are typical damage assessments that can be done but there are 2 typical factors that ultimately determine damage costs and severity - the depth of water and the time water stays around (ok and type of building materials used)</p>
<p>Anything typically above 400mm for a day or 2 means that the lower floor needs gutting and requires a complete rework.</p>
<p>Now think of this in terms of demands locally.  Every homeless person will  need rehousing, every house will require skilled trades to repair them(and they WILL be in  demand). It will take years for all affected properties to be repaired by all trades.</p>
<p>But as a starter for then why not google what happened during hurricane katrina or the 2005 flooding carlisle in the UK.  Some of the stats are just mindblowing and heartbreaking.</p>
<p>Ps also google the lake levels rises during hurricane Katrina due to the low air pressure alone.  It makes for amazing reading.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a semester away from graduating with a degree in soil science, so I'll answer this as it pertains to soil.</p>
<p>The most important concept to understand before I delve into this is that everything moves through soil via water. This includes nutrients, pollutants, minerals, etc.</p>
<p>The large scale scope of a flood like this is pollution and soil erosion. When soil is flooded to the point that water can no longer infiltrate, it begins transporting the top 2 layers of soil. This is the organic layer (such as leaf litter) and the surface layer (topsoil). These are the two most nutrient rich layers of soil, and often the most polluted (by pesticides, foreign chemicals, or trash). This is not good for a few reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The main source of nutrients have now been stripped from the plants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sub-surface layers are exposed, and from what I understand about Texan soil, this is mostly clay.</p>
</li>
<li>Pollutants are now being transported and dumped into waterways or varying soil environments. </li>
</ol>
<p>Some of the nutrients will be returned to soil elsewhere, but most of these nutrients will flow to waterways and into the ocean. This will not be good for the Gulf, as it is already hypoxic (lack of dissolved oxygen due to nutrient runoff. Essentially, the large amount of nutrients results in algae blooms which deprives the water of oxygen). The reduction of plant matter will also reduce the stability of the soil, meaning it will be more likely to erode in the future. </p>
<p>The second portion of this is that clay now becomes the surface layer. Because clay is so small, it takes water significantly longer to move through the soil profile, thus lowering the hydraulic conductivity. This means water runoff will now become a large problem in the affected areas for months or years to come.</p>
<p>The third portion is pollutants. Chemicals and trash are now being transported to different soils and waterways. Not good.</p>
<p>As for the smaller scope impacts, soil horizons will become disrupted. Soil stability will be negatively impacted. Nutrients will be forced through the horizons quicker, leaving a deprived soil. Many soil microbes (the most important indicator of soil health, depending on who you ask) will be killed off.</p>
<p>So, yeah. It's disastrous for soil and the overall environmental health of the area.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, as for plants, many can survive being submerged for up to a weekish. Many cannot. The flooding will inhibit root nutrient uptake, which will result in decay. Water-logged roots are also more susceptible to organisms that specialize in root-rot.      </p>
<p>EDIT2: /u/BadBadger42 asked a question about highly expansive clays. These are what we call shrink-swell soils. The clay fraction is expanded in area when water-logged, which causes extra stress on infrastructure. This is the leading cause of flooding basements, and why many buildings in Texas do not have basements. Taking a look at <a href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_MEDIA/nrcs144p2_000979.jpg" target="_blank">this soil map of Texas</a>, most of the area effected is Vertisol. I'm sure you've all noticed a vertisol before, when it dries it looks like <a href="http://geotechfoundation.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/cracked-soil-texas.jpg" target="_blank">this</a>. The &quot;swell&quot; of the soil is caused by the micropores between the clay particles becoming over-saturated - and when it dries (&quot;shrinks&quot;) those cracks are left behind. Vertisol is the shrink-swell classification of soil. I would imagine that the effects of shrink-swell on infrastructure will be exacerbated by the flooding.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Professional Engineer in Pennsylvania who consults in stormwater management.</p>
<p>Q1: Water will recede just like any other storm, it will just take MUCH longer. In an urban setting like Houston, it will flow into storm drains along the curb, into small pipes like 18” diameter, then those feed into larger pipes like 48” or even concrete box culverts which might be 15’ wide by 4’ high (the possible dimensions are endless). Those large pipes/culverts drain into the streams and rivers. Everything eventually keeps draining downhill to the ocean, bay, bayou, etc. </p>
<p>Q2: In general, this probably won’t change much regarding the landscape. It will look like the same place as it did before, except structures around main drainage channels may have washed away.</p>
<p>Q3: No permanent lakes or rivers will be made. Everything will drain naturally in a matter of days. If there is a low spot that doesn’t drain by gravity to a storm sewer, channel, stream, etc., that depression could hold water longer but it will eventually infiltrate into the soil and/or evaporate.</p>
<p>Up here in Pennsylvania, we design pipes/culverts to carry up to the 100-year storm which would be like 8” of rain in 24 hours. Not sure what they design for down south, but their 100-year storm is probably like 12”+ of rain in 24 hours. This hurricane is dumping 4+ feet in some areas so there’s no way to drain that much water very quickly. Just have to wait.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water will recede in basically same way as in the normal, non-flooding rain. </p>
<p>There are two (three) types of <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclerunoff.html" target="_blank">runoff</a> (= outflow/discharge). We have direct runoff and basic runoff. </p>
<p>One part of direct runoff is surface runoff: water is no longer being soaked up by soil, because soil is fully saturated, therefore water can only flow on the surface. </p>
<p>Other type of direct runoff is hypodermic runoff - water is <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercycleinfiltration.html" target="_blank">infiltrated</a> to the soil, but above groundwater level, only in soil capillaries, where it's flowing away.</p>
<p>About basic runoff, this is the <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/watercyclegwdischarge.html" target="_blank">groundwater runoff</a>, where water in zone of saturation(=aquifier), beneath the groundwater level, flows off.</p>
<p>When you have flood, all soil is fully saturated even in aeration zone, above groundwater level, so soil is not able to soak up water and water is not able to infiltrate into the soil, so it stays on the ground. Or there is precipitation so strong, water cannot infiltrate into the soil in time. But, in time, all that water flows away, because groundwater is basically connected system of water bodies, so excess water is distributed to other areas via basic runoff and via basic runoff, especially surface runoff, it flows back to terrain depression, rivers and other areas with low altitude. In this area it's the gulf of Mexico for most of this excess water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
