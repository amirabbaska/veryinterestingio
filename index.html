<p><a href="http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Fistic-Medicine-The-Biophysics-of-Taking-a-Punch-22134" target="_blank">http://www.sherdog.com/news/articles/Fistic-Medicine-The-Biophysics-of-Taking-a-Punch-22134</a></p>
<p>It’s hard not to be in awe of Tito Ortiz’s head. So imperious in its shape and proportions. So defiantly unbowed. So … well, frankly, so unbelievably mammoth.</p>
<p>It was only after I had been admiring Tito’s head for some time that I learned that in addition to its obvious aesthetic qualities, his cranium’s superhuman proportions gave him near invincibility in the ring. Amazing! And it was only after I had been believing that for some time more that I went to medical school and realized it was absolute nonsense.</p>
<p>If a strangely enlarged cranium doesn’t provide a fighter with infallible protection against knockouts, the so-called “iron chin,” what does? What allows one fighter to absorb a man-killing blow to the face and dooms another to crumple before it? The answer is straightforward and multi-syllabic: the sternocleidomastoid muscles.</p>
<p>The sternocleidomastoids (SCM) -- one on each side of the neck -- are paired muscles, composed of the sternomastoid component that runs from the sternum to the mastoid process of the skull, immediately behind and below the ear, and the cleidomastoid muscle that runs from the clavicle to the mastoid. When flexed, the SCM rotates the head toward the opposing side. Flexing both SCMs in alternation shakes the head “no,” as one might if waving off an overly concerned ringside physician. Flexing them simultaneously flexes the neck forward and extends the head -- in the right circumstance resisting the force of a blow to the face. It’s why fighters often seem to be ducking into a punch.</p>
<p>One can look in a mirror and flex his SCMs, looking a bit like Lou Ferrigno after someone has seriously pissed off Bruce Banner. The muscles are prominent. Unfortunately, they are also isolated; no other significant muscle supports them in resisting backward movement of the cranium.</p>

Moreover, arrayed against them are the muscles used in throwing a punch: calves, gluts, lats, pecs, triceps, etc. These are some of the most powerful muscles in the body. It is not surprising then that we rarely see the thrower of a well-placed punch to the head grasping his hand in pain and stumbling back in amazement as his opponent casually flexes his SCMs and smiles; the muscular arithmetic is firmly in the thrower’s favor.</p>
<p>When a punch of sufficient force strikes the face, it accelerates the front of the cranium back into the frontal lobes of the brain. This is the irreducible sweet science of brain injury. A gentle blow to the frontal lobes causes various degrees of central nervous system sedation -- it stuns the brain -- and a blow of sufficient force simply shuts the brain off. Seizures are not uncommon.</p>
<p>When a blow to the head comes from an angle, as opposed to straight on, only one of the SCMs can resist the force: The resulting acceleration of the cranium and damage to the brain are thus much greater.</p>
<p>Worse still, when a fighter is struck on the chin, the mandible creates leverage that magnifies the force and damage. This is the phenomenon of a fighter being hit “on the button.” Incidentally, this is an argument why, all things being equal, fighters with large heads and Cro-Magnon-like chins are at a theoretical mechanical disadvantage in withstanding blows.</p>
<p>Lastly, the anatomy of the brain makes blows to the back of the head particularly dangerous. The extensor muscles of the neck are far stronger than the SCMs, but the part of the brain under direct assault is more delicate. The frontal lobes injured in a frontal blow control speech, movement and thought -- all the neurologic skills we see depleted in old boxers. The back of the brain, the hindbrain or rhombencephalon, controls respiration, heart rate, swallowing, blood pressure. Fighters who sustain injuries there never grow to be old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A tremendous amount of this is skill and practice, you cant beat physics, any strike which is powerful enough to cause the brain to bounce against the inside of the cranium is liable to cause a knockout.
A well practiced fighter will be able to &quot;ride&quot; or &quot;roll with&quot; punches to an extent, by spotting the incoming blow and either slipping the punch (causing a glancing blow) or allowing your head to move along with the direction of the force applied you can lessen the impact on the brain. </p>
<p>Imagine catching a raw egg, if you can cushion the landing by following through with the movement of the thrown egg and decelerating it gently vs. It landing on the ground you can prevent the egg breaking. </p>
<p>Being &quot;caught cold&quot; is where the fighter doesn't see the approaching blow and is unable to lessen the impact by riding the punch. </p>
<p>Tldr. Heads aren't built that differently, how you ride the punch makes the biggest difference to being able to &quot;take a punch&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll go ahead and preface this by saying that Extra History did a really quite good series on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nZkP2b-4vo" target="_blank">history of paper money</a> that deals in a fair amount of depth with how early banking works, so you should definitely check that out if it's something you're interested in. The history of how banking works is intrinsically tied up in the history of paper money, so... you know. Hold on to your butts.</p>
<p>Originally, a bank was just a place where you stored your gold. So you didn't have to get your gold out and carry it around with you everywhere, banks started to issue their own promissory notes. Paper money, then, is really just a sort of shorthand that says 'Hey, if you bring this to a bank, they'll give you a certain amount of cash in exchange, no bamboozle'. Banks put out their own notes (which were really just receipts saying you had a certain amount of gold in their vault) and kept their own logs -- but that also brought with it a bigger problem. Say you live in Homesville, and your money is deposited at the Homesville Local Bank. You travel to Awaysburgh, with your Homesville paper money, and you try to buy something. The Awaysburgh shopkeeper takes your $100 Homesville note, looks at it, and says, 'No.'</p>
<p>Well, shit.</p>
<p>See, for him to get that $100 worth of gold, he has to travel all the way to Homesville to go to the Homesville Local Bank and withdraw that money himself -- which is a pain in the ass. Now sure, he can wait until he has more Homesville residents passing through and paying him in Homesville dollars to make the trip worthwhile, but maybe there just isn't all that much Homesville traffic in his little town. He might be waiting <em>months</em> until he has enough Holmesville currency to justify schlepping all the way to your podunk town to cash in your debt. Until he goes there (assuming there's no one else he can palm your Homesville dollars on), that money is worthless to him -- literally not worth the paper it's written on. That doesn't help you, of course, because you're now hundreds of miles from home and you've got paper money that works great in your local tavern, but here might as well be toilet paper. Maybe he'll agree to give you something in exchange for it, but to compensate him for his effort and the risk he's taking (after all, what if your bank collapses? What if he gets robbed during the long and arduous trip to cash in?)... maybe he'll just give you $50 worth of stuff instead, how does that sound?</p>
<p>So how did the banks get around this system? Well, Homesville Local Bank can set up a branch in Awaysburgh, with a store of gold in each branch. (After all, it doesn't matter <em>which</em> gold coins you get, exactly, only that they're of the same value.) Then, your Awaysburgh shopkeeper can easily take your notes to his loval Homesville branch, cash it in, and the two branches can shuttle money back and forth between each other to keep the coffers full. That explains how branches of banks form, and why they work better: two banks in separate cities sharing funds and customers are vastly more desirable than two banks that work entirely independently. This was helped somewhat by the creation of central banks and the notion of legal tender -- that the government would take over the printing of banknotes and ensure that there was (at least, in theory) a level of stability in the value of a currency, rather than it being at the whim of whether your particular bank just disappeared one morning -- but that's <a href="https://youtu.be/LrB9bS2VOLE?t=3m14s" target="_blank">a long and surprisingly convoluted story</a> that doesn't really play into the main question here.</p>
<p>It's a lot easier to transfer information -- which, really, is all bank notes are -- than it is to transfer gold itself. Over time, this transfer of information became easier (first by writing, then by phone and now by computers), but the basic principle is the same. As long as all branches have a way of checking just how much money is in a person's account, the actual <em>method</em> of checking only really changes how convenient and safe the system is. That's why now you can get your money pretty much instantly at any branch of your bank, even halfway around the world, but historically it might have taken some time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Even working in retail as recently as the late 90s, we would have to call and verify checks over $500.  Call up the customers bank, give the clients name and account number(from the check) and the bank would tell you if it would clear or not.  They wouldn't give you extraneous info like how much extra was in there, or how short it would be, but they would easily tell you that yes, as of that moment, the check would or would not clear.</p>
<p>Of course, this didn't account for things like someone going out and writing 10 different $500 checks in the same day when all they had was $600 in their bank account, so there was still a risk of checks not clearing even if you did get verbal confirmation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It depended on the state. In the 1970s, big banks in California had branches all up and down the state. In Illinois, branch banks were not permitted (or maybe 1 or 2? not sure). The idea was to protect small banks.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, all banks closed at 3 PM. The bank employees then processed all the money and paperwork until their workday was done.
If you had a savings account, you had an account book, about the size of a passport. When you added or took money out of savings, you handed the account book to a bank clerk, who put it in a machine. Then the clerk punched in the transaction, and the amount in/out, and the new balance was printed. Interest on savings accounts was calculated quarterly.  I was a little kid at the time, but I think my folks said that you had to walk into the bank to get your interest recorded, or you would miss it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before any concept of subatomic particles, people knew about atoms and elements via a wide array of experiments (which could be detailed, but isn't really relevant to this story).  When you have a purified sample of an element, you can determine how much an atom of it weighs, and so we start with knowing a bunch of elements and their atomic weights.</p>
<p>Enter Dmitri Mendeleev.  He notices that if you arrange the elements by increasing weight, you end up with repeating groups of elements that are chemically similar.  This was nice, except people knew something wasn't quite right with it, because you had to do a couple tricks to make similarly-acting elements end up in the right groups (such as swapping the by-weight ordering of tellurium and iodine or cobalt and nickel).  Once this was done, the elements gradually got numbered using their place in the table: 1 is Hydrogen, 2 is Helium, etc.  The numbers didn't mean anything to anyone, they were just useful identifiers, and they were called atomic numbers.</p>
<p>Later, Joseph J. Thomson is working on figuring out what is going on in electric discharge tubes.  He discovers that tiny particles are being discharged from the cathode in those tubes, and he managed to measure the ratio between their charge and mass.  He calls those particles electrons.</p>
<p>Next we go to Ernest Rutherford.  He had an experiment where he fired a bunch of positively-charged particles at a thin sheet of gold leaf, and he noticed that the vast majority of them made it through without interacting with anything, but a few of them got deflected.  This led him to hypothesize that atoms had a dense central core of positive charge (the nucleus) and then a diffuse cloud of electrons around it.  Since atoms overall usually have neutral electric charge, the number of electrons and the charge of the nucleus had to be equal.</p>
<p>Following on from this was Henry Moseley.  He measured the wavelengths of X-rays sent off by various elements in a particular kind of experimental setup, and he determined that the wavelength was proportional to the square of the atomic number.  That indicated that the atomic number actually indicated a physical quantity, which was then hypothesized as the amount of charge in the nucleus.  One of the neat things this did was conclusively show where there were gaps in the periodic table: elements that should exist, but hadn't been discovered yet.  In the course of time, all those gaps were filled in, once people knew what to look for.</p>
<p>Back to Rutherford again, a few years later.  He succeeds in experimentally stripping out everything but the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, which has a charge of 1 and a weight of 1.  He calls what he ends up with a proton.</p>
<p>Finally, we need to discover the neutron.  We already know that the nucleus has a positive charge of the atomic number, and thus there are that many electrons as well, but the problem is that most atoms have a much higher weight than their atomic number, so something more than protons had to be in the atomic nucleus.  A leading theory was that there were a bunch of extra proton-electron pairs just hanging around in the nucleus, but that was shown to be impossible.  Enter James Chadwick, who shot a weird kind of radiation others had discovered at paraffin and other substances and measured what happened, and concluded that the radiation was in fact made up of neutrally-charged particles that had about the same mass as a proton.  He's discovered the neutron.</p>
<p>So, now that we know everything, we can gather up our data on elements.  The number of protons in an atom is the atomic number of that element.  That's also the number of electrons, since atoms are neutrally-charged.  Finally, the difference between the atom's weight and the atomic number is the number of neutrons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of my friends from when I was in physics work in a lab where they do very precise isotope measurements. The number of protons in an atom is easy because each element has different chemical properties. To determine the number of neutrons, they heat the atoms into a plasma then put them in a mini particle accelerator before throwing them at a sensor target. The different masses of the atoms due to the number of neutrons result in different isotopes having slightly different paths in the accelerator and so each particular isotope hits the sensor at different locations, allowing them to measure the exact isotope ratios of the sample. With some adjustments you could do the same thing to count protons too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want to find particles which decay by emission of protons and neutrons, you don't want to look at very heavy nuclei (large N + Z). Instead you want to look at nuclei with extreme N/Z ratios (large |N - Z|). If you go to the extremes of |N - Z|, you reach the <em>driplines</em>, where the outermost nucleons are not bound to the core of the nucleus. This is the point where the separation energy (the energy it takes to remove a single nucleon) goes negative, and it becomes favorable for the extra nucleon to simply &quot;drip&quot; off of the core. You'll see a stark difference between the <em>bound</em> nuclei which decay via beta emission (lifetimes around milliseconds), and <em>unbound</em> nuclei which decay by nucleon emission (lifetimes around 10^(-21) seconds).</p>
<p>To understand why these decays happen where they do, you have to understand how they happen. Alpha decay happens when an alpha particle tunnels out of the nuclear potential well. Alpha particles are extremely tightly-bound nuclei, so they're a very favorable cluster to emit in a decay process. Above a certain point (lead-208), the alpha separation energy becomes negative, so all nuclei above that point are in principle unstable to alpha decay (although some may primarily decay via beta or spontaneous fission).</p>
<p>Beta decay occurs for slightly unbalanced N/Z ratios, because it allows for protons to be turned into neutrons and vice versa. If you plot the ground state energies of a group of nuclei with the same mass number, you get a plot which looks like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258388038/figure/fig6/AS:320549642358797@1453436398292/Representation-of-the-energies-of-the-A76-isobars-The-single-beta-decay-b-green.png" target="_blank">this</a>. It looks like a parabola with one or two species near the bottom, with the lowest energy. The ones near the bottom are the most stable, so all others along the chain will beta decay towards the bottom of the &quot;valley&quot;.</p>
<p>So now you understand what alpha and beta decays are, so you can hopefully see why extremely heavy nuclei would be able to do them.</p>
<p>The next thing to understand is why they <em>don't</em> emit single nucleons. As I mentioned before, nucleon emission happens beyond the driplines. Experimentally, the proton and neutron driplines are only known for relatively light elements. So for very heavy nuclei we don't yet know where the driplines are, and all of the heavy nuclei we have observed so far are within the driplines, so we don't observe any of them decaying by nucleon emission.</p>
<p>Since the alpha particle is so tightly-bound, it's a much more favorable particle to emit than a single nucleon. So for heavy nuclei, the alpha separation energy is negative but the nucleon separation energies are positive. The alpha particle also has spin 0 whereas nucleons have spin 1/2. So alpha decays can occur without changing the angular momentum of the daughter nucleus, which makes the decay more &quot;willing&quot; to occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything is flammable if you try hard enough.</p>
<p>Serious answer, fire has what is known as the fire triangle, if any corner of the triangle is lacking, the fire will go out (or never start)  The corners are heat, oxygen, and fuel.</p>
<p>So, you have a nice chunk of steel, but it just refuses to burn, why not? You know that iron will react with oxygen to make rust, so it should burn, but it just never seems to- the problem is heat.  A block of steel will wick heat away from where you are applying it, so it never gets hot enough to sustain its own burning.  When you get it hot enough to react with oxygen, it's still a slow process, and the heat is getting pulled in to the center of the block, starving the fire.</p>
<p>Another factor is that steel doesn't vaporize when it burns, it turns to rust.  If you have ever watched any videos of metal working and seen pieces of dark material falling away, that's actually steel that has oxidized (called scale) due to the heat and exposure to oxygen- but it also seals the steel inside away from more oxygen reaching it to react.</p>
<p>When you powder steel(or even just shred it in to steel wool), there is no longer a mass of steel to suck all the heat out of the reaction, and the oxidized steel can't get in the way of the oxygen getting in contact with the unburned steel.</p>
<p>TL;DR: if something doesn't burn, but does when powdered, something about its material properties normally blocks one or more of the legs of the fire triangle</p>
<p>As a side note, there is a method of cutting steel that works by getting it really hot and blowing oxygen at it so that it burns up- powdering isn't the only way to force something that is normally non-flammable to burn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

All colors in the middle work simply because they tingle two receptors at once, so your brain guesses the frequency causing that tingle must be somewhere between the frequencies it actually senses.</p>
<p>Have all 3 colors come together and you get white. Have only two of them and your brain tries to make sense of it. Which basically means, magenta, combination of red and blue doesn't actually exist on electromagnetic spectrum, it's simply the color sensation you get from both red and blue rods activating. Which means, you can put red, green and blue on some wheel and then have colors between them gradually move from all blue to all red to all green and back to blue, and thus capture pretty much all colors you can sense.</p>
<p>There exists a condition where some people, mostly women, have four, instead of usual three, different colors they react to. Weird stuff, I don't know how they react to color wheels and displays that we have, all which are based on three-color eyes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>A normal human eye has cone cells sensitive to red, green, and blue.  However, the red cone is a little quirky and is also sensitive to a region in the blue spectrum.  As the frequency of light increases, the red cone fires, then the green, then both blue and the red, which is why violet looks a little reddish.  In fact, RGB screens can't produce monochromatic violet light, so they simulate it by combining red and blue in a manner the stimulates our eyes in about the same way violet would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Colours aren't exactly just frequencies. They're the result of those frequencies being detected and interpreted by our eyes. Your TV can produce the colour yellow, but (usually) it can't produce light of a frequency that we'd call yellow. It produces red light and green light, and that combination looks just as yellow as &quot;real&quot; yellow light.</p>
<p>If you want to transition smoothly from red to blue, there are two ways to do it. You could gradually change the frequency, moving through the rainbow until you get to blue. The &quot;long way&quot; around the colour wheel represents that. Alternatively, you could gradually make the red light dimmer and a blue light brighter until you have just blue light left. These mixtures of red and blue light give the &quot;short way&quot; around the wheel, through the magentas and purples. There's no single wavelength of light which corresponds to those colours, but they're still colours that you can see and name.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can compare the light spectrum with the musical scale. It too is just frequencies on a non-periodic scale. However when you double the frequency you get the same harmonics so it is periodic. A low D and a high C sounds quite close to each other even though they are very different pitch. It is similar with light. The visible light spectrum covers one &quot;octave&quot;. For example purple is very similar to red because it is almost half the frequency. But on the spectrum scale they are at opposite ends. This is even more evident with digital camera sensors as they have a bit wider spectrum and is able to detect infrared. However it is the blue sensors that is able to detect infrared as infrared is twice the frequency of blue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a neuroscientist, and someone who likes beer probably more than he should, so I think I'm in a perfect position to answer this.</p>
<p>Your question is perfect. What it demonstrates is that a hangover cannot <em>just</em> be dehydration and lack of sleep (let's forget &quot;mild alcohol poisoning&quot; because that doesn't make much sense for a bunch of reasons).</p>
<p>Let me take this in what seems like a different direction: Did you know that people with epilepsy can often suffer from seizures the morning after heavy drinking? Why might that be? Also, very heavy drinkers often have seizures when they stop drinking. Why might that be?</p>
<p>The answer to both of these questions comes down to one fact, and one general principle of biology. First: Alcohol makes the main &quot;inhibitory&quot; neurotransmitter in your brain more effective. What does that mean? A neurotransmitter is a chemical that is released from one brain cell to talk to another. Generally speaking, neurotransmitters make the cell that receives the neurotransmitter either MORE likely to release neurotransmitter themselves, or LESS likely to release neurotransmitter themselves. A inhibitory neurotransmitter is the last one. An alcohol makes it work better.. making it even more potent at telling brain cells stop releasing neurotransmitter.</p>
<p>The general principle in biology I was talking about is called &quot;homeostasis&quot; and it means that if you exert some change on the body, the body tries to reverse it. While it doesn't always happen, in this case it does: alcohol makes the inhibitory neurotransmitter more effective, so the brain does a variety of things to reduce the effectiveness of the inhibition.</p>
<p>The problem then comes when the alcohol is removed from your body. Your brain has turned down the level of inhibition, and with no alcohol floating around, this lowered level of inhibition does not make you feel great. In people prone to seizures already (i.e. epileptics) it can be enough to trigger a seizure. In non-epileptic people, it just makes you feel gross (and is why, I guess, that sometimes after drinking, you end up waking up earlier than normal, and can't sleep, even though you feel terrible).</p>
<p>By resupplying a little bit of alcohol, you are turning the level of inhibition back up a bit, giving your brain time to readjust it's inhibition back to normal levels.</p>
<p>I know I've gone a bit above ELI5 levels. Sorry about that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because alcohol fucks with your GABA receptors.</p>
<p>High GAGA = You feel awesome, don't care about anything</p>
<p>Low GABA = You feel like absolute shit and can't sleep</p>
<p>If you drink in excess, your GABA is depleted the next day and you are basically suffering from alcohol withdrawal. By drinking two beers in the morning, you increase your GABA (again), feeling ok temporality until you come down again. </p>
<p>Extreme GABA depletion can cause seizures and even death. This is why alcoholics often die when they quit cold-turkey (I think this is why Amy Winehouse died). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Additional nutrients, like the carbs and micronutrients in beer helps your body recover faster.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, there is no absolute limit. However due to relativity and laws of causation there actually is a limit given by the speed of light. That is to say if Earth magically doubled in mass in an instant(t=0) observers at varying distances from Earth would feel the increased gravity a some time t&gt;0 depending on how far they are from Earth. Thus there is some distance limit on the effect of gravity if you include time.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The force between two objects is calculated as F=GMm/R^2, where:
-G is the universal gravitational constant, 6.674*10−11 N-m2/kg2
-M and m are the masses of the objects in kg
-R is the distance between the objects' centres of mass, in metres.</p>
<p>Because the numerator of this rational expression is non-zero, there is no real value of R that would make the value of the expression 0. However, as R grows larger, F does rapidly decrease, and as R approaches infinity, F approaches 0.</p>
<p>Far enough away, the force would be negligible for practical applications as the objects would be affected by other, greater forces (think riding into a headwind while someone blows on your ear).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is very little science in this thread. Both Newtonian gravity (attraction between planets, stars, us, etc) and the expanding Universe <em>are solutions to general relativity.</em>  </p>
<p>Their difference lies in the scale of interactions which you consider. If you take GR and make approximations appropriate to describe a person standing on Earth, you get Newtonian gravity. If you zoom out to beyond superclusters, so that you can't really see nearby galaxies, clusters, etc, as distinct, the the Universe is basically smooth and homogeneous. This is the approximation to GR that gives rise to the expanding Universe.  </p>
<p>These approximations aren't wrong, they're just only valid in the realm where they hold. We don't see the Universe expanding within the solar system because Newtonian gravity (for the most part) dominates --- it is the best approximation within the solar system (galaxy, etc.). The effects of Newtonian gravity diminish once you get to the scale of 100's of mega parsecs, where it's all homogeneous and isotropic expansion. Expansion doesn't touch the solar system; we don't touch expansion.  </p>
<p>So <em>technically</em> Earth is pulling on distant galaxies and clusters, but the effect is unfathomably tiny. When we use GR to describe the expansion of the Universe, Newtonain physics is not included. The range of gravity is infinite in the sense that there's no place where it suddenly drops to zero. However, causality is a true, physical limit, and the furthest effect something can have is within it's own Hubble patch (no further than a Hubble length away).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the perspective of the most fundamental maths related to the universe... yes gravity's range is considered infinite. Gravity is the most variable part of our equations related to the expansion of the universe(and thus size).</p>
<p>The Hubble parameter(which defines the  rate of the expansion of the universe) is, in part, defined by the Robertson-Walker scale factor.</p>
<p>Robertson-Walker scale factor is defined as the relationship between gravity and energy(more specifically mass and radiation) on a universal scale.  Photon pressure(expansion) is losing the battle to gravity(contraction), but dark energy(expansion) will become dominate in a few billion years.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the dimensionless scale factor to characterize the expansion of the universe, the effective energy densities of radiation and mass scale differently. This leads to a radiation-dominated era in the very early universe but a transition to a matter-dominated era at a later time and, since about 5 billion years ago, a subsequent dark energy-dominated era</p>
