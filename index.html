You can't get to them unless you know exactly what you're looking for. The vast majority of the deep web are old servers and such that are completely useless. There are some gems, however.</p>
<p>The dark web is part of the deep web. It refers to servers that you can only get into with special software or special network configurations. Some of them are curated in large networks like TOR, but others are very small and private. These are the types of places where drug and human trafficking tend to go down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright so you have the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web. The surface web is the internet you're most familiar with and is classified as anything that can be found with a typical search engine. The deep web is basically shit like medical records, legal records, government databases, and the like. Then you have the dark web which I'm guessing is what you're interested in.
All the illicit shit you hear about is what the dark web consists of. Drug trafficking, weapons trafficking, hitmen, kiddie porn, snuff films, etc. - they're typically all .onion sites from what I've seen. And they're all encrypted sites so it's not just a matter of typing in buyblackmarketshit.onion. The site addresses look like gibberish and end in .onion.
So you either have to know exactly what you're looking for or find a link in a forum, or just find a rough list of sites on some dark web wiki page of some sort. It's a bit complex but that's why they reference an onion with the dark web: because basically there are many layers to the dark web.
So download the TOR browser from a search engine link, have fun, and be safe. </p>
<p>Also, just for reference, it's said that only 4% of the Internet is the surface web</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Totally stealing this from another source that I cannot remember.</p>
<p>Imagine a pool. On the top are bright fuzzy tennis balls that represent websites like Facebook and Yelp. Then, there is also a pool skimmer that is a search engine. Most websites want to be found and picked up by that search engine and even have more fuzz to help them get picked up. This is the web that most people know and love.</p>
<p>Now imagine some smooth and heavy stones. They sink to the bottom, they have no fur to grab, and they try to remain hidden unless you already know where they are. These are websites on the dark web that try and hide their location from casual viewers. If someone told you to look 50 meters from the left corner of the pool and 12.7 meters down, sure you could find your specific dark website but very rarely will anyone else be able to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The doctrine of the Trinity is one of the least understood aspects of Christian theology, but by no means the least important. Theologians have wrestled for it for 2 millennia and it is still not fully understood, though many would argue there are aspects of God that we will never be able to understand, or wrap our minds around. Argument over the role of the Spirit is actually one of the leading causes for why the Eastern and Western churches split. The Western church believes the Father and Son (Jesus) breathe/send the Holy Spirit, while the Eastern church maintains that it is only the Father who breathes the Holy Spirit. The Trinity is often regarded as 3 persons (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and 1 substance (God). The doctrine is clearly open to criticism for being illogical and out of line with human reason, though most theologians will argue that human language and thought can't do justice to the transcendent God. Two terms are worth understanding: Perichoresis and Appropriation. Perichoresis basically says that the 3 persons of the Trinity maintain their own individuality while sharing in the life of the other 2 persons. This is seen as &quot;a community of being.&quot; Appropriation suggests that every person of the Trinity is present in the outward action of God, but it is &quot;appropriate&quot; to speak of 1 of the persons being responsible for different revelations throughout history. (Example: all 3 persons were present and took part in the Creation, but it is &quot;appropriate&quot; to speak of creation as the work of the Father) These two ideas together also help to reject Modalism (this is a belief that the Trinity can only appear as one Person at a time, think of ice, water, and water vapor)<br />
There are many analogies to how the Trinity works. Augustine suggested that it can be seen as a lover (the Father), the beloved (the Son), and the love (Holy Spirit) that unites the 2. This is a decent analogy but it tends to depersonalize the Holy Spirit and can cause us to view It as just that, an &quot;it&quot;.<br />
The actual functions of the Holy Spirit are generally agreed to focus on 3 areas: revelation, salvation, and the Christian life. Revelation: we need the Holy Spirit to discern truth about God. Salvation: the Spirit plays a role in establishing a relationship between Christ and the believer and uniting us to God (much in the same way it unites the Father and Son). The Christian Life: this takes place both in individuals and corporately (the Church as a whole) The Spirit brings unity to the Church, helps us to experience God in worship prayer, and devotion, and empowers/moves us to live a Christian life (think in terms of morality)  </p>
<p>This is not even a scratch on the surface of the current understanding of the Holy Spirit and Trinity in theology. I'm about to finish my bachelors in Christian Ministry and plan to go on to get a Masters of Divinity and Masters of Theology. One of the biggest problems is defining the terms, and every time you bring up a new term, there are more terms to define lol Specifically, it is pretty impossible to speak about the Holy Spirit without some understanding of the Trinity Also the majority of these descriptions come from Alister McGrath's &quot;Christian Theology&quot; and I apologize for butchering them!<br />
edit: There is some irony to the ELI5 Holy Spirit/ Trinity because it is one of the most complex doctrines of Christian Theology, and any simple answer given (including mine) is really an injustice to the true Holy Spirit lol</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question and you are going to hear a lot of different, contradicting answers since people have various beliefs and it's in our human nature to want to share these beliefs.</p>
<p>Allow me to take a different approach and answer your question from the Scriptures. It is described after all as God's word, and 2 Peter 1:21 says &quot;For prophecy was at no time brought by man’s will, but men spoke from God as they were moved by holy spirit.&quot; Plus by specifying &quot;Christian context&quot; in your question, it will be right in line with Christ's pattern, which was to use the scriptures extensively, hence you will see both the old and the new testaments herein.</p>
<p>To address the last item of your question, is the holy spirit Jesus? Matthew 12:32 says &quot;For example, whoever speaks a word against the Son of man, it will be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the holy spirit, it will not be forgiven him, no, not in this system of things nor in that to come.&quot; The Son of man is a usual title employed for Jesus. Here the idea is clear: sinning against Jesus can be forgiven, sinning against the holy spirit cannot.</p>
<p>Is it a person? The Bible compares the holy spirit to water. When promising future blessings for his people, God said: “I shall pour out water upon the thirsty one, and trickling streams upon the dry place. I shall pour out my spirit upon your seed, and my blessing upon your descendants.” (Isaiah 44:3). When God pours out his spirit upon his servants, they become “full of holy spirit,” or “filled with holy spirit.” Jesus, John the Baptist, Peter, Paul, Barnabas, and the disciples who were gathered together on the day of Pentecost 33 C.E. are all described as being full of, or filled with, holy spirit (Luke 1:15; 4:1; Acts 4:8; 9:17; 11:22, 24; 13:9). So it's not a person either.</p>
<p>Now check out Luke 11:9-13, Jesus says: &quot;So I say to you, keep on asking, and it will be given you; keep on seeking, and you will find; keep on knocking, and it will be opened to you. For everyone asking receives, and everyone seeking finds, and to everyone knocking, it will be opened.  Indeed, which father among you, if his son asks for a fish, will hand him a serpent instead of a fish? Or if he also asks for an egg, will hand him a scorpion? Therefore, if you, although being wicked, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more so will the Father in heaven give holy spirit to those asking him!”.</p>
<p>Holy spirit is a thing that can be shared or given by God. Another aspect is found in Luke 1:35, when the angel Gabriel spoke to Mary and said &quot;In answer the angel said to her: “Holy spirit will come upon you, and power of the Most High will overshadow you. And for that reason the one who is born will be called holy, God’s Son&quot;. So there is a clear connection between holy spirit and power from the Most High. </p>
<p>Indeed, Christ confirms the link in Acts 1:8 &quot;But you will receive power when the holy spirit comes upon you, and you will be witnesses of me in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the most distant part of the earth.&quot; </p>
<p>In other words and to make it ELI5-compatible, holy spirit is the <em>power of God</em>, in action. Thus, with his holy spirit, God causes actions to be done.</p>
<p>Now, that being said, I am expecting people will disagree with this take of your ELI5. It's okay. I never claimed to be an expert in modern church theology. What I have done is using the Scriptures to answer your question. I will be happy to pursue this discussion as long as we focus on what the Scriptures teach, not what the doctrines churches teach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>God is the Developer of an MMO. He notices his players are misbehaving, and logs into the game as Jesus. He travels around as Jesus talking to people and preaching. He then gets lynched and killed by trolls. God resurrects Jesus and  walks around talking a bit more, then ascends him out of the game.</p>
<p>God keeps sending messages and buffs to players using  &quot;The Holy Spirit&quot; special account, which isn't his Jesus player account, but a fundamentally different sort of thing.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes the Holy Spirit is a person -- but not a person in the sense of a human being, but in the sense of an existing sentient being with a personality and (this is key) the ability to have discreet relationships with others.
No, it is not Jesus.</p>
<p>It's probably too late to help, but... there is just a lot of misinformation and bad understanding in this thread.</p>
<p>And yes -- it is true that different Christian churches and traditions have said different things about the Holy Spirit and the Trinity... but a lot of what is being said in this thread isn't any of those things. It's like bad understandings of poorly understood vaguely reformed evangelical theology, through the lens of American pop culture, through the lens of trying to explain things by analogy.</p>
<p>And to explain the differences in this thread as &quot;well, different Christians have understood it differently&quot; is just plain wrong.</p>
<p>The vast majority of Christians on the planet, and throughout history, have been Roman Catholic, Orthodox (of various flavors), or Anglican. This accounts for damn near everyone. If you include Lutheranism and Reformed traditions, that's REALLY damn near everybody. And there is a substantial amount of agreement here.</p>
<p>According to all of these traditions, there is one God in Three Persons: The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Many people in the thread (And many people today) will pile on the &quot;God&quot; language into the First Person (the Father) - but this is simply not accurate. All Three Persons are One God. When Christian pray to God, they pray to the Trinity. Thomas Aquinas even said that the &quot;Our Father&quot; is prayed to the Trinity as a whole, not to the First Person.</p>
<p>That's because &quot;God the Father&quot; is not &quot;God OUR Father,&quot; but rather &quot;the Person of God who is the Father of the Son.&quot; The names of the Trinity are indicative of their relationships TO EACH OTHER, not to us. The Father of the Son, the Son of the Father, their Holy Spirit: one God.</p>
<p>This makes no sense. It is a mystery that cannot really be explained. Rather, it is a set of words that were chosen to best express (though not fully express) the lived experience of the early Church.</p>
<p>So, with that little bit of groundwork... WHO is the Holy Spirit?</p>
<p>At the Last Supper, Jesus says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you love me, you will keep my commandments. And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate, to be with you forever. This is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You know him, because he abides with you, and he will be in you.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sending of the Holy Spirit is understood to have happened 50 days after the Resurrection, on Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit is said to have descended on the Apostles &quot;like tongues of fire&quot;. </p>
<p>We can also look back to the Hebrew Scriptures (the Old Testament - OT) and see, for example, at the creation of the world in Genesis, &quot;the Spirit of God was upon the waters.&quot; There are many other OT references - for example, the &quot;Shekinah&quot; - the presence of God that hovered over the Tabernacle.</p>
<p>But what does any of that mean for who the Holy Spirit is?</p>
<p>There's two ways of thinking about this question: Who is the Holy Spirit within God, and who is the Holy Spirit to us?</p>
<p>It is commonly understood that all things which are true about God are true about all three persons. So (for example) even though we typically call God the Father the creator, all three create because all three are One God.</p>
<p>However, we assign certain actions and aspects or qualities of God to particular persons of the Trinity because (as Aquinas might say) they are logically proper to that person. So, we say that the Second Person (the Son) &quot;saves us,&quot; even though - really - it is the whole Trinity, the One God, who saves us.</p>
<p>We speak, then, of the Holy Spirit as the active power of God in creation and, especially, in the lives of human beings. We say that inspiration (creativity) is the work of the Spirit (notice in+spirit=inspiration). We say that prophets receive the Spirit. That the Spirit guides the Church in Truth (that is, keeps the Church from proclaiming heresy as doctrine).</p>
<p>These things are difficult to talk about, so you shouldn't feel dumb for not understanding them. And most analogies are within a hair's breadth of heresy.</p>
<p>Here are some analogies and ways of thinking about the Spirit. If taken too literally, and especially if taken individually in isolation, they can lead to error, but as many images, taken together held lightly, they might help:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Holy Spirit is the Love between the Father and the Son</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit is the Begetting of the Begotten One (the Son) by the Begetter (the Father)</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit is the breath of God</li>
<li>The Holy Spirit is God at work in the World</li>
</ul>
<p>Some issues/notes...</p>
<p>Second Temple Judaism (the Judaism of the time of Jesus) had a concept of the Deuteros Theos -- the &quot;second God.&quot; This was the Wisdom of God (the Sophia) as well as the Presence of God (the Shekina), the Word of God (Logos), and the Spirit/Breath of God (the Ruah, or the Pneuma). After the Jesus event and the destruction of the Second Temple, Rabbinical Judaism graphs all of the Deuteros Theos theology onto the Torah. So, Jews today might say things like &quot;God created the world through His Torah.&quot; </p>
<p>The Jewish and then Gentile followers of Jesus graphed most of that theology onto Christ. Christ became the Word (Logos) of God in John's Gospel, the Wisdom of God through whom God created the World. There was a time in early Christianity where there was no Trinitarian doctrine. And there was a time when the Holy Spirit was identified primarily with Jesus. Eventually some of the Deuteros Theos imagery became associated with the Holy Spirit. And when Protestants excised much of the late Wisdom literature from the Biblical Canon, some of the explicit connections between Wisdom and Christ were lost -- and so Wisdom often gets grafted onto the Holy Spirit in evangelicalism and Reformed traditions, even though Catholics and Oterthodox traditionally understand Wisdom to be Christ. (&quot;Since then she has appeared on earth, and moved among people. She is the book of the precepts of God, the law that endures forever; all who cling to her will live, but those will die who forsake her.&quot;) So... there is some confusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two things that go into why a material can have a mirror finish.  First, is whether light that hits it reflects straight back or gets scattered in many different directions.  Smooth surfaces scatter less of the reflected light, and will be shinier than rough surfaces.</p>
<p>Any material can be polished.*  Polishing is just making the surface smoother.  Generally, the smoother a surface, the shinier it looks.  </p>
<p>So the real question is, why are smooth metal surfaces extremely shiny and other materials not so shiny?</p>
<p>The second part of the story is that light is reflected any time it encounters a boundary between two materials with different indexes of refraction.  The bigger the difference in the index of refraction, the more light gets reflected.</p>
<p>For visible light, metals have very large indices of refraction.  The huge difference in the index of refraction between the metal and air can result easily in over 90% of light being reflected.</p>
<p>Explaining why metals have such high indices of refraction for light is a little more complicated.   Metals have lots of free electrons that can move around inside them (that's why they conduct electricity).   All these electrons interact strongly with the electric field of light.</p>
<p>Things like wood and plastic do not have many free electrons so they don't interact nearly as strongly with light.  For example, when travels through air and hits a glass surface, only about 4% of the light will be reflected.</p>
<ul>
<li>It turns out that it's a lot easier to polish a metal than it is to polish wood.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is one of the properties that metallic elements have. Shine, the capability of being polished, being ductile (capable of being drawn out into threads or wires), being a heat and electricity conductor are all part of the same characteristic: metallic character.</p>
<p>This is dictated by the way a metal's electrons behave, among some other factors.</p>
<p>When a bunch of atoms of the same metal react they form what it is known as a Sea of Electrons. Something like <a href="http://chemistry-batz.wikispaces.com/file/view/metal.e-structure.JPG/473394092/metal.e-structure.JPG" target="_blank">this</a>. Electrons tend to be delocalized in this situation, meaning that instead of orbiting their respective atoms they are &quot;loose&quot; between the metal's atoms, like water drops in the sea, forming a sea of electrons. This is what gives metals their characteristics. Light can't penetrate the surface because of the &quot;sea&quot;, so it is reflected thus metals are shiny. This also makes them good conductors of electricty as electrons move freely unlike in wood, for example.</p>
<p>Now, why isn't wood or plastic shiny? It's because of the way their atoms react to each other, too. Those two are or come from organic matter, that is usually made up from nonmetals like Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nytrogen and others. They can have metals on their structure but not in a way that their atoms form a &quot;Sea of electrons&quot; or anything of that kind. The structures formed by these elements are very big compared to simpler molecules (like H2O) and are highly complex too. Basically, light is absorbed by these compounds instead of reflecting it. One of the main reasons is their electrons are not &quot;freely moving between atoms&quot; but have more specific arrangements and positions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lack of internal structure. The metalic bond in metals and the &quot;amorphic solid&quot; nature of glass are ideal for polishing because of what polishing actually is...</p>
<p>A scientist (who's name I don't remember) realized from his work as a lens grinder that &quot;polishing&quot; is just making finer and finer scratches, closer and closer together until you basically overwhelm the materials ability to &quot;record&quot; the individual scratches (well enough to matter).</p>
<p>So metals, things engaged in &quot;metallic bonds&quot;, largely consist of free-floating atoms awash in a sea of the electrons they've given up to the whole mass. So something that is all metalic bonds can be easily reshaped by the very focused pressures of a series of finer and finer &quot;grit&quot;, first of a rasp, then a &quot;sand paper&quot; and then a &quot;polishing compound&quot;. Basically, at the finest levels, individual atoms are getting pushed around (or, well, maybe clusters, where the clusters deform into individual motion). So metals can be polished very, very well.</p>
<p>Second only to metals is glass. Its lack of fixed internal structure means that, while whole (covalently bonded) molecules have to be shoved around or peeled off, the resulting &quot;minimum deformity&quot; is the size of any one of those molecules and/or the spaces into which it can be forced.</p>
<p>Plastic is much more difficult to polish because it has larger polymer molecules which leave much bigger pits behind when they are displaced. It's possible, and even every-day common, to polish &quot;the right kind of plastic&quot;, such as acrylics. That's what most &quot;eye glasses&quot; are made of these days. Real glass is heavy, fragile, and expensive for something that's become as disposable as plastic over the last thirty years. (But when I was a child in the seventies, virtually all glasses were glass because plastics was still a pretty primitive era.)</p>
<p>When we get to something hugely structural, like wood, all bets are off. The difference between the cellulose inter-cellular matrix and the soft liquid cell centers... and the arrangements of grain and the differing growth segments and all that relatively huge stuff means that as you sand and polish you reach a point where the abrasive starts breaking the structure instead of scratching it. You are gouging out whole cell structures or even groups of cells. The different moisture contents, hardnesses, and connective tissues just aren't consistent enough to get that smooth.</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong. There are some impressively well polished wood structures. They've often been impregnated with oil or wax, and they are usually made from very dense and hard woods (not to be confused with &quot;hardwoods&quot;... balsa wood is a &quot;hardwood&quot; but it isn't a hard wood) to begin with.</p>
<p>(ASIDE: Hardwoods versus Softwoods is about the seeds of the trees not the flesh of the wood.)</p>
<p>Now something with an internal structure isn't always bad. Diamonds, and most other crystals, can be polished quite nicely despite their internal structure. That's because their internal structure is very regular. A skilled craftsman knows the &quot;grain&quot; of the structures of such materials and knows how to work variously with and against the grains to create the desired effects.</p>
<p>So basically, things with internal structural detail which <em>varies</em> throughout the material is difficult or impossible to polish beyond a particular point.</p>
<p>Finally the &quot;mirror&quot; part. We make mirrors by precision crafting a glass surface and then putting metal on that surface and then viewing it from the other side (through the glass) because we want <em>flat</em> and we want <em>reflective</em>, and the seal between the flat glass and the flat metal lets the flat glass <em>protect</em> the integrity of the flat and <em>reflective</em> metal, while helping prevent oxidation and pitting of that metal. The &quot;flat side&quot; of the glass is often achieved (or was, back in the day) by pouring the molten glass onto a sea of mercury. Basically it was easier to <em>create</em> the smooth glass than it was to <em>polish</em> the glass smooth after the fact. The crappy (and less-important) upper surface of that glass mirror could then be polished, but it didn't take the same amount of care to still get a nice mirror.</p>
<p>So metals make a better mirror because they respond to the electromatnetic disruptions of a large range of frequencies quite readily, largely because of that &quot;sea of electrons&quot; thing (if memory served). (read up on &quot;the types of chemical bonds&quot; and the difference between metallic and covalent bonds in particular. Fascinating stuff.)</p>
<p>But now we are into details of conductivity and the electromagnetic field in which photons spend their reality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To polish a material to a mirror finish you have to create a very uniform surface, so that all the light is reflected in the same way and not scattered into different directions. The higher the density of a material, the closer you can get to this even surface because the atoms are &quot;closer together&quot;.<br />
Imagine bouncing a ball against a box full of pebbles (resembling light bouncing against a low density surface): no matter how hard you try to arrange the pebbles as evenly as possible, you can't create a surface that will bounce the ball in the same direction every time.    </p>
<p>EDIT: seems like I only got half of the story. Like /u/jjs2424 explained, the index of refraction is the other half. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They're already damaged beyond repair from lack of oxygen. That does however not mean that they've lost their nutritional value. Even if you crush an egg, all the nutritients are still there, right? Assuming you don't spill something onto the floor.</p>
<p>Your frozen meat is however not as fine when thawed as it was when it was fresh. You'll notice this if you freeze and thaw something several times. The meat's texture changes, and generally becomes less appetizing. Freezing it just once, and gently thawing it doesn't damage it all that much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We're not talking about silly things either, oil is an essential material for making plastic, nylon, and a thousand other synthetic fibers.</p>
<p>Basically, if you wear any clothing not homemade, use a computer, drive a car, or use... anything these days, then you need oil. If it's not made out of metal, wood, or 100% cotton, it's got a little oil in it somewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a fuel, yes.</p>
<p>We'd have to run out first or at least get to a point where the per-joule price point for oil is higher than something else. It's debatable how long that will take.</p>
<p>The green-minded people say it's already happened and the price is kept artificially low by countries (such as Saudi Arabia) selling below cost to undercut competitors to the point of bankruptcy, after which time they'll stop selling below cost.</p>
<p>Those in favor of oil (such as the oil industry spokespeople) say that, essentially, there's so much oil that we'll effectively never run out.</p>
<p>The reality is that there is a finite surplus on Earth and there is a finite production rate. If the human race is using oil faster than it is produced, the surplus will be exhausted.</p>
<p>As the surplus reaches exhaustion, supply does down bring the price up. This is when technologies such as wind, solar, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_depolymerization" target="_blank">thermal depolymerization</a> can become more feasible.</p>
<p>I've talked about thermal depolymerization before but there doesn't seem to be the level of interest in it that I thought there would be. To summarize, this process can convert just about anything with carbon and hydrogen into oil, natural gas, and &quot;carbon solids&quot; (probably elemental carbon or graphite, etc). Imagine a water treatment plant that converts raw sewage, garbage, used motor oil, and plastics into drinking water, natural gas, #2 light crude, and graphite.</p>
<p>Anyway, we'll never actually be away from oil completely. Oil is useful as a dielectric for large transformers, liquid cooling of computer equipment, wire EDM and EDM sinker machining processes, and all sorts of other things.</p>
<p>There's always going to be diesel and gas turbine backup generators, those are simply too reliable to decommission.</p>
<p>You're always going to need to lubricate something as well. Teflon is great, but sometimes you need the mechanical properties of metal on metal without the teflon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when a company drills, they do not just get oil. They get a whole bunch of things. </p>
<p>Lets call these things HC's. When a well is drilled things then are taken from the earth. Things like Gas and Oil, but also things like Ethane and Propane. These are used for Transportation fuel, Plastics manufacturing, electricity generation (for things like heating and lights) as well as a plethora of other significant needs. </p>
<p>But the big concern in your question here is the Oil and Gas specifically. </p>
<p>In places like USA and Western Europe, you don't really think about it much (beyond that its the stuff you put in your car). </p>
<p>But in places like China and India, it is a huge concern! The 2 largest countries in the world STILL mostly use coal! <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/to-curb-climate-change-china-slows-coal-to-gas/" target="_blank">In fact, China is desperate to get away from coal and move to other energy sources.</a> Oil and Gas is one of those. </p>
<p>They want to get away from coal for a few reasons. </p>
<p>To the men in suits they will say it is more efficient and beneficial economically for the growth of not only the economy but the standard of living. This is very true. </p>
<p>To the concerned citizens and the world they will say it will be better for the environment and their quality of life. This is also true!</p>
<p>You are too young to remember but there was a time that Coal was King in many places in North America. Things like Acid Rain and heavy smog in smaller population centres was common. This is something China faces today!</p>
<p>So, in the near future, No!. Oils demand continues to grow! </p>
<p>In the very long run, who knows.  When your explaining to your great grandchildren when they are 5, you will have a better answer.</p>
<p>Remember, Oil has not began to be phased out. And Coal was being phased out a century ago and is still in use.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to be talking about petroleum oil from the ground. Until 1972 when whale hunting was banned sperm whale oil was used to lubricate automatic transmissions.  After the ban transmission failures increased dramatically. Now there is a substitute.</p>
<p>Nothing beats diesel fuel as a concentrated energy source for a mobile engine. The most important diesel engines in the world are in tractors. If you do not use tractors for farming you must use horses and mules. That would increase the need for hay and grain decreasing farm land available for human food.</p>
<p>I calculated enough corn oil and soybean oil is produced from farming to fuel the farm equipment. But it would have to be restricted to farm fuel. No extras to go around.</p>
<p>Organic chemists will tell you if they care that there are many many easily produced things which can be made from petroleum oil that it is a shame we burn it. Would you rather have warm coats or to drive?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you go far enough north, this isn't always true.  In places where it's warm enough for the snow to turn to rain, snowstorms are more likely to happen at night simply because it's colder.</p>
<p>Also, night is longer in the winter, especially as you go further north.  In much of southern Canada, for example, in December it's night 16 hours or more of the day, so snow is more likely at night simply because it's more likely to be night.</p>
<p>Really bad snow storms last long enough that they persist day and night.  We just had a 36-hour blizzard here this week.  It started around lunchtime on Monday and ended overnight Tuesday night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Others here have answered your question: nights are longer than day during winter, plus it's cooler at night, so more likely to snow vs. changing to rain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You and your friends gather around a table. You eat food, you drink drinks, and pretend to be characters in a fantasy world. Your very smartest friend is the &quot;DM&quot; because he or she wrote down some ideas for a story that you can all act out together. Your DM starts at the beginning of the story, and lets everyone at the table improvise the middle and end. Solving problems and fighting monsters a big part of moving the story along, but at this table you roll dice to decide if your character will be awesome or fail. Winning takes some lucky dice rolls, but if you play to your character's strengths, you'll get through it no problem. At the end of the story your character gets experience points and levels up. If you and your friends get to a higher level, you can solve more interesting problems and fight way bigger monsters. </p>
<p>Just like any other improv or board game, if everyone at the table WANTS TO have a good time, it's going to be a great time. Also you have to worship the devil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's imagine two characters; Bob the Barbarian and Will the Wizard. Bob is very strong and very tough, but not a very smart or sociable guy. Will is very smart and can do cool magic things, but is a frail fellow. You get to come up with a fun story for Bob and/or Will about why they're an adventurer/how they got to be so cool.</p>
<p>From there....you make up things as you go along a story, which is controlled by your DM, aka your &quot;Dungeon Master&quot;. Let's say his/her story has you confronting a troll who demands payment for you to cross his bridge.</p>
<p>Bob could try and fight the troll. He's good at fighting. His stats are great for fighting. Bob can also certainly try and write up a treaty between the nearby town and the troll to arrange free passage in a diplomatic trade agreement. Bob's not so good at that, but he's definitely able to try if he'd like, and Bob gets to be a hero either way.</p>
<p>Will might try using magic on the troll to pass by undetected, or he can use his clever wits to trick the troll in to letting them pass for free. Will can also attempt to arm wrestle the troll to let them pass; it may not work, but that's totally Will's call, and if he wins he still beat the bad guy.</p>
<p>That's D&amp;D in a nutshell. You come up with a character, create a fun backstory, and then just make up things based on what the DM is narrating to you. The DM is the world your characters live in. They're the narrator describing events as they unfold. They're the familiar tavern keeper welcoming you back in from the cold. They're the bad guy cursing you with his dying breath. You are active members in the story they create. You can literally do (almost) anything, as long as the dice go your way. There's a chance of success or failure in almost everything you do, only limited by your own creativity. Depending on what you wanna do, you add a certain modifier to your dice roll. The better you are at a certain skill, the higher the modifier, meaning the more likely it is that something using that modifier will succeed. </p>
<p>Depending on how you make your character, certain stats are more likely to succeed than others, so obviously you'll probably play it safe most of the time. </p>
<p>...But no one remembers that time the cleric THOUGHT about punching the troll in the dick so that she could intimidate it to let her friends pass, and then decided to pray to their god to make the troll go away. They remember the time Christina the Cleric kicked a troll so hard in the nads it passed out from the pain. </p>
<p>Moments like that are what make D&amp;D amazing, and I hope you and your friend have a great time playing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apologies in advance I am on mobile:</p>
<p>Dungeons and Dragons is a pen and paper tabletop role playing game. </p>
<p>The game is structured by rulebooks that describe mechanics, detailing how to decide if a particular action has the desired result or not (&quot;I want to jump over this big pit! For example). </p>
<p>Because these actions are usually more complicated than simple success or failure (continuing our our example: you may fall short of the other side of the pit but just barely manage to catch the ledge, hanging on for dear life!) there exists the role of The Dungeon Master (DM). The DMs influence and control of the game can vary from person to person. The typical experienced DM will act as the arbitrator, will keep the flow of the story going, will act and play as all the characters aside from the players (shopkeepers, monsters, quest givers), and will also act as the environment (traps, dungeons, weather, dues ex machina). A DM may write their own story and monsters and dungeons, or use premade material.    </p>
<p>Edit:
The core mechanic of DnD is as follows:
For any action with a chance of failure roll a twenty sided die (called a d20). The DM instructs the player to add the relevant numbers from the players character sheet. Compare the result against a pre-determined 'dice check' number (called a DC). </p>
<p>Putting it all together: </p>
<p>DM: you are in a dark cave. The door to the treasure is on the far side of the room, illuminated dimly by light seepung through the cracks in the frame. A large pit, 15ft across, blocks your path</p>
<p>Player character (PC): I get a good running start and leap across the pit!</p>
<p>DM: ok roll an Athletics Check. Remember, that's d20 plus your strength and also plus any training you may have in athletics. (The DM knows from the rulebook the DC for this check is DC 15)</p>
<p>PC: ok! I rolled a 7, plus my 3 strength bonus and 4 from my training. I got 14!</p>
<p>DM: You dash towards tje pit and make a mighty leap! Soaring through the near total darkness you realize you aren't going to make it! If you are quick and lucky you may be able to grab on to the ledge and avoid a fall. Roll a dexterity saving throw. that's a d20 plus dexterity plus training.</p>
<p>PC: I got a 19!</p>
<p>DM: you barely manage to grab the ledge and haul yourself over the side. Lucky save!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>D&amp;D is a game, and First and foremost it should be fun. It is also a game with a lot of rules. How many of them you choose to follow depends on who's running the game, and at it's core the game is very flexible. There are a common set of generally agreed upon rules you'll find at every table, how much damage weapons do, how movement works, how casting spells work. You want to learn the rules for whatever flavor of D&amp;D you choose.</p>
<p>Pathfinder is free and available online and the getting started section applied to most D&amp;D type games: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html" target="_blank">http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/coreRulebook/gettingStarted.html</a></p>
<p>D&amp;D version 5e can be googled: d&amp;d 5e player's handbook pdf you can view the basic rules for free (TIL): <a href="http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules" target="_blank">http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/basicrules</a></p>
<p>Reading the first few section of either handbook will get you acquainted with the general way the game works. After that there are lots and lots of details. Pathfinder has a nice beginners box which simplies a LOT of the rules, but lets you get a good feel for how the game plays. If you choose to teach yourself and your friend, and you won't be joining an experienced table I highly recommend you start with this: <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox" target="_blank">http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/products/beginnerbox</a></p>
<p>It will primarily allow you to PLAY the game instead of spending hours learning rules.</p>
<p>Once you have the general stuff like &quot;how do I hit things&quot; and &quot;how do I move around&quot; you'll want to decide what &quot;game&quot; you want to play. do you want to create your own world? author your own story? If so, the world is your oyster. You can craft a fantastical story and have your friend play through it with you. This is a very traditional approach, but it puts a lot of burden on the Game Master to create a story. If that's not your style there are TONS of already written Adventures for both D&amp;D 5e and pathfinder. You basically get to play through an RPG story. This is great if nobody you know is a good author, and will make some of the stuff easier to understand since monster stat blocks and things will be easier to understand.</p>
<p>After you get a feel for the rules and how it generally works, there are tons and tons of digital tabletop ways to play with people online. And lots of local game-stores host their own game nights, pathfinder has the <a href="http://paizo.com/pathfinderSociety" target="_blank">Pathfinder Society</a> which is a way to very much play Pathfinder like an RPG. I found it to be a great place to try different characters without having to commit to a full campaign. At the time when I played PFS I played a &quot;home game&quot; with friends with a long running story, and I would play a couple PFS games every month to try out different character classes etc. It was really fun. If you're looking to play D&amp;D like a MMO or RPG, PFS will give you a similar experience. If you are looking to play a huge fantastical story of your own creation, you probably want to read the rules and craft your own world. If you want something in between, checkout the pathfinder adventure paths or campaign settings.</p>
<p>I have only played d&amp;d 2, 3.5, and pathfinder. I have friends who've played 5e and claim it's simplier and easier to approach, but I don't know all the resources to dive into 5e. There are subreddits for each of these games though, with lots of info.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My real advice would be to see if there's a group or club near you who would be happy to play with some newbies. There should be some people who are happy to run a game for you, or let you join a campaign. Look on facebook for groups in your nearest reasonably sized town.</p>
<p>However, the basic explanation:</p>
<p>You have a Dungeon Master (DM for short) who sets up a basic setting for a story. Some locations, characters, monsters and so on, and find some way to give the players a quest. This can be simple, for example, a major local figure has recruited you to go to a specific place and find a magic gem, or something. </p>
<p>The players create characters, with certain skills and abilities. The players say what they want to do. The DM decides whether to just let them do it, or whether they need to roll dice for it. The skills and abilities tend to add a number to the roll. </p>
<p>An important thing to understand is that the DM is running the game. He is not trying to defeat the players (that would be easy - rocks fall, everyone dies) but to create an interesting challenge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elementary particles are pointlike, as far as we can tell. But there are subatomic particles which are not elementary particles, for example atomic nuclei.</p>
<p>Nuclei come in various shapes and sizes. Of course they are quantum-mechanical objects so you have to be careful about how you define their &quot;shape&quot; and their &quot;size&quot;. But the details of doing that are not that important.</p>
<p>Protons and neutrons inside a nucleus live in discrete orbitals, just like atomic electrons do. And just like there are &quot;special&quot; numbers where the electron shells fill up (noble gases), there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_(physics\)" target="_blank">magic number</a> of nucleons which lead to enhanced nuclear stability.</p>
<p>It turns out that if you consider the structure of <em>doubly</em>-magic nuclei (both proton and neutron numbers are magic) like oxygen-16 and lead-208, they must be shaped like perfect spheres, and their sizes are small compared to other nuclei with similar mass numbers.</p>
<p>In the opposite extreme, you can have nuclei where the shell model orbitals are distorted or rearranged due to nuclear correlations far away from magic numbers. You can have cases where the outermost nucleons have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo_nucleus" target="_blank">huge orbitals</a>.</p>
<p>A famous example of the first case is lead-208, and a famous example of the second case is lithium-11. These two nuclei, despite having hugely different mass numbers, have about the <strong>same size</strong>. It's because lead-208 is doubly-magic and lithium-11 is a halo nucleus.</p>
<p>Imagine nucleons as if they're inflated beach balls. How would you feel if I told you that I could arrange 11 beach balls and 208 beach balls such that they have the same size? It's very hard to picture this with classical objects like beach balls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the particles are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_particles" target="_blank">identical particles</a> then they are indistinguishable even in principle.  This means that all of their features must be the same---they have the same charge, the same spin, the same mass, etc.  This <em>sounds</em> like somewhat of a trivial statement---of course if you can't tell them apart, they're indistinguishable!  The point is that <em>there are</em> indistinguishable particles.  That didn't have to be!  The world could have been made out of infinitely many fundamental ingredients, for example.  Or there could be many varieties of protons---protons that are striped (I don't mean literally visually striped), protons that are spotted, zig-zag protons, flannel protons, etc.  No.  We just see protons, and you can't &quot;tag&quot; a proton like you might tag a wild animal, so that when it goes out of sight and you encounter another one later you can be sure it's the same proton.  You cannot: protons are indistinguishable.</p>
<p>If you put a proton in a magnetic field, then its shape will distort.  But, <em>every proton distorts the same way</em>.  We believe fundamental particles like electrons and quarks to be point-like.  But if they ultimately have a finite size or are made of vibrating strings or whatever, each electron will be the same as every other electron, each up quark the same as every other up quark, each down quark the same as every other down quark, etc.</p>
<p>edit:  But it need not be the case that if we discover quarks have finite size that up quarks must have the same size as down quarks (for example).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This depends on how you define size. If you want to be analogous to the macroscopic world then yes, as others have answered, all particles appear point like, I.e. You can get as close to them as you like given enough energy. However, if you define size by how much energy it takes to approach, then size depends on the field created by the particle. For example, if you were probing a proton and a neutron with another proton, it would be a lot easier to get close to the neutron than the proton because of the equal charges of the proton. (This is a simplification because you obviously get particles that 'attract' each other I.e. With opposite charges and so you may be wondering if size is a quantity that depends on what you want to probe with) This leads to a definition of size that can be defined by the modulus of the field emitted by the particle. With this in mind, there are differences in sizes between different subatomic particles. An obvious example would be between the charge neutral neutron and a positively charged proton, but there are more exotic baryons with a quark composition such that they have a charge of 2 such as the double plus Delta (composed of 3 up quarks). This definition of size is not rigorous however; it is easier to consider particles as point like structures that emit properties.</p>
<p>You asked about some protons being larger than others, and while all protons are the same at ground level, when you give a particle more energy, it's wavefunction tends to get spread out. Think about how you were taught that atoms 'vibrate' more the more energy they were given (again this is a simplification, the real reason has to do with the uncertainty principle). This means that particularly energetic particles can be considered spatially 'larger' than lower energy equivalents, although this effect is very small for reasonable energies. </p>
<p>This being said, when you take combinations of particles, you can define a size much more easily. A good example of this comes when looking at the radius of an atom. If you go with a definition of radius based on a distance from the centre of the nucleus required to bring another atom such that both atoms interact, you can define an atomic radius based on the orbital distance of the furthest bound electron to the nucleus. If you remember your high school chemistry, orbiting electrons come in groups known as shells. A simplification of this leads to the conclusion that the larger the number of shells a particle has, the larger the radius of the furthest orbiting electron. However, this is a huge simplification as it does not take into account the fact that the larger the nuclear charge, the tighter electrons are 'pulled' towards the nucleus and so the smaller each electron shell radius is. </p>
<p>Hope this answers your question, at least partially. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Protons and neutrons are not &quot;larger&quot; than electrons because electrons are not particles. They don't have a size or mass. </p>
<p>We visualize them as being a particle because it allows us to make sense of the chemistry, but in reality all the electron really represents is a probability wave. It's an electric charge. It is used to describe the state of an atom, but it is not a physical thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a beautiful question because it really highlights the limits of science and what science really does. What science really does is come up with models of reality and then test them to see if they have predictive value. Electrons are defined as having zero volume. Clearly that doesn't make any sense. If something has zero volume, how can it have mass? How is it even a physical object? Great questions. But it doesn't matter in a sense, because the model works, and that's the goal. One can legitimately ask if there even are any electrons at all, objectively speaking, or whether there is anything in reality that corresponds to the particular idea of an electron you have in your head. </p>
<p>So are all these little particles the same? The truthful answer is nobody really knows. They're defined in the models as all being the same, because there's no need to define them differently. But are they really all the same? Are there even such discrete objects as electrons out there in nature, or are they just useful fictions in models? The reality may be much stranger than we imagine, despite the success of our models. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
