The math says it has zero volume (a singularity), but we don't know what happens to the physics in these situations. What we do know is, given a certain amount of mass, how big the radius is of the sphere that encompasses the region from which light can't escape.</p>
<p>This radius is called the Schwarzschild radius and it is given by the expression 2 G M / c^2 (G = Gravitational constant, M = mass, c = speed of light). If the object is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius, then it's a black hole.</p>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I understand that the more hoops one has to go through to vote, the fewer people will want to subject themselves to go through the process. But I don't fully understand how voter ID laws suppress minorities specifically, or how they're more suppressive than requiring voters to show up in person at the booths (instead of online voting, for example). </p>
<p>EDIT: I'm not trying to get into a political debate here, I'm looking for the pros and cons of both sides. Please don't put answers like &quot;Republicans are trying to suppress minority votes&quot; as the answer, I'm trying to find out <em>how</em> this policy suppresses votes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of laws that affect everyone can be used to specifically target groups that are disproportionately unlikely to be able to follow them. The more hoops that a person has to go through, the more that a lack of education or a lack of time could stop them. The lack of education thing is important because someone with some college or even just a high school diploma is far more likely to have the patience to deal with large volumes of paperwork.</p>
<p>I have a college education, which means I only have to work one job. I have the time and attention span to jump through lots of hoops to be able to vote. Others with less education or in worse financial situations are less likely to have the time or motivation to go through the long and arduous process that registering to vote could be.</p>
<p>As an anecdotal example, when my wife and I (white US citizens in our mid-20's) first moved to this state (Virginia), she wound up having to take 4 trips to the DMV to be fully registered to vote, which was incredibly tedious and discouraging. If she weren't so determined to exercise her rights, she would have stopped once she got her drivers license. This wasn't even due to excessive laws in the state, it was just the DMV. If she had to work 2 jobs (more likely for minorities) or if we had family relying on us (more likely for minorities) or if she had less education (more likely for minorities) then this process could have likely stopped her early.</p>
<p>Fundamentally, it's all about the kinds of people more likely to be lost at every hurdle. A law doesn't need to directly target minorities to disproportionately hurt them. </p>
<p>EDIT: To clear up a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>I'm not talking about total suppression of some minorities. Making some part of the process slightly more difficult will not block out an entire group. But if a law is put in place that stops 1% of the rich and 5% of the poor, then it is disproportionately hurting the poor. It doesn't take much to do this, and it often doesn't take much to tip the scales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My wife's situation was made worse by a fuck-up at the DMV. There were no extra laws getting in her way, but the process was made much more difficult regardless. This is an anecdotal point and only serves as an example of how simple little issues can prevent less motivated people from registering. I don't believe that her situation represents the majority of people in Virginia. </p>
</li>
<li>As a lot of people have brought up, I'm improperly using the term &quot;minorities&quot;. The group that I'm referring to is really anyone who is not part of the social or financial elite who may be disenfranchised by laws that make voting more difficult for everyone. Most of this group is poor, and is disproportionately non-white, hence my misusing the term. Plenty of white people are affected negatively by increased difficulty in voting, and plenty of racial minorities are not affected by it.</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Many ID-issuing offices maintain limited business hours. For example, the office in Sauk City, Wisconsin is open only on the fifth Wednesday of any month. But only four months in 2012 â€” February, May, August, and October â€” have five Wednesdays.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the office for non-driving voter ID.  If you want a drivers license (has a fee), you can get one at any DMV, however only select locations with obscure and select hours offered the free ID.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Canada and I actually have experience working as a deputy returning officer for a provincial election a couple years ago. </p>
<p>When I was working, I required that people had at least one of three things in order for them to vote.</p>
<p>a) A voting card, the card had 5 or 6 digit numeric code on it, used for the purposes of identifying the voter. They were mailed out to addresses prior to the election based on census data and other info collected (for example, when you received an ID/Drivers license, you have to provide an address)</p>
<p>b) If they didn't have a voter card, they had to fill a one page form so that they could be entered into the system. I would enter this information in to ensure that they didn't vote twice and wouldn't have to deal with this during the next election.</p>
<p>c) If they had no form of ID, and no voter form, they also had to fill out a declaration stating that they are who they are, and if they lied about the information provided, they could be charged under the elections act.</p>
<p>Voter ID really wasn't that bad. It was the people, primarily older folks who were the pain. They would have no voter card, and did wish to provide any form of ID or sign any form to vote. Eventually when they realized that we were not going to allow them to vote if they did not comply, did they produce their driver's license.</p>
<p>In my experience, the DMV in Nova Scotia is normally open until 7pm and getting an ID costs max $15. As well we also took birth certificates, and even registered mail as proof. You don't actually need ID to vote here, but if you do, it makes the process significantly easier.</p>
<p>Voter turnout for that election I worked was 59% which was unchanged from the previous eleciton, in comparison, voter turnout in the last Presidential election was 55%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this entire issue should be simplified that way no one can complain of fraudulent votes.  In order to vote, you would need an ID, plain and simple.</p>
<p>But make it super super simple to get one.  When a citizen turns 18, send them a free ID.  If they do not have a registered address, that's another issue obviously, but then they should send an official out to find the person to get them the ID.</p>
<p>I don't want to oversimplify the issue, but voting is one of the biggest hallmarks of our society, and the nation should do everything it can to make it the easiest and most legitimate process possible.</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>ID cost money to obtain which means the poorest citizens often don't bother because they need that money for other things. </p>
<p>ID also has to be obtained at specific locations which means those who are not living near one of these locations must find a means of travel to go get an ID.  Again the poor often don't have access to the transportation needed to get the ID. Even those in cities who are poor,   often can't take the time or money to get an ID due to life situations. </p>
<p>Therefore those who are poor or in rural areas without transportation to where they can get ID are unable to vote as a result. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physics major here, I hope I did not misunderstood your question (not native speaker). As far as I know, single protons do not decay ( or to be exact what was shown that their average lifetime is pretty big, sources later since I'm from mobile ). Single neutrons do decay into protons, electrons , and anti-neutrinos (this is the most likely case). And to clarify, we call stable atoms stable stable because they are not observed to decay (strictly, there is a low probability because in quantum mechanics nothing is sure, but it is basically zero, like fifty thousand zeros and then a one, since we are talking about really high energies). </p>
<p>Unstable atoms decay through either the weak interaction through beta decay, or through the quantum tunneling of alpha particles. They do decay, because through decay they will be in a lower energy state. Free neutrons are just alike, they do decay because if they decay, the total (rest) energy of the newly create particles will be lower than the total energy of the neutron being alone. </p>
<p>So stable atoms don't decay because they are energetically stable, and neutrons inside them are stable, because decaying would not be energetically efficient, not because they are unstable by default. The between the protons and neutrons, provided by pions, I'd what ensures that they will not decay. It's not that neutrons are by default going to decay, it depend on the given circumstances, whether anything will happen or not. </p>
<p>Example: radioactive atoms are known to alter their half-life time when placed inside carbon nano balls (fulleren balls is the correct name, source later). This I'd because the change in circumstances provide a change of their possible energetical states, thus altering the chance they will decay and therefore altering the half life time of the given material. </p>

In unified models and the like in which we speak of &quot;proton decay,&quot; we actually are referring to processes that change the total number of baryons; the stable baryons in the universe are protons and neutrons (stable inside certain nuclei). In these models, there are decays of such protons and neutrons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one random ass question which I can answer. The answer is no. Pimples form because a hair follicle is plugged by dead skin or other debris, and the secretions (which are produced by cells) get stuck underneath. As the secretions accumulate, they irritate surrounding tissues and white blood cells are attracted to the site, carried there by flowing blood. The end result is the red, swollen, painful nodule of a pimple.</p>
<p>After you're dead, your skin cells can probably survive a few hours, if that. During that time, it'll be in self preservation mode mostly since it assumes the blood supply will return soon; it won't be actively producing the usual secretions. Furthermore, even if secretions are present, white blood cells can't get there in significant numbers due to lack of flowing blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My hypothesis is that if any pimples or blackheads do form at all - which I am not convinced is very likely, the process would have to be at the very least slowed due to the fact that the heart stopped pumping blood. This, in turn, means that no new white blood cells are getting transported to the infected area - meaning little if any inflammation, and no nutrients getting transported to either the bacteria or the surrounding cells - which means everything slowly dies.</p>
<p>In short: I don't think so, unless there is some way to pump healthy and living white blood cells into the infected carcass's to be pimply area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your teacher is talking about something called &quot;significant figures&quot;. </p>
<p>Significant figures talk about precision or accuracy in a measurement. Imagine measuring the length of an object with a ruler. This type of measurement isn't necessarily precise, right? You might measure something out to be 4.9 millimeters but your friend might guess it's closer to 5.0</p>
<p>When you say something is &quot;5&quot; centimeters, you're saying it is 5 whole centimeters but aren't talking about how many 10ths of a centimeter it is past those 5. The notation &quot;5.0&quot; says something like, &quot;we're certain it is 5 centimeters and 0 whole tenths of a centimeter&quot;. Carrying it out further, &quot;5.01&quot; would be, &quot;5 whole centimeters, 0 tenths of a centimeter and 1 hundredth of a centimeter&quot;.</p>
<p>Now this is where 5.0x5.0 and 5x5 give different answers. You want to use the <em>least precise</em> number when doing calculations.</p>
<p>The number 5 has one significant figure. When you multiply two numbers with one significant figure together, your result should be written with one significant figure. Basically, if you're doing a calculation, your answer can't suddenly be more precise than the measurements going into that calculation if that makes sense. Therefore, that answer is 30.</p>
<p>There are a lot of rules for when a digit is considered significant or insignificant. You can read a lot more about it <a href="http://chem.libretexts.org/Core/Analytical_Chemistry/Quantifying_Nature/Significant_Digits" target="_blank">here</a></p>
<p>25 as an answer would say it's &quot;two whole 10 units and 5 whole single units&quot;. The number &quot;30&quot; just says it's &quot;three whole 10 units and we can't be exact about how many single units it is&quot;.</p>
<p>Hopefully that starts to explain it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>5 has 1 sig fig. 25, however, has two sig figs. Since the input only has 1 sig fig, the product can only have 1 sig fig, thus you round it to 30, which has 1 sig fig.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Significant figures. You may only properly express the result of a calculation to the same precision as the measurements on which that result is based. Physical quantities are different than integers, however. An integer quantity can be treated as though it has an infinite number of significant figures. Thus, if you have five jars of five marbles each, 5x5=25, because each of those 5s is actually a 5.00000000... Conversely, if you apply a load of 5 lbs at a distance of 5 feet, you have a torque of 25 lb-ft, but that result has two significant figures, while the original terms in the equation only have one. The result can only be approximated to 3x10^1 or 30. To get a result of 25, you need to measure to a higher precision so that the original terms are e.g. 5.0 and 5.0.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

How you write a number (5 vs 5.0) has a bearing on how precisely you measured something.  Just writing 5 means you only bother to measure to 5, it could have been 5.01 or 5.999... all you cared about was 5.  As such, when you multiply 5x5 you're not saying exactly 5; thus you have 1 significant figure.  So your result can only have one significant figure.  25 is two significant figures, so you have to round to 30.</p>
<p>5.0x5.0 is saying you've measure to two significant figures, so your answer can have two significant figures.. thus 25.</p>
<p>I'm sure someone else will have a better explanation, but that's the general idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't just Physics. More properly, in experimental sciences or anything that involves the use of statistics, it's important to not create precision that isn't there. So by saying 5 x 5 = 30, what you're really doing is saying there's some statistic (likely an average) that is around 5-ish, and a second one that's also around 5. So I have a single digit of precision, and therefore I can't express the answer as 25 because that is more precise than my inputs.</p>
<p>Notice this applies to cases where your inputs are statistics or estimates. In formal math you aren't estimating anything, the number 5 is <em>exactly</em> 5 (or 5.000000000 if you prefer) so expressing the answer with two digits isn't creating extra precision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Executive orders however don't let you make law. They let you control and issue orders to things directly or indirectly assigned to the executive branch. According to Article II. Section1. of the U.S. Constitution: &quot;The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.&quot; This means he can order things to happen as long as it doesn't violate the laws that Congress has passed. You should read up more on this here: <a href="http://www.thisnation.com/question/040.html" target="_blank">http://www.thisnation.com/question/040.html</a> If Congress doesn't like an executive order, they can pass a law overruling it and Congress's law will take priority. The president can veto the law however, so basically to overrule an Executive Order a 2/3 majority is needed in Congress to overrule the executive order. This is why the Republican controlled congress couldn't stop Obamacare from happening. Though a Republican president can simply reverse previous executive orders unilaterally. Specifically though, areas of foreign policy, national defense, or the implementation and negotiation of treaties are given specifically to the President in the U.S. Constitution and Congress has little ability to over-rule an executive order in these cases.</p>
<p>Edit: Additionally, I should add, the courts also have the power to overrule an executive order if it's determined to be in violation of the Constitution, this has happened several times but it's relatively rare. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#Legal_conflicts" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#Legal_conflicts</a></p>
<p>And you should also read our Constitution, every citizen should have at least read it once even if you don't fully understand it. It's the core of our country and it's not very long, only a couple pages, even if some parts are somewhat confusing. <a href="http://constitutionus.com/" target="_blank">http://constitutionus.com/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The legislative branch makes laws. The executive branch executes those laws. The judicial branch considers whether actions taken by the executive branch or laws written by the legislative branch are constitutional.</p>
<p>In executing the laws, the executive branch has an interpretation and certain resources. For example, a law might be created to institute something like the FCC, whose head is nominated by the president and follows the president's orders. The president needs some way to tell the various departments and bureaus what to do, so he uses executive orders.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with executive orders. You just need to understand what they do. All they do is to give instructions on how to handle cases requiring regulatory approval or oversight within the bounds of the responsibility of that department as assigned by congress.</p>
<p>If they overstep the bounds, then the action can be challenged in court. If the dept. itself is unconstitutional (for example, congress creates a department of religious affairs to say what religions can and can't be practiced) then it will be challenged in court. </p>
<p>An executive order is not unconstitutional until declared unconstitutional by the courts. Despite what conservatives would have you believe about Obama's executive orders. I don't necessarily agree with what Trump is doing, but he's well within the law on this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Constitution says that Congress gets to make laws and the executive branch, led by the President, enforces laws. The courts interpret laws, resolve disagreements, and determine punishment within the bounds of laws set by Congress.</p>
<p>There is a fourth shadow branch of government that you don't learn about in school: administrative agencies. These are entities-- some famous, like the EPA, NASA, FTC, FCC, and dozens that you've never heard of-- that are created by Congress and told to do certain things. Usually (and this is grossly oversimplifying) Congress will say, &quot;we are creating this agency. Here is how agency heads are appointed. This agency needs to regulate X Policy Area (environment, communications, whatever) consistent with Y Vague Standards. They must pass rules and can bring actions against entities that violate rules.&quot; The rules made by agencies have to be enacted, usually, by procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedures Act, which is like a handbook for agency actions. The APA requires that a proposed rule be published, the public have a chance to comment, and then a final rule must be supported by a statement justifying why the rule is appropriate. Rules passed by agencies have the force and effect of law.</p>
<p>Under these grants of authority, agencies actually pass WAY more rules than Congress.</p>
<p>Here's where things get interesting: agencies, because they are carrying out laws (enforcing the law created by congress), they are under the executive branch's ultimate control. The President usually has some level of power to appoint and remove agency heads, the President wields political control over agencies, and the President sets the policy agenda.</p>
<p>The President, through executive order, can direct an agency to make a rule on a certain topic as long as the rule generally falls within an agency's power. Similarly, the President can direct agencies to NOT enforce a given law! (Think, for example, the choice to not enforce the federal ban on marijuana, or President Obama's DAPA and DACA programs).</p>
<p>Presidents since Reagan have seen agencies as extensions of their own policy agendas, and while SOME limits exist, the immense breadth of agencies and delegation of rule-makong authority to the executive branch means that the President has a lot of practical control over federal lawmaking and enforcement through executive action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a presidency scholar, so I can answer this pretty well. In inhibiting executive action, there are four really key things. </p>
<p>The first is that the POTUS is not the Executive. By that I mean that the man signs the thing, but the institution must do any of the actions. If, for instance, Trump wakes up cranky and decides, by executive order, to have arrested on sight anyone who makes fun of him, many will simply not do it. Their reasons for disobedience will vary from moral to legal arguments, but many will not. It wasn't an order, rather a firing, but this scared Truman shitless when he wanted to fire MacArthur. </p>
<p>Second, there is Congress. Congress can pass law contravening Executive orders, in which case the law takes precedent. Congress can also de-fund offices, projects, etc. that try to do the will of POTUS. So if, for instance, Trump decides we should not do trade deals, but congress signs laws mandating him to do so, we'd be headed in the direction of #3...</p>
<p>Third, there is the Supreme Court. If someone sues POTUS for doing something wildly illegal (for instance, violating the fourth amendment by requiring us all to wear ID badges indicating citizenship status), SCOTUS would then decide the issue. </p>
<p>Fourth is political expediency. In the past, presidents would have rather used orders sparingly; they really piss off Congress and have the nasty attribute of being tied to the man himself very, very directly. This may be lessened if, for instance, the POTUS has no idea what political capital is and is already willing to simply ignore congress. This, I think, is the most common but hardest to study insomuch that it is the non-event, the deed that gets done without order that matters here. More orders happen under divided government or when the party in power has no one single mind on an issue: executive orders are a desperate tool to try to get something done when the normal legislating process works. I am willing to make the scholarly argument that Obama had to use so many for the sole reason that the modern GOP would have filibustered everything Obama wanted, even if it was a proposal for a bill to have the floors waxed in the Senate to keep the building nice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Some event causes an offset in elevation, like at a <strong>fault zone</strong>, where some piece of land is lifted/dropped in relation to another. When a river is involved, this creates the waterfall at the fault because there is an offset in elevation (this is referred to as a <strong>knickpoint</strong>).  Through time, instead of this knickpoint being eroded down, it actually migrates upstream (<strong>knickpoint migration</strong>).  It may become more gradual through space and time, though generally this knickpoint migrates upstream to the headwaters.  </p>
<p>You see this happen all the time.  A colleague of mine was performing a study on the rates of this phenomenon in the lower Rocky Mountains, where the fault line near Jackson has caused knickpoints that are migrating upstream.  It's pretty interesting stuff.   </p>

<p><strong>edit1:</strong> The distances are wrong (1500km vs 1200km). Now that I have double checked. 2500 was a typo, I meant to type 1500km. As for New York and Atlanta I wrote miles instead of KM, should be 1200km!</p>
<p><strong>edit2:</strong> Turns out you can fly for even cheaper form London to Italy, some people estimate its $15-$30!!!!!!!</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is actually <em>really</em> neat! In addition to overhead costs in the US being generally higher, airlines in Europe (due to the way the EU handles borders) are generally cheaper.<br />
Airlines which are based in a country generally have to pay different fees to different countries for air-traffic-control services, so as a result the first instinct is to think that London to Italy would cost <em>more</em>. But, the EU treats airlines from all member countries as domestic.<br />
This helps <em>immensely</em> without travel costs because it expands the negotiating powers of budget airlines in member countries.<br />
But, since both flights you mentioned are treated as domestic that's not a factor in the answer.</p>
<hr />
<p>Given the lack of information on airlines and airports, I'm going to assume you're talking about RyanAir in the UK taking off out of Stansted and flying to Pisa. RyanAir has extremely low overhead costs relative to other airlines simply based on their purchasing and employment choices, however they use a secret weapon for budget flights: using smaller, more remote airports.<br />
Stansted is a small airport about a 40 minute train ride outside of London, so RyanAir is able to negotiate much more favorable prices in take off and landing fees simply by bringing business to the airport. And while Pisa is a larger airport, they're able to offer cheaper prices by keeping the runways in use during slow times of day.<br />
If you'd like more information on budget airlines, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=069y1MpOkQY" target="_blank">[this video]</a>.  </p>
<hr />
<p>So, why doesn't this work in the US? Increased costs following 9/11 have been cited, and this is true... But it's not the whole story. Budget airlines in the US have rarely been successful. <del>, and lately they're being executed incorrectly. Many of the current &quot;budget&quot; airlines in the US are subsidiaries of larger airlines, which means that their costs/profit margins are supposed to be high... But their big-ticket airline managers are executing the budgeting and negotiating incorrectly.</del> Additionally, there are simply fewer cheap airports in the US.<br />
In the end, US-based budget airlines just don't have the playing field to run well <del>and aren't executed properly.</del>  </p>
<hr />
<p>Update: apparently my information about airline-within-an-airline schemes was dated, so I've struck it out of the answer.<br />
Update2: People are asking about Brexit in relation to air travel. I don't really know much about how this will affect air travel between the UK and the EU, but air travel between other EU states and between EU states and international destinations shouldn't change much. From the US to EU states, there are many airports in Ireland that can be used instead of UK airports so those costs likely won't change by much after Brexit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The price you've quoted for the London to Italy flight comes with several strings attached - flying from smaller airports outside the city (airlines save on airport tax), weird takeoff and landing times (again, to save on taxes by utilizing undesirable times). </p>
<p>Also, the price quoted is pretty much $2-$3 for the actual ticket itself + taxes. The airline is not making any money on you (yet!). Real income comes with all the additions you need - check in at the airport (fee), print a boarding pass at the airport (fee), take a carry on with you (fee), check in a bag (fee), choosing your own seat (fee), drinks (fee), snacks (fee), etc. </p>
<p>Buying a ticket on a major airline to fly between to major cities comes with its perks. All 3 airports in NYC (JFK, LGA and EWR) and the airport in Atlanta (ATL) are all Delta hubs (3rd largest airline in the world). Hub to hub flying is always a little more expensive, not to mention direct flying. Hub to hub because anywhere from 40% to 99% of the flight could he connecting (I work for Delta, worked a flight a few days ago from Salt Lake city to Atlanta with 99% of the people connecting), mostly international; airlines like to keep these flights for people who are going onwards or are willing to pay extra. Direct because it's a luxury getting to your destination quicker, and luxuries often come with a surcharge. Now, if you were to go on the same route but were to do LGA to DCA to ATL, your ticket would be cheaper because you're not taking a valuable seat on a direct flight, and don't kind getting to your destination in 5 hours rather than 3.</p>
<p>And, flying on big name airlines also come with added benefits. On international flights, they almost always serve free meals. On long haul international flights with Delta, even booze is free. Also, flying with a major airline comes with their name, and what it stands for. Delta prides itself on being the #1 on time airline in the US, and also the airline with the fewest cancelations. If you're an occasional flyer, this won't matter to you that much. But if you're a business traveller, then an airline can use this title to capture your business travel needs because it's offering you something no other could. That gives the airlines the right to jack up prices even further. </p>
<p>tl;dr budget airlines can offer cheap tickets, but they come with many inconveniences. Major airlines charge more, but comes with more peace of mind. Flying hub to hub is expensive because of mostly connections. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean $70 for a budget airline like RyanAir? A fair comparison would be Frontier Airlines, who offers round-trip flights from LGA (NY) to ATL frequently at $60 roundtrip. I've similarly gone from Philadelphia to St. Augustine (880miles), Minneapolis (1,172miles), and Raeligh (471miles) for $30-$60 through Frontier.</p>
<p>ELI5: you're comparing a budget airline to major US carriers. There's often a discrepancy, but I've taken similarly expensive flights in the EU. Budget prices exist in the US, but people often complain about amenities being taken away despite seeking lower fares.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>40 minutes drive to Basel Airport from Freiburg via shuttle bus: 20 Euros</p>
<p>Flight to London Stansted, with priority boarding, no checked bags: 27 Euros</p>
<p>40 minutes drive from airport to King's X via bus: 12 pounds</p>
<p>Return bus to Stansted: 12 pounds</p>
<p>Flight back home: no idea, the 27 euros for the flight to London covered the flight back home as well.</p>
<p>Bus back home to Freiburg from Basel: 20 Euros</p>
<p>So the flight two ways was cheaper than transportation to the airports EACH. Weird world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

If you sit down for a full meal, you're there for probably the better part of an hour. If you grab a coffee, you can chat for as long or short as you like depending on what's going on. It's also pretty cheap, only spending a few bucks for a drink rather than maybe $20 or more for a full meal. Timing is also more flexible. You can grab a drink whenever, but going for a meal at something like 3:00 in the afternoon is a bit odd.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
