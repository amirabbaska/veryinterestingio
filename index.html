		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uv-vis spectroscopy is considered electronic detection/absorption. Electrons being excited from one energy level to another. Let's say from HOMO to LUMO or something similar like a band gap. Having broad peaks suggests to us that there are many energy levels that electrons can exist in. The wavelength max, the peak in the broad absorption spectrum suggests that at that energy level the probability of an electron to be excited is the greatest. We can infer all this data from the uv-vis and probably need other tools to suggest more than this. </p>
<p>Other spectroscopy detects rotational and vibration energy levels within a molecule. It just so happens that electronic excitations also incorporstate these energy levels too. Once an electron is excited it means that it gained energy, potential and kinetic. It can transfer that energy in a number of ways and has to conserve energy which is one of the laws of thermodynamics. It does this by emmiting pure energy as light or causing the molecule to vibrate or rotate. Rotation and vibration (rot and vib) would be considered heat. Since rotational and vibration energy levels are not quite as discrete as an electron existing in specific orbitals there ends up being essentially infinite rot and vib energy levels, meaning the excited electron can give a little, a lot, or any amount of energy to these heat modes. Ok, this suggests that electrons can relax or donate energy to other modes but doesn't explain broad peaks.</p>
<p>Ground state electronic levels. These electrons excited by UV-vis are not all at the same starting energy level. Since absorption is pure light energy being incorporated into the molecules where electrons start and stop excitation will determine the light/energy that can be absorbed. If a molecule is already in a slightly excited state by being a little warm then it has a higher starting place energeticly and will absorb a longer, less energetic photon and appear to absorp above its wavelength max. Shorter/higher energy photons can be absorbed if an electron can incorporate that light energy to its excited electronic state plus a heat energy level (rot and vib).
We should be able to backup this idea by taking uv-vis at different temperatures of a known substance. </p>
<p>TLDR:
UV-vis excites electrons at discrete energy levels which would be suggested by peak max. Vibrational and rotational (heat) energy levels allow for wiggle room and allow molecules to absorbed photons of higher and lower energy. This combination of electronic, vibrational, and rotational energy levels gives a broad spectrum. We are looking at energy being absorbed into a molecule and thus must extrapolate what a change in energy means.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have two types of broadening : homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening.</p>
<p>The easier to conceptualize is inhomogeneous broadening : this can be caused by a multitude of factors, that make each molecule/emitter be in a slightly different energy state. This can be caused by Doppler effect (molecules moving at different speeds), uneven distribution of impurities in a material that locally affect the material properties around them, etc.</p>
<p>In the case of a pure, defect-free sample, where there is no inhomogeneous broadening, you will still observe homogeneous broadening of any optical transition. This is caused by the uncertainty principle, and the product Delta_E <em> Delta_t has a minimum value of hbar/2, and any optical transition takes a finite time Delta_t to happen, thus the transition linewidth will always be at least hbar/(2</em>Delta_t).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>
<p>We know how big the Earth is because we can measure it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can measure how strong gravity is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combining those, we can figure out Earth's mass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combining mass and volume, we can figure out the Earth's average density.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The density you get from this is immediately weird - 5.5 g/cm^(3). When we measure all the rocks around us, the density is more like 3 g/cm^(3). In order for the <em>average</em> density of the Earth to be 5.5 g/cm^(3), there's got to be a lot of something even more dense so that Earth averages out to a density of 5.5 g/cm^(3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here's where earthquakes help us: Shear waves won't travel through liquid. When we measure <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XPYsXd5.jpg" target="_blank">which parts of the Earth actually receive shear waves</a> we see a big shadow zone, so we can tell there's a big ball of something liquid at the core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the size of the shadow zone, we can figure out the radius of the core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order for the average density to come out to 5.5 g/cm^(3), using the core's radius we can calculate its density must be somewhere around 7.9 g/cm^(3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That incredible close to the density of iron, so that's a good candidate for the core material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also know that iron is super common in the universe (thanks to our understanding of how stars undergo fusion), so that further strengthens the case of iron as a good candidate.</p>
</li>
<li>Finally, we can measure how strong the Earth's magnetic field is. Based on our knowledge of how quickly Earth rotates and how dynamos work, we can determine that a rotating ball the size of our core and made of liquid iron produces a magnetic field that's just about the same strength as the one we measure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Earth's average density, earthquake shadow zones, and the strength of our planet's magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Longer answer:
Geology gives us a strong indication of what the earth is made of simply by digging up rock and looking at things like lava flows.</p>
<p>Seismographic data tells us how kinetic energy movies through the earth, this data is collected all over the earth and is timed and correlated to each-other.</p>
<p>Astronomy tells is what other objects in our solar system are made out of and what materials would have been common in the solar system as earth was forming and also gives the necessary data to assess the earths mass.</p>
<p>Physics ties it all together by using measurements of the magnetic field and its strength, measurements of the earths mass and gravity,  assessments of the data from seismology. Essentially these all paint a picture of the earths composition and it all points to an Iron Nickle core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a bubble - soap/water, milk or otherwise - and initiate a &quot;pop&quot; from a single point on the surface. What would be the velocity of the bursting edge, as it propagates away from the initiation point?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blNe2Ae5a2c" target="_blank">Here is a video</a> of some bursting bubbles in slow-motion. Notice that the bursting edge recedes from the initiation point; the intact surface remains unaffected until the bursting edge reaches it.</p>
<p>For simplicity, assume a <em>perfect bubble</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Perfectly spherical</li>
<li>Evenly distributed surface</li>
<li>No external forces (i.e. gravity, which would cause deformation and pooling of the medium)</li>
<li>&quot;Pop&quot; or burst initiated from a single point on the surface</li>
</ul>
<p>It seems intuitive that the <em>upper limit</em> would be the <strong>speed of sound</strong> for whatever medium the bubble was made from, because the speed of sound would be the physical limit that the information could be passed along that the bubble was popping. But I'm unsure what role the <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/127695/why-is-the-pressure-inside-a-soap-bubble-higher-than-outside" target="_blank">pressure differential</a> might play - if any at all.</p></div></div>

<ul>
<li>Determine frame rate of the original video recording</li>
<li>Determine size of bubble in video</li>
<li>Measure time for bubble to pop</li>
<li>Calculate speed: distance divided by time</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Looking at the bubble at 1m43s: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvZ2Z_s4Bo&t=103s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktvZ2Z_s4Bo&t=103s</a></p>
<ul>
<li>video is recorded at 18,000 FPS.</li>
<li>bubble size is about 15 cm.</li>
<li>time to pop is about 13 seconds.</li>
<li>13s of video at 18,000 FPS is 0.72ms of real time. 0.15m/0.72ms  = 208 m/s</li>
<li>edit: MorRobots did the speed calculation for a spherical surface: 362.2 m/s</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bubble size and duration of the popping are just rough numbers and can be approximated better but it'll get you in the right ballpark.</p>
<p>For homework, you can do the math for traversing a sphereical surface instead of the simpler calculation I'm using.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

From this diagram we see that at any point on the bubbles surface, the forces due to surface tension are actually orthogonal to the forces due to the pressure differential. For this reason, forces due to pressure differential can be ignored in calculating how quickly the break will move along.</p>
<p>Unless there is something else to be considered, I'd say that the upper bound of the material's speed of sound is a very reasonable approximation for the speed of propagation of the surface break.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On mobile, so sorry for the spelling errors and typos. </p>
<p>I imagine that the viscosity of the bubble material and the shear force of the liquid plane traveling through the gas are important factors.</p>
<p>We typically use liquids containing surfactants (such as soap) to achieve a liquid with low surface tension and viscosity. </p>
<p>I also think the upper limit is significantly less than the speed of sound in the material for a couple different reasons. First, when a bubble bursts the matter travels <em>around</em> the surface of the bubble, in a circle. This requires a change of momentum not required if the material is traveling in a straight line. Second, when a bubble bursts, all of the material goes <em>with</em> the “shock wave.” When sound travels through a material, there is just a slight movement of each molecule; the energy from one molecule is passed along to the next (minus some frictional losses). In a popped bubble on the other hand, all of the material “clumps” together moving at the same speed. This means that enough energy is needed to accelerate all of the atoms to some top speed. </p>
<p>The best analogy I can think of is a train accelerating from a stop. In the ”speed of sound” case, the “speed” would be CLUNK CLUNK CLUNK of each train car’s hitch getting pulled taught. This happens really quickly and the CLUNk travels all the way to the last car in almost no time. In the bubble example, we have to accelerate all of the actual train cars to some top speed. </p>
<p>TD;DR I have no idea how to calculate the top speed outside of experimentation, but I am guessing that it is significantly less than the speed of sound in the material. Like 1-3 orders of magnitude less. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody knows. For all we know, it could be unknowable. Some suggest that consciousness is emergent, that is, given a sufficiently complex set of instructions on how to respond to external stimuli, one will &quot;think&quot; to decide how to respond before doing anything. Others suggest that our consciousness is inherent to our beings, that is, there exists some part of us that contains our consciousness which would exist regardless of our physical complexity (call it a soul, if you will.)</p>
<p>The problem with emergent consciousness is that it suggests a lack of free will in order to gain agency over our lives. If you are nothing more than a collection of responses to stimuli, then you can control your life, but how can you make decisions?</p>
<p>The problem with souls is that if it is presumed to be independent of the body, that is, non-physical in nature, which it must be in order to be independent of your physical complexity and to exist outside your physical body, then they cannot be measured or observed by any physical instruments. However, if they cannot affect anything physical, then they logically cannot affect your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As you turn it to hot, the cold valve starts to close off more until it's barely passing water through and causes it to whistle, just like whistling with your lips. You have to restrict the airflow by closing off your lips to create the whistle sound and as you change the speed of the air and size of opening in your lips, the sound changes with it. This is what's happening with the water and the valves in your shower. The temperature doesn't matter to the sound, it's just that when you turn it up hotter you're closing off the cold valve more and more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your sink or bathtub or toilet have shut off valves in the line before the water reaches the valve at the sink or bathtub, this is so you can replace the main valve without having to shut off the water main.</p>
<p>The older style valves have a rubber seat that is loose when it is in the open position, The rubber seat picks up a vibration as the water flows by. When it hits the right frequency it becomes extremely loud.</p>
<p>To fix this they replaced the old valve with a new ball valve, it doesn't have any loose components that can start to vibrate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1) if the noise is coming from the shower head area, simply buy some lime-a-way and put it in a sand which bag and dip the head in it or hold it over the head. </p>
<p>2) if the noise is coming from the area of the handle where you turn it from cold to hot, you will need to replace your shower cartridge. You tube it it pretty simple to do. </p>
<p>3) if it’s coming from the downspout area where you lift the little handle to send it to the shower head, I would just replace that. It’s about 15-$20 at Home Depot or Lowe’s. You can buy a universal one and it’s pretty easy to install as well. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't actually know why, but the child immune system and the adult immune system react differently to the varicella-zoster virus and that means that the adult infection can come with rather fatal complications as a result of infection. The reasoning can be due to how our antibodies react to infections (adults have been infected more so their antibodies have greater memory of more viruses) and perhaps the composition of different white blood cells in our body (they have very complex interactions).</p>
<p>But it can cause greater levels of fluid trapped in the lungs, known as pneumonia which can be incredibly uncomfortable and feel like you can't breathe. It can also cause infection and inflammation within the brain (encephalitis) which is very lethal. You can also die from your immune response having a huge body-wide reaction to the virus (sepsis). </p>
<p>Because of how infectious it is, you can catch it from your child, or any child, as well as contact with people who have re-emerged virus which is known as Shingles. If you've never been vaccinated or infected, its strongly suggested that you do get vaccinated ASAP. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>How many calories will be stored in fat (assuming none of the calories are used for exercise etc).</li>
<li>How many calories are available to perform work with (after the body has converted the sugar to ATP, etc). The assumption is that the conversion process from Sugar --&gt; X --&gt; ATP --&gt; ? is not 100% efficient.</li>
<li>How do the above numbers differ for different sources of energy. For example does eating 1000 cal of fat result in the same number of calories available for work as eating 1000 cal of sugar? </li>

<p>Bonus question:</p>
<ul>
<li>How efficient is the body in converting the energy stored in fat to energy available for work (e.g. ATP)</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, as far as the processing, storage and other ‘taking in’ goes, you’re looking for the thermic effect of food. That is energy used to convert it from its raw state to one that’s ‘ready to burn’.</p>
<p>Carbs have a 5-15% thermic effect, depending on complexity. Very complex carbs take more energy to process than simple ones.</p>
<p>Fats have at most 5-15%, some sources claim well below 5%, and are seen as the most efficient.</p>
<p>Protein is much harder to digest and process, with a thermic effect of 20-35%, depending on complexity and blend.</p>
<p>So the conclusion here is that replacing fat or sugar calories with an equal amount of protein calories will reduce your net caloric intake after cost of processing. It isn’t a huge number but is meaningful over time - I ran some numbers for a long post a while ago, and it could be enough for a few pounds of weight gain or loss a year. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Atwater system is what we use for rough estimates for the available energy in food--metabolizable energy. The pure energy stored in food, the gross combustible energy, does not equal metabolizable energy 1:1 for the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Food must be broken down into monomeric components to be directly absorbed (the majority of this absorption occurs in the duodenum, the first section of the small intestine)  and this breakdown process is reliant on enzymes. Enzyme action is in turn reliant on available substrate surface area and time.  Time for enzymatic action on the food you eat is controlled by gut motility. If you don't eat regularly your body will slow gut motility and this has the effect of increasing how much you absorb from your food. Anything that decreases gut motility will increase the metabolizable energy of food. </li>
</ol>
<p>Surface area is controlled by the physical properties  of the food itself, the mechanical mixing due to GI tract muscular contractions, and in the case of fat--bile salts that act to increase surface area of fat droplets by breaking them into much smaller droplets (micelles) that don't recondense in the aqueous chyme.  Insoluble fiber  plays a role in reducing available surface area for amylase (the enzyme that breaks starch down into simple sugars),  so high fiber foods have decreased metabolizable energy.  But we'll come back to fiber because it is tricky.</p>
<ol>
<li>Monomers (amino acids, monosaccharides, and fatty acids) must be absorbed by gut epithelial cells and transported to the portal venous system.  From there they go to the liver and then see systemic distribution from the liver. These transport systems require energy and some monomers required less energy than others to shuffle around. Some macronutrients yield less metabolizable energy than others due to higher energy investment for transport and uptake. Some people can't absorb certain monomers like fructose very efficiently.  Also, new research is showing evidence that stimulation of sweet taste receptors leads to increased absorption of nutrients in the SI, meaning that some foods like sugar and sugar substitutes may boost the metabolizable energy of others.</li>
</ol>
<p>Further, uptake of macronutrients by tissues is often the subject of regulation. People with severe peripheral insulin resistance see little to no metabolizable energy from glucose because it never enters those cells to be used.  Different tissue types have different macronutrient preferences and adjust absorption and subsequent catabolism accordingly. </p>
<ol>
<li>Macronutrients are catabolized in cells to power ATP generation. There are a number of different pathways and not all have the same ATP yields. The catabolic pathways that require oxygen occur in the mitochondria, which means that mitochondrial density and efficiency affect the metabolizable energy of food as well. People who are physically active have greater mitochondrial density in their skeletal  muscle fibers and there are studies showing that things like fasting increase mitochondrial efficiency--resulting in increased ATP generation.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know your question is more asking about bookeeping but unfortunately bookkeeping is a nightmare, is variable across the population and is even variable in one individual depending on their activity level and things like, weirdly--the bacteria in their colon. I mentioned fiber before and how it is tricky. The Atwater system's largest flaw is its accounting for fiber.</p>
<p>Fiber and whatever monomers manage to escape the small intestine end up in the large intestine, which is full of bacteria. Gut bacteria digest the remaining di and monosaccharides (if you're lactose intolerant, this is where the lactose is broken down) and secrete out short chain fatty acids which is another source of energy for us. Gut bacteria can also partially digest fiber, as well as certain oligosaccharides found in vegetables/fruit, and non-nutritive sweeteners like stevia (not aspartame, aspartame is essentially an amino acid pair that gets absorbed up in the SI). </p>
<p>Because the metabolizable energy is effectively second-hand, there isn't much by way of hard numbers but animal and human studies support the idea that gut bacteria play a big role in obesity and the theory behind this is that some people have more efficient gut bacteria than others, seeing increased metabolizable energy from food sources.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said with respect to the thermic effects of food (which answers your third bullet), the proportion of calories eaten that are burned/used for various processes vs stored is in constant flux. Proportions would be based on tons of factors including things like circulating levels of hormones such as insulin (promotes storage I.e, anabolic) and glucagon (opposite effect I.e., catabolic). I don't think you could ever put exact numbers on it. However the body is VERY efficient at 'using' (either burning or storing) calories from food. Only a very small amount of the energy taken in is 'lost' in the form of heat, which helps us stay warm blooded. Look up mitochondrial uncoupling for more on that.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello friend, when consuming calories from any source (protein fat or carbs) the body will undergo specific pathways depending on your current state (fed fasting or starving)  these pathways convert the calorie sources you consume into several intermediates which can then be stored (glycogen, TAGs) or used immediately (glucose, ketone bodies, etc) to produce ATP. Eating pure sugar would generally be broken down to glucose and then stored as glycogen or used to generate ATP depending on your metabolic needs. The pathways that take place are sometimes very efficient (Krebs cycle) and sometimes can be less efficient like the Electron transport chain (where the most ATP  is produced) which will lose around 50 of a vital step (H+ gradient) as heat instead of generating ATP.  </p>
<p>Very simply put calories are calories since your body can convert or store carbs, protein, and lipids into interchangeable intermediates. That is a very basic and generalised explanation. Hope this helps, sorry for typos I'm on mobile!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's one way to do it:  Humans burn 100 watts in food energy - you get this by assuming 2200 kcal diet and convert to joules by multiplying by 4.19e3 J/kcal  and divide by seconds in a day.</p>
<p>A laborer can produce <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_power" target="_blank">75 watts of work over an 8 hour shift</a>.  </p>
<p>So the 'useful work efficiency' of a human, treating them as a machine, is </p>
<p>Output/Input = (75 W x 8 hrs)/ (100 W  x 24 hrs) = 25%  </p>
<p>Surprisingly efficient, I'd say. About the same as an internal combustion engine.    It's probably a bit lower in reality, because this laborer is probably consuming more than 2200 kcal.  If you assume 3500 kcal/day, it becomes 14%.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spent nuclear fuel just doesn't produce enough heat to make it useful for producing steam. The amount of power you'd get out of it that way simply would never pay for the cost of building and running the system.</p>
<p>It can be recycled however. Spent fuel still contains a lot of useful radioisotopes and there are types of reactors designed to recycle the spent fuel back into usable nuclear fuel. The problem is, that on top of the normal political concerns with nuclear reactors, recycling can produce plutonium, which is used in nuclear weapons. Because it is very difficult to tell the difference between a fuel recycling plant and a weapon-making plant from outside, many countries have decided to not recycle to avoid political and diplomatic troubles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>According to <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/22/Decay_heat_illustration.PNG" target="_blank">this image</a> from wikipedia, after a mere 10 days power output is down to less than 0.5% of the original power output. Because of the nature of the graph, a year later it will probably still be about 0.1%. Clearly this is enough heat to warrant powered-passive cooling (like a computer fan, as opposed to powered cooling, such as a refrigerator).</p>
<p>Any power station built to collect this power would produce 1000x less energy than a regular power station, which means the energy it produces would cost 1000x as much, assuming the operating cost of the facility is similar to a regular power station.</p>
<p>It's cheaper to run a cooling station than to run a power station that doesn't produce any power.</p>
