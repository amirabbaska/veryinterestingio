Your finger &quot;pushes&quot; the egg away from itself when you go to fish out the eggshell - however, the egg pushes the eggshell away from your finger because it is viscous. Think of how jello would behave if you pushed on it, egg is like a more watery jello.</p>
<p>If you use another eggshell piece to fish it out, you will have more success, the sharp edge of the other eggshell will &quot;cut&quot; through the egg and let you grab the other piece.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy costs on an open cold case are not as high as you might imagine. It's very different from simply leaving the door open on your refrigerator. Open cold cases are equipped with air curtains, which are sets of narrow vents that blow cold air from the top of the case into corresponding vents at the bottom of the cases (which draw that air in). This effectively forms a &quot;curtain&quot; that helps prevent the cold air inside the case from mixing with the warmer air outside. </p>
<p>Cases that are heavily shopped and require frequent re-stocking (many times per day), such as produce and meat cases, are less likely to have doors because this reduces the time needed for employees to work the product, which saves money on labor, and it also makes it easier for customers shop, which invites more sales. These items are also much less perishable and able to withstand greater temperature fluctuations than frozen products like ice cream, which you will never find without doors.</p>
<p>Side note: the retailer I work for once experimented with doors on all of our wall coolers, including meat and produce, for a little more than a year, not to save money directly, but to collect some kind of energy-efficiency tax credits. Those same doors came off just as soon as those tax credits expired (or so I was told).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The items in the freezer section (ones with big glass doors) are things that, you guessed it, need to be frozen so they are needed. </p>
<p>At night when supermarkets are closed, they actually drape plastic or something similar over the refrigerated section to save energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything everyone said about them being surprisingly efficient is true. They can actually be more efficient then ones with doors. Depending on how often or how long they'll be opened. On a meat case where there's always someone looking through the steaks to find the right one the doors would always be open. Or very heavily shopped sections the doors would always be open. The milk and eggs are often in fidges with doors because there's a whole walking fridge behind the display where the back up is kept, and the restocking is done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know if every digit is equally likely in pi, but it is conjectured that this is the case, we just can't prove it yet. We think that this is the case mostly because every digit is equally likely in almost all numbers, so there would have to be some kind of specific reason or obstruction to this for pi if it weren't the case. But we don't think that pi should have a special reason not to have every digit equally likely. So we think that every digit in pi is equally likely because we think it's like most every other number and not particularly special (at least, when it comes to digits).</p>
<p>I don't think you would want to use it as a random number generator, because it's still a well known sequence of numbers and you don't really want that when you are trying to get random numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In accounting we used to apply <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benford's_law" target="_blank"></a> to catch fraudsters. </p>
<p>&quot;The law states that in many naturally occurring collections of numbers, the leading significant digit is likely to be small. in sets which obey the law, the number 1 appears as the most significant digit about 30% of the time, while 9 appears as the most significant digit less than 5% of the time.&quot;</p>
<p>We could catch fraud in a balance sheet because randomly generated numbers follow this law. If someone was cooking the books, the number 9 might appear as the most significant digit 10-20% of the time. When this occurred deeper investigation usually found fraud in action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>lets see</p>
<p>1) Megabit vs Megabyte, 1 megabyte is 8 megabit, so if you have 10Mbps from your telco, you probobly have 1.25MBps</p>
<p>2) Protocol overhead, the data dosnt go un a raw format, its usualy packaged in a protocol called TCP/IP which requires envalopes called &quot;packets&quot; with their own structure and inner detail, this usualy can take between 2 and 10% of your bandwidth. </p>
<p>3) Wifi is very dependent on protocol used (A. B. G, N, AC...), interferance from local sources, sometimes some brands hate other brands and things like this. so for a perfect connection you would have to be on a &quot;clean channel&quot; (meaning no interference or anyone else using it), your antenna and equipment be 100% operational and your reciving device as well, using the same protocol and with a wifi standard that is able to provide speeds which are superior to the speed you get from a cabled connection. </p>
<p>4) if you have a DSL connection, your distance from the nearest DSL exchange device where your line is plugged in (a DSLAM) will affect the connection, around 2/3 of a mile gives you 100% but from there you start to drop off, i use to live around 2 miles from the exchange and had around 45db of attunuation, my 20mbps ADSL2+ would end up being a 6mbps DSL link. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could be faced with a multitude of reasons why. Do you get the speed you pay for when your  computer is plugged in directly to the router? If that's the case, you need a better router that can handle the speed. </p>
<p>If you don't get the speed you pay for when directly plugged into the router, but you get the speed you pay for when directly plugged into the modem, you still have a bad router.</p>
<p>If you still don't get the speed you pay for when you're plugged directly into the modem, it's likely the fault of your ISP.</p>
<p>Maybe, if your laptop/phone/etc is older, your wireless card in the machine isn't up to par to match the speeds (ac standard should allow you to top out). </p>
<p>There are a lot of factors going into this. I have gigabit and get the full tap through my router, but I also have a very nice router and my wireless devices can handle speeds that high. Maybe the situation for you has a broken link</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

A bit is a single unit of binary information which is either a zero or a one. A byte is a standard functional unit of information composed of eight bits.</p>
<p>As a result the speed the computer will display will be 1/8th of that which your internet provider would be advertising. Obviously the provider prefers to advertise the bigger number and the only way you can tell the difference is by checking the units.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the one thing that many responses are missing is the key phrase &quot;I never have WIFI speeds...&quot; </p>
<p>Wifi is sent over radio waves to your computer, which is the key to why you may be having problems. If many routers are nearby and on the same frequency, or you or a neighbor are using a microwave, data transmission can be very spotty when sent over radio. This is especially bad if you are in an apartment setting, where 8+ people could all have their own wifi connections and be using microwaves at various times. And that is only in one building, nearby buildings could also cause interference! Even when you are feet from your router, you could still be receiving major interference from the many sources nearby. If many devices are trying to receive data from the same signal, you will have similar issues. For best speed over wifi, a single device needs to be connected to the router.</p>
<p>So that's one of the major things, but the next major thing is that your router may be using a older transmission format which has a lower capped speed. Wireless-G has a max throughput of only 54 mbps (mega bits per second). These speeds are only reached if the router is practically in isolation with no other signals interfering. Wireless-N can a throughput of 600 - 900 mbps. So in order to receive better speed from your router, using N will help tremendously. In addition, a new format was recently developed called Wireless-AC, which is even faster and more reliable.</p>
<p>The takeaway from this is that wireless is a very variable (and sometimes unreliable) method of delivering internet. If you want max speed, you need a wired connection directly to your router. Only then can you really say that you are not receiving the speeds you are paying for. Speeds from internet companies are assuming you are using a wired direct connection to the modem. Its also important to note that most internet service providers do not guarantee the speeds you are paying for, but that is another topic entirely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There can be a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>1)  You're confusing mbps and MB/s.  If you have 150mbps service, your maximum speed is going to be 18.75MB/s.</p>
<p>2)  Your router isn't capable of transmitting the full speed. If you have a B band router, the max speed is 11mbps. If you have a G band router, your max speed is 53mbps. Wireless N is 600-900mbps max. Wireless AC is up to 5300mbps.</p>
<p>3)  Your device that's on wireless isn't capable of receiving the full speed (see #2 above for speed limitations).</p>
<p>4)  There is signal degradation between the router and your device, preventing the top speed.</p>
<p>5)  Add in switches, hubs, cable lengths, wall and floor composition, data reflection, and other nearby wifi transmitters using the same channel range, and you can see major variances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not. In fact, it is the most dangerous meal of the day. </p>
<p>Professor Terence Kealey's book Breakfast is a Dangerous Meal highlights the many ways in which it is dangerous. To ELY5:</p>
<p>Because of evolution, humans did not naturally eat in the morning. As a result, our body provides a spike in blood sugar to cope with the natural fast we have. So if we eat breakfast (which in our society is usually full of carbs (i.e. sugar) and other foods of low nutritional value) then our blood sugar levels rocket up, which also increases our insulin resistance, eventually leading to type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, eating breakfast increases our hunger throughout the day (contrary to prevailing wisdom) and makes it more likely for us to eat more calories throughout the whole day. </p>
<p>As other commentators have stated, many of the studies which try to prove that breakfast is good for us are flawed for two reasons: Firstly, they are nearly always funded by Kelloggs or similar, and secondly, they are based on correlation and not causation. This is because <strong>it is true that, generally speaking, people who eat breakfast are also more healthy than those who do not.</strong> However, this is because people who eat breakfast come from a higher socioeconomic profile than those who don't, and so generally do what they are told when it comes to health and nutrition - such as eat their 5 fruit and veg a day, do lots of exercise, etc., and to eat breakfast. They are therefore healthier in spite of the fact they eat breakfast, and not because of it. This then allows the studies funded by Kelloggs and other food companies to say &quot;Hey look! People who eat breakfast are  less obese!&quot; Which then in turn allows bad news publications to say &quot;Hey look! People who eat breakfast are less likely to be obese!&quot; Which is a lie. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not, the slogan, &quot;Breakfast is the most important meal of the day,&quot; was invented in the mid 19th century by Seventh Day Adventists James Caleb Jackson and John Harvey Kellogg to sell their newly invented breakfast cereal food stuffs. Yes, <em>that</em> Kellogg. Then the bacon market jumped on that bandwagon, got 5,000 doctors to sign off on the health benefits of eating protein in the morning, and got news papers to publish the signatories as though it were scientific research.</p>
<p>It was all founded on bullshit. It was a weird time, where people were moving into factories and people were getting all up about indigestion. Kellogg was also weird about the morality of breakfast and thought bland food would curb masturbation. If you look into this period, it gets weirder than that. I blame all the lead and mercury in the water. That shit makes you dumb and <em>fucking crazy</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't always. Find what works for you. </p>
<p>I find that I do better personally skipping breakfast, having lunch as my first meal of the day between 11a-1p, having a small snack sometime between 2-4p, and then having dinner 6-8p.</p>
<p>I find that if I eat a meal at 7-8a before work, I get ravenously hungry 2 hours later, whereas I don't get hungry before lunch if I skip breakfast. I believe this is because the 'getting hungry' response that occurs after eating dinner occurs while I am asleep, which means it has curbed itself by the time I wake up. Eating breakfast just re-initiates that hunger because breakfast usually isn't a thousand calorie meal so you get hungry relatively quickly... and then if the solution is adding a thousand calorie meal to my diet to solve a problem that is alleviated by not eating the meal altogether, I don't see how that makes any sense.</p>
<p>Performance-wise I don't notice much difference for skipping breakfast, but I do drink black coffee every morning as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually when engineers say something will last for X years, it means that the thing has 95% (for example) chance of still working after X years. It doesn't mean that as soon as the X years have passed the satellite will stop working. This is something people often don't understand when they are talking about planned obsolescence. </p>
<p>For satellites there are a couple of limitations on the lifespan on top of stuff just breaking up. First is the propulsion. In geostationary orbit you need a bit of propellant to correct for perturbations caused by the moon and the sun gravitational pull as well light pressure. When the propellant runs out the satellites are placed into a graveyard orbit so that they are out of the way of other satellites. Sometime thrusters perform better than expected, or the rocket is extra precise in its launch so you end up having spare propellant and you can extend the mission. </p>
<p>Another thing that happens as satellites age is the degradation of solar panels and batteries. The solar panels lose efficiency when they are struck by radiation and cosmic rays.</p>
<p>Lastly sometime the mission duration is tied to the money needed to operate a satellite. To extend a mission you need money to pay the people in charge of the mission. The ground equipment can be very expensive too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Everything should last longer than planned or you've failed in your mission.   </p>
<p>The &quot;expected lifespan&quot; is the minimum.</p>
<p>Lasting far longer (Meteosat-7, Spirit, Opportunity and later Curiosity Mars Rovers) are real exceptions to the case, but every electronic device we launch into space on a rocket is expected to function beyond it's listed lifespan.</p>
<p>It's considered to have been worth the massive amount of money spent to make it if it functions properly up to that expected lifespan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what /u/electric_ionland has written,</p>
<p>When researchers say things like: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The satellite was supposed to stay in geostationary orbit for only 6 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They don't mean that at 6 years they expect it to come down, or at 6 years+1 day they expect it to fail. </p>
<p>It more precisely means that they anticipate 6 years of relatively consistent function and funding for the project (including personnel). It also means that after 6 years, the goals of the project can be considered &quot;met&quot;. </p>
<p>This is key because you always need to present a scientific justification for putting a satellite (equipped with specific sensors and capabilities) into orbit, so you need to be able to plan out what you're going to do with it. An anticipated 6-year lifespan means that they can plan experiments and analysis of data for 6-year (or less) experiments, but any project that requires 10+ years would be risky. For example, if they want to collect data on a specific comet or distant planet - the planetary body and satellite sensors need to be aligned during the timeframe of anticipated function. For multiple measurements, they need to be aligned multiple times. Or if you need weather data for X years in order to validate the &quot;fit&quot; of your statistical weather model, you need to ensure that you'll get X years, not X-2. If you'll only get X-2 years, you need to adapt your model or find an alternative data source as this is not one that can be counted on to give sufficient power. Logistics for &quot;competing&quot; projects need to be planned out so that the right measurements are made and data goes to the right people in a timely fashion.</p>
<p>In addition, they factor in anticipated technological advances on the ground. For example, a geosynchronous satellite launched 20 years ago may only be able to relay low-resolution static images, while a satellite launched today can relay high-resolution video. So the old tech may not have failed, but has outlived it's usefulness. </p>
<p>Funders (ex. governments) and leadership are willing to consider proposals launching a new satellite only after (1) the first one was actually useful, and (2) the agreed-upon timeline for technology upgrades is reasonably met.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Depression is like swimming in very heavy clothing.  It takes all of my energy to resist sinking so that I can keep breathing (i.e., take care of my most basic needs).  There isn't enough energy left to move in any direction.  Sometimes I can summon the energy to call for help; most of the time not.  Medication strips off some of the clothes but not enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(another one I have tried).  Depression is like feeling the misery from the worst experience you can imagine, without remembering what that experience was.  Like having total amnesia while still feeling massive shock from watching your house burn down with your loved ones inside, on the same day that you also got fired and discovered that you have a terminal illness.  You can't remember why, but you know that everything good in the world is gone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I ran into this a year or so ago, and to me, this is the simplest way I saw to describe it.  It doesn't start with &quot;Depression is like...&quot;, but I hope this helps. </p>
<p>&quot; I once tried to explain depression to someone as like if one day you gradually started to lose both your sense of taste and your ability to feel full. And you don’t know why, but now everything you eat tastes like mashed potatoes and nothing you eat is satisfying. You keep eating because you must eat to live, but the effort that it takes to prepare food is taxing and there is no pay off. You just know it will taste like mashed potatoes. You just know you will still be hungry. So you stop bothering with seasonings. Then you stop bothering to use ingredients you used to like. Then you start to wonder what the point of eating is because there is no payoff. You still feel hungry and you’re sick of the taste and you don’t know if you will ever enjoy food again and you don’t know why this is happening.</p>
<p>If someone comes up to you in this scenario and says, “Well have you tried spicing your food? Using different ingredients? Eating foods you used to love?” It isn’t necessarily helpful because the reason you stopped doing all that in the first place is that everything…tasted…like mashed…potatoes.&quot; -57circlesofhell, Tumblr</p>
<p>I get where you're coming from. I grew up in a religious household. I have depression that borders on manic. It was always demons taunting me, and If I just prayed, I'd get better. I tried to get help from my family, and my dad told me I was being a dramatic teenager, and my step-mom told me it was part of being a woman. Years later and no better, she asked if therapy would help and I asked her to give me a little bit to think about it because therapy would make my problem real, and something I had to actually deal with, and that scared me. When I came to her about it (a few hours later, mind you), she told me that therapists were scam artists, and that the Lord was the only one who could help me get better. </p>
<p>Again, I really hope that helped. It helped me when speaking to former partners. Some people just can't be convinced that it is a real disease and not just a bad day though. If you ever need to talk, just send me a message. I get on here fairly frequently, and make it a point to try and help others. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This David Foster Wallace quote: </p>
<p>The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn’t do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life’s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire’s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It’s not desiring the fall; it’s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don’t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You’d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.</p>
<p>Short version: like being trapped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mistake that led to Flint's toxic water was a water purification error that corrupted the actual <em>pipes</em> the water flows through. So the water itself can be perfectly clean, and on the way to your house, the pipes will leech toxic amounts of lead into it.</p>
<p>In order for Flint to repair its water problem, it has to replace all of the pipes in the city. This is really expensive and Flint doesn't have the money to do it. Most cities wouldn't have the money to do it, as they only budget for a certain percentage of pipes to be replaced and serviced every year.</p>
<p>The replacement cost has been estimated to be $60M and the project, to be fully completed, to take 15 years. There are about 29,000 pipes that need to be completed. They are focusing on the most at-risk homes first and several hundred have been completed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily an answer to this question but I wanted to chime in.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Flint Town. Mom worked downtown at UM Flint and I went there for a few years.</p>
<p>As far back as the 90s she would say that everyone in her office, at Water Street Pavillon, knew they were pulling water from the river. They stopped drinking it and making coffee with it. Several of the restaurants in the pavilion did too. The ones who didn't you could tell. Their pop/soda tasted like shit.</p>
<p>Whenever I would drink from a fountain on campus (we're talking back in like 01-03) it tasted absolutely god awful and had a yellow tint to it. Kind of tasted like dry wall.</p>
<p>I said all of that to say this - this wasn't a new problem.</p>
<p>It fit into a media cycle because the story was so bombastic and the state government made the choice to switch the city as a whole to that water only a few years ago. However, several places in Flint have been on that water since I was a kid.</p>
<p>We have always known that river was disgusting. No one ever wanted to get in it. We didn't really have any river-related activities in Flint that many people participated in. No one fished in it. No one swam in it.</p>
<p>As a matter of face, I remember when I was a kid and they drained a 1/4 mile portion of it. They pulled out several old cars, guns, knives, safe's, and other contraband. I think they even found human remains if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>Point being it's not like everything was fine in Flint and then BOOM all of the sudden the water is toxic. The river has always been shit and more and more businesses and municipalities have been getting their water from it to save money for years.</p>
<p>There should have been a clean up effort for the river LONG before this happened, and I mean 30-40 years ago. This river has been toxic and a danger since the first factory started draining their sludge into it a hundred years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
