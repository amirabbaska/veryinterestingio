		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly the universe is either finite or infinite, we don't know which.</p>
<p>If it's finite it either has borders or it doesn't, we don't know which.</p>
<p>You're assuming it has no borders. Meaning either it is infinite or it is finite but a closed loop. In other words the 3d shape of the universe curves through 4d space so that while the amount of space might be finite there is no edge.</p>
<p>If the universe is infinite then an object travelling forever in linear motion will just keep on getting further away.</p>
<p>If the universe is finite but unbounded then an object travelling forever in linear motion might eventually arrive back at its initial spot but it depends on the topography. You might end up three feet to your initial left and draw out an infinite but never-repeating spiral. There are lots of ways <a href="http://www.cut-the-knot.org/WhatIs/Infinity/Length-Area.shtml" target="_blank">to have an infinite curve on a finite plane</a></p>
<p>If the universe is finite and unbounded and topographically simple enough then yes object travelling forever in linear motion might eventually arrive back at its initial spot but the object might not have enough time to do so. Even if the object is a photon it can only travel at the speed of light and the distance it has to travel is unknown but has to be at least many hundreds of billions of light years. And it is not guaranteed that the universe will last hundreds of billions of years.</p>
<p>If the universe is finite and unbounded then the universe will probably end in a big crunch. How long this takes depends how big the universe is, but either way there probably isn't time to do a lap.</p>
<p>There's some theories that suggest that if there's enough dark energy in the universe then even if the universe is finite and unbounded the big crunch can still be avoided. So then we're racing against heat death. If the object is anything other than a photon it will decay within 10^100 years which might be enough time to do a lap of a small universe but nothing big, and even if its a photon it will decay (be annihilated) eventually.</p>
<p>Tl:dr depends how big and bendy your universe is but probably not.</p>
<p>Edits:</p>
<ul>
<li>thanks for gold</li>
<li>yes I meant topology, although I'm not 100% convinced that my usage of topography was totally wrong</li>
<li>I cheated/simplified a little by folding in the whole factor of if the universe is expanding and at what rate into the question of its infiniteness/shape but this doesn't make any substantive difference I can see to the answer to the question</li>
<li>Yes the universe probably is flat, and infinite/expanding so fast it is effectively infinite. But if that is the case then ops question becomes boring and trivial, so I'd rather explore some of the more interesting possibilities.</li>
<li>Thanks for all the comments, sorry I didn't reply to all of them but I tried to reply to most that weren't repeats. If I didn't reply to you it either means I missed you, I answered someone who was saying something similar, or your question had me so stumped I couldn't think of an answer.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a two-dimensional creature living in what it can only sense is a two-dimensional physical universe. What it cannot comprehend is that it actually lives on the surface of a massive three-dimensional sphere. It can never get to the center of its universe because the center is straight down, and up-and-down is a third physical dimension, one of which it is unable to comprehend because of its flat, two-dimensional nature. So, if it travels in a straight line (a great circle), it will return to the point of origin. And its universe is expanding, like a balloon blowing up. </p>
<p>I imagine the same is true of our universe, only with one extra dimension. We are three-dimensional beings living on the surface of a four+ dimensional universe (physicists posit that there are ten physical dimensions, but I have a hard time grokking it). So, if we travel in space in a single direction, we would also end up right back at Earth. And our universe is expanding with the center of expansion being along a dimension(s) of which we cannot conceive.</p>
<p><strong>Bonus mindfuck:</strong> As the two-dimensional creature's universe expands, the surface area of its universe increases. Each point on the sphere moves away from every other point on the sphere. New 2D space is created as the sphere expands. The same is true for our universe; as our three-dimensional universe expands, every point in space moves away from every other point, and new space is constantly being created.</p>
<p><strong>Super Bonus Mindfuck X-treme:</strong> &quot;Now&quot;...what you conceive of as the present moment...the center of your consciousness...is new time being created by the expansion of the universe in a similar way to how new space is being created.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If all we knew about the universe was that it has no boundaries, it would be impossible to answer your question. Maybe an object would return to its original starting place (if the universe is sufficiently small and doughnut or sphere like) or it would continue forever (if the universe is infinite).</p>
<p>But we do know more. Below I try to outline the logic best I can based on the evidence we have.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_expansion_of_space?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">We know, for example, that the universe is expanding at an ever-increasing rate.</a> So a star 90 billion lightyears away from us today will be further away in the future. </p>
<p>We also know the universe is a finite age: about 13.8 billion years. So a finite age, combined with a fixed speed of light means the universe <em>we can see</em> is definitely finite. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">It's the part of the universe from which light has had time to reach us in the last 13.8 billion years.</a> Since a point that was 13.8 billion lightyears away from us is now further away, due to expansion, the observable universe is wider than 13.8 billion lightyears. It's actually a sphere about 93 billion lightyears in diameter. </p>
<p>Finally, we know that, as best as we can measure, the curvature of space (as a <em>slice</em> of <em>spacetime</em>) is flat. Spacetime as a whole is curved, but a slice of space at a given time, on average over the whole universe that we can see is not. This tells us that the universe can have three shapes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Infinite and flat</li>
<li>The three-dimensional version of a doughnut, which can be flat (weirdly enough).</li>
<li>The three-dimensional version of a sphere, but <em>really</em> huge so that it looks flat to us. (Think about the surface of the Earth. From space it looks curved, but your bedroom looks flat.)</li>
</ol>
<p>In the case of scenario 1, you travel forever. In the case of scenario 3, the universe is already too vast, a spaceship could not beat the expansion.</p>
<p>In the case of scenario 2, however, it might be possible for a spaceship going in a straight line to return to its original position. It would have to be traveling fast enough to beat the accelerating expansion of the universe, however. We know the radius of this torus must be larger than the observable universe because otherwise we'd see that stars on one side of the sky are the same as on  the other side of the sky. (Since tests of this have been done.) I don't have the numbers at the moment, though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Stuff that would be important for early humans trying to stay alive and prove their worth as mates. If your dick is disproportionate, it doesn't impact those functions (unless it's just absurdly long, which is why there is an upper limit to what's possible), and for over 90% of human existence it didn't make a difference in your ability to have kids because it was the dudes who were the best at surviving who passed on their genes. Not the dudes who were the best at sex. Thus, we got a lot more variety in dicks than we got with most other body parts, because they didn't affect a dude's ability to not die or his ability to get laid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The variation is probably not as great as you may think, at least if you compare penis size to body mass, volume, or height. But aside from that, one of the biggest reasons for the variation of some traits - perhaps penis size, for instance - is a lack of, or very weak selection pressures. Although you may find some people to whom it matters, penis size really doesn't play a significant role at all when it comes to fitness. Evolutionarily speaking, fitness is defined as the ability of an organism to grow to maturity, reproduce, and have viable offspring. Penis size variation simply doesn't lead to that much variation in fitness. Even if there is a small number of annual births that occurred <em>only</em> because of penis size, the other factors affecting any one individual's reproductive fitness are likely making any selection for penis size rather insignificant.</p>
<p>This is why there seems to be such variation in height for modern males, particularly when compared globally. Male-female dichotomy for body size and canine size used to be significant, i.e. men used to be consistently significantly bigger than females, and had larger canines. This was when there was more male-male competition for mates, and more polygynous mating. You can still see this dichotomy in Gorillas and other of our ape relatives. After the move into modern times, selection pressures for large male body size and canine size were relaxed as things like weapons were invented and brain power became more important. As a result, the variation in male body size is quite large now, since the selection pressure has been relaxed, yet the genes for large bodies still exist in the population. Different ancestral human populations relaxed this selection pressure at different times, and so you can see more male-female dichotomy in certain groups of people than in others. Like how you see more variation in male body size in Northern Europeans than you do in East Asians. The Northern Europeans likely had to rely on larger bodies up until a more recent point in history.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Penises are a battleground. Just not for humans.</strong> tl;dr</p>
<p>Today I saw a math question tagged NSFW and a penis size question that is apparently family-friendly.</p>
<p>Kidding aside, I'd like to add a few notes to the excellent points raised by other posters. It's true that penis size in <em>humans</em> has not been selected for strongly, both because the size does not confer advantage, and because across its normal size range it does not confer a disadvantage.</p>
<p><em>But sex is what organisms live for</em>. Seriously. A living organism &quot;wants&quot; to spend the least amount of energy while passing along its genes most successfully.</p>
<p>So a lot of species out there <em>do</em> select for penises. Not just size but also function.</p>
<p>You hypothetical five-year-olds are in for a treat.</p>
<p><strong>Ducks</strong> [Slow-motion of duck penis](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch</a>? v=qwjEeI2SmiU) It's fast, it's corkscrewed, and it presented a <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2009/12/22/ballistic-penises-and-corkscrew-vaginas-the-sexual-battles-of-ducks/#.WGaD5RsrJEY" target="_blank">problem to researchers</a>. IIRC Dr. Brennan said that they switched to silicone fake vaginas because the glass vaginas would sometimes shatter.</p>
<p>And because ducks also need to fly, a lot of ducks lose weight after mating season by losing their penises. I lost my car keys this morning but it's hard to misplace a penis.</p>
<p><strong>Marine flatworms</strong> <em>Pseudobiceros bedfordi</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3xluIRh1Y" target="_blank">Penis fencing. En garde!</a> I love these guys. Hermaphrodites, chemosensing, lots of ovaries and a pair of penis-structures (stylets.) Making babies carries a necessary energy cost. Being a dad generally costs less, because dad can leave. Even in species that don't have parental care, laying eggs can be expensive. (Yes, this is a generalization, kids. You're five, I'm going to wave my hands a bit.)</p>
<p>When P. bedfordi meet, they rear up and each attempts to poke the other with a penis in a behavior termed &quot;fencing.&quot; If they make contact they will ejaculate onto the other's skin (syncytium, integument.) The ejaculator is male for today, the ejaculee is female. Sometimes they both hit home and play both roles.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter where the semen hits, because it will eat its way through the skin and the sperm will move toward one of the ovaries scattered throughout the body. These flatworms regenerate so the holes will be closed, but you can spot a newly expectant mom by her tattered appearance. Mom will soon lay fertile eggs.</p>
<p>But she has one more trick up her very strange sleeve. The ovaries are placed along her digestive canal. She recoups some of the energy cost by eating most of the semen.</p>
<p><strong>Cephalophods</strong> deserve special mention. These are squid, octopus, cuttlefish, argonaut, chambered nautilus. Their sperm are packaged into motile and mobile packets called &quot;spermatophores&quot; which burrow and move about like worms. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21834723" target="_blank">It can be a sushi hazard.</a> IIRC they're still not well understood. And anyhow they're delivered by a modified tentacle (hectocotylus) which, depending on the species, can be anything from an arm with a scoop shape and fewer suckers, all the way through a highly specialized bit that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonaut_\(animal\)?oldformat=true#Sexual_dimorphism_and_reproduction" target="_blank">detached and plugs the female's cavity.</a></p>
<p><strong>Speaking of plugs,</strong> there's a huge lot of adaptations designed to prevent sperm from leaking out of a female, or to prevent competitors from fertilizing a female, or to scrape out sperm deposited by a competitor who got there first.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of sneaky sex out there like the Midshipman fish type II male, and other kinds of reproductive strategies to make someone else bear the cost, like the varied shells of cuckoo eggs. There are also lots of other factors, such as how often do members of the species meet, like the angler fish, or whether their food supply has a boom and bust cycle.</p>
<p>I have to get some work done, but after a few beers I can go on for hours. It's even better with dry erase markers and a whiteboard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep.  The entire point of burying the tomb somewhere in the desert was to prevent thieves from raiding it.  They were deliberately concealed to make it harder to tomb looters to find.  This is part of the reason King Tut's tomb was so valuable - it was literally the only tomb that hadn't already been robbed.</p>
<p>Also, something to keep in mind is that the Egyptian civilization lasted around 3100 years (if you measure it from Narmer to Cleopatra VII).  That is a <em>long damn time</em> and the average person of that period was not exactly renowned for their skills in literacy.</p>
<p>A few more points:</p>
<p>(1) Tut reigned around 1300 BC.  That makes him older than the Trojan War, and people are still arguing over whether <em>that</em> was even a real thing.</p>
<p>(2) Tut was not &quot;the most important thing to any Egyptian.&quot;  The only reason we remember him today was because his tomb was recovered intact.  Tut was not an important King.  Compared to other pharaohs, he was practically a footnote.  The average Egyptian peasant probably didn't know, or even <em>care</em>, who he was or where he was buried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>War.</p>
<p>Empires transitioning/collapsing/being sacked/etc. was kind of a huge problem back before the printing press was invented. Books (the #1 method of remembering shit until fairly recently) were painstaking, expensive, and extremely time-consuming to make. And even then, with so many scribes that could be working, you have to consider how a massive majority of the industry revolved around printing one thing and really one thing only: religious texts. So, a lot of things that they needed more copies of may have been put on the wayside while they met demand for churches and other important organizations. The fact that the church had a huge control over literature for a long period didn't help with maintaining consistency either.</p>
<p>So 'alchemy' and chemistry formulas, like the true composition of &quot;Greek Fire&quot;, blueprints and building secrets, medical procedures, agricultural works, etc. etc. that were handmade, hand-copied, hand-bound, and kept mostly all in one place (large scholarly libraries, which were not very common...) would get lost by fire, theft, smashed into the rubble, or deliberately destroyed in order to keep the information out of the belligerents' hands (which is sort of okay if the guy who wrote or provided for it was still alive, which may not always be true). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>I was wondering about the failure mechanism of most of the drops. It seems like the drop weathered the bullet strike, but the force that it absorbed resulted in the tip of it breaking off somehow.

<p>Weight, on the other hand, is usually just a way to represent the mass of the object in terms easier for people to understand.  After all, these bodies are all in free fall, so their mass is the relevant metric.  This can be estimated by applying our general knowledge of the composition of celestial bodies, but it's also extremely common to measure the gravitational interactions between bodies to estimate their size - gravity is, after all, a product of mass.  When we describe a celestial body as &quot;weighing&quot; a certain amount, it's usually just what it would weigh in standard Earth gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given how far it is and how big it is in the sky we can find the volume of a star easily. It's just the volume of the sphere.</p>
<pre><code>
The mass of the star is a bit harder to find. Fortunately, stars lie in a (somewhat) narrow mass range depending on what type of star it is and what color it is (this is due to 5 very messy nested differential equations). If you are not familiar with the H-R graph, it plots the luminosity of a bunch of stars against its color. 

The actual calculation of the mass has a lot of assumptions and computational methods involved. Basically a main sequence star has three significant regions: the core, the radiative zone, and the convective zone. The central density and temperature of the core is assumed to be at a density and temperature range where Hydrogen (or helium) fusion is allowed (which is surprisingly narrow). The radiative zone and the convective zones both have a cut-off point. Using surface temperature, luminosity and a bunch of complicated math, we can figure out the change in density in radius, which we can then find the mass because we know the volume.

Again, most people just use a simplication because it turns out for at least for stars *in the main sequence*, the mass of the stars pretty much determines "what color/size/brightness" they are. This means we can guess how massive the star is just by its color. It makes sense since the way stars form are pretty standardized, and most of the variables regarding their creation are pretty unchanged except for mass. Think of starmaking as a stellar "machine" with one adjustable "knob".

Unfortunately, a lot of the variables themselves within the equations are assumed, like the central density of the star and the cutoff points of the zones. That's why we have such a high uncertainty for stellar masses.
</code></pre>
<p>It gets much easier if we have a star orbiting a &quot;standardized&quot; stellar object like a white dwarf, a neutron star or other &quot;stellar candles&quot;. This is because all we need to know about the system is the mass of the stellar object and its orbital mechanics. White dwarves and neutron stars are by &quot;design&quot; in a VERY narrow mass range. Their mass is also pretty easy to calculate, since they are usually elemental. We then use those stars to set &quot;standards&quot; for what each star of that specific color should be in the range of.</p>

<p>And the pain is not just from surgically repaired areas. Even the &quot;ole football&quot; type injures become sore as well. </p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There's no full agreement among scientists that weather causes pain, or if a specific mechanism is at fault, Jamison says. But there are plausible theories.</p>
<p>One leading theory points to changes in air pressure. Although many people say that their pain worsens with damp, rainy weather, research has shown that it's not the cold, wind, rain, or snow, Borenstein says. &quot;The thing that affects people most is barometric pressure.&quot;</p>
<p>Barometric pressure is the weight of the atmosphere that surrounds us.</p>
<p>If you imagine the tissues surrounding the joints to be like a balloon, high barometric pressure that pushes against the body from the outside will keep tissues from expanding.</p>
<p>But barometric pressure often drops before bad weather sets in. This lower air pressure pushes less against the body, allowing tissues to expand -- and those expanded tissues can put pressure on the joint. &quot;It's very microscopic and we can hardly notice, except that we have these sensations,&quot; Jamison says.</p>

<p>Most published studies seem to read more or less the same conclusion as this one : <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20570193/?i=5&from=/15229951/related" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/20570193/?i=5&from=/15229951/related</a></p>
<p>&quot;CONCLUSION: The studies to date do not show any consistent group effect of weather conditions on pain in people with RA. There is, however, evidence suggesting that pain in some individuals is more affected by the weather than in others, and that patients react in different ways to the weather. Thus, the hypothesis that weather changes might significantly influence pain reporting in clinical care and research in some patients with RA cannot be rejected.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm an air traffic controller and a big part of my job is controlling medevac helicopters transitioning through the airspace. We aren't supposed to give the aircraft altitude adjustments because if someone is bleeding in the aircraft, changing the aircraft's altitude a few hundred feet can mean the difference of a person remaining stable and a person bleeding out.  </p>
<p>This is sad when you think about helpless pilots in Afghanistan when they fly out of steep terrain. Those pilots know what's going on behind them and know that clearing the ridge by climbing 1,000 ft is going to kill his passengers.  </p>
<p>At my last base, we were one of the busiest airports for VFR traffic in the country, working 12-14 aircraft in a pattern was almost a daily occurrence(for tower, that's pretty damn busy).  I've had situations where we have been busy as shit and a medevac helo called needing to cut straight through my airspace with a critical casualty. I've made blanket broadcasts telling all the aircraft at once to change their altitude and 'race track' just so medavac can get through without any issues; it's that important that they don't climb.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barometric pressure.  Injuries never heal perfectly (yet).  When the barometric pressure changes, you are getting stretched or compressed.  The scar tissue does the same, but at a different rate than surrounding non-damaged areas.  That makes it hurt.  The greater the change, the more pain.  Once the barometric pressure stabilizes, the stretching and compressing stops and everything goes back to &quot;normal&quot;.  That's why it hurts before the storm, but not necessarily during or after...at least for me.</p>
<p>Arthritis works under a similar method.  Any currently inflamed tissue will ache because some level of damage is occurring - sort of like tugging at a big cut on your arm.  Leave it be and the pain will stop.  Keeping tugging and it will keep hurting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

No matter how perfectly you play, some games will force you to occasionally have to make a guess, as is the case in the image that I linked too.</p>
<p>If we can assume that we have a perfect player, who always makes the most highest probability selections (in other words, if there is a 100% &quot;safe&quot; square, it will always pick that before attempting to guess on a 50/50 safe square, and if there is a square that has a 2/3 chance of being safe, it will pick that before picking a square that has a 50/50 chance of being safe, then what would percentage of wins would the &quot;perfect player&quot; most likely approach?</p>
<p>Other assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The first click will never result in a mine exploding --&gt; the game is generated AFTER you click your first square.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mine placement is completely random, except for the first clicked square.</p>
</li>
<li>The Mines can not change position after the board has been determined on the first click.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can you describe this perfect play? In game theory, a solution to a game is optimal if it perfectly maximizes your chances of winning. But even coming up with a candidate solution for a game like Minesweeper is difficult. </p>
<p>Say your first click reveals a lone 1. What's the best way to proceed? Should you hunt down the 1? Should you click somewhere else randomly? Should it be a combination of the two? Can you generalize this into any scenario that requires guessing (e.g. a good strategy might have you only guess based on estimated probabilities of hitting a mine at a given spot, given known information about adjacent markers and the number of mines remaining in the game). How do you account for every kind of advanced technique, like looking at many adjacent markers to figure out which spots can or cannot have mines? You might not realize it, but there's a ton of complexity to this game, and even coming up with a good general strategy for playing Minesweeper would be difficult. Trying to prove your strategy was the solution would be even harder. Then and only then could you understand how often &quot;perfect play&quot; will succeed at the game. </p>
<p>For reference, in total there are (480 choose 99) or about 5.6x10^104 possible game boards. That's a lot of possibilities to account for - far too many to have a computer actually check them all. </p>
<p>EDIT: My scenarios clearly were too simplified (yes, you go for a spot adjacent to the 1), so try this one on for size. You've reached a scenario where you have to guess because there are no spots that can be determined as either 0% or 100% chance of a mine. Almost everyone so far has been fixating on probabilities, assuming that the optimal strategy will be to always guess at the least likely spot, because it has the least chance of blowing up and immediately ending the game. However, I suggest that sometimes, it will be better to guess at a higher-probability spot. What if one of those spots has a small chance of containing a mine, but clicking on it wouldn't reveal enough information to allow you to continue, so you'd then have to make another guess. Meanwhile, you could have originally chosen a more illuminating but higher probability spot. </p>
<p>In the first strategy, although you are always guessing &quot;optimally&quot;, you might be exposing yourself to unnecessary risk. The combination of multiple guesses might make you more likely to explode than taking the second strategy and making only a single, more effective, yet higher probability guess. </p>
<p>As a more concrete example, revisit the lone 1 scenario. Is it truly better to click on one of the adjacent tiles? Or is it better to click on a tile a short distance away in order to gain a better understanding of the game board? What nearby tile do you choose? Can you mathematically prove one or the other gives you better chances of success on average? </p>
<p>This is just one such complication. Yes, you could use a Monte Carlo approach to approximate the win percentage of a player who always chose the probability-optimal tile. But this won't necessarily constitute a solution to the game, as there are many other strategies which may beat this immediate optimum over the long run. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

People who play for speed always guess when it's faster - even if you could uncover tiles later that make the solution apparent. (source: my best time is 70)</p>
<p>Needless to say, the new version with a pop-up after every game is unplayable.</p>
<p>In order to have the best chance of winning, though, you couldn't simply rely on which square had the best odds.  Often times, if you say have a small square revealed or a wall going from one side of the board to another, the best 'odds' may be any square in the great grey sea.  But some of these squares will synergize better with the squares you've already revealed.</p>
<p>Also, it might be a technical note but in at least one version of the game, the board is generated before the click and is then possibly modified by the location of the first click.  A cheat that changes the upper-left pixel of the monitor demonstrates this.  I'm not sure how the new mine is chosen - randomly or the first available space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Two main reasons; weight and their skin. Sea mammals that don't normally venture on to land, like dolphins and whales, aren't built to carry their body weight and would get crushed under their own girth. For the ones small enough to survive their own weight for a bit, they still need to be kept wet and somewhat shaded as they can suffer burns or dehydrate quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
