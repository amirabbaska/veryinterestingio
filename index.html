		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple factors in play.</p>
<ol>
<li>Not all water sources are contaminated to the point that they will cause a problem for anyone, humans or animals. Most mammals have a highly developed sense of smell and they can smell water that is very bacteriologically active and they won't drink it. A muddy puddle is full of mud, but not necessarily anything else. Also, a lot of waterborne illnesses are simple bacterial infections that are inconvenient, but not deadly to animals or humans with functioning immune systems.</li>
<li>Animals gain resistance and immunity to waterborne pathogens in their area due to exposure over a lifetime. Notably, sudden changers in the pathogens in the water (often due to human activity) can kill large numbers of native wildlife.</li>
<li>Animals routinely <em>do</em> get sick from drinking contaminated water. Sick animals usually hide until they either recover or die, so you don't see them very often unless you know where to seek them out. (House pets like cats have this behavior mechanism, as well.)</li>
<li>In placental mammals, immunity gained by mothers can be passed along to offspring in a single generation. Certain genetic adaptions can also provide resistance or immunity to pathogens found in the animals' native environment. Animals who did not develop these immunities are often dead as of several generations ago.</li>
<li>Modern humans in developed areas have lived for many generations without having to worry about most waterborne pathogens, therefore we have bred the immunity for these pathogens out of ourselves. They are not a factor in survival and reproduction; Everyone survives and reproduces regardless of this factor. In areas without access to water of modern levels of cleanliness you will find resistance to the local waterborne pathogens in the population. Probably the example most familiar to people from the US is &quot;Montezuma's Revenge,&quot; illness northerners tend to contract from the water in Mexico. Mexicans are resistant/immune to it, people who are not regularly exposed to it are not.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit for further thoughts: All of these factors illustrate that, like many things in nature, the status quo is in fact a delicate balance of a combination of interrelated factors rather than a single simple mechanism. All of these act as a natural system of checks and balances that act to control populations of species by, yes, sometimes killing some of them. Upsetting one important factor among many can topple the entire web of interactions and result in the deaths of a lot of animals (or plants) or a permanent shift in which are the dominant species within an area. It goes without saying that most of the time this happens when we are able to observe it is due to human interference: A new foreign pathogen is introduced, animals are pushed away from their favored water sources by human development, parasites get moved from one location to another, etc. Natural disasters can have similar effects, too.</p>
<p>I've seen one or two comments suggesting gold for this post. If you're thinking about it, please don't. Reddit gold is ultimately pointless, and if those few bucks are really burning a hole in your pocket I suggest you donate them to some kind of wildlife or preservation charity instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have a ridiculously exaggerated understanding of the risk of contracting illness. In order to fall ill from dirty water, the contaminant has to actually be present in the bit of water you drink (it may not be mixed throughout it) in sufficient concentration. It has to survive your body's initial defences like stomach acid and proteases (another way of digesting and breaking down food, and also germs), and then take hold as an infection (in the case of germs - if the water is contaminated with heavy metals, say, this doesn't apply) and the infection needs to go unchecked by your immune system long enough that it presents as an illness. None of these stages are guaranteed, but there is a perception, presumably because in developed countries pretty much no-one drinks anything but clean water, that a single drop will make you ill.</p>
<p>Worldwide, 1.8 <em>billion</em> people only have access to unsafe, potentially contaminated water. They die from waterborne illnesses at a vastly greater rate than we in developed nations do, yes, but they are not in danger of extinction. Many people contract illnesses when young, fight them off, and gain immunity, as other people have said. Many infections are just asymptomatic - the infectious agent never takes hold enough to cause illness, or is of a strain which is less harmful.</p>
<p>EDIT: just in case it wasn't clear, this is not a good reason to drink dirty water. It's dangerous, just not as dangerous as a lot of people think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In part it's immunity gained by getting ill once, or a few times and surviving it. The immune system remembers what foreign organisms it encountered before and fights them a lot faster and efficiently when an infection happens again (with exceptions from the rule, not all pathogens produce a lasting immunity). </p>
<p>In part it's evolution at work. The wolf that couldn't handle half-rotten meat simply didn't live long enough to reproduce. Disadvantages like that get culled very quickly in nature. Most people living today have a genetic immunity to illnesses that were devastating a few generations earlier. The Spanish Flu wouldn't be as bad today as it was 1918 because we're the descendants of the survivors.</p>
<p>If there are few water sources, then those have an advantage who can use even the dirtiest puddle without major consequences. </p>
<p>But, you also only see the animals drinking, not hiding in the undergrowth puking their souls out, or dying prematurely from infections and poison. Just because they drink something doesn't mean it's automatically ok for them to do so. If there's nothing better to be had, they'll go for it and hope for the best, not like they can go to the next convenience store and buy a bottle of water instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would refute the top comment on this post. The largest part of our innate immunity (that which defends us all the time in regards to pretty much all organisms) is our natural flora- or basically the bacteria in our colon. Yes, our immune system interacts and accepts this flora but that's above the ELI5. Everyone has different ratios and compositions of this flora. However, in some regions of the world, some humans have similar species profiles of flora.  </p>
<p>For instance- think of Montezuma's revenge. This is a bacteria commonly found in water in Mexico that American's don't encounter. When the American guy (gut, but what a funny autocorrect) encounters this bacteria it causes diarrhea. When Mexican's drink it, it doesn't because this bacteria is already in their gut and they live with it, and it doesn't cause any problems!!  </p>
<p>There are some fun flora profiles that scientists are experimenting with right now that protect against certain diseases and provide unique amounts of nutrition to people in food-scarce environments. There even is a c-dif treatment called a fecal transplant where they take someone's poop that has awesome flora makeup and stick it in your colon to try and reset your floral makeup.  </p>
<p>Also: you have to get ENOUGH of the bacteria in you to get sick. Your body can handle small amounts of certain deadly or non-beneficial organisms. You eat bacteria in meat all the time. Some people are seemingly immune to food poisoning when others get sick. Maybe they are one less taco, maybe they ate their boogers as a kid because staph is commonly in the nose and staph is the MC food poisoning bug. Shigella is well known as a bug that has a very low threshold for infection, with some estimates placing the number of bugs needed to ingest for infection around 10!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many are mentioning expsoure immunity, which is part of the case, as is evolutionary selection for ability to survive it.</p>
<p>But also important is simply a higher social tolerance for death rates.  Animals die all the time from this sort of thing - when you read about a flock of birds suddenly falling dead; or go out and see a bunch of carcasses around some water that looks a lot dicey.  In nature, drinking whatever water you find might give you some death rate (say 1-10%) which your species can survive.  Among humans, we'd notice and worry about that.  If your species does better on average by drinking whatever water is there and losing some fraction of the population (as opposed to limiting your population size to only safe water) then evolution might move you in that direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The button <em>is</em> the sensor. </p>
<p>See this paragraph from Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Touch ID is built into the home button, which is built of laser-cut[9] sapphire crystal, which does not scratch easily (scratching would prevent Touch ID from working).[10] It features a stainless steel detection ring to detect the user's finger without pressing it. The feature does not work without contact with this ring. There is no longer a rounded square icon in the home button, nor is it concave.
The sensor uses capacitive touch to detect the user's fingerprint.[10] The sensor has a thickness of 170 µm, with 500 pixels per inch resolution. The user's finger can be oriented in any direction and it will still be read.[2] Apple says it can read sub-epidermal skin layers,[11] and it will be easy to set up and will improve with every use.[9] The sensor passes a small current through one's finger to create a &quot;fingerprint map&quot; of the user's dermis. Up to 5 fingerprint maps can be stored in the Secure Enclave.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone has fingerprints, the loops and swirls you can see looking at your finger, and everyone's loops and swirls are different. Those loops and swirls are caused by part of the skin being higher and lower than each other. The button on the phone has a sensor, a thing that takes measurements, inside that can sense fingerprints by using a tiny amount of electricity, similar to when you run across the carpet in socks, touch door knob, and there is a spark, you are acting like the phone and the door knob is like your finger. You have electricity and it moves from you to the door knob. On the button, you don't feel it because it is so tiny, but it can feel the loss of electricity, much like you do when you touch the door knob. Except the button on the phone can see more  see all of the points where there was and wasn't contact with your finger. On the button, the electricity is picked up by the raised part of your fingerprint, the lower part doesn't get it. Knowing where the electricity was picked up from and where it wasn't, let's the button see what your fingerprint looks like. It does this by using a bunch of tiny squares called a grid and recording which squares lost power and which squares didn't. The first time you do it, it the button learns what your finger looks like, and the phone remembers that. Then when you or someone else touchs the button, it takes what it sees and sends it to the phone that asks if what the button just saw is the same as what it remembers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My answer from that thread:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the kid wants to be comfortable, and the water doesn't.  </p>
<p>Deadweight, like the water, is harder to carry because it doesn't do anything like, say, maintain it's own center of gravity---or, in the case of an older kid, actually hold on to you, thus distributing the weight across more of your muscles.  </p>
<p>As a result, you need to use your own power to do all the little things necessary to keep the weight oriented they way you want it to be oriented.  That makes it seem heavier.  The water might slosh around or get slightly off center from how you are carrying it some other way, and you then have to consciously or sub-consciously correct it.  The kid, on the other hand, probably wants to stay generally upright and generally in the same place/orientation as after you lifted them, taking that pressure off.*</p>
<p>*assuming not a toddler. Their weight is effectively quintupled from sheer madness. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you truly concerned with picking up the weight as much as holding the weight because there is a difference? And the method of picking up the weight will make a big difference.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you pick the up either the child or dumbbell with extended arms and hands it will seem to weight more than if you picked it up by hugging it. Hugging it has less impact on your arms and hands.</li>
<li>If you pick the up either the child or dumbbell with either extended arms and hands or by hugging it will seem lighter if you stoop down with bended knees than if you were bent over at the waist. Thus more parts of your body help to lift the weight.</li>
<li>As a tall slender mass, the child's weight is unevenly distributed, with the bulk of it in the torso, and can help support and balance his/her own weight, unlike a dumbbell of equal weight that is compact and is unable to help support its own weight.</li>
<li>The child is a tall slender object that can be held snug to your body with your arms wrapped around the child, which makes supporting the weight easier than holding in equal weight in a different shaped mass in your extended hands. And the child can hug you to help support the weight.</li>
<li>If you carried the child on your shoulder or back he or she would seem even lighter because doing so makes the child's weight part of your own weight and balance system.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers, but none seem to have mentioned an important factor: isolation. </p>
<p>When you do a bicep curl with a dumbbell, good form helps you use only your bicep, so you can specifically challenge that muscle. You intentionally minimize involvement of your triceps, pecs, delts, etc. Similarly for most other simple free weight motions. </p>
<p>When you reach down to pick up a child, you're making a complex movement and aren't intentionally isolating any one muscle. You recruit a bunch of muscle groups to share the load, and it feels easier. </p>
<p>Unless it's an angry toddler - then their bones just turn to jelly and suddenly all their squirmy uneven weight is focused on a muscle you didn't know you needed! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because of the weight distribution, when you're holding a child your bringing it closer to your center of gravity, and making your body more stable this stability allows for less work to be done in muscles of your body . If you were to hold the child like you hold a dumbbell you would find that they feel about the same. This is the same reason why grocery bags feel insanely heavy, because often times you're holding them at an awkward angle away from your center of gravity. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.4550" target="_blank">This is a relevant paper</a>. The flow of granular objects is very different from the flow of a liquid in terms of underlying mechanics (e.g., pressure vs. friction). So determining the flow rate is not a trivial matter. What follows is a short paraphrasing of a relevant section of the paper.</p>
<p>Dimensional analysis can get you a rough relation for the flow rate. For simplicity, suppose our &quot;hourglass&quot; is a right circular cylinder filled with sand, which flows out through a small hole punched in the bottom of the cylinder. There are ostensibly (at least) 5 parameters that enter the flow rate: the diameter of the cylinder (<em>D</em>), the height of the sand (<em>H</em>), the diameter of the hole (<em>r</em>), the diameter of each grain (<em>a</em>), and the local gravitational acceleration (<em>g</em>). </p>
<p>It turns out that experimentally you can determine that if <em>H</em> is large compared to <em>D</em> and <em>r</em> is large compared to <em>a</em>, then the flow rate is independent of all our parameters except <em>r</em> and <em>g</em>. By dimensional analysis, the speed <em>v</em> of the grains as they exit the hole must be proportional to (<em>gr</em>)^(1/2). The flow rate is proportional to this speed times the cross-sectional area, hence proportional to <em>vr</em>^(2) ~ g^(1/2)r^(5/2).</p>
<p>The time it takes for an hourglass to empty is inverse proportional to the flow rate, hence proportional to g^(-1/2)r^(-5/2). So, for instance, if a certain hourglass measures time <em>T</em> on Earth, it will measure 6^(1/2)<em>T</em> on the Moon (because the Moon's gravity is about one-sixth that of Earth). Hence a 1-minute timer on Earth becomes about a 2.5-minute timer on the Moon.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Flow rate = Q ~ g^(1/2)r^(5/2), Total time = T ~ g^(-1/2)r^(-5/2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider this: how long would it take in zero gravity? Infinite time right? So now we have two data points, one in 1g, and one in 0g. Now based on those two alone we see that there does appear to be a relationship between gravity and hourgalss time, and a seemingly exponential one at that. Nothing better than a little thought experiment!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Non scientific but logical answer.  Since nothing falls at zero gravity everything will fall slower at lower gravity, meaning then that the hourglass would have to be calibrated for a specific gravity. In turn then, an hourglass calibrated at sea level would be inaccurate at high altitudes. FWIW, Captain Morgan has helped me see the gravity of this situation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

There is a quantity known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicity_(particle_physics\)" target="_blank">helicity</a> which is the projection of the spin  onto the direction of linear momentum. This is conserved.  The spin of the photon can only be parallel or anti-parallel to the momentum, it can't be perpendicular to the direction of motion.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is generally believed that people having kids is helpful to a society. It creates the next generation of consumers/taxpayers, for example. </p>
<p>Having kids is also generally costly.  The idea of tax benefits for people who have kids is that it represents an offset of the cost to the individual of having the kids, giving them a slightly larger share of the wider societal benefit of having kids that they can't individually capture. </p>
<p>Marriage is similar, though more debatable and less direct.  There are many who argue that marriages, especially stable ones that produce kids, tend to create &quot;stronger&quot; or better ordered societies.  However, at least in the U.S. so far as I know, most of the tax &quot;benefits&quot; of marriage tend to be more about the weirdness of people having combined incomes---more an after effect then a genuine &quot;incentive.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There aren't tax incentive for married people. If there is a wide range in income between the two, or if one is a stay-at-home parent, then the tax bracket would be different for married couple and they might save. So if you had a husband who made $100k while the wife stayed home, then he'd see lower taxes on his income filing as married than before. But if they each made $50k before getting married, they'd see no difference in taxes filing jointly.</p>
<p>As for kids, there are deductions for each member of the household because presumably it costs more to feed, clothe, house more people so the same person supporting 4 people on $100k pays less in taxes than the single person earning $100k.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You really don't get an objective benefit on taxes for being married. You just file differently. Sometimes that benefits families sometimes it doesn't. The government does this because married people sometimes live off the income their partner makes without generating any themselves. That is not a bad thing but it needs to be handled different.</p>
<p>The tax break for kids is because kids cost money but do not generate money however kids are IMMENSELY valuable to society as a whole because they are the future, literally. The tax break is to try and even the playing field and reward the parents for contributing to the future of the country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There are three solutions:</p>
<p>1) Watch them die.</p>
<p>2) Give them aid.</p>
<p>3) Help their parents.</p>
<p>In the US, tax filers who make less than $3000 in a year receive no tax credit (they cannot care for themselves or their children independently, so they are assumed to use the care of others or the government).  Tax filers who make more than $150,000 also receive no tax credit.  They are assumed to have enough resources to care for any number of children they may have. Those in between get $1000 credit per child.</p>
<p>When you don't have children, giving you a tax credit does nothing to address child poverty.  It has nothing to do with encouraging fertility.  You will not find parents who decided to have children because they could take advantage of $1000/year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The principle of thermodynamics at play here is that heat flows from high temperature systems to low temperature system. The flaw with your reasoning is that you are simply forgetting this idea. </p>
<p>If you start a container just large enough to contain the liquid, so that there is no vapor phase, and then you increase the size of the container, then a vapor phase will occupy the new volume. Initially this vapor phase will have a higher temperature than the liquid, but over time the vapor phase will exchange energy with the liquid, and the temperature of the two phases will equilibrate. </p>
<p>The other thing you could image is that instead of increasing the size of the container by a finite amount, you take away the walls of the container completely. In this case the vapor phase flies away to infinity and so is not in thermal contact with the liquid. In this case, the two phases really have different temperatures, but this is allowed by thermodynamics because the two phases are not in thermal contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When dealing with laws of thermodynamics and temperature you cannot deal with individual particles. Any liquid or gas has a variety of particles with different energy states. The temperature is a statistical sample of these.</p>
<p>If you have a sealed container with vapour above a liquid, once equilibrium is reached they are at the same temperature because that is what equilibrium means. No net energy is transferred between them (or more accurately they both add the same amount to each other).</p>
<p>If you suddenly made the container bigger, the available space would increase, the gas would expand and pressure would drop in the gas. This would allow for more evaporation and cooling until a new equilibrium is reached. The overall system would have the same energy less the energy required to expand so would overall be slightly cooler but the gas and liquid would still reach equilibrium.</p>
<p>Perhaps a reason for the confusion is that &quot;temperature&quot; is not really a measure of the amount of energy something has but more a measure of the direction of heat flow in relation to something else. </p>
<p>What you are thinking about is similar to Maxwells Demon. There are several youtube videos that would explain this better than I could.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The banks went after Target and got some of their money back while insurers took out the rest.</p>
<p>What's left is the punitive damages for the negligence with personal credit data. Those fines are up to governments to levy. It's designed this way so companies like Target invest in data protection. If there were no fines, they would just save the money and leave your data unprotected. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The State (via police and other gov't agencies) had to commit time to help people and 'clean up the mess'.</p>
<p>Sometimes its just simply hush money... agree to pay the State so they don't look to hard at the inner workings of how the breach occurred.</p>
<p>I work at a Fortune 50 retailer and while on paper we are PCI compliant, I know that we do things that the processors say were not supposed to.. like keep CC numbers and CVS codes.  While there are some gray areas CC numbers can be stored but must be encrypted.  Well, if every CC en encrypted with the same key or hash its significantly less secure than a unique key for each card.  So while we follow the letter of the rules we really don't do it the right or best way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

It is also possible that laws in these states allow the state to sue directly rather than people for various reasons (maybe the individual harms are too small to justify individuals suing, or false suits were seen as too common).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the things that &quot;Fun&quot; is, is being able to predict a result, and see that prediction be validated. </p>
<p>As a child, they're still learning a lot of things, so much is not understood and unpredictable.  A movie or a show gives them the ability to think about what is going to happen, and then have the show confirm the result. </p>
<p>As an adult, we have learned a lot of things.  Our ability to predict the result is not fun because it's not surprising.  The kids shows are simple and predictable, and the joy that we get from confirmation of that prediction is minor because it's a certainty.  </p>
<p>As an adult, I find myself watching the same shows with my daughter over and over.  I find myself looking for details, whether it's trying to build a map of the island in my head in Puffin Rock, or pick out the individual theme songs of the various creatures in Dinosaur Train.  Or finding patterns that show changes in the show's production.  I do this because I'm searching for fun, though it's a bit more work on my behalf, but it's essentially the same thing that my daughter finds fun in on the surface.  </p>
<p>I have a method of guessing what the result is going to be.  I know early in the season the production is less regular about playing the theme music for the characters, but has more location and mood based music, while later in the season the character music is dominant, less music is written, and it's generally more thematic.  So early in the season they have music for watching the sun set or walking around on the train, or exploring a new place.  Later in the season the music follows the person talking, or it's the intro theme to the type of story it is (under the sea for instance), but you rarely see music that imparts mood or minor activities, and there's less music written for a specific incident in a single episode. </p>
<p>I like watching shows with my daughter, I've never been the person to just sit her down in front of the TV and go and do my own thing.  This means I get to see this, and struggle to find something that interests me.  But I still do the same thing, recognize the pattern, predict the result, and feel good when I'm right.  For my daughter, it's the same, but the pattern that she recognizes is trivial to me.</p>
<p>I think it's very similar to how you develop a taste for music.  If you're unfamiliar with a genre of music, it's the more 'pop' type of music that is appealing. The more popular music is generally simpler, so the patterns are easy to see and predict and get validation for quickly.  These kinds of songs are catchy and easy to sing along to even the first time you hear them.  It's kind of fun when a song has a part that you can sing along to, because you can quickly make the prediction that the next verse is going to sound like this one, and get validated.  You're smart, you figured out the pattern.</p>
<p>But as you get more interested in the genre, that catchy music gets dull.  It's predictable. It's boring.  There are other genres of music that have more complex elements to them, but which are common to the genre or the artist. You start to learn these elements and can predict them, and that's exciting and fun, and you're understanding it in a deeper way than you could before.  As you get deeper into the understanding of these mechanics, you start to appreciate things that a naive observer wouldn't even have the basis to understand.  </p>
<p>This results in things like appreciation of art that is like 4 bands of color but people are willing to buy it for 75 million dollars.  Because the people who are looking at it and appreciating it have so much more background that they're using to evaluate the piece.  The naive observer can't start to even relate to the people who love it.  At the same time, the people who love it can't really relate to the people who appreciate much more accessible amateur art. </p>
<p>The child likes the same movie every day because there's a lot for them to get out of it.  </p>
<p>The adult is just way past the child in terms of what is filtered out and what is remembered and how easily it's remembered, and how predictable the outcomes of the characters in a children's show will be that they run out of that excitement quickly, and essentially can't appreciate it at the same level as a child. </p>
<p>In the same way, many adult shows, with their level of complexity and nuance, can be very boring and confusing to a child because they don't have the tools to learn and make these predictions and be rewarded for them. </p>
<p>Layering it can help.  For instance, if my daughter were to watch a television show that had in the background a bit of a backstory that took a bit of work to put together, created out of hints and things at the periphery of the action, then it would be kind of fun to watch it over and over.  The first time through the series you might pick up on some of those subtleties, and then over the course of watching it a few times you might be able to put together what's really going on behind the scenes.  Meanwhile, the child might not even be aware of that deeper story, they can enjoy the basic story. </p>
<p>Peppa Pig does this a bit by cheekily using Ms. Rabbit for pretty much every odd job out there.  In something like Paw Patrol, my wife and I have made up backstories to explain away Ryder's resources, and Mayor Goodway's incompetence.  One idea is Ryder is a juvenile god who is practicing at creating his own world. Another is that it's a bit of a Coma dream where Ryder fell into a coma during the messy divorce of his parents, represented by Mayor Goodway and Mayor Hummdinger. </p>
<p>But what I'm searching for by playing these little games and taking note of these meta-details is basically the same thing as my daughter gets.  And it's a lot of the same types of content that is directly served to me by a show like Westworld.</p>
<p>Note that some of the movies or shows that you as an adult might like to watch multiple times are typically because there are new things you might learn every time you watch them.  Consider also that kids are just a lot less skilled at picking up on those things in the same way, so they can watch the same thing over and over and continue to build on their understanding of it. </p>
<p>It's not every video.  Give a child a show that is a simple 3 minute video and try and have them watch it every day for an hour.  You'll still have a hard time keeping their attention for the first hour.  They'll get bored because there's nothing new for them to figure out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every top-level post seems to either describe others doing the same thing, or guess.</p>
<p>Here's the current, scientific understanding - excuse me, my 5yo friend, here's what scientists tell us.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/never-ending-story-how-repetition-helps-a-childs-vocabulary-2220647.html" target="_blank">Young kids learn best this way!</a> It's fun, but it also allows them to repeat things until they sink in. Lots of fun play is really just practicing skills you'll need as a grownup!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.parents.com/toddlers-preschoolers/development/behavioral/why-toddlers-love-repetition/" target="_blank">Also, they are learning how to control their world.</a> With storybooks, they are learning how the pictures tell the story, and before they start reading they discover that those funny groups of ABC shapes <em>mean</em> something special to Mommy and Daddy. Of course, nothing ever changes with videos - except it does! They can notice new things. Ever watch a movie, and not realize something that went on in the background, or miss a character's quick reaction until the second viewing? Little kids are doing that, only with the main character's exaggerated reactions. They're absorbing social and emotional clues from the &quot;people&quot; on the video. But since they aren't as good at it as older kids, they keep practising. So, they're not directly learning to control their world, but they are studying how others provide important clues to what others are thinking and feeling.</p>
<p>This can be taken to an extreme. The great animal researcher Dr. Temple Grandin is autistic, and in her autobiography she says the other kids called her &quot;tape recorder&quot; because she would repeat a single phrase over and over and over and over - any phrase. She wasn't &quot;dumb&quot;; as an autistic person emotional clues in voice inflections were especially hard for her to understand, and she <em>might</em> have been rehearsing the word, trying to find clues to those emotions she had problems detecting.</p>
<p>Finally, the kid's show <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue%27s_Clues" target="_blank">Blues Clues was based on this research</a>. The originators learned that kids learned best with lots of repetition, and proposed a kind of kid show that would repeat the exact same episode every day for a week. Kids could tune in on Tuesday through Friday, and practice everything they learned on Monday. It was a HUGE hit because of this! Little kids loved it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Young children love repetition, whether it's watching a video or listening to song lyrics, because it's the best way for them to acquire and master new skills. In order to learn something well, children this age practice it until they get it right, hence the repeated watching.</p>
<p>What is your child practicing by repeatedly watching a video? It depends on the video, of course, but it could be that he doesn't yet understand the story line. And the more he watches, the better he's able to understand. Maybe he's fascinated by programs that feature songs and dancing and wants to practice the movements while singing along. Young children are almost always in the process of mastering basic skills while they play.</p>
<p>Once your child has mastered a video's dialog or song lyrics or movements, he/she wants to celebrate his/her success by participating in what he's/she's seeing, so he/she'll continue to watch. She/He'll probably announce the next plot sequence or song (in his head or out loud); for children this age, making correct predictions is the ultimate form of mastery. Since life is fairly unpredictable for them, they especially relish feeling competent and in control of what's coming next.</p>
<p>Soon they see it and recognize it from the diaspora of the rest of their experience.  That feeling of recognition is comforting because the brain wants it that way.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have worked with kids before, and my wife is a preschool teacher/has a college education about this, so I have a little more experience than most seeing a wide variety of kids learning.</p>
<p>I think you and some of the other commenters have hit the nail on the head with the repetition idea - kids have this innate desire to master and learn skills, and one of the best ways is to repeat over and over and over (i.e. learning numbers, times tables, etc.). What I would add is that many people forget what it was like to be 5, and what your attention span was like. Kids sit down to watch a movie, and it takes them more time to absorb and think through reactions. One of the key skills they are learning here is cause and effect: this character did this, so this happened.  By the time these connections are made, the movie has moved on, or an exciting scene happened that made the child lose their grasp of what was going on, etc.</p>
<p>It is actually pretty easy to test this: ask a kid about a movie they just saw for the first time, and what it was about. Most of the time, they can tell you vaguely what happened, or some of the major story points, but often they can only repeat their favorite actionish parts, or little bits that they remember. </p>
<p>Ask them about a movie they have watched more, and often they can tell you more and more connected plot points, or actually tell you the story of the movie. They will even use the word &quot;because&quot; more - Nemo's dad goes to find Nemo BECAUSE Nemo got stolen by a boat, and the sharks attack BECAUSE of the blood.</p>
<p>Another key element is that kids don't have the mental shortcuts  and patterns stored that adults do, and so they have to learn everything as a new pattern. To take the Finding Nemo example above: Kids don't know that blood draws sharks. In that scene, even though an adult can look at that and either know what is happening, or guess from context clues, a kid doesn't have that same frame of reference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's add the fact that children don't have as strong a concept of &quot;time&quot; as an adult does, nor enough experiences to compare and contrast, so they don't easily experience the thought of &quot;let's move on, I've seen this before and there's other things to do&quot;.</p>
<p>When you're a child, you don't really realize that there's been thousands of movies and television shows/episodes created since the advent of these technologies in the previous century.  You just know, &quot;Hey, there's that brightly colored show with the animated animals that make me laugh, let's see that!&quot;  And since your perception of time is slower as a child, a movie or TV show will make for an awesome afternoon.  You don't (or rarely do) hear kids say, &quot;well, there's an hour I'll never get back&quot; when bored by some experience, that's because adults are more likely to be aware of time spent during an activity -- the kid either knows bored or non-bored, for the most part.</p>
<p>As an example, I saw the Star Wars something like twelve times in the theater, Empire Strikes back another four to seven times, and Return of the Jedi probably five times.  As much as I love Star Wars, I've only watched the following movies once in the theater each (at most, some I believe I waited for video but memory escapes me there), with a follow up viewing when friends wanted to re-watch it to refresh their memory for the upcoming movies.  Why?  Because 90-120 minutes of my adult time is viewed as much more valuable and not worth spending on a repeat activity.  There are still things I'll gladly re-watch, but it takes time for the desire to return, not a matter of days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
