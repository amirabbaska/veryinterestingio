However that's not a strict mathematical derivation of the fact, that's common sense (and woe is he who trusts it). The proof is in the form of a statistical (thermodynamical) analysis which shows that for large objects quantum mechanics tends towards classical mechanics.</p>
<p>Having that said, the fact that there is sound for example (or perhaps better: quantized electrical conductivity) shows that quantum effects can still be seen at these scales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The behaviour of some systems is chaotic, which means that even very small changes to the starting conditions may lead to big differences in outcome. </p>
<p>Unfortunately Heisenberg's uncertainty principle means that we can't measure all the parameters we'd need accurately. This means that, even with infinitely fast, infinitely accurate computers, our predictions could still be wrong, because we lack the required input data (and fundamentally cannot acquire it). </p>
<p>The best we could do in principle would be to Monte-Carlo simulate a lot of start cases that are within the measurement error and look at the range of possible outcomes. </p>
<p>In practice, we don't have infinitely fast / accurate computers, nor do we have the ability to measure millions of particles to the Heisenberg uncertainty limit, so we are much worse off than that theoretical best case. </p>
<p>Fortunately, many systems are not chaotic, which means that roughly-right inputs give roughly-right outputs. That's why we can predict many physical phenomena (just not all). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there's a reasonably well understood thing called quantum decoherence which rather precisely describes how &quot;quantumness&quot; tends to be lost to the environment over time due to inevitable interactions between the system you are interested in and the rest of the universe, particularly the immediate environment. Very small numbers of quantum particles are easier to isolate from their environment whereas larger numbers of particles presumably are more difficult to &quot;contain&quot; thereby losing their coherence i.e their quantumness more readily. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the contrary, I'd say that there is a rule, or principle of physics, that the laws of particle physics do scale up to macroscopic systems. That doesn't mean that we are able to compute the behavior of macroscopic systems from the Standard Model, just that if we were able to do so, and it didn't match the actual behavior of those systems, we would assume that there is an error in the Standard Model.</p>
<p>That could be wrong—it wouldn't be the first time that a seemingly sacrosanct principle of physics was overturned—but everyone works under the assumption that it's true as long as there's no evidence that it isn't.</p>
<p>We actually have a fairly good understanding of how macroscopic classical behavior arises from quantum rules. Quantum probability averages out to classical probability in incoherent systems (systems where the phases of the quantum amplitudes are random). The technical reason for this is that if you add two quantum amplitudes, a+b=c, the law of cosines says that |a|² + |b|² + 2|a||b| cos φ = |c|², where φ is the relative phase of a and b. If φ is random, the expected (average) value of cos φ is zero, so you get |a|² + |b|² = |c|² on average, which is the classical rule. Macroscopic systems inevitably become incoherent through interaction with the environment, via blackbody radiation if nothing else. This is why macroscopic quantum phenomena like superfluidity require very cold temperatures—warmer objects emit too much blackbody radiation. High temperature superconductivity is not well understood, but there must be a kind of natural insulation of certain parts of the superconducting medium from others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Yet nitrogen is arguably one of the very most prevalent and important components of nutrition for most organisms on the planet (in my understanding?). </p>
<p>So how do organisms break that triple bond in order to render nitrogen reactive enough to bond with other elements? </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that certain soil bacteria break N2 down using an enzyme called nitrogenase.  It catalyzes the reaction:</p>
<p>N2 + 6 e^- + 6 H^+ --&gt; 2 NH3</p>
<p>This is a thermodynamically favorable reaction, but it is very slow due to the strength of the nitrogen triple bond, which has to break on the way to forming ammonia.  The active site of nitrogenase contains a large iron sulfur cluster that serves as a powerful and fast source of electrons to make this reaction happen.  At the same time, to maintain charge balance, amino acids near the N2 binding site quickly deliver the hydrogen ions that name up the rest of the reaction.  Overall, we call reactions like these proton coupled electron transfer, or PCET.</p>
<p>The trick in this reaction is that every time you give an electron to N2, its bond gets weaker.  This is due to the increasing population of electrons in what are called antibonding orbitals.  Consequently, if you add 6 electrons to N2, the bond gets completely negated.  Maintaining charge balance through proton delivery makes the injection of additional electrons much easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It needs to be in a bioavailable form such as NH3, which as already mentioned, can be created by some bacteria. The other way is through lightning but it's not nearly enough to support the amount of people and food we grow now. The Haber-Bosch process converts atmospheric N2 with hydrogen to generate ammonia for large-scale fertilizer production. This allowed us to dramatically increase the productivity of land to grow more food and populations. Now some 80% of nitrogen in the human body originated from this process. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Nitrogen is one the most abundant molecules in the atmosphere and necessary for plant metabolism, yet most plants are incapable of obtaining usable nitrogen due to its diatomic state. In a given environment, you'll more often than not find a fungi/plant mutualistic relationship where the fungi (most often rhizobium) will be living at the roots of a plant. The fungi will break down the nitrogen and exchange it with the plants' roots for sugar!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to everything else already mentioned, dictators keep themselves in power by spending enormous resources on propaganda (and censorship) to keep individuals who hate the government from realizing they're not alone.</p>
<p>If you hate the government enough to want to act, but fear that you are alone and therefore essentially powerless, you're probably going to keep your head down and grudgingly obey. If you realize that <em>everyone</em> feels that way, well, if <em>everyone</em> revolts, the dictator is in deep trouble. Therefore, it is in his interests to fill the media with lies 24/7 about how great he his, how popular he is, how good everyone under his rule has it, and so forth. It doesn't even matter if the lies are transparently false--as long as you can't be sure the population as a whole shares your hatred for the regime, the risks of revolting are huge.</p>
<p>But when it becomes evident that hatred and unrest are widespread, you can see a dictatorship fall seemingly overnight. Suddenly everyone realizes the regime is a house of cards and reacts accordingly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Governors and Rulers are kept in power by their key supporters, not necessarily by the populace which they rule. Many countries in which the citizens suffer and the elites flourish are actually quite stable, when compared to democratic societies. </p>
<p>For example, in Saudi Arabia, only the royal family can vote in the next king and the king only really has to maintain the support of his family members (albeit larger than your typical family). The saudi citizens has no real say in who rules next.</p>
<p>Whereas in the U.S., the president requires key support from major political figures, who are they themselves supported by their constituents and contributors, who are also themselves supported by local level constituency / stockholders etc.</p>
<p>TLDR: Dictators tend to need to keep less people happy than elected leaders.</p>
<p>You mentioned the role of the military, which behaves similarly to any political pyramid. At the top you have the generalissimo, who is presumably a key supporter of the dictator, and is being kept happy by the dictator. </p>
<p>He is then appointing and keeping happy the top officers he needs to keep the army under control (typically with help from the regime's coffers). These top officers will dispense and acquire whatever influence they need to keep their subordinates under control, and so on.</p>
<p>The army, with the general in the lead, is not likely to abandon the current regime unless a new regime is likely to improve their welfare. At which point they might throw their weight behind a revolution. Its important to note that populist uprisings are typically seen as the people rising up against the establishment, this is a fallacy. What actually happens in a populist uprising is a new regime moving to push the old regime out, probably having swayed some key supporters their way. It's just a better public image to let the people (aka angry mob) do the work for you. </p>
<p>This is why so many new governments born of populist uprisings ends up being just as bad or if not worse than the previous government. When a new ruler comes in power, new key supporters are installed, much of the old support base is purged, and the day to day lives of the people tends to stay the same. Since the money used to maintain the previous government's support base is now being spent to keep the current government's support base happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a primitive response to danger. Your body releases large amounts of adrenaline and triggers your fight or flight. Everyone will usually feel this in different symptoms. Some people get tingles in their feet, others get a really fast head rush, palpitations, etc. But basically your heart rate will elevate to pump blood to where ever it feels it needs to go in order to help you escape your situation and your breathing quickens to get that good sweet oxygen inside you and even you muscles will tense. </p>
<p>The feelings of dread or impending doom usually come before, not after the attack, and usually have to do with trauma or deep seated fears. Once you've had a triggered response, your brain will interpret other similar responses, and put you in full panic mode. Sometimes it doesn't even need to be that similar to a previous experience, but your brain will just assume it so. Remember that one time you felt sick after eating seafood on that really long car ride? Well now maybe just eating and being in a moving vehicle triggers your anxiety.</p>
<p>It's very common for people who have anxiety to also have obsession disorders, and it's a cyclical thinking that will continuously trigger the attacks. Can't sleep, but you know you need to, makes you anxious. Anxiety than in turn keeps you from sleeping. But you know you need to sleep, big day tomorrow. But you keep thinking about trying to sleep, more anxiety. </p>
<p>There doesn't even need to be external trigger either. There is a lot of evidence for people who are very sensitive and in tune with their bodies to get frequent attacks. There are lots of studies that the gut may have something to do with anxiety attacks. For example, having acid reflux, or bad gut flora. </p>
<p>Mostly though, everyone gets some sort of anxiety at some point in their life. The people that seem to get it the worst, and often enough to be a disorder, seem to be those more sensitive to internal/external factors, and those who have constant obsessive or obtrusive thoughts, in which case it really needs to be taken seriously and the person should be assisted. </p>
<p>EDIT: words. Thank you. </p>
<p>EDIT2: Been through it myself, and done a lot of research. For the people asking what you do in situations like this, people have mentioned them down below; mediation, but mostly just breathing. Focus on your breathing. As hard as it may seem sometimes because you have so much going on in your head, go back to your breathing and continue to focus on it until your body calms itself down. Like I mean really focus on it. Feel it go in and out of your body, take really deep breaths. 4 seconds in and 4 seconds out. It's a life saver.         </p>
<p>EDIT3: Hey everyone, just remember you're not alone in this and it's nothing to be ashamed or scared of. Find something that works for you and make yourself better!   </p>
<p>EDIT 4: Thanks for the reddit gold kind stranger! I hope this post is informative and helping others out!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have described the initial &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. I would just add that as an episode of acute anxiety progresses, you have adrenaline pouring into your system. You breathe faster, and this changes the acid-base balance of your blood. You can break down the physical sensations into a few processes:</p>
<p>-Adrenaline:</p>
<p>*Your muscles tense, getting ready for physical action. You may also notice a &quot;lump&quot; in your throat and tightness in your chest.</p>
<p>*You breathe faster, increasing oxygen flow in anticipation of action. You may feel like you can't breathe or are suffocating.</p>
<p>*You may tremble, sweat, and have pupil dilation</p>
<p>-Fast breathing / changed acid-base balance in your blood (because you rapidly breathe out carbon dioxide):</p>
<p>*You start to feel lightheaded</p>
<p>*You notice tingling, typically first in your hands, feet and lips</p>
<p>*You may feel &quot;dissociative,&quot; like you are &quot;removed&quot; or watching yourself</p>
<p>-Changes in activation of the Vagus nerve (going from your brain through your gut):</p>
<p>*You notice &quot;knots&quot; in your stomach</p>
<p>*In extreme cases, you may pass out (this is quite rare)</p>
<p>There are other signs and symptoms of anxiety. Mindfully recognizing and allowing these sensations to unfold can help nip an anxiety attack in the bud. For further reading, check out Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Russ Harris has written good books about this (The Happiness Trap, The Confidence Gap).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parts of your brain take in information about your environment, like when you feel a small tickle from something you didn't see or hear a frightening sound, but your brain also stores memories of where you are and the context in which you experienced something. All these factors contribute to your brain reacting, which produces a fear response in a part of your brain known as the amygdala. When this happens, your amygdala sends signals out to other systems of your brain and body, which cause your heart rate to go up, certain hormones like adrenaline to release, and your body temperature to change in preparation for danger. This can happen even if the perceived threat is all in your head. </p>
<p>Usually if you find you're not in danger, you will learn that the cues that made you feel fear and dread are no longer dangerous; it is possible that you do not learn this though, and the fear stays with you anyway for a variety of reasons (for example, trauma). This is how PTSD is believed to work, and is why it feels uncontrollable to people who have it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is what happens when the mainstream media and its useful idiots make shit up, publish it, only to have it gobbled up, misinterpreted, and regurgitated by other useful idiots.</p>
<p>The surface web, deep web, and dark web are all manufactured concepts that are almost entirely meaningless to any computer academic.</p>
<p>Summed up briefly, they can be roughly defined as follows:</p>
<p>Surface web: The surface web consists of web pages that are accessible or discoverable through search engines.</p>
<p>Deep web: The deep web consists of content that is not accessible or discoverable through search engines, often requiring extensive navigation or even authentication. Most &quot;deep web&quot; content is obvious, such as password-protected services; for example, the contents of your GMail account will not be found on an anonymously accessible search engine.</p>
<p>Dark web / Dark net: The dark web consists of content that is accessible only through the use of special software, most notably Tor, I2P, and Freenet.</p>
<p>The problem:</p>
<p>It's often repeated that 90% of web content is found on the deep web or dark web. However, a &quot;web page&quot; is entirely impossible to quantify, it's not a metric in any sane sense. Accordingly, it's impossible to evaluate objectively. The static web page of the 1990s and early 2000s is gone, now everything is dynamic. To make matters worse, most &quot;deep web&quot; content isn't actually deep at all, it's expressly excluded from search indexing at the website maintainer's request because it's not search worthy. However, this alone does not mean that it is not indirectly accessible through a search engine by way of another resource that incorporates it. To make matters worse, how big is a piece of &quot;web content&quot;? Are the petabytes of Youtube videos considered to be part of the surface web?</p>
<p>It would have been more appropriate to say that there is a great deal more content on the internet than is available through most search engines; this maintains the largely subjective and highly imprecise and non-scientific matter of trying to quantify and classify the internet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to understand that the <strong>deep web</strong> should not be confused with the <strong>dark net</strong>.</p>
<p>The <strong>deep web</strong> is simply composed of all the web pages on the Internet not typically indexed by search engines like Google. This includes things like password-protected pages, dynamic pages, or encrypted networks. You visit these pages all the time, usually through means of starting from a page found on the surface web and navigating further through the website.</p>
<p>What you're likely thinking of is the <strong>dark net</strong>, which is a subset of the deep web accessible only through special means, the most well-known of which is likely the TOR network. It is here that you're more likely (but not always) to find &quot;shady&quot; transactions and media content.</p>
<p>So, to answer your question, most people actually know <em>what</em> the deep web is but simply don't know <em>it's called.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modernism and Post-Modernism are extremely broad terms that describe mass cultural movements in Western art and philosophy. To understand them, one must also understand the general evolution of Western philosophy, especially the concepts of Rationalism and Romanticism.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<p><strong>Modernism is an extension of Romanticism (which was a revolt against Rationalism)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Post-Modernism is a critique of Modernism.</strong></p>
<p>I don't know much about Post-Post-Modernism (what a name) as I believe it is still in its infancy.</p>
<p>In long form:</p>
<p>I'll try to start with Rationalism. Rationalism developed through the Renaissance and the Enlightenment, and encouraged the use of empirical observation and reason to determine the truth of the universe. A quintessential example of Rationalist thought is Descartes and his famous conclusion, &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;. To keep it brief, Descartes theorized that human beings may not necessarily be able to trust their own senses - you may see, hear, or touch an object, but how can you trust that what you see is the truth rather than a very elaborate illusion. He therefore uses deductive reasoning to determine the first thing that can objectively be determined as real - because you think, you therefore <em>must</em> exist as a real, and not illusory, entity. Descartes is thus using deductive reasoning to determine what is objectively real.</p>
<p>Romanticism was a reaction to the changing society of 19th-century Europe - industrial and scientific developments were quickly rendering ancient institutions and social orders obsolete. It was thus a reaction against the values of Rationalism that had been quite important in developing the modern scientific method and driving that progress forward.</p>
<p>Romanticism was also far more of an art movement than a true philosophical movement. It evoked imagery of a romantic past, and emphasized the use of meta-narratives to justify an argument. It focuses more on the intangible than the tangible. For example, a common theme of the Romantic movement was that scientific progress disrupts the natural order and is thus dangerous and volatile - Mary Shelley's <em>Frankenstein</em> is one of the most famous works of the Romantic movement, and concerns this theme.</p>
<p>It is from Romanticism that many intangible modern political concepts spring. Manifest Destiny, Ethnic Nationalism, Zeitgeist, &quot;Human Spirit&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>In between here, Realism developed as an art movement, a reaction to Romanticism. It emphasized realistic depictions of its subjects and sympathized more with the lower strata of society and new developments rather than the upper strata and an idealized past.</p>
<p>Modernism was an evolution of Romanticism. Modernism utilized meta-narratives, but also encouraged the criticism of everything, including the old order. It rejected Realism. Where Romanticism was more concerned with the dangers of human progress and a return to an idealized past, Modernism was more concerned with finding out where wayward progress went wrong and finding out what is &quot;holding back&quot; true progress. As Modernism developed as an art movement, it encouraged the use of more abstract forms of creative expression - hence the stereotype of &quot;modern art&quot; being incomprehensible.</p>
<p>World War I was a huge influence on the rising Modernist movement. The horror and destruction of that war showed how dangerous and destructive modern industrial warfare could be. But World War I also represented a huge shake-up of the European political order - old monarchial empires were toppled in favor of democratic republics or communist states. And so as a political movement, Modernism examined the meta-narratives surrounding Western society - what holds back social progress, and how can that change.</p>
<p>It is from this that we see the rise of social movements against perceived oppression: progressivism, socialism, feminism, civil rights, popular sovereignty. These are all movements centered around a meta-narrative of one group being oppressed in some way by another - laborers by capitalists, women by men, minorities by a majority, ethnic groups by other ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Post-Modernism developed as a result of the trauma of World War II. It is primarily a critique of Modernism. A central part of Post-Modernism is the inherent unreliability of human judgment - humans are not inherently rational creatures, and will commit irrational and self-defeating actions if they <em>believe</em> those actions will be beneficial. Post-Modernism thus emphasizes the inherent unreliability of those Modernist meta-narratives - these meta-narratives are formulated by humans, and are thus an unreliable source. A pretty good example of how this relates to WWII, and the inherent unreliability of meta-narratives, is the Nazis themselves - the Nazi ideology heavily relied upon the use of extreme (and false) nationalist and racist meta-narratives to justify itself.</p>
<p>Thus, in both Post-Modernist philosophy and art you will see a heavy emphasis on criticism of institutions and their foundations. Overcoming oppression on the surface-level is not enough - we must examine and change the factors and flaws deep within our culture and society in order to progress as a species. Thus you get emphasis on concepts such as moral relativism in Post-Modernism than in Modernism.</p>
<p>I'm more familiar with the artistic side of Post-Modernism, and can give several examples of Post-Modern art. One of the most famous is <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg" target="_blank">&quot;The Treachery of Images&quot;</a>. It is a painting of a pipe, with the caption reading &quot;This is not a pipe&quot;. The image is not lying - it's not a pipe, it's the painting of a pipe. But when you look at it and are asked what it is, you wouldn't say &quot;That's a painting of pipe&quot; you would likely say &quot;That's a pipe&quot;. I hope this isn't too abstract. Essentially, the image encourages the observer to question their assumptions about what they are seeing.</p>
<p>Post-Modern film and television tend to examine and critique the tropes and norms of their genre or medium (as a Post-Modern social movement would critique the norms and values of their culture). For example, a big part of <em>Scream</em>'s appeal and popularity was its willingness to extensively explore and make fun of the conventions of the slasher genre, which had been run into the ground by the mid-1990s. <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> examines the conventions and cliches of the horror and high school drama genres, and is positively soaked in existentialist philosophy.</p>
<p>And in literature, a good example of a Post-Modern book series is <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em>, which brutally deconstructs the conventions of the high fantasy genre. And <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Deconstruction" target="_blank">Deconstruction</a> is a key weapon in the arsenal of the Post-Modern artist or activist - examine a convention or norm, explore its unfiltered effects and origins, and try to make it different.</p>
<p>As for Post-Post-Modernism, again I am unfamiliar, but because it is a reaction to Post-Modernism I assume it has to do with rejecting the relativist and deconstructionist beliefs of the Post-Modernists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a module on contemporary American fiction last term at university -- I study English literature -- so I'll add my two cents on how postpostmodernism was presented there.</p>
<p>Essentially, it's what you'd expect; how do the generation of writers born after the postmodern epoch of the 80s/90s deal with that intellectual shadow hanging over them?</p>
<p>The two writers we associated most strongly with the term were David Foster Wallace and Jennifer Egan. You can make relatively decent arguments for them both actually being just postmodern, but hey, it's the humanities: you can argue a lot of things.</p>
<p>In brief, their takeaway from postmodernism was one of overbearing cynicism. True knowledge is impossible. Capitalism is destructive and capricious. There was a shift from ontology to epistemology, usually in the vein of &quot;you can't ever really know anything, har har!&quot;. Mass-media was thought to be profoundly affecting society, usually in a bad way. We lived in a hyperreal late-capitalist wasteland of cultural emptiness, copies without originals, etc. etc.</p>
<p>The postpostmodernists, essentially, got tired of this cynicism and decided to have a go at fighting back. David Foster Wallace is linked with the term 'sincerity' for this reason, and a lot of his works deal with themes of how to break down the endless barriers of irony, cynicism, facades, mind-games and double-guesses of academia and postmodern discourse to arrive at actual sincerity. Egan goes at it from a different tack, essentially (I'm summarising in very broad strokes) saying that if we're strictly historical, if we very carefully map out how our culture got to where it is now, we might be able to understand things -- and change them.</p>
<p>Everything I've said here is up for debate. That said, no-one else has yet offered much on postpostmodernism, so I hope you find this useful. I welcome any questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Postmodernism (at least to me) is the backlash to modernism and is super snarky, pretentious, socially aware, and critical in comparison. Sort of a &quot;Your future sucks and needs to be better.&quot; You see a lot of weird -isms pop up here.</p>
<p>Postpostmodernism is a more gentle backlash to the previous backlash and is sort of a &quot;Christ, that was exhausting.

<p>In food terms: Modernism is a TV dinner (Salisbury steak), Postmodernism is sushi (while it was still &quot;new&quot; in America) with a bunch of zig-zagged sauce all over, Postpostmodernism is a Chipotle burrito after they stopped using unethically raised chickens and also you got it delivered using an app on your phone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If all the organs are reversed, the body functions completely normally, and it is not unusual for it to go undetected.  The main issue is making sure medical providers know about it, especially in an emergency.</p>
<p>In some cases, the reversal is imperfect, and this can lead to a number of health problems, with the most common being cardiac problems.  Also, situs inversus can be caused by Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, which results in improperly formed cilia in the body.  Other symptoms include sinus and lung problems, and male infertility.  These are chronic conditions you would have already had.</p>
<p>Finally, situs inversus can complicate organ transplants involving asymmetric organs like the liver or heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Make sure this is added to your medical notes wherever you go. A lot of your organs are asymmetric so it's important to know. Make sure your SO knows so they can tell medics if you can't. A medical bracelet is a good idea. Also fill in the emergency medical details on your phone. It's a good idea to have a rough idea where your appendix should now be, just in case you get weird stabbing pains in your stomach. </p>
<p>I had fun with this when I was a kid. I was a subject for the finals at a medical school. I remember the colour draining from one young soon-to-be doctors face when he couldn't hear my heart, then the look of relief when he tried the other side. Lol. Got paid too, about £15 I think.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I experimented with this after suffering blackouts on a regular basis over about a few months. I read that it was down to the blood alcohol level and at a certain point it interfered with long term memory. So I set out by restricting my calorie intake each Friday before going to the pub and drank 6 pints of budvar over approx 3 hours. </p>
<p>I restricted calories by skipping meals. Breakfast, lunch or dinner </p>
<p>3 meals in sequence = drunk no blackout </p>
<p>Breakfast and lunch = pretty hammered, no blackout</p>
<p>Breakfast = brown outs with a lingering memory of arguing at the Indian takeaway for a smoked sausage</p>
<p>Breakfast and dinner &amp; lunch and dinner = brown outs with little to report.</p>
<p>No meals = ruined. I apparently peed in the cupboard and argued with my own reflection in a mirror before taking the mirror off the wall and placing it in the bath.</p>
<p>Shortening the drinking time from 3 to 2 hours had a huge impact, pretty much without 3 meals i was blacking out. </p>
<p>I also repeated this in different establishments and dark indoor pubs seemed to have a impact, although not enough that I could make any conclusions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

for many years I drank as naturally as I breathed,  and I was able to ingest and sustain, what seems now to be a heinous amount of hard liquor or beer for a 19/20yr female of my size, (5'4&quot; and probably around 100lbs at the time,  if that) and for a good while i never blacked out,  like.. ever. not once! and I had a bad diet,  bad sleeping habits,  you name it.  but there was a certain night when it distinctly changed,  I got into, what was then,  the worse  fight I had ever been in, with my (then) SO. yelling at each other outside a gas station,  screaming after one another down a quiet neighborhood street at some horribly rude hour of the night,  definately post-midnight, bawling in someone's front yard,  strangers coming up and saying if things didn't lighten up they would get the police involved,  the whole nine yards, extremely dramatic bullshit,  totally unnecessary, totally embarassing, but hey,  everyone has at least ONE night where they act a complete fool in their lives... right? lol.
aaaaanywho,  that night I blacked out for the first time and after that I started to black out it seemed like every time my emotions would get even a little frazzled,  it always felt like that night, had like... been some subconscious tipping point where my brain said never again!  so, before- I was able to hold it together but afterwards, even if I was in a perfectly fine mood,  celebrating even, not a dark cloud in the metaphorical sky,  it wouldn't matter, once i passed the tipsy stage and proceeded into drunkenness,  i became an emotional mess and would black out almost like clockwork, (hence beginning the official stages of a definite spiral into a dark alcoholism period)
bbbbbut I'm just wondering if that's common? to have a said,  &quot;tipping point&quot;, or if that's just a mental health commonality pertaining to depression ect ect</p>
<p>and also- the inability to form long term memories is a logically sound explanation for most blackouters, but I'm also curious to it pertaining to if your mixing, let's say MDMA with alcohol,  cuz it was my experience, that I wouldn't black out or get drunk when I was rolling,  us that just a side effect or the drug,  some suppression of alcohol receptors cuz their too busy wanting to dance? lol,  I've always wondered about that.  ah to be young again... lol </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>our brains are hard wired to recognize human faces and eye contact. In fact, there's a whole part of your brain devoted specifically to that task, and people with damage to it can get something called face blindness. So human faces in your visual field get some special attention when it comes to how your brain processes the image in front of you, leading to quick attraction and notice.</p>
<p>For people you can't see, you might recognize their presence by some other means, such as sound or touch. Then when you turn, both you and their face-recognizing visual systems have a reasonable chance to result in spontaneous eye contact. This might fool you into thinking you &quot;sensed&quot; them looking at you.</p>
<p>Otherwise it is likely simply a matter of confirmation bias. You recall when you felt something &quot;odd&quot; and met someone's eyes, and forget when you just &quot;felt something odd&quot; and nothing happened. There's no real basis for a 'sense' that can detect eyes looking at you, eyes don't transmit anything unique that makes an impact on human skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In as ELI5 as I can: you can't, but you think you do. One of 4 things can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone is looking at you, and you notice.</li>
<li>Someone is looking at you, and you don't notice.</li>
<li>Nobody is looking at you, and you notice.</li>
<li>Nobody is looking at you, and you don't notice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the first one, you'll remember. You think &quot;why is Johnny looking at me? Has he been looking at me the whole time? That's kinda weird.&quot; The 2nd and the 4th, you cannot remember, since you didn't know it was happening. And the 3rd, well, you notice but you don't remember it, usually. Why would you? Nothing happened. People around you just doing their own thing.</p>
<p>Let's assume for fun each of these events are equally likely. Then some is looking at you (and you notice) 1 in every 4 times, on average. But it will feel like almost every time, because you don't bother remembering the times when someone isn't looking at you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to offer a rare dissent, here, supported by absolutely no evidence.  So y'all are free to laugh at me until I am proven correct, years from now.</p>
<p>I offer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Human hearing is more sensitive than many of us credit.  There was a recent example--predicted by William Gibson, by the way--of a blind person who learned to navigate a room by making bat-like clicking noises and learning to &quot;read&quot; the echoes.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check him out: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kish" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kish</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A possibly useful survival trait would be the ability to detect a silent predator by the change in <em>ambient</em> noise.  That's a change in the texture of other noises going on as something silently occludes a sound source or echo.  So our brains may retain this ability.  Furthermore, humans seem to have evolved from an early time in close proximity to a potentially useful ambient noise point-source--a smoldering fire.  Eyes burning a hole in your back, see--or rather, hear?  Does that turn of phrase go all the way back to the caves?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The shape of the human head might reflect ambient noise in different ways.  We have convex foreheads and, more to my point, we have two semi-concave eye sockets which, at a certain distance, might actually <em>focus</em> ambient noise.  When someone is looking directly at the back of your head (or more likely, from an angle that might help the subject to guess the position), their eye sockets may be focusing ambient sound directly at your <em>ears</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>Thus, when a person behind you turns to face you (as in staring), I think it's possible that some people may actually be able to <em>hear</em> a change in ambient noise that gives them the &quot;feeling of being watched.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>Having said that, it would of course depend upon the shape of a person's face, the distance and position of that person, and it would be useless beyond a certain very short distance.</p>
<p>But it <em>might</em> explain some of the incidents that occur in enclosed places with a fair amount of ambient noise, like for example in waiting rooms or on the subway.  </p>
<p>And, in conclusion, I wish to credit Iron Maiden for the idea: <em>You walk through the subway, his eyes burn a hole in your back/ A footstep behind you he lunges prepared to attack</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
