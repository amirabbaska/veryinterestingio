		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair coarseness is a function of the thickness of each individual shaft of hair. Beard hairs are coarser than scalp hairs because they are individually thicker than your head hairs. One of the main things that influences hair thickness is the size of the dermal papilla, the space the root of the hair shaft sits in at the base of the follicle. Dermal papilla size is characterised both in terms of the space afforded within the dermal (skin) matrix and the number of cells at the dermal papilla.</p>
<p>Table 2 in the following paper shows that the dermal papilla in male beard hair follicles is around 4 times the size of dermal papilla in male scalp follicles. So we might expect that beard hairs are thicker than scalp hairs</p>
<p><a href="http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022202X15406700/1-s2.0-S0022202X15406700-main.pdf?_tid=d76ae1b6-3561-11e7-a265-00000aab0f01&acdnat=1494408180_3ef85226c926ada6bdd37aae4e068499" target="_blank">http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022202X15406700/1-s2.0-S0022202X15406700-main.pdf?_tid=d76ae1b6-3561-11e7-a265-00000aab0f01&acdnat=1494408180_3ef85226c926ada6bdd37aae4e068499</a></p>
<p>This paper (figures 4 through 7) show that follicle size is roughly correlated with hair shaft thickness at different body sites, although they don't specifically measure the dermal papilla size (which would be rather invasive).</p>
<p><a href="http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022202X15306291/1-s2.0-S0022202X15306291-main.pdf?_tid=6e7ddb36-3561-11e7-a5ee-00000aacb362&acdnat=1494408004_b8c74d07766baecfbeff46a1f8d98c18" target="_blank">http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0022202X15306291/1-s2.0-S0022202X15306291-main.pdf?_tid=6e7ddb36-3561-11e7-a5ee-00000aacb362&acdnat=1494408004_b8c74d07766baecfbeff46a1f8d98c18</a></p>
<p>That's the proximal, specific reason beard hair is coarser than scalp hair. Also worth noting that follicle density is lower on the face than the scalp and that likely increases the perception of coarseness as the fingers can better resolve each individual hair when the face is stroked.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Possibly &quot;dermal papilla size differences&quot; isn't enough of an explanation, so I'll add a bit more:</em></p>
<p><em>You essentially have 2 types of hair covering your body ultra fine, unpigmented and short Vellus hairs and thick, long, pigmented  Terminal hairs. Hair follicles will convert from vellus hairs to terminal hair follicles when exposed to sufficient levels of androgen hormones (largely testosterone). Hair follicles across the body also show a great range in sensitivity to androgens. Scalp follicles are very sensitive so you grow terminal hairs from your scalp, from infancy, with very modest levels of androgens present. Pubic and beards hairs require the additional increases in androgen levels that come with puberty and once the threshold is met they are also acutely sensitive to the raised level of hormones. The androgen signal causes the follicle to mature, rebuilding and enlarging much of its structure. Interestingly the dermal papilla is believed to be the main site of action within the follicle of this hormone signal. The the extent of these changes is a result of the degree of sensitivity to the new androgens, with more sensitive follicles growing larger which in turn leads to thicker hairs.</em></p>
<p><em>Scalp hairs do not undergo additional thickening at puberty as the follicles are already mature. Interestingly, sufficiently raised androgen levels has the ability to convert scalp terminal hairs back to vellus hairs:</em></p>
<p><em>Here is a really nice review of all this material, and you can read more detail from the section titled &quot;How do androgens carry out these changes?&quot;</em></p>
<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1529-8019.2008.00214.x/full" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1529-8019.2008.00214.x/full</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is it simply a matter of evolution? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It certainly appears to be an evolved trait. Beard growth shows  strong sexual dimorphism; males have obvious beard growth and women very little. This kind of marked sexual dimorphism is usually taken as evidence that the trait is primarily influenced by sexual selection rather than some other environmental selection. Another piece of evidence that this is a sexually selected trait is that beard hairs come in around the onset of sexual maturity, which strongly suggests they are a signal of sexual maturation.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sexual_selection</a></p>
<p>It seems unlikely that exposure (wind chill, precipitation etc...) is the cause. We have no evidence that males spent less time sheltered than women in the Paleolithic period during which Homo sapiens evolved. For many hunter-gatherers men do typically hunt but women spend significant time out gathering (fun fact: grandmothers gather significantly more calories per day than the men acquire through hunting). Also humans evolved near the equator and I'm not aware of any evidence that extant hunter-gatherers living on or near the equator show any gender based differences in sheltering. </p>
<p>Worth noting that women do hunt in some hunter-gatherer groups but I don't think they've started growing beards. Although perhaps they've just not had enough evolutionary time... ;)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What proteins are in beard hair which aren't found in other types of hair?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beard and scalp hairs are both constructed from type 1 and type 2 keratin. There's no specific proteinaceous difference between beard and other hairs.</p>
<p>Edit: In case people revisit this answer. Some people are asking what is the evolutionary reason beard hairs are thicker than scalp hairs. I'm not aware of any work on this nor on how we could assess this. The above answer is kept largely to what Science does know about beard hair thickness and the evolutionary drive for beard presence. Coming up with an evolutionary Just-So story about the Why of it would be much too speculative. Not all traits are under strict evolutionary selection so beard hair thickness may just be an artefact of the process which matures pubic and beard follicles</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair, like nails, horns, claws and much skin is Keratin, an extremely stable protein. As such it's preserved from 100's of millions of years ago, because of that structural, least energy characteristic. Feathers are seen often fossilized, as are reptilian skin, which are other, common forms of keratin. We cannot digest hair, and most animals cannot either, tho bacteria, fungi and some others can, just like lignin, or cellulose is largely indigestible, because it requires a very great deal of activation energy to break it down.</p>
<p>Hair serves many, many purposes. Not all persons have thick beard hair, Mine is not, and is easily broken.  But the roots of beard hair are very much deeper than head hair. It's more strongly rooted than on top of our heads and elsewhere. But consider that we humans have chins, and most other animals do not. That's probably because of our very large, mobile and speech enabling tongues, which are rooted in the base of our &quot;chinny&quot; jaws.</p>
<p>Note also beard hair is much more densely concentrated around our chins and mustache, forming a sort of natural &quot;goatee&quot;. And also note in most men the beard extends much lower on the neck, and covers in most all cases, our Adam's apple, the external part of our male Larynges. Thus it's protective in the cold, as well. The chin down to the larynx is more heavily covered than the say, cheeks areas, on both sides. Freeze the chin, damages the tongue. Freeze the larynx and speech is damaged. Thus the heavier beard there.</p>
<p>That's largely what's going on, from a structural, protective as well as evolutionary basis. Note also hair is rather slick, too. So a hit to the face where the beard is will more likely slide off compared to if it hits bare skin. it deflects some or more of the damaging impact energy. Beard hair is greasy and slippery.</p>
<p>Won't go into its secondary sexual characteristics, denoting male gender, increases face appearance, threat size, etc.</p>
<p>Multiple functions, complex system characteristics of hair...... No wonder it's persisted so long, too. It's stable because it's least energy and very useful, doing lots with the little, simply repeated structures, the hair follicles. Our hair.....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Earth is one of the best conduits of movement, so the vibrations of animals such as worms can be felt through their claws and talons, travelling through their legs and into their bones, eventually vibrating into their skulls. This sensation allows them to pinpoint the movement of any animal, so they can then aim their beaks to strike at the exact moment any creature comes closest to the surface.</p>

<p>To test if they were using scent to locate their prey, birds were offered trays with buried live, moving worms and dead ones. Robins found the live worms more often, suggesting they were not using scent.</p>
<p>In the next test, they were given hanging food trays to keep them from touching the soil with their feet and detecting the worm’s vibrations. The trays did not affect their ability to find the worms, suggesting they do not use tactile cues.</p>
<p>When cardboard was used as a barrier to block visual cues, the birds could still find the worms. That meant they were using another sense. A last experiment used white noise to block sound cues and the birds had more difficulty finding the worms.</p>
<p>The research concluded that robins could use either visual or auditory cues alone, but probably use both.
I think this is also likely true for Starlings/Blackbirds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only try and explain from the Grammy point of view as a voting member there. Basically voting for the Grammys becomes more of a political manner in the industry than simply voting for the &quot;best&quot; record in each category.</p>
<p>The way the voting process works for the Grammys is that there are these sub-committees for each and every category. I have no idea how someone gets onto one of these sub-committees but the people on them don't seem to change much. Every year these committees convene and decide which albums out of the hundreds in each category get nominated. Then around fall of each year the rest of the voting members get sent a packet and we're allowed to cast our vote for the nominees in 5 (I think?) categories - to seemingly keep everyone from voting on every category that they couldn't have an opinion in. (Like I probably shouldn't vote for best &quot;world music&quot; album since I have no idea who any of the artists are there) As a side note everyone gets a free vote for some popular categories like artist of the year, album of the year, etc. </p>
<p>Because of these subcommittees whittling down the voting pool, by the time the vast majority of the academy gets to vote on the winners - the most &quot;popular&quot; artists seem to be the only choices. I think it's due to the fact that the sub-committees don't change very often and so the members on them try and pick the nominees not based on what's best but who they know who worked on the albums. It's definitely an odd way to vote and I'm not sure if the oscars are any different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One reason is that there are far fewer movies made than albums.  There are around 100,000 albums released per year, while Hollywood makes something on the order of 700 movies per year.  (Given, there are more movies than just Hollywood, but that's the bulk, at least of what would be considered for Oscar nomination.)</p>
<p>It's reasonably easy to narrow down 700 to the few that are truly excellent, especially when you're ignoring stuff that was never intended to be excellent in the way that an Oscar category is looking for.  It's even vaguely possible, if unlikely, to watch every single one of those movies.  And it's reasonably easy to come to a consensus about those movies.</p>
<p>If you have 100,000 albums, that's way more music than can be listened to over the course of a year.  (Assuming an average of 45 minutes per album, that would be over eight years of constant music.)  At that level, you have to find things that are already being promoted external to the voting system to come to any sort of consensus.</p>
<p>This is not intended to contradict /u/Carbonm8's answer.  It's just another aspect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As such the Oscars will get ratings regardless of who wins, but the Grammies rely on the popularity of the awardees to get ratings. </p>
<p>Like, an Oscar winning director has pretty much automatically 'made it' and is going to have a certain level of respect for the rest of their career. Christopher Cross won five grammies for his debut album, and is now so obscure his new albums don't even get their own wikipedia page. Can you imagine a director getting five oscars for their debut movie ever releasing anything that didn't have a wikipedia page?</p>
<p>As a sidenote Cross also won one Oscar for writing the theme song to Arthur, and most people probably know the tune (or at the very least are aware of the movie).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is my contrarian view: very often they do not favor artistic movies. This year's win is a pretty big deviation from the norm. </p>
<p>Traditionally, bigger budget films with mass appeal are the ones to be nominated and to win. Going farther back, think of &quot;It Happened One Night.&quot; From the 1990s: Forrest Gump, Braveheart, Titanic, Shakespeare in Love, Gladiator. </p>
<p>Starting in the 2000s, the Academy broadened its voting membership to include a lot of people less directly tied to the major studios, and so now the films are more diverse. Typically there is a 50/50 mix of more independent fare and well-received mainstream film. Even films like Argo and 12 Years a Slave had decent budgets. </p>
<p>I'm not saying these are bad films -- not at all. But they wouldn't be considered particularly outside of the mainstream by serious film buffs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>From thread with the same title</p>
<p>It is due to what is known as &quot;stress induced crystallization&quot;. As mentioned before, many polymers are semi-crystalline, containing both crystalline and amorphous (non-ordered, think spaghetti) regions. When the crystalline region size is on the order of the wavelength of light, it can scatter light making the plastic opaque. For polymers that are entirely amorphous, you have no crystalline regions and thus the polymers are transparent. As I mentioned above, you can think of the amorphous regions as something similar to spaghetti, a messed of tangled polymer chains. When you bend the plastic (i.e. stress), you are forcing those polymer chains to align in the axis of strain, inducing crystallization in that region, which can then scatter light and turn the plastic opaque or white.</p>

Just like how sugar can be a crystal or dissolved and invisible, or caramel, or rock candy, etc. When you bend the plastic you're changing the structure of the plastic on a microscopic level and that structure change affects the color. There is no simple explanation that explains the actual effect at a 5 year old's reading level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume a lot of these people are correct about crystal whatevers. I think that with certain plastics that are bendable, you can open tiny openings in the plastic to reveal the color inside but thats completely up to the material used. I'm talking about very cheap plastic, especially when it's old and easier to bend like it's a piece of taffy. You'll get that same color if you were to cut the plastic, and that is simply the color of the plastic before it was painted or colored. For clear plastics I have no idea. Probably a structural reaction to stress. Like when you break glass and it turns white.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the turning white is because plastic is made up of a lot of tiny strings stuck together, normally these strings are randomly aligned to each other. If plastic is this way, it is actually transparent, the colour comes from other coloured stuff which is mixed in the plastic. The bending causes the strings to stretch a bit, and since they are all stretched in the same direction, the plastic will now turn from transparent to white. Since the colour stuff is inside the plastic, you will not see the colour anymore through the whiteness of the plastic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>And, yes, it has created an environment in which our elected representatives are beholden more to their benefactors, the ones who enable them to be elected and to keep their jobs, than they are to &quot;we the people.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> To clarify, <em>Citizens United</em> does not permit massive corporate contributions directly to the coffers of individual politicians or political parties, by establishing procedural and policy hoops they have to leap through. However, there is never any question where the money is coming from or for whom or what it is intended, so the net result is still the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll provide a more macro perspective on this because I think it helps. One must ask first, why would the government deny anyone the right to do anything that they want? If two people make an agreement whos the government (being the third party) to come in and tell them that the agreement they made is void? </p>
<p>And so we come to a very old idea between two parties regarding the freedom to contract with one another. This old idea is incorporated across the world in many different ways from the most simple of cultures to massive political systems such as the USA. Determining whether agreements are equitable between parties or bad for public policy or many other things is what each governments burden is when creating laws that suppress this original freedom.</p>
<p>So to answer your question in a nonspecific way, the United States has not abolished (although they have made some campaign finance reform in other ways) this idea... yet. </p>
<p>I hope my answer was helpful as a foundation for the basis of your question in the first place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Why is it allowed? There is an argument that it's free expression or free speech. You can give up your yard for a campaign sign, give up your internet bandwidth to share campaign slogans on social media, give up your time to call people and encourage them to vote for your cause.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of wrong answers here.  Very simply:</p>
<ul>
<li>Corporations cannot give money to politicians directly.</li>
<li>Corporations cannot donate money to politicians' campaigns.</li>
<li>Corporations <em>can</em> spend money to advertise on political <em>issues</em>, but not [edit] in cooperation with a campaign.</li>
<li>Certain corporations have publicly advocated for or against candidates for most of the nation's history.  We call those corporations &quot;newspapers&quot;.  The <em>Citizens United</em> Supreme Court decision basically made it so that any corporation could endorse a political candidate without having to go through the hassle of buying a newspaper.  But that's not the same as giving money to a campaign, and certainly not the same as giving money directly to a candidate.</li>
<li>Most of what's reported as &quot;corporations giving money to politicians&quot; is actually <em>people who work for corporations</em> making <em>individual</em> donations to a campaign.  There are websites that track this, but again, it's often incorrectly reported as &quot;Walmart gave $$$$ to Senator X&quot;, when it's actually people who work for Walmart who made individual donations.</li>
<li>Individual people <em>are</em> allowed to make donations to political campaigns, because that's how they're funded.  But it's limited in size so that super-rich people can't basically buy a candidate.  People who work for corporations can give money just like people who don't.</li>
<li>There have been some proposals to make campaign costs be paid for by the government rather than from donations, but there's a serious problem with those proposals - they really help people who are already in office.  People who are already in office have good name recognition and already have connections with the media, so they have a huge advantage over challengers.  Fund-raising is one of the few ways that challengers have of getting an advantage over a veteran politician.</li>
<li>There is corruption and it is a real thing, but for the most part, this isn't it.  Corruption tends to be more of an informal arrangement - where a politician looks out for a corporation or other special interest, then they offer him or her a cushy job or super-generous &quot;consulting fees&quot; or &quot;speaking fees&quot; after they leave office.  That's entirely legal, but seriously questionable ethically, but it happens all the time.  But again, this isn't it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea of lobbying for political favor is just the people asking for what they want.</p>
<p>However, it becomes a problem when people organize themselves into groups, and then lobby on behalf of their own interests as opposed to what's good for everyone.</p>
<p>These groups are often businesses, and businesses do what businesses are supposed to: make money. When a business lobbies for political favor, they are asking for special treatment in order to operate differently, and therefore, at an advantage to the competition. In order to achieve this goal, bribes are given, under the presumption that the bribed will work politically to improve the briber's ability to dodge competition or cut corners.</p>
<p>The problem isn't so much the bribes, it's where they are coming from. It's who is allowed to make the &quot;donations&quot;.</p>
<p>Money is necessary in politics because campaigning is expensive, and politicians don't directly create anything of value. As such, they must be allowed to accept money.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the first step to fixing government is to fund campaigns via tax money and forbid direct donations. Appeals to political favor made through rhetoric, not money. And to best fight against under the table bribes, require campaigns to set goals and make promises that they must pursue, otherwise they forfeit their position and a new election is held.</p>
<p>When individuals are politicians focus not  collectives, then we can have good government.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a purely computational standpoint, this in a sense boils down to how one explains multiplication by fractions, such as 0.7 <em> 2. Clearly that is 0.7 + 0.7, but it is also 7 </em> 0.2 = 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2 + 0.2, where all we're really doing is playing around with powers of ten. Once you understand how to represent a fraction in terms of powers of ten, multiplication by fractions is very similar to integer multiplication. I'll show below how we can use this to retain the interpretation that multiplication is repeat addition:</p>
<p>e ~ 2.72, π ~ 3.14</p>
<p>e x π = 2.72 x 3.14</p>
<p>2*(3 + 0.1 + 0.04) +</p>
<p>7*(3 + 0.1 + 0.04)/10 +</p>
<p>2*(3 + 0.1 + 0.04)/100 = </p>
<p>3 + 3 + 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.04 + 0.04 +</p>
<p>0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.3 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.01 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + 0.004 + </p>
<p>0.03 + 0.03 + 0.001 + 0.001 + 0.0004 + 0.0004 = 8.54</p>
<p>Edit: I should say that this is just an explicit example which shows that multiplication as repeat addition makes sense for fractions. I'm sure there is some other explanation as well, which more directly answers your question, <em>what is multiplication?</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you want to take a class in real analysis. The really quick answer is that your definition works for rational numbers, and we extend that to irrational numbers by defining them as limits of sequences of rationals.</p>
<p>Here's a bit longer answer, but you'd likely need at least the first few chapters of a real analysis book to make sense of it. You construct the real numbers from Cauchy sequences of rational numbers. (Equivalence classes of Cauchy sequences with the same limits, to be precise.) For multiplication, you just create a new sequence by multiplying the elements (pairwise) of the two multiplicands. Proving that this is also a Cauchy sequence is easy.  </p>
<p>In general terms, think of it as writing e and π to <em>n</em> decimal places. Then your repeated addition definition works fine. Now do it for <em>n</em>+1 digits. Show that as we add more digits to the multiplicands, the product doesn't change until (say) <em>n</em>-1 digits. So we can compute the product to arbitrary precision just by starting with enough precision in the multiplicands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: /u/kgluds with the answer, link to comment: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/29d26x/what_is_the_circle_that_sometimes_forms_when/cik0num" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/29d26x/what_is_the_circle_that_sometimes_forms_when/cik0num</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: or for the lazy,</p>
<p>&quot;These are called phosophenes. This happens when you touch or rub your closed eyes, or even squeeze them tightly closed, because the pressure stimulates your retina and makes your brain perceive light. Your retina has tiny cells in it that are used to collect light. When it takes in a light stimulus, the sensation crosses over to the other side of the eyeball which is why you see the light form opposite of the side of the eye that pressure was added. Phosophenes are different from hallucinations because they are caused by a physical pressure to the eyeball that creates the sensation of &quot;seeing light&quot; whereas hallucinations are generated solely in the occipital lobe.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit 3: I am not an opthalmologist, I just remembered someone asked a similar question. I know nothing of Opthalmology aside from that iritis sucks a whole hell of a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of sound waves that move like this</p>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<pre><code>
The sound waves are moving perpendicular to the ground. 

If the source is to your left, and your ear is to the right, then you'll hear the sound just fine. 

If we put a really thin wall between the two.

~~~~~~~~~~~l~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~l~~~~~

~~~~~~~~~~~l~~~~~ 

You'll still hear the sound, the sound waves hits the wall, transfers the energy THROUGH the wall to the air on the other side, and you'll hear it. 

Now, a larger wall

~~~~~~~~~|||||||~

~~~~~~~~~|||||||~

~~~~~~~~~|||||||~

You may still hear it, but it will be very faint, maybe you'll have to put your ear to the wall, that's because the sound wave have to move a much larger amount of mass to transmit the signal and they don't have as much energy. (This is very simplified)

Now, rather than a wall, you've got snow. 

If it's snowing lightly.

~~~~~~~~#~~~~~
</code></pre>
<pre><code>

The sound is just partially muffled from the snowflake interfering with the path of the sound wave, it absorbs some of the energy of the wave and it doesn't go as far. 

If it's snowing heavily

~~~~~#~~~~~#~~~~~~##~~~~

~~~~#~~~~~~#~~~~~#~~~~~#

~~~~##~~~~~#~~~~~~#~~~~~~#~~

The sound wave loses a lot more energy as it goes from the source to your ear. Making the sound less loud, and it won't travel as far. 

Edit: formatting, cause the snowflakes didn't work well.</code></pre></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of sound energy as a tennis ball. If you drop it on a hard flooring(cement/tile) it almost bounces back with same energy. Now if you drop the same ball on a sand pit , it hardly bounces. This happens because in a hard flooring the particles are tightly packed. They don't move . So all the energy that the ball carries transferred back to the ball and makes it move in the other direction. On the sand the particles are loosely packed so the get to move . So a lot of energy is expended in moving sand particles and very little is transferred to the ball. </p>
<p>Something similar happens to the sound. When it snows the snowflakes are not tightly packed. So they can absorb more ambient noise compared to before snowfall. So it relatively feels quieter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is honestly one of the most uninformed threads I have seen. There are only 2 laws that grant Congress immunity that the average person does not have, and they both are related to Congress doing their job. Congressman cannot be detained for minor crimes while on their way to cast a vote, and Congressman cannot be sued for things they say or votes they cast while in a session of Congress.</p>
<p>Both of these protections are very minor and yet very necessary. </p>
<p>But let me emphasize that you often <em>hear</em> news stories that say Congress is exempt from a law, but those news stories are <em>intentionally misleading.</em> Here are a few recent examples.</p>
<p><strong>Congress is exempt from insider trading</strong>. This gets circulating around every year or so and it is 100% false. Congress never has, and never will be, exempt from insider trading laws. When you read these news stories you will find out that Congress is allowed to buy and sell stock with the early knowledge of how their laws will affect companies. But this is <strong>not insider trading</strong>. It sounds like insider trading to someone that does not know the laws, but legally speaking it is not. Congress has to follow all the same insider trading laws as you and I, and it has always been that way.</p>
<p><strong>Congress is exempt from the Affordable Car Act/from the ACA replacement.</strong> This is also 100% false. The ACA set up health care exchanges where people could go if they did not have employer sponsored health insurance (among other things). Congress has employer sponsored health insurance as they are a government employees. Thus they will not use the exchanges, and somehow this got to people reporting that they were &quot;exempt&quot; from it. They are not exempt. </p>
<p>Just as if Congress passed a law that regulated Alaska crab fishing, you would not say they are exempt from the law because none of them are currently crab fisherman. They just passed a law that does not directly affect them. They do it all the time, that is their job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>So, why would Congress make itself exempt from anything?  In some cases, the rules deal with things Congress doesn't want to do to itself, such as giving some protections to their own workers.  In other cases, it's just for more innocent, logistical purposes.  For example, as part of the recent Republican efforts to pass a new healthcare law, Congress exempted itself to avoid a conflict related to which committee can alter congressional health plans.  That being said, another bill was written to un-exempt Congress.

For example, they can't be detained for some smaller crime until parliament waives their immunity. They also can't be prosecuted for the things they say while performing the duty of an MP. </p>
<p>Why? Because, unlike in the US, it has been relatively common for dictators to arise from the executive branch of govt in which case the parliament is either obedient from the start or the dictator removes problematic MPs because police found &quot;evidence&quot; that they're criminals so that they can be removed and replaced.</p>
<p>So they have immunity rights, which is still not a guarantee against this sort of thing but is still better than nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These laws are put in place with good intentions. For example, the Congress and most state legislatures have a law that says representatives can't be arrested on their way or from the capitol. That's a very important law that can keep a corrupt local sheriff from detaining a state legislator just long enough that they miss the vote on the 2017 Hold Corrupt Sheriffs Accountable Act. But like any other law, this one can be abused, or made subject to a bogus defense claim. It's easy to find examples of legislators disputing a DUI or reckless driving charge by claiming they were on their way to a vote.</p>
<p>Some of these &quot;exempt themselves from laws&quot; things are a matter of interpretation. For example, in my home state, legislators are allowed to carry a concealed weapon. That might sound like a special privilege until you realize there's little difference between their CCW privileges and yours. Congressman Smith still can't carry a gun into a bar or on an airplane. And like the above no-arrests example, this law is designed with sensible intentions: think back to the civil rights movement, when a legislator could legitimately fear for their safety for voting against segregation. So really it is just another law intended to protect government officials.</p>
<p>Please bear in mind that the laws that apply to office holders <em>while in office</em>. Despite any voter complacency, the people do have some say in the matter, and it's not a freebies-for-life sort of deal. Once you're out, you're out. And since it's an elected office, so you could at least theoretically attain the office yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
