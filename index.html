<p>One of these personalities could write and speak in Serbian and was extraordinarily strong. The page doesn't say that Billy, in his normal persona, could speak in Serbian. How is this possible? And how could one of his personas be far stronger than another?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As for how, the general consensus is that he learned at least some of the language somewhere, and that it took off from there. There are multiple cases dealing with brain injuries that deal with complete changes in personality and sometimes complete changes in language, so an alter ( alternative personality) knowing a different language isn't completely impossible. How Regan knew Serbian while Billy didn't? It's the same as why you might know English better than someone else. Regan is technically a completely different person. So he may think and speak in Serbian as his first language and English had secondary. You have to understand that the question isn't really why Billy can speak Serbian, it's where did Regan learn Serbian from. It wouldn't have to be a lot, just enough for Billy's brain to learn more. </p>
<p>Example: You know the French word for dog and door. You see a dog walk through a doorway. Someone says in French &quot;the dog walked through the door&quot;, you can figure out which word means &quot;walked&quot;. Now you know the French word for &quot;walked&quot;. </p>
<p>The brain is capable of amazing things. Absorbing a language isn't that hard for a brain wired to do so. That's why there are some people who can learn and speak in multiple languages easily, while someone else under the same circumstances, with the same opportunities, may not be able to learn a second language to save their life. Once the Regan personality fully developed he probably just went and interacted with Serbian people and media, which expanded his vocabulary.</p>
<p>As to how he can be stronger while still only possessing the qualities of Billy's body, that deals with Regan's mindset. </p>
<p>Have you ever seen people psych themselves up before lifting a heavy weight? Or someone else is yelling at them to &quot;get mad at it&quot;? People tend to exert more force when they're angry, even if you discount adrenaline as a factor. People tend to be stronger than they know, but without proper motivation or the proper mind set, they don't exert their full capability. </p>
<p>With Regan being the angriest personality (he was referred to as the &quot;keeper of hate&quot;) he would be more likely to put more effort behind something than Billy would. Therefore he'd be utilizing more of their body's capability (basically putting more &quot;umph&quot; into it) than Billy would.</p>
<p>In other cases, it comes down to the simple fact that the brain is the epicenter of DPD, and the brain tells everything else what to do. It could simply be that Billy's brain is convincing his personality that he's weak. He goes to pick up something, and he can't because his brain tells his muscles that they can't handle the weight, while it tells Regan's personality that they can. </p>
<p>When dealing with the traits of different personalities, outside of obvious answers, you start getting into unsolved neuroscience. Unlocking the brains full potential. If someone could figure out and reproduce how Regan learned Serbian without Billy really trying, they could make a whole lot of money selling that ability to people. There are cases of a personality having a disease that the others didn't. Why? Because no matter what condition your liver/kidneys/lungs/whatever are in, if your brain convinces them that they're not working, then they'll stop working. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you talk about DID, it's important to remember that <strong>there is no objective, empirical way to measure or evaluate claims of DID</strong>. In fact, there isn't even a universally accepted definition of the disorder. There is no measurable biological information that one would expect to observe with imaging like fMRI. It's just...what someone says is happening to them.</p>
<p>The leading theory is that trauma or stress causes dissociation and you &quot;forget&quot; about connections, which allows you to create separate identities. Say you have three groups of traits. Normally, you see yourself as the whole of the three. It's theorized that some people who dissociate lose whatever ties bind those that group together, leaving three separate groups of traits that appear as three separate identities. But <strong>there is no study that has ever demonstrated this mechanism</strong>.</p>
<p>Another theory is that alter identities are actually hallucinations, and one is experiencing psychosis not DID.</p>
<p>Now, dissociation as derealizing or depersonalization are well-studied reactions to stress, anxiety, trauma, etc. But they don't make people forget who they are.</p>
<p>With the Billy Milligan case specific, not criminally responsible is a <em>legal opinion</em>, not a medical diagnosis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remembered reading about this a while back ago and had to do some googling to find his answer but /u/jiggity_gee did a pretty good ELI5 on this. </p>
<p>Edit: This is mainly about diarrhea than regular poop.  </p>
<p>&quot;So your bowels are like a long train track and your food is like a set of cars on the track. Transit time between Point A, your mouth, and Point B, the chute, is a bit flexible but normally operates on a regularly scheduled basis.
When you eat, you put cars on the track and send them to Point B. As these cars go to Point B, they lose passengers (nutrients) at various points in the thin tunnel portion (small intestine). The journey isnt complete and the journey has already altered the shape of the car pretty significantly giving a rusty color. Once in the larger portion of the tunnel, the cars are checked for stray passengers and are hosed down a bit so that transition out of Point B isn't so bad. Sometimes, the train cars park juuust outside the gates of Point B so they can exit at the best time for the operator (toilet).
Now, all of this goes fucking nuts when you load a bad set of train cars at Point A. The track sensors located everywhere along the track, detect this alien set of cars and sends a distress call to the Supervisor (your brain). The Supervisor wants to handle the situation without having to phone the Manager (your consciousness) about the craziness on the tracks and also wants to make sure you never know it was on the tracks. It has to make a choice now: send it back to Point A violently and somewhat painfully risking tearing the tracks, or send it to Point B as fast as fuck? Depending on where it's located on the track, it'll choose the best route.
Let's use the destination Point B. The Supervisor hits the panic button and puts all the train cars that are on the track (in your body) on overdrive. The tunnels are flooded with water and lubricant to speed all the cars up and get them the hell out of there as quickly as possible. Cars collide with each other, and previously well formed cars are just flooded with water and lubricant that they are just a soggy, shadowy reminder of their former glory state.
The Media (pain) hears about the car collisions immediately begins filming live the high speed, flooded train cars out of control. They want to knos how an alien set of train cars were put on the tracks and they want someone to pay for such carelessness. The Manager is just watching the horror unfold on Live TV but cannot do anything to stop it, because the Supervisor was deaf and he had not installed a means of communicating with him after hours in the office.
I hope this answers your question.
TL;DR when you get diarrhea, everything gets pushed out, one way or another. There are no passing lanes.

Expansion and irritation of your stomach leads to the activation of your enteric nervous system, which is a network of nerves running all throughout your GI tract. This activation leads to peristalsis and movement of the colon to make space for the new &quot;to be digested&quot; food. It takes hours to make stool from your food, it never runs right through you. Certain irritable foods can make your enteric nervous system get a little testy, so that's why that Indian curry seemed to come straight out.

<p>Edit: In the hopes of sparing my inbox some grief, let me explain. The fact is there are many reasons why eating can trigger defecation and OP's question is non-specific. I still think my answer is the most common reason as OP didn't mention anything about diarrhea or corn or contaminated food. Other mechanisms are also valid and have been well covered in other responses. Also spelling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When food exits your stomach to enter the intestines, it's blocked by a valve called the pyloric valve to keep you from overloading your intestines with too much volume. Your body, wanting as much nutrition as possible because it doesn't know you plan on eating again, will hold as much food in your large intestine as possible for as long as possible because the longer it's in there, the more nutrients are absorbed.
So, when you eat and the pyloric valve is opened, that is a signal to your large intestine that &quot;hey! We have food again! Get rid of that old shit (pun intended.)&quot; This caused your colon to contract and poop out what, at this point, may be day or two old poop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The smaller canal has a bigger resistance to flow and allows less &quot;current.&quot; However, downstream the two canals still meet back together at the same &quot;voltage&quot; elevation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>V= I*R This basic, foundational equation demonstrates that voltage can stay constant as current and resistance vary. As long as current and resistance change proportionally.</p>
<p>Another important consideration is that if node 1 is the high side of the resistors and node 2 is the low side, voltage can only have one value at node 1. Same for node 2. It's analogous to pressure in a pipe. If there were two plumbing routes from node 1 to node 2, pressure would be a single value at each node. However, flow would be determined by the resistance in each route. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is a combination of what /u/ajent123 and what /u/Mininni have said. </p>
<p>Ultimately it depends on the size of the studio.  A lot of porn studios are extremely legitimate and professional.  In that case, they pull permits for their scenes the same way any film studio would, and have a highly controlled environment, where extras have given consent, camera crews are standing by, as well as a full set of professionals for hair, makeup, etc.   </p>
<p>A smaller studio will most likely <em>not</em> do this, because it is difficult and costly, but also because they have less to lose.  A large studio is a legit operation, with insurance, payroll, probably investors and parent companies.  They need to be &quot;by the book&quot;, but they also have the money and legal teams to figure out the logistics and make sure everything is above board. </p>
<p>A smaller studio or freelance film crew can take the risk, film the scene quickly, and get out before they're caught.  If they are caught, they may face fines, and may either just pay them or get out of dodge, depending on what they get served for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh I have a small story about this.<br />
I went to a large public university (UCLA) and one time I saw these two blonds walking around in skimpy clothing (not much skimpier than normal since it was a sunny day in Southern California) but they were particularly standing out.  They were on Bruinwalk which was the main walkway towards and from the dorms.<br />
As I was walking towards them/back to my dorm I recognized one of them.......vaguely....They also had one guy in front of them shooting something on his large camera. No cones set up, no tape, just two girls walking and a guy filming them.   Didn't think much of it since there are lots of famous people that visit the campus so I couldn't pinpoint who it was anyway.     </p>
<p>Fast forward a year or two (can't remember how long) and I was watching this adult video and  whaddaya know, the &quot;setting&quot; was on a university campus and it was the same scene that those two actresses were shooting that day!  I tried to locate myself in the video and I could faintly make out my backpack in the background, it wasn't particularly crowded that time since it was during classtime. This was a large famous studio too, I can't remember the name of the video/studio though but it was easily recognizable, they didn't shoot the actual sex acts in public, it was just used as a setting.  </p>
<p>Also I've walked into many, many, many filming scenes of &quot;Lifetime Channel&quot; movies walking around campus, like literally into the front of the camera while it's rolling cuz they don't rope anything off. They give no fucks at all and it looks like they shoot without a permit or telling the school's administration. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oil doesn't all come from the desert. There is a <em>lot</em> of oil in the arctic circle. Alaska has a lot of oil, as does Norway, and many places more. There's also a lot in jungle areas as well.</p>
<p>As to how it got there, well, the surface of the Earth is significantly different to how it was 500 million+ years ago. Oil, often referred to as &quot;fossil fuel&quot;, comes from fossilized plant material, animals (like dinosaurs, though little oil would actually be dinosaurs), and microbes in the oceans. While these dead things went further into the crust, the surface of the Earth changed: the climates changed, the tectonic plates moved, etc. So places like Saudi Arabia, the North Sea, Venezuela changed on the surface, but the fossil fuel was still there. </p>
<p>What you're probably confusing is that a lot of the world's oil comes from the Middle East because it is very easy (relatively speaking) to draw it to the surface, but the most of the oil in the Earth isn't <em>in</em> the Middle East.</p>
<p>Edit: and there's a lot of oil in Oceans, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are a ton of reasons why laptop/desktops see more viruses than smartphones and consoles.  I would say the top two reasons said by u/Gnomio1 and u/ckindley argue that creaters of malware are going to focus there energy on what gives the greatest return.</p>
<p>On top of that it comes down to the type of data.  PCs (even most enterprise servers/storage) run block or file data.  Mobile devices (excluding consoles here) tend to access data through object storage.  TL;DR basically means PCs are predictable and the ways we access than is well known.  Mobile devices are still new.  It takes someone who keeps up with modern programming languages to attack.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day there are fewer people who know how to attack mobile devices and it's more cost effective to go after PCs.  Combine the two and there's your answer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Think of what you might target as a producer of malware, whether that's ransomware or otherwise. Going after end users is not going to be profitable. End users don't often have the cash to shell out to ransom their files. So malware producers target businesses that can shell out large sums of cash as ransom (either because they have no backups, have bad backups, or it's cheaper to ransom the files and restore than to recover the backups). With certain industries there may be trade secrets to steal and sell, or perhaps a state-sponsored malware attack on the strategic utility or industry.</p>

<p>The issue is that on a PC a user is getting everything from a third party rather then from an &quot;app store&quot; that is managed an authority. This often leads to people downloading malware as Trojans while trying to find a bit of software if they navigate to the wrong URL or find the wrong bit of software to do a job they need.</p>
<p>This is more apparent on mobile when people start downloading apps on Android from sources other then the Play Store this is why by default this is blocked and has to have a setting changed before you can do this. </p>

<p>If the US stops paying its debts as planned, folks are going to stop buying their bonds.  Should they ever want to raise cash through debt again, nobody's going to buy their bonds again without some kind of (expensive) garauntee.  </p>
<p>A large-scale example is Dubai in the UAE.  Seeing their oil reserves drying up, the royal family started converting their largest city into THE Muslim tourist destination.  Turns out after certain world events Muslim folks don't always feel welcome in Paris or Disneyworld.  They set out to build 7-star resorts, rediculous luxury activities, some of the tallest towers in the world, and even fabricated whole designer islands.  </p>
<p>At first this was all financed by the royal family, but as that cash dried up they sought out foreign investors.  When they started having cash flow issues due to a lack of tourists, they simply stopped paying debts.  Tons of people got hosed, but as you said nobody can really repossess a whole country, and invading a small non-militant country is really bad mojo on the world stage.  So almost overnight Dubai's construction progress virtually halted, as nobody was lending to fund further development.  </p>
<p>Another consideration is that world debt brings world peace.  The US famously owes China trillions. That means we're paying trillions worth of interest payments each year in debt service.  Should we go to war with China, you can pretty much garauntee that we'd cut those payments off the first day and zero the debt in our books.  That's a massive blow to Chinese income, so whatever they're willing to go to literal war over would have to be worth the hit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They pay to bondholders, who bought US treasury bonds. Every once in awhile, the US (or other country) essentially hold an auction, and people who want to buy bonds, do so. After buying them, they'll get paid back according to the return on the bond</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whom do they owe to?
It depends on the country, but most owe it to citizens, and some foreigners. If i recall, ~60-70% of the U.S debt is owed by US citizens. </p>
<p>Most important, whats the need for US to be paying back its not that someone is going to come and foreclose.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mainly in order to be able to borrow in the future. As a sovereign nation, they can basically tell creditors they're screwed, and there's not much anyone can do to stop that. However, this would obviously hurt people's trust in the countries' ability to pay in the future, and they'll have a harder time selling bonds in the future (usually they can still sell bonds, but they have to offer nicer terms to make up for the chance they're going to screw creditors again).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>whom do i pay?
While you can't buy out the bonds directly * , there is a form on your taxes where you can pay more than you owe to the Treasury.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>technically it depends on the bond. Some have buyout clauses, though you would have to pay extra for the privilege. but especially in the U.S. case, they don't <em>want</em> to be paid back early. It's safe, free profit for them (although the return is rather low. iirc Treasuries right now are going for something like .5-1.5% . better than nothing though)</li>

<p>When the US borrows money, they hold an auction, in which people give them 10,000 (usually in large multiples of $10,000) for the right to receive a few interest payments per year and $10,000 when the bond matures.  These bondholders can be almost anyone (it's likely tough for Cubans to collect) and the bonds can be resold on the secondary markets.  The US collectively owes whomever owns the bonds at any given moment (which includes almost everyone via mutual funds that own at least a few bonds).  </p>
<p>The US pays its debts because it wishes to maintain it's stellar credit rating (the US has never defaulted on a debt in it's entire history).  That means when the US wants to borrow money, nearly everyone in the world is interested in lending money to the US.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, who owns the national debt? A pretty large part of it, about 20% is actually just one department of the government owing money to other departments. It's not unusual for one department to borrow money from other departments in order to fill in budget shortfalls.</p>
<p>The next 40% or so is held by US citizens and companies. These are in the form of US Treasury Bonds, which are a type of savings bonds that anyone can buy. If you own the bond, the government owed you that amount of money with interest, due on the date the bond matures.</p>
<p>The remaining 40% or so is owned by a mix of foreign governments, companies, and individuals. This is also in the form of Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>In theory, you could go out and buy $10 Trillion dollars worth of these bonds from anyone willing to sell them and then formally forgive the debt. I'm not sure what this process would entail, but it might be as simple as destroying the bonds. It could be much more complicated though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In practice, as others said, it's not instant, they technically put it into a fund reserved for paying off bond holders, and the treasury pays out as they come due, if it was $10 trillion I'm sure lawmakers would find a way to withdraw it before the treasury pays down that debt.</p>
<p>As for forclosure, not possible, a bond is something that says &quot;I owe you $x on this date&quot;, if you say you want it back early, they don't really have to pay. And if the US did default, there isn't really anything anyone can do about it, the US government controls their bonds, and there isn't any higher authority they answer to (unless you count the rest of the world going to war over it). In practice, it's bad for the US if it happens, if they failed to pay it, the mutual funds owning the bonds would simply end up zeroing out the bonds that went unpaid, vaporizing money out of the fund, and everyone with a retirement account would be upset about losing money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question. Here's an analogy.</p>
<p>Imagine you throw a ball in the air - really, really hard. After the ball leaves your hand, it is moving up in the air. Now, if someone looks over and sees this ball flying up in the air they might ask &quot;How is that ball flying through the air on its own!?!?&quot; Of course, it is because you threw it!</p>
<p>This is exactly what happened with the Universe. Based on our current understanding of Cosmology, the Big Bang caused the Universe to begin expanding very rapidly. Why? That's a great question and still one of hot debate.</p>
<p>So what happens next? Well, in our ball analogy, the ball will slow down as it gets higher and higher due to the force of gravity of the Earth. This is exactly the same for the Universe. Due to the gravity of all the stuff in the Universe, the expansion of space slowed after the Big Bang. In fact, if the total mass density of the Universe was above some critical value, the Universe would eventually halt its expansion and begin contracting, just as the ball will eventually reach its highest point and start falling. </p>
<p>Perhaps the Universe did not have enough mass density to cause it to recollapse? Then what would happen? Well, that would be like if we threw the ball so hard that the force of gravity of the Earth could not stop it. The ball would slow down for a while, escape the Earth's gravity, then coast along forever.</p>
<p>These two ideas are summarized <a href="http://www.nat.vu.nl/~wimu/Varying-Constants-Pictures/Time-Scale-Universe.jpg" target="_blank">in this figure</a>. The x-axis is time, and the y-axis is called the &quot;scale factor&quot; which is a way of visualizing the size of the Universe. In our first example, we would be in a &quot;closed&quot; Universe where the Universe eventually re-collapses and we get a &quot;Big Crunch&quot;. The second example is like the &quot;Flat&quot; or &quot;Negative Curvature&quot; lines where the ball just coasts on forever.</p>
<p>You might have heard that the Universe is accelerating. That was one of the greatest discoveries of our time. Now we have a completely different scenario. Imagine if you threw up your ball, it went up and slowed down a bit, but then suddenly it started speeding up and flying higher and higher, faster and faster. You would assume some magical force is pushing the ball up, and you would be right! This seems to be what is happening in our Universe. We've given this mysterious force the name &quot;Dark Energy&quot;, and it is causing the Universe to accelerate! This is indicated by the &quot;Dark Energy&quot; curve on that graph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another important concept to understand is that nothing in the universe is <em>traveling</em> faster than light. Galaxies moving away from us at 400,000,000 m/s aren't actually moving through space that fast. What is happening is the &quot;metric expansion of space time&quot;. In other words, space itself is what is growing. As an analogy, imagine a 4x4 grid that is 1&quot; per unit at t=0. You are at (0,0) and there is a planet at (2,2). We can see with the Pythagorean theorem that the distance to that point is sqrt(8) inches away. </p>
<p>Now, the way to think of metric expansion is that at time t=1s, you are still at (0,0) and the planet is still at (2,2). We would say that the planet isn't traveling right? But now our initial 4x4 grid is 2&quot; per unit. And our new distance is sqrt(32) inches away. The object is now 4 times further away, but its actual position on the grid is the same. What has changed is the <em>size of the grid (space) itself</em>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to try my best to explain this, but it can get complicated. To understand how this works, you would need to understand how a key cylinder is made and how the key interacts with the cylinder. We'll use a 6-pin cylinder as an example.</p>
<p>Starting with the key, as you know there are several grooves along the side of the key. This designates the keyway. Each keyway is usually specific to a manufacturer like Schlage or BEST. When you look at the cylinder on a lock, where you stick your key in, it isn't a straight line, it's a series of jagged shapes that correspond to a keyway. Typically keyways are designated by a letter, for example &quot;C keyway&quot;. This is done so that a key with the C keyway grooves will not work in a cylinder with an A keyway.</p>
<p>The notches on a key correspond to the pins inside the cylinder. There are 6 pins in their own chambers within the cylinder. In each of these chambers there is also a spring so that when you take the key out of the lock, the pins will return to their original position. When the key is inserted into the lock, the grooves push the pins into alignment allowing you to turn the key and unlock the padlock. </p>
<p>The pins in each chamber vary in size and are placed in a sequence called the bitting format (I'll touch on this later). The various pin sizes are given a number 0-9, zero being no pin and nine being the largest pin. These pins are placed in a sequence to create a combination. Keys are cut to these different combinations so that one key doesn't operate every lock. </p>
<p>Now, remember that bitting format? The bitting format is a sequence that allows us to come up with 4096 possible combinations. How did I come up with that number? Using the 0-9 size pins I mentioned earlier, you would put a different sized pin in each chamber. For Example:</p>
<p>965857
965859
965851
965853</p>
<p>Each of the 4 combinations above have to be operated by a different key (assuming there is no cross keying or master keying, but that's another time). When coming up with these combinations, it's important to note that no 2 numbers in the sequence can be the same when they are next to one another, which is why I left out 965855. Since this is the case, there are only 4 possibilities per sequence group. Since there are 4 possibilities per group and 6 pins, 4^6 is 4096 possible combinations.</p>
<p>Out of those 4096 there also arises the issue of ghost keys, which are keys that are so close to another combination that it's possible for them to accidentally unlock another cylinder. This is why your friend's key will sometimes work in your lock. Typically there is keying software that eliminates these groups before the bitting list is finalized, but when things like padlocks are mass produced, they reuse the same bitting format because of the limited number of combinations. </p>
<p>So to bring this all back around, because of the different pin combinations in a cylinder, there are around 4096 possible combinations (minus ghost keys) that can be used when mass producing padlocks. They are all operated by a different key that is specific to the padlock's keyway. </p>
<p>I realize this is too much information and there were some points I didn't touch on...but it's fun to explain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lock has a set of pins of various sizes that when lined up correctly allow the lock to turn. Depending on the lock, there's usually about 4-6 pins. For a 5 pin lock, let's say there are 15* different pin sizes that can be put in any permutation. The number of permutations P(15,5) gives 360,360 unique locks. </p>
<p>During manufacturing they just rotate through different pin sizes either at random or according to a process which ensures that no two identical locks end up in the same lot.</p>
<p>* 15 comes from looking up the number of sizes in a Schlage pin replacement kit. Some pin replacement kits have up to 28 sizes which would result in 11,793,600 unique pin sets for a 5 pin lock, or 271,252,800 for a 6 pin lock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Any given lock has a number of spring loaded pins that can have a small number of positions, the cut of the key moves the pins up and down to align break points with the edge of the lock cylinder so that the lock can turn.</p>
<p>A cheap lock might have 4 pins and each pin has 5 possible heights that it can be cut to.  Such a lock would have 5^4 possible combinations, which would be about 500 different keys.</p>
<p>a more well made lock might have six pins capable of 10 positions, and that would give you 10^6 possible combinations, or 1,000,000 different keys (that said, a lot of combinations near all high or all low would tend to be avoided- you wouldn't want to be able to open the lock with what was essentially a key blank)</p>
<p>high security locks may have additional features like angled teeth that rotate the pins to a necessary position, which adds another dimension for potential unique keys, as well as making picking the lock much more difficult.</p>
