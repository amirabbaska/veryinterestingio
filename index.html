		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Power Transmission Engineer here.</p>
<p>The power is mostly likely off in 99% of these areas. If the utilities are doing their jobs correctly, then relays, lockouts, circuit switchers, and the like would have operated, isolating these customer's from power.</p>
<p>Those that are still getting lights are probably on back up generators.</p>
<p>Now, lets talk about the dangers of having power in a flooded house. These people are taking their lives into their own hands here. <strong>ANY</strong> electrical that's been exposed to water, especially breaker boxes is considered damaged beyond repair and <em>MUST</em> be replaced. Why? Corrosion. All these contacts, especially with active voltage and current in the lines, are corroding as we speak.</p>
<p><em>ALL</em> wiring and components will have to be replaced, it is part of the restoration process to get your power restored to the house.</p>
<p>Next, we'll talk about what's happening to the grid in these areas. Power comes to your house via a substation, any of these substations that went underwater, whether these cables were buried or not, will have to most likely be ripped out and be replaced.</p>
<p>If any of the power that is coming from the utilities is still on, then their protection schemes have failed and there is something poorly planned in their relay performance/design area. By rights, if they are competent engineers then the following should have happened:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Water floods the switch yard, and shorts out lets say a breaker. The breaker should be wired to do its job, break the current and lockout. Meaning it cannot be re-engaged unless an operator is on sight. With the loss of power to the breaker, the relay protecting this part of equipment would see a &quot;Loss of Potential&quot; at the breaker, thus tripping a lockout again, creating another point where an operator would have to reset it.</p>
<p>With water now in the switch yard, the sub house will most likely be next to go out. Station service is provided by special potential transformers, called SSVT (station service voltage transformers) these devices take bus voltage from the PT's and sends it to be converted into DC and powers a battery set. These will be protected by their own protection scheme. Seeing that the voltage on a circuit breaker is gone, the bus voltage will drop out, thus dropping the station service. (All lockouts should have operated because of this, again isolating the sub and customers affected)</p>
<p>Now, depending on how this substation operates, it could either be radially fed, power coming from one direction, or networked, power coming from many directions. If the station is radially fed, then anything connected downstream from this sub will be out of power and nothing will restore it until whatever is in the circuit is repaired. If the service is networked, then once this sub goes out, power is restored nearly instantaneously by rerouting through other circuits connected to it, transferring load. (This is why your lights might blink during a storm.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Keep in mind, everything I've talked about either happens in a few cycles to upwards of 3600 cycles.</p>
<p>A cycle is: 60cy/sec, which translates to 1/60th of a second to one minute. It all depends on what the engineers have set this stuff to operate at.</p>
<p>TL;DR: These people still using power have either backup generators or their utilities have failed them. Any flooded house should not have power and are opening themselves up to death. If the utilities are providing power and someone dies of an electric shock then they are opening themselves up to lawsuits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Rainwater in hurricane flooding, although 'dirty' from the ground, may be on the less conductive end of that; not enough to trip breakers. The voltage potential in the water will vary based on the distance from hot points and paths to ground.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electricity is run on an alternating current (AC) which reverses voltage in the pattern of a sine wave. In the US, the frequency of this alternating is 60 Hz, which is a B flat (more of a flat B or sharp B flat, really). Sometimes interactions with surroundings, especially at high voltages like in transformers, can cause a hum at the frequency the grid is run on. In most of Europe, as an example, it's run at 50 Hz not 60 Hz, so you would hear a G (a little sharp) instead of a B flat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, alternating current (AC) oscillates at 60Hz and the buzzing you hear is generated by the second harmonic, so 120Hz. The nearest B-flat is at 116.54Hz, so it's pretty close! The next B is at 123.47Hz, so really you're hearing something that is very much in the middle of B and B-flat. If you were in Europe, where the standard is 50Hz, you'd be hearing something between G (98Hz) and G-sharp (103.83Hz).</p>

<p>As a musician, you might appreciate this story. These jammers were complaining about random humming coming from their amps. Their jam room was close to some overhead wires. It took a while, but we finally figured out that when their guitar strings were parallel to the power lines, the amps would hum, but if they stood so that the guitar strings were perpendicular to the power lines, the humming would go away. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electricity oscillating doesn't produce the sound by itself; the oscillation of electricity needs to move air in order to produce a sound. Air is not influenced enough by electromagnetism at audible frequencies that we would hear any sounds from a direct interaction between the electricity and the air.</p>
<p>The oscillating current of AC electricity creates an oscillating magnetic field, which is especially strong in electrical transformers where the wire is wound around an iron core. The kind of iron used in transformers exhibits a phenomenon called &quot;megnetostriction&quot;, where the crystal structure of the iron grains in the metal changes its length in the presence of a magnetic field. It is this rapid oscillating length change in the iron cores of transformers and other electromagnetic components that results in vibrations that we can hear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you take Germany for example and put it into contrast to the UK, France or Russia. While France, UK and Russia have been empires for hundreds of years with a centralised political system, Germany had scattered regionalism with hundreds of sovereign states. This is the reason why Germany has no AAA city such as UK with London, France with Paris or Russia with Moscow. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This same situation happens in Latin America, with São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Ciudad de México and Rio being larger than any European city. The reason is very well known : developed economies tend to create jobs and education oportunities across the whole country, while 3rd world countries having less resources are still concentrating the best infrastructure (electricity, good roads, plenty of clean water, hi-speed  Internet, etc) and good educational institutions in their larger cities. Entrepreneurs also seek these advantages to their businesses, so a lot of country people migrates to big cities because there are far more jobs there. It's an old and very studied phenomenum, called &quot;êxodo rural&quot; (rural exodus) em Portuguese, for example. These countries struggle to fight it, since it's not good for a nation. </p>

<p>Apart from that, affluence plays a role.  People in more developed can afford a better quality of life, which means more space and better services.  They have the resources to spread out and travel to where the work that people in less developed countries do not.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been about food.  Rice produces more calories per acre than most pre-industrial crops, but also requires more manpower.  This both allows and requires more people to live closely together, and has lead to cultures with greater tolerance of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>We were driving along in a coach bus at 100km/h.  A van driving in front of us slowed down, signaling a right turn at a side road.  Our bus pulled into the oncoming traffic lane to pass them on the left.  The van turned left, and got T-boned by the bus at 100km/h.</p>
<p>As a passenger near the back, it felt like we hit a speedbump.  I just felt light on my seat for a second, then everything was normal again.  We were then confused as to why the bus was pulling over.</p>
<p>The van had its entire side destroyed.  You could see the steel beam that runs down the side of the van in relief, every body panel and window on the left side of the van was crushed.  Fortunately there were no serious injuries in the van (but probably lots of whiplash).</p>
<p>In summary:  momentum is awesome.  As far as I can recall, this bus had no seatbelts.</p>
<p>(Ironic part:  we were watching a movie on the bus.  It was &quot;Alive&quot;, and our bus accident happened shortly after the airplane crash scene was shown.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Town/ city buses drive at about 20-30 mph. They have handles often on sides or the seat in front. They are not legally required to have seat belts atleast here in the uk. And the inconvenience of having to take it on and off every time someone wants off.
On the other hand, coaches or intercity buses travel on highways often faster and are required by law to have them and in proper operating condition. And people don't get on and off as often. These are checked on every inspection and yearly MOT(government vehicle check)
Ps- city buses can drive fast but only when no passengers on board </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of a genetic mutation that causes a specific area of the scalps follicles to be sensitive to DHT - a preprogrammed pattern. It takes a long time for the follicles to respond to the onset of it but eventually it gets ya. </p>
<p>I am bald on top and it actually initially started with me when I was 17 at the very edges of my forehead! So minor it was back then, but 18 rolled by and it wasn't too bad, then 19 it got slightly worse, creating the more defined M shape (no spam at the back first, thankfully), then 20 it progressed quite a lot on the tops of the left and right of the forehead and by 21 it got so bad at the left and right of my forehead that I started shaving my head completely. Realistically I could have just had short hair but meh. Through 21 to 28 it thinned out on top completely so I now have the definitive horseshoe shape if I don't cut my hair, but I shave my head completely anyway. If I run my hand across my head through the middle there is still a quite a few bristles but no where near enough to grow it - I am fortunate my hair is a mousy blonde colour so it doesn't show as much. Fortunately I don't look too bad bald/shaved and kind of suit it. Some people are very unfortunate and do not.</p>
<p>So yeah, testosterone encourages hair growth, but a messed up genetic mutation is why a predetermined pattern of weakened hair, sensitive to DHT is why we lose it. Like all of these things, just like other genetic inheritance of, say, diseases, the onset is unknown but expresses itself within a certain time frame  - this is why some of us get hair loss at varying times, some very late, some super early (like me). For example; my Dad is bald and his Mother, who he heavily takes after, her father was bald. I take heavily after my Dad but he had decent hair till his mid 20s, I didn't. It was a lot more pronounced on my forehead earlier on than on my Father. My Grandfather, who I don't take after much, is bald but that didn't affect him till his 50s. So the genes are all there. My Brother however takes heavily after my Mother, whose father isn't bald nor is my Mother's father (as far as I am aware). So while my Brother is whining about his receding hairline at the corners, left and right of his forehead, and has been moaning about it for years, his hair receding is so minor it seems to me, ridiculous. My brother is 9 months younger than me and he has almost all of his hair. He is at the stage I was at 19/20! (We are currently both 28, but I will be 29 in February).</p>
<p>Blah, rambles. My apologies. A lot of shit will happen if you cherish your locks... Or not. Look at your family history and try not to worry too much. There are ways of slowing hair loss, even if it is genetic Male Pattern Baldness (MPB). However do not go spending fortunes on trying to cure the inevitable. There are cost effective solutions that can slow the process but it isn't a guarantee for everyone. Or, you may be lucky and it may not progress heavily till you are older. </p>
<p>You may experience a roller-coaster of emotions or you may be more chilled about hair loss like I was. There will be moments in your life where you get pangs and thoughts or wishes of having hair or doing something about (transplants, research, etc) but the best way to be is to be accepting of yourself and not trying to please everyone else. My brother once told me that the new people you meet will not find you ugly or weird looking because they have only ever seen you with your head shaved... So yeah that helped me when I had my doubts about going out. </p>
<p>If you are worried and it appears to be progressive, instead of clinging on to hair like it is all there is to life, experiment with shorter hair styles gradually over the years until eventually cutting it to 0.5mm with a trimmer - this means it is a less drastic or shocking change to people you are around rather than going from longish hair to slap head, because stark differences, whether it be hair or anything else is always going to draw attention. You don't have to go cue-ball style. In fact, I never even started using a razor on my head until a couple of months ago! You really don't need to use a razor. Short and tidy 0.5mm hair will show a faint outline of where your hairline is, but because it's very short it looks good, not old man style. Embrace le bald when the time comes, it is not as bad as you think. </p>
<p>All the best dude. Remember, don't worry! (งツ)ว</p>

<li>
<p>95% of balding is due to Androgenic Alopecia, a hereditary gene. You can get them from either your Mother or Father, not just the maternal side as one myth is reported. The other 5% is often due to underlying health issues like Thyroid problems, Stress induced hairloss (Telogen Effluvium) or other conditions called Alopecia Areata, Alopecia Totalis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classic MPB (Male Pattern Baldness) comes normally in two forms. One is the ‘’classic’’ type where you see a recession of the hairline at the temples into a deep ‘M’ shape followed by a bald spot at the crown (around where your cowlick can be). The bald spot often gets bigger and bigger until it joins at the hairline. These are examples of more extreme baldness where the spot meets the hairline and is normally classified under the Norwood hairloss scale as types V, VI &amp; VII. The other type of male hairloss due to genetics called diffuse hairloss. There is not often a recession of the hairline at the temples but instead the whole top goes out over time. Reports have said this is generally a more aggressive form of hairloss but the severity of the hairloss is generally more down to the individual and their genetics. </p>
</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Hairloss in women comes under the Ludwig scale and ‘’generally’’ follows a different pattern to men where the centre parting of hair gets wider and wider.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A link to the Ludwig hairloss scale for women:
<a href="http://haircanada.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/womens-hairloss-scale-birmingham.jpg" target="_blank">http://haircanada.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/womens-hairloss-scale-birmingham.jpg</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hairloss is down to your genetic sensitivity to your own hormones. Everyone, man and women but men in higher quantities have a hormone in your body called DHT (Dihydro-testosterone). It is a far more potent form of Testosterone and gives men their male characteristics such as deep voice, body hair and formation of male genitalia. It is produced in the Prostate, Testicles, Adrenal Glands &amp; Hair Follicles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People say that it is high levels of DHT that cause baldness or high levels of Testosterone but this is incorrect. It’s actually how sensitive you are to your own hormones and how many receptor you have in your existing hair follicles. You could have incredibly low DHT levels but a lot of receptor sites in your hair follicles thus becoming bald or incredibly high DHT levels but if you have very little DHT receptors in your hair follicles then you likely won’t go very bald or at all. Also a myth exists that men who go bald have more testosterone, this is also not true. It's all down to the individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People believe there are other causations and reasons for balding but the DHT theory in combination with chronic but low level inflammation in the scalp (which is why your scalp can itch) is generally the most widely accepted. There is other things regarding KROX-20, WNT pathways, PGD2 and Lactate production but I won’t get into them. They are still being debated and until we have more evidence people generally just tackle DHT as the primary culprit. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the moment the only two FDA approved treatments for hairloss is Minoxidil (Rogaine, Regaine, Kirkland etc) and Propecia/Finasteride. However, both are life long commitments and can come with side effects. Minoxidil is a vasodilator meaning it increases blood supply to the area it is applied. Some people manage to maintain, a lucky few grow some hair back and an unlucky few actually lose hair. Other reported side effects are dark circles under the eyes, shortness of breath, heart palpitations and even aging of skin due to it (allegedly) inhibiting collagen production in the skin. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Propecia/Finasteride first patented by Merck for BPH (Enlarged Prostate) until they discovered it could stop or slow down balding and now produced also elsewhere by other companies is an oral medication that stops the conversion of Testosterone into DHT by blocking the mechanism 5-AR. Some people report good results and maintain or even regrow some hair however in recent years a lot of reports side effects (primarily of a sexual manner) but also of a psychological manner have surfaced. Merck claimed 1-2% of men got these side effects but other studies say it is far, far higher. These side effects can include testicle ache, weak or useless erections, watery semen, loss of libido and depression. Merck claims all side effects should stop once the drug is stopped but some individuals report side effects lasting months or years after cessation. There is a longer list but I will not get into them. I had side effects for 16 months. I was on it for 3 weeks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finasteride/Propecia is often prescribed by a Doctor. It generally comes in a 1mg pill which is to be taken daily but some people take 0.25mg every day or up to 1.25mg every day by splitting the 5mg pills into quarters. 5mg is generally used for enlarged prostate. Propecia/Finasteride stops the conversion of Testosterone to DHT by up to 70%. Whilst people are still not completely 100% the reason a lot of men (but some don’t) get side effects is because they are decreasing their primary male hormone by a large quantity. This medication should not be used by women and ideally not men who have not finished developing (18-21). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are other things that can stop or prevent hairloss but they are likely not very effective. There is a lot of fake and phony products on the market that exist purely to take money from them. Please please do your research before purchasing hairloss products. Forums are easy to find and so is the information. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also HT (Hair Transplants) but they can be expensive, ineffective or give a very un-natural look plus there is alot of dodgy HT doctors out there so DO YOUR RESEARCH should you choose to go down this route. Also alot of Doctors recommend you take Propecia/Finasteride after a HT but if you had side effects or don't want to take medication the rest of your life HT can be only a temporary fix before you lose more hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upcoming treatments:
Science is advancing at an incredible rate but a lot of people complain that we are yet to have a safe cure for balding. I will not go into great detail but there is currently many companies who are working on alternate treatments. There is big $$$ to be made. If you are reading this and are particularly depressed about going bald here are some companies or upcoming drugs you could look into;</p>
</li>
<li>Replicel/Sheseido</li>
<li>Tsuji Hair Cloning</li>
<li>Brotzu Hair Lotion (FIDIA)</li>
<li>JAK Inhibitors</li>
<li>Follica</li>
<li>Follicum</li>
<li>Rivertown Therapeutics</li>
<li>
<p>Allergan (Setipiprant)
-Fevipiprant (for asthma but some evidence theorises it could be very effective for balding)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does curing hairloss even matter?
A lot of people say we should be curing things like Cancer, HIV, MS, Dementia and Diabetes instead of hairloss but currently we are trying to cure all that are listed and hairloss. Just like women deserve a safer alternative to the pill (messing with hormones is not safe alot of the time, the balance is very delicate) men and women also deserve safer alternatives to hairloss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people go bald and it’s not a big deal, they own it and look great and honestly I say absolute power to you. However, many young men and women (typically who go bald faster as it begins earlier) find balding very destructive to their self-esteem and confidence. We live in a world now where vanity is becoming more and more prominent. Not only that but losing hair, particularly at a young age can destroy ones confidence. Especially when you are in the process of discovering who you are. On top of that there is also a stigma against men wearing wigs but not against women and if men are discovered they will often be ridiculed or called ‘’shallow’’ or ‘’vain’’. </p>
</li>
<li>I hope this post has cleared up some information. If anyone notices corrections please feel free to comment and I’ll adjust the post accordingly. I tried not to be biased too much but as a young individual losing their hair fast and young it’s a hard burden to carry, particularly when conventional treatments did me more damage than good. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that hair all over the body has different responses to testosterone (especially when it gets converted to DHT that causes hair follicles to fall out). Beard hair tends to grow more with more testosterone but hair on the crown (front hairline to the the “bald spot” area on the back of he head) tends to fall out due to DHT. Facial hair and hair around the side and back of the head is more resistant to DHT and therefore doesn’t usually fall out (leading to the old man hair we usually think of, i.e. bald on top and front but hair on the side and back of head). This is why hair transplants tend to pull hair roots from the back of the head since they are more resistant to DHT.</p>
<p>I started seeing my hairline recede when I was 24 and I started using minoxidil (Rogaine) and it helped me keep most of my hair. The sooner you start treatment the better the results, but you have to keep using for the rest of your life or it will start to fall out. Minoxidil and propecia (proscar) are the only FDA approved drugs to treat hair loss. Everything else out there has yet to be medically proven to work.</p>
<p>Fun fact, hair lost isn’t actually “dead” but is just in a really long resting phase. Your hair is constantly going from growing, falling out, resting then growing phases. Eventually your hair just rest permanently then you have balding in that area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Testosterone gets converted in the body to something called DHT (dihydrotestosterone) which is useful for many important things in the body.</p>
<p>People have different types of hair folicles and The ones on our head are actually different to the ones on our body, they have a much longer growth cycle and are sensitive to DHT. DHT binds to the hair follicles on the head which makes them weaker and with every growth cycle, the hair will grow thinner and thinner until it can no longer penetrate through the skin anymore. </p>
<p>Hair loss medications use a form of DHT blocker (finasteride, Azelaic acid, etc) combined with other stuff to free the weakened hair follicles from DHT and allow them to regain some or all of their strength.  </p>
<p>body builders, athletes and other steroid users who inject testosterone also end up increasing their DHT levels because there is more test to convert. This is why hair loss is a common side effect of anabolic steroids. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Men go bald <em>because of</em>, not in spite of, testosterone.</p>
<p>DHT is a similar hormone to testosterone.*</p>
<p>How much free-circulating testosterone, and how much free-circulating DHT you have in your blood determine a lot of things.</p>
<p>Male hormones are often spoken of in terms of how anabolic and androgenic they are. Anabolic basically means binding to receptors in muscles and making 'em grow. Androgenic basically means binding to receptors in other tissues and making 'em do other man stuff.</p>
<p>DHT is somewhat anabolic, and much more androgenic than testosterone. When it binds to hairs, it makes them convert from baby-soft, lighter, finer hair type, to old-man, darker, thicker type. DHT is also mostly responsible for the progress of male pattern baldness, thickening and darkening of facial hair, chest hair, and pubes.</p>
<p>Here's a source talking about how male pattern baldness may be related to some sort of disorder with DHT: <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/68082.php" target="_blank">http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/68082.php</a></p>

<p>It is a proposed unit of time that represents the smallest individual unit of time.  There is another proposed unit of time, called the Plank Time, which is another possible theoretically smallest individual unit of time.  (Much like the Plank Distance, which is possible theoretically smallest individual unit of distance.)</p>
<p>Both units of time are proposed the smallest quantum, they assume time is not continuous but has tiny steps between each instant.</p>
<p>It is also used in fiction as a particle or blob of time, mostly as a plot device for people moving through time in the story.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what evidence is there that it actually exists?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the unit of time version, that's like asking what evidence there is that a second exists, or that a minute exists.  It is an extremely short period of time, possibly the shortest discrete unit of time, much like the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4.  If the theories are correct then fractional time between them like 1.02 or 2.412 don't actually exist, they're bumped to the nearest time increment.</p>
<p>For the fictional particle, they're something writers like to use for plot twists, and they don't actually exist except in the book, movie, or game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know more about this than a lay-person should, but that's perhaps because I'm considering starting a business in this area. On this, you can AAMA - I know quite a bit.</p>
<p>I also know this is <em>way</em> more info than you actually care about, and nobody is going to care about this, but I enjoy talking about it, so, here goes:</p>
<p>The system you're talking about in tennis is called <a href="https://www.hawkeyeinnovations.com" target="_blank">Hawk-Eye</a> and the first time I saw it in use was during a cricket match being shown in the UK where the broadcaster had brought it in to understand very subtle decisions almost impossible to judge by eye (cricket has a rule called &quot;LBW&quot; which in particular, is hard to get right sometimes by sight), and it quickly got engrained into the top tier of the game.</p>
<p>There are other systems as well. Ever wondered how &quot;they know&quot; your favourite soccer player has run 18.2km this game? That's almost certainly from the <a href="http://chyronhego.com" target="_blank">ChryonHego</a> Tracab system.</p>
<p>When it comes to pass completion, shots on goal, etc. that data is probably coming from another system called Opta. That relies on a mixture of camera tracking and human event classification (they have people at games saying &quot;that frame was a pass, that frame was an attempt at goal, etc.&quot;</p>
<p>In Rugby the players are often wearing positional tracking devices that also track heart rate and letting coaches know how players are performing in real-time. I believe NFL does this too.  Basketball has a mixture of systems, and in cricket, they have even more toys (I'll come back to that). </p>
<p>You are probably also aware that in motorsports, the objective has become &quot;a driver moving as large a collection of sensors as possible around a track as quickly as possible&quot;, because the more sensors you have, the better you are at managing the data, the more likely you are to win. Hilariously, just this weekend, one F1 team has shown that their <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/alonso-qualifying-spa-honda-mclaren-945396/" target="_blank">positional analysis is easy to fool and can lead to stupid decisions</a>.</p>
<p>The positional tracking systems all have similar concepts: film something, then analyse each frame. In the case of Tracab and Opta, they're happy with 25 frames per second, the same as most broadcast TV systems. I would argue it's a little too low for accuracy.</p>
<p>Hawk-Eye is a much higher frame rate (500-1000 frames per second) that should aid with the accuracy. Each frame is broken down in terms of object recognition: here are the lines, here's the ball. Now look at the relationship between them and produce a data frame. The data frame will have x, y, z co-ordinates of a ball in relation to a line or some other aspect you care about, and can be fed into a piece of software that can call &quot;foul&quot; or &quot;goal&quot; or whatever you need.</p>
<p>Now, why has it not all replaced officials? It's obviously already used to augment officials. In some tennis competitions you can actually hear Hawk-Eye make a noise on fouls that is effectively taking the place of a linesman. In EPL games, goal line technology using something like Hawk-Eye (not ChyronHego, I believe), is used to let a referee know the ball just crossed the line in case it's not obvious to them.</p>
<p>For some scenarios then, it is being used to replace linesmen. There are three reasons it hasn't yet succeeded in removing them completely, I think.</p>
<p>Firstly: cost. It's not cheap. There are a lot of problems they have to take into account in getting this far. Wind, light, shadows, floodlights causing multiple shadows, they all need to be dealt with. That has led to R&amp;D costs being quite significant.</p>
<p>They are proprietary systems that cost a fortune to develop, and it's a bit of a closed-shop monopoly. Setup requires a fair bit of work and there is normally a team of people running it behind the scenes at each game where this technology is deployed.</p>
<p>That cost is not a problem with the top tier, but the top tier of every sport normally knows its future lies in lower rungs and &quot;grass roots&quot; forms of the game. It's important that even the second division (where these systems can't be used), look and feel like the top tier. And ideally, it should be possible to play the game on a Sunday afternoon down your local park without it seeming to be futile.</p>
<p>Human judges aid with that. They signal &quot;you can do this&quot;. The sports in which that's not possible (F1), still have alternatives, and there are some measurement systems (timing, speed, etc.) that are accessible to teens with a desire to soup up their Corolla.</p>
<p>Secondly: not all in-game events can be tracked using these systems. Hawk-Eye can track a ball near a line being foul or not, but it can't easily tell whether a player's foot is over the line it should not be when serving, for example. </p>
<p>Even in cricket where Hawk-Eye first made its reputation, detection of foul balls (when a bowler steps over a line) has to still be done by umpires and video review. Whether the ball hit a bat or not is done by audio detection (snick-o-meter), and heat-sensitive camera (as the ball brushes the bat, the friction warms it up enough to show as white hot on an appropriate camera). The technology isn't quite there yet to make it possible for these events to be done through camera analysis alone.</p>
<p>Thirdly: accuracy. It's pretty damned good in some scenarios but less so in others. I competed in the Manchester City hackday in July 2016 (was in the winning team, too) where we got access to Tracab and Opta raw data from some historical games. In some of those frames we were seeing the football travelling - according to their systems - at 1,500m/s - which is about Mach 5. It clearly didn't actually do that (I mean, I think Yaya Toure is <em>great</em>, but he's not <em>that</em> good), so where did the error creep in? </p>
<p>That casts doubt, and to my mind, just enough to not allow it to be determining the outcomes of games on which millions of pounds and entries in history books are determined.</p>
<p>Hawk-Eye's higher frame rate is likely to make it much more accurate, so you can see it making more inroads into official calls. It makes most sense in contexts of positional review (cricket, tennis, goals in soccer), and ideally in phased-play games where there is a lot of stop-start and reviews can be done without disrupting play.</p>
<p>Tennis lends itself to all this perfectly, so the only honest answer I can give you as to why it's not everywhere is quite simply cost and the fact some in-game events can't be done through hawkeye so they need the official anyway. They'll defer to humans allow Hawk-Eye on review where it has the time to churn the data rather than in real-time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Then by analyzing the size and location of the ball on the different camera images, they can determine its actual location. </p>
<p>Why hasn't it replaced linesmen? First of all it's extremely expensive to set up, so in the near future it's never going to be a universal system. Secondly I'm not sure if it's possible to have it activated in real-time, to call immediately when a ball is out. Given that in football goalline technology seems to work that way, it looks possible, but I don't know the details. Finally tradition is very important in tennis, which could hold back some possible advancements. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on p7r's magnificient response, the availability is really dependant on the costs and the situation. Currently in tennis, not every big tournament has the system implemented on each and every court. The system is used as a way to contest referees and linesmen calls and not systematically call every single ball inbounds or not. The whole rallies aren't probably saved for data storage purposes, but impact points can be used on broadcast to show statistics (such as where the services landed all-match), and if the system has a 99.9% accuracy mark, there's less likely to be a lot of wrong calls upon using it 1000 times rather than 100000 times.</p>
<p>Also the cameras are obviously situated 360° around, to be as accurate as possible in spotting whether there is a space as small as half of a millimeter between where the ball landed and the line  (which is basically the whole point, to see if the ball and line have a contact). Many cameras are essential because you wouldn't want the player's body to stand in the way of your only camera.</p>
<p>Finally, even if the human eye isn't as accurate as the machine, a linesman wouldn't have system errors or accidentally lose a file. While it's not common, I've witnessed tennis matches where the replay wouldn't be available for numerous reasons, so the game cannot be dependant uniquely on that system for now. Also, a human response is much quicker, and the players love to keep the flow going in a high intensity game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of sports value tradition over technology so its important to still have people on the field saying yes or no. MLB didn't even allow instant replay until 2008 which was decades after it became prominent in other sports and that delay was detrimental to the game. But lots of people opposed it because arguing with the umpire over differences in opinion is fundamental to the culture of baseball. If you scrap the humans, then there is no one to argue with and it diminishes some of the excitement of the game. Tennis is somewhat the same and the drama is a lot lower if there is a computer making the calls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here have been good for certain circumstances, but the integrity checksum and uncompressing are usually stream operations, so they can happen as the file is downloading.</p>
<p>Virus checking and moving the temporary file to it's finished location are block operations, so they would take time at the end of the download.  But those only happen in specific circumstances - many people don't have virus protection and the temporary file doesn't need to be moved across physical drives / partitions, and yet there is still a delay at 99%.</p>
<p>But there is an answer:</p>
<p><strong>File cache flush.</strong> When the file handle is closed by the browser, it asks the OS to ensure that the file is physically on the drive.  This causes the pipeline from the fast memory-based file cache to complete it's emptying out to the slower hard drive.  This mostly happens continuously, but because the hard drive is slower, it takes some time to catch up.</p>
<p>You can also see an opposite effect: for medium-sized files, the first few percent is much faster as the memory cache fills up, then it slows down  when the memory cache gets full or is flushed and has to wait for the hardware.</p>
<p>The size of the cache varies depending on your memory usage, hard drive speed and type, operating system and lots of other factors.  The hard drive flush speed also varies depending on what other programs are using the drive, so it's hard or impossible to roll this in to the download time estimate.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><strong>1. File integrity verification:</strong> Your computer performs an operation on the data you downloaded and compares the result to a checksum. If answer and checksum do not match, the data is corrupt. This is how your computer tells if your file's data is a completely correct copy. </p>
<p><strong>2. Uncompressing:</strong> Some optimised downloaders or protocols (usually modern ones) have built-in compression. Compression reduces file size and helps with download duration. However, to extract the raw file from a compressed one, it needs to be decompressed first. The 1% is decompressing: you may notice the 1% takes longer for bigger files. </p>
<p><strong>3. Virus scan:</strong> Modern browsers also have in-built virus scanning. The process is similar to file integrity verification, but your computer actively looks and matches for malicious code checksums. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, there's quite a bit of a difference. Our bodies are trained to sleep at night and stay awake during the day. If you're sleeping in the daytime instead of the nighttime your body is exposed to more UV light while you're sleeping through the sun &amp; while you're awake through artificial light. This leads to more problems such as increased risk of cancer, harder/longer time falling asleep, harder/longer time waking up, waking up more tired, diabetes, and other health problems. In fact, night shift workers have a 4x higher chance of getting cancer compared to their daytime colleagues.</p>

<p>Edit: Woah this blew up a lot more than I expected it to. In my attempt to simplify things and 'ELI5' I seemed to have raised more questions than I have answered. Here's a list of sources I've used in my thesis which should rectify the points I've listed above. I don't really feel comfortable linking my own thesis, so hopefully, this will do.

<p>One thing I want to point out is that yes using blackout curtains, sleeping in a room without windows, etc. can help counteract most of what these studies are stating. BUT any light/artificial light exposure in the hours leading up to bed and while you are sleeping shifts your circadian rhythm, suppresses melatonin production, and disrupts sleep. This leads to an increase in the detrimental health effects such as diabetes, cancer, hypertension, etc. </p>
<p><strong>It is the sleep deprivation, deficiency, and suppression of melatonin, that mainly causes these problems</strong></p>

Serotonin is associated with sun-light and helps you wake up, giving you focus.
Melatonin is produced at night and makes you feel drowsy, ready for bed.
If you don't follow the sun-cycle for waking up and going to bed you risk disturbing the Serotonin/Melatonin balance.
Low levels of serotonin are associated with a depression called SAD (Seasonal Affective Disorder).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Once I switched to now working 6a to 2p, I haven't noticed a difference. Only thing that sucked was all the bars were closed when I was leaving work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. I'm not an expert in this field but I am someone with a <em>terrible</em> sleep schedule.</p>
<p>Most days I'm awake for ~14hrs, the earlier I go to sleep, the less sleep I need, the later (from the norm) I need WAY more sleep.</p>
<p>Using 10PM as a base, every hour I stay up <em>past</em> that, I need one more hour of sleep. I'm fine with waking up at 6AM if I go to sleep at 10PM but if I go to sleep at 5AM (which is the norm), I need 14-15hrs worth of sleep.</p>
<p>Something I've realized with experience, your body KNOWS when it's day time and when it's night time, if you're not following the 10AM-12M to 6AM-8AM sleeping pattern, you will suffer. I've spent a day or two without any sunlight, clocks or human interaction and my body still knows, it somehow keeps track.</p>
<p>The effects of sleeping late include digestion problems, intolerance to ANY food for a good 4hrs after waking up, <em>severely</em> reduced REM, fog-brain, heavy limbs, lethargicness, lack of reality, productivity, increase in creativity, and most strangely, your empathy and sympathy for others goes to virtually zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
