I would like to find out how likely it is to find that specific value distribution of given the probability distribution that I have but I can't figure out how to calculate this. in other words, I would like to figure out how likely it is that my measured distribution is random or ordered. </p>
<p>In analogy, I thow a dice 1000 times and I get the distribution of results. I want to figure out how likely it is that this distribution of numbers happened by random chance or not. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before answering the question, consider the easier task of determining the likelihood of your distribution given you know the true underlying distribution. Once we know the probability of the outcome given the true distribution, we can begin to look at the set of distributions which could lead to the observation with some bounded probability. We will also show that this set becomes increasingly smaller for more samples, and as a result the distance between the true distribution and any distribution in that set decreases. I will be assuming a discrete probability distribution, but this should not be seen as overly restrictive as that you are considering histograms after all.</p>
<p>Beginning, denote by Q the true underlying distribution, and denote by P the empirical distribution after observing n-independent samples. Writing t(P) to denote the set of all possibilities which lead to an empirical distribution of P, we have</p>
<p>| -n^(-1) log Q(t(P)) - D(P||Q) + (|X|-1)(2n)^(-1) log(2πn) + (2n)^(-1) log ΠP | &lt; (|X|+1) log( 1 + (12n)^(-1) )</p>
<p>where D(P||Q) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback%E2%80%93Leibler_divergence" target="_blank">KL divergence</a> of P to Q, |X| is the alphabet size of X, and Π is the product of the probabilities of the distribution of P (for instance equal heads and tails would result in .25).  Indeed this formula comes first from observing that the probability of any sequence with empirical distribution P has probability exp(-n ( H(P) + D(P||Q))ln 2 ) and then summing over all possible values which result in that empirical distribution. The bounds occur by use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling%27s_approximation" target="_blank">Stirling's approximation</a> in estimating those quantities. </p>
<p>Note that from the formula, n^(-1) log Q(t(P)) converges to D(P||Q), or in other words Q(t(P)) converges to exp( -n D(P||Q) ln 2 ), which is actually fantastic for your purposes. Indeed one can interpret D(P||Q) as a distance (which strictly speaking it is not, since D(P||Q) does not equal D(Q||P) ), between P and Q. Thus, intuitively, the probability of P occurring given Q is exp( -n (distance between P and Q) ). In fact, for the remainder of this discussion I am going to equate Q(t(P)) with exp( -n D(P||Q) ln 2) for simplicity, obviously those extra terms would have to be added back in for a more detailed analysis.</p>
<p>Now we move to the situation where we do not know Q, and instead just know P. Take the set of Q which could result in P with probability greater than n^(-a). Using our formula we see that D(P||Q) &lt; a' n^(-1) log(n) for all such Q. In essence, we have now bounded the &quot;distance&quot; between P and Q, based upon the number of samples of samples. </p>
<p>From that bound, we also have
d(P,Q) &lt; a'' √( n^(-1) log n ),
where d is the L1 distance between distributions, which follows by a simple application of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinsker%27s_inequality" target="_blank">Pinsker's inequality</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since you claim your distribution looks normal, assume it is. Now try to construct a histogram of the the normal distribution parameters (mean and variance). A fairly simple way to do it would be to repeatedly resample your population with replacement (called bootstrapping, I believe). A more sophisticated method would involve creating Bayesian priors of the parameter distributions and updating them based on you samples. I don't know of a nonparametric  method, but I'm sure one exists.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Use a Z test against the probability histogram. You know the population mean and standard deviation and the sample mean and standard deviation. From there you can calculate the probability of your sample occurring in the population. For example, you have a population with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 that is normally distributed. You take a sample of size 1 ( the equation changes depending on how many samples you take but we'll use 1 for simplicity) and get a value of -1. We know that ~67% of results will fall within one standard deviation of the mean, leaving 33% that would be outside of 1 standard deviation with half falling above 1 standard deviation above the mean and half falling below one standard deviation below the mean. Essentially, the probability of getting a mean below -1 or above 1 is 33%. In order to find the probability of getting a result at or below -1 (ex -2,-3 etc) we take 33/2=16.5%. That is, the probability that a sample of size 1 taken from the population has a value of -1 or below is 16.5%. This is obviously a really simple example to Illustrate the point and real samples of larger sizes are obviously more complex but I hope this is sufficient to answer your question. Feel free to respond with any other things you feel are unclear or any other questions you might have and I'll try my best to answer them. </p>
<p>Edit: one more point, because probability distributions involve using integrals, the probability of getting an exact value is 0, which is why we use ranges rather than specific values when calculating probability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>In summary: There are 4 stages of dying. CAS stands for Cardiac Arrest Stage.  </p>
<ul>
<li>CAS 1 - Final heart beat to Final pulse of blood containing oxygen  </li>
<li>CAS 2 - Final oxygen containing pulse to &quot;Delta blip&quot; (short burst of Delta waves on EEG)  </li>
<li>CAS 3 - Delta blip to EEG recordings below 10 microvolts  </li>
<li>CAS 4 - Low voltage (&lt; 10uV) to no electrical activity  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
What's interesting is that in CAS 3, there was an increase in synchronized gamma waves, indicating </p>
<blockquote>
<p>a highly aroused brain, and collectively, the data suggest that the mammalian brain has the potential for high levels of internal information processing during clinical death. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gamma waves are EEG waves that are associated with wakefulness and conscious attention.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The return of these neural correlates of conscious brain activity after cardiac arrest at levels exceeding the waking state provides strong evidence for the potential of heightened cognitive processing in the near-death state</p>
</blockquote>
<p>tl;dr: Near Death Experiences may result from a burst of coordinated gamma waves which occurs after the blood is deoxygenated</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>To summarize, just before death, it was expected that the brain would wind down and slowly stop, but the brain surges with activity. This study was <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/08/12/in-dying-brains-signs-of-heightened-consciousness/" target="_blank">done on mice</a> and also on <a href="https://www.seeker.com/brain-waves-surge-moments-before-death-1764727850.html" target="_blank">terminally ill humans</a>. Similar results were found in both cases. (The story about mice includes some crap about &quot;heightened consciousness&quot; but that is clickbaity, newspaper-selling bullshit.) You start to die, your brain goes haywire for a bit possibly due to a failure of whatever regulates your brain activity, and then it calms down and you pass away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know. There are a number of theories about this. To clarify, while the increase may be exaggerated by people who falsely claim intolerance when they probably have other health issues (or are hypochondriacs), there is actually an increase in people with diagnosable gluten intolerance. And gluten intolerance is different than celiac. I'm taking here about gluten intolerance. Some possible causes include changes in the gut microbiome and changes in how we process and make bread.</p>
<p>Changes in the gut microbiome are a likely cause/contributor but the causes and effects of that are just stating to be understood, and barely. So I won't go into that too much, but if anyone has questions I may be able to answer.</p>
<p>On the processing side, one interesting theory is that the germ of wheat helps us process the gluten in some way. It has lots of nutrients, vitamins, fats, etc. Modern wheat flour (even most whole grain stuff) is made by separating the germ from the rest of the wheat first, then processing. This causes the flour to keep longer but removes all those nutrients. This is why flour/cereals need to be fortified. However, we only fortify with the vitamins and minerals for which we notice obvious deficiencies. So it's entirely feasible that we are neglecting to add something back into the flour that helps SOME people not develop gluten intolerance. This may be via some immune response or due to changes caused in the gut microbe (e.g. we are no longer giving some micronutrients to a specific bacteria in our gut so it dies out. That bacteria helped us process gluten or a byproduct and without its help we get sick). It's also possible that our body just needs some nutrient in the germ to process gluten efficiently. We really just don't know.</p>
<p>Tldr: shits complicated literally</p>
<p>edit: First, I know the difference between a theory and hypothesis. I was using the term colloquially, which <em>even scientists</em> do sometimes.</p>
<p>People seem to have extrapolated way more than they should have from my comment. Like are asking me where to buy bread with wheat germ and how to fix their gut microbes. That's really not how this works. Anybody who gives you an easy answer to your problems is probably trying to sell you something (I'm looking at you, supplement/probiotics industry...). </p>
<p>Until relatively recently we didn't even know bacteria could survive in your gut, so expecting the scientific community to have a solid understanding of the gut microbiome now is absurd. These questions span the fields of nutrition, microbial ecology, microbe-host interactions, immunology, and more. I'm sure there are hundreds of plausible explanations, but we are VERY FAR AWAY from definitively answering most questions related to the gut microbe. We DO know that it affects digestive health, mood, weight, and all kinds of other human physiology. What we don't know is how to bend it to our will or how it causes all of these things. We do know that the answer is complicated. How do different bacteria interact with each other in your gut, and then with your body? We also don't know much about that. But we're learning.</p>
<p>There is a unique soup of maybe 1000 species of bacteria in your gut, and they are mostly different than the species that live in mine. We are just starting to learn how specific individual species of bacteria can affect their hosts. But even with this research, we don't think that it will be the same in everyone.</p>
<p>example: Maybe bacteria A has effect B on me, but it has effect C on you, because I have bacteria Q in my gut and you don't, and bacteria Q is necessary for effect B. Now consider that x 1000 species, and that a genetic component also affects this, and diet and stress levels and fitness also affect this. See where I'm going?</p>
<p>We do know that the gut microbe is influenced by stress, diet, sleep, environmental exposure, your parents, exercise, infection, travel, antibiotics, alcohol consumption, genetics, epigenetics (which is affected by all of these things and more), social habits, sun exposure, etc. Just to name a few. The extent to which these affect each person is probably highly variable. So asking about specific solutions or a quick fix is a waste of time, especially on the internet. And if you have a shitty diet - especially one high in carbs and sugar - or high stress levels, or you drink a lot, addressing those first is probably a smarter solution than asking about wheat germ and special bread and probiotics (may work in some cases for some people sometimes, and usually not as a &quot;fix&quot; but as a supplement. it's just not well studied enough.) and GMOs (no evidence of them affecting any of this or even a feasible mechanism for how they would). </p>
<p>tldr2: no really, shit's complicated. Something that works for one person may not for another for hundreds of reasons that we don't know much about yet, but are sort-of on the verge of understanding. This is also why the human microbiome is so hard to study. Remember, none of this is well researched enough for there to be standardized advice for anybody outside of the normal &quot;live a healthy lifestyle&quot; advice, and slowly figuring out what makes you feel better. So don't ask for a quick fix and don't trust anyone who offers one. Here are some links about the microbiome and a couple on the microbiome and gluten. </p>

<p>edit2: yes, non celiac wheat/gluten intolerance exists. some studies have shown that people who claim to have it do not, but that does not encompass all the literature. the key to those studies is that they were looking at SELF REPORTED gluten intolerance, so basically your average &quot;but gluten&quot; person, not people who were medically evaluated and thought to have it. turns out you just have to find the right people to study (who actually have it). just skim this google scholar search and you will see significant evidence of its existence: <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=non+celiac" target="_blank">https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&q=non+celiac</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Their postulate was that for the vast majority of people, gluten isn't the issue. Sure there are some people for whom the gluten is the problem, they just assume it is because modern bread doesn't agree with them because of the accelerated processes they use to make it. Or perhaps there used to be something in bread that prevented gluten from having such an adverse reaction.</p>
<p>It used to be that bread was fermented. The dough was a living, breathing colony. In more recent years, to speed up the bread making process, instead of allowing the natural bacteria in the water supply to thrive in the wheat and change it - they instead use &quot;clean&quot; additives, such as yeast.  Due to this, there are various nutrients that used to be in bread that aren't any more, so manufacturers have also added fortifications in also, to make up for those that were missing and actually have it be nutritious. </p>
<p>TLDR: The bread we eat now isn't really anything like the bread our bodies evolved with. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just so we're clear: Allergy to gluten is a thing, but is different from celiac disease. Both are well-defined and different from gluten intolerance, which is less clear. </p>
<p>The most common explanation for increased allergies is the hygiene hypothesis. The idea is that aggressive modern hygiene removes the parasites and bacteria that help calibrate the immune system, leaving it more likely to react to harmless targets.</p>
<p>It's also been suggested that modern wheat could be more allergenic. The cross-breeding of new wheat strains in the 1960s, which allowed us to feed billions of people, could have selected for a protein variant that immune systems just don't like. Modern wheat processing has also been noted as a potential contributor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a little off topic : one thing I read a long time ago in nature before the anti-gluten trend we're seeing.  It was an article about fibre in our modern western diets.  and how we lack a lot of fibre in our diets and how the lack of fibre causes the lower intestines to not be healthy, getting swollen and enflamed.  When the lower intestines get to this stage, gluten can and has been shown to pass through the walls into the blood stream. At that point, once past the barrier,  problems occur.  It was a good read and I'm sure I'm paraphrasing it way wrong, but what I took from it, because our diets are bad in one way it's causing other problems to appear.  And you didn't have to have an allergy or Celiacs to see some of the problems appearing.   note: I think this is very different then the trend we are seeing today where everybody is afraid of the &quot;glutens&quot; </p>

From an evolutionary perspective our bodies are designed to react very intensely to any kind of trauma in that particular anatomy. Our goal is to reproduce, and getting your seed sack whacked isn't helpful. Over a million plus years, those mutations for a painful nut punch ensure that particular lineage would continue up until you get your dingleberries dung and put out of commission.

<p>Basically France produced an agreement which require developed and developing countries alike to limit their emissions to relatively safe levels. Finance will be provided to poor nations to help them cut emissions and cope with the effects of extreme weather. Countries affected by climate-related disasters will gain urgent aid.</p>
<p>The Paris Agreement (French: Accord de Paris) is an agreement within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) dealing with greenhouse gas emissions mitigation, adaptation and finance starting in the year 2020. </p>
<p>The language of the agreement was negotiated by representatives of 195 countries at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC in Paris and adopted by consensus on 12 December 2015. It was opened for signature on 22 April 2016 (Earth Day) at a ceremony in New York. As of May 2017, 195 UNFCCC members have signed the treaty, 147 of which have ratified it.</p>
<p>After several European Union states ratified the agreement in October 2016, there were enough countries that had ratified the agreement that produce enough of the world's greenhouse gases for the agreement to enter into force.The agreement went into effect on 4 November 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Details -</strong></p>
<p>Paris produced an agreement which require developed and developing countries alike are required to limit their emissions to relatively safe levels, of 2C with an aspiration of 1.5C, with regular reviews to ensure these commitments can be increased in line with scientific advice. </p>
<p>Like any international compromise, it is not perfect: the caps on emissions are still too loose, likely to lead to warming of 2.7 to 3C above pre-industrial levels, breaching the 2C threshold that scientists say is the limit of safety, beyond which the effects – droughts, floods, heatwaves and sea level rises – are likely to become catastrophic and irreversible. Poor countries are also concerned that the money provided to them will not be nearly enough to protect them. Not all of the agreement is legally binding, so future governments of the signatory countries could yet renege on their commitments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This would include a reduction in coal plants and associated jobs,  increasing green energy resources. Each country determined what they could do, and committed to those numbers.
The goal is to keep the global average temp below a 2 degree c increase.
You should care because if we don't make any change, the earth will keep heating, severe weather may increase, droughts may get worse, arctic ice will continue to melt. These will affect global food and movement.
The us is no longer the number one producer of green house gas(may be wrong last I read it was China), but we are a huge contributor. Mainly it's industry not people, but reducing what you do helps too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say for arguments sake that the current extreme weather we are experiencing here in Florida is due to natural climate change like that that has occurred many times in the past. Its a slow process with a devastating impact that will result in starvation and violence as everyone competes to survive and the cost of food and water will increase the worse things get. Now add in the human impact of the Industrial Revolution with its smelting plants going back as far as the mid 1600s and all the plastic that are now polluting beaches due to the volume of plastic we have thrown in the ocean since the 1950s that will help to speed up the natural climate change. Coal use became abundant in the mid 19th century and only recently looks like it will be extinct. And add in vast world wide human development along the coast line and the deforestation to build homes.</p>
<p>So if we are into the early stages of the next natural climate change, why would you not want to take steps to slow it down? Is it because it will not affect you as much as your grandchildren? Is it not being restricted in whatever you want to do and live for the moment? Is it because it will make you rich? Switching from a fossil fuel based economy to an alternative is no different than switching from an agricultural economy to an industrial one. Jobs will be eliminated and others created.</p>
<p>And yes, it will cost more to implement the change. But it is a matter of what account you want to place your money because the money is going to be spent either way. You either spend it on fixing the problem or spend it on your fading health and damage caused by the worsening weather. The reality is you are going to have to fund both. </p>
<p>As for Trump pulling out of the agreement, fortunately we have states rights that say anything not mentioned in the Constitution are reserved to the states. And among them are the big liberal states that have the most industry, GDP and population that will abide by the Paris Agreement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand why not, you have to understand how a battery works. It's not a tank of electrons, exactly. A battery is a chemical reaction between an anode (-), cathode (+), and an electrolyte (or some form of conduit) which facilitates the exchange of electrons.</p>
<p>When you discharge (use) a battery, a chemical reaction is occurring, moving electrons between the two chemicals (anode and cathode). So, don't think of a battery as a vessel which just holds a pile of electricity. It's a specific transfer of energy between two chemicals.</p>
<p>Now, in a rechargeable battery, this reaction can be reversed by applying electricity using a charger. But, again, it's not adding anything, really. It's reversing the chemical reaction which is putting the chemicals back to their original state.</p>
<p>When charging, it takes time for the reaction to reverse and at the same time, heat is created because the electrons are moving back across the conduit they travelled across originally. Electrons moving over a conductor meet resistance which creates heat, no matter which direction. Much like the battery heating up when you use the phone, the battery will heat up while charging for the same reason. If you were to throw a bunch of current at the battery, it could easily cause a thermal issue. Nickel-cadmium (NiCd: pronounced Nye-Cad) batteries had a problem called thermal runaway where the battery, if charged too quickly, the heat generated could induce a self-feeding loop where the battery could heat to a point of ignition or explosion. But that's not an issue with Lead-Acid batteries (like sealed lead acid batteries like in your car, which use a liquid electrolyte, also known as a wet cell [thanks to u/gilescoreywasframed for the correction below]). Also prone are Lithium Ion (LiOn, like in your cell phone) or Lithium-Polymer (Li-PO) batteries (credit to u/incrediboy729 for the correction here), but these usually incorporate circuitry to prevent this situation.</p>
<p>tl;dr - it is dangerous, and modern cell phone chargers and batteries have circuitry to prevent too fast/overcharging which could lead to heat damage or fire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They are an example of a supercapacitor, a battery able to physically hold onto electrons. You'd be able to plug it in, fill it up and go on with your life in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p>This is very different from our current technologies, all of which use an electrical current to reverse a chemical reaction. As everyone is saying this process necessarily takes a while and is fairly inefficient, hence battery chargers getting hot, heat production=wasted energy. This is essentially the same difference between lightbulb types. Incandescents are very inefficient, so they get very hot, CFLs are fairly efficient so they only get warm and LEDs are very efficient so they barely produce heat at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Power (wattage) in a conductor is resistance times current squared.  So when current is flowing in or out of a battery, it is going to create waste heat based on it's internal resistance and the current flowing in or out of it squared.  This means the battery itself gets warmer when it's in use or charging.  And since it's current squared doubling the current quadruples the heat.  If you either charge or discharge too fast, it will overheat.  The result of overheating will depend on the type of battery.

The rust wants to get some glue so it can become metal again. Instead of letting them make their trade normally, by putting both in a bath of basically saltwater, we put something in their way. Now, they have to push it through a pipe to exchange it. the power they spend pushing is used by your phone to play youtube and stuff. How hard they push is called voltage, or how badly they want to trade electrons. Your battery wants to be at 0.00V. If it goes below 2.90V, we won't be able to recharge it, because one metal will be a pile of rust and another will be overgrown from all the electrons the rust gave it. </p>
<p>At too high a voltage, the metals say &quot;lol, screw this&quot; and start doing stuff we don't want, like making hydrogen gas (explosive) or getting too hot. And we also can't recharge them after this. </p>

So n^0 = 1</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is to follow the pattern:
To get from n^5 to n^4 we divide by n
To get from n^4 to n^3 we divide by n
To get from n^3 to n^2 we divide by n
To get from n^2 to n^1 we divide by n
And finally to get from n^1 to n^0 we divide by n.
But n^1 = n, and n/n = 1. So n^0 = 1</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take a look at the pattern below. We can move from one integer exponent, to one less than that integer exponent, by diving by the base.</p>
<p>n^3 = n^4 ÷ n</p>
<p>n^2 = n^3 ÷ n</p>
<p>n^1 = n^2 ÷ n</p>
<p><strong>n^0 = n^1 ÷ n</strong></p>

<p>Assuming that n is not 0 (you can't divide by 0), the answer will always be 1.</p>
<hr />
<p>If you continue this trend, it also provides some insight into negative exponents:</p>

That will usually be enough to get people using whatever the government takes for tax payments. Especially if nobody's printing anything else.</p>
<p>People in East Timor, and the government, can buy and sell U.S. dollars like anyone else. The US doesn't really have any interest in stopping them from doing so, and I'm not sure if they could if they tried.</p>
<p>For a very young country like East Timor, especially given the fragile state of its economy, there's some real benefits to using dollars as their currency: you don't have to ride the rocky currents of inflation and deflation as the markets try to figure out what the heck your money is actually worth. They can get outside lenders more easily, who know they'll be paid back in dollars, not a local currency that could have a very different value in ten years.</p>
<p>It's not without risk, though: American monetary policy does not consider the needs of East Timor, and so the US could tighten up the supply of dollars at a time when Timor needs a looser policy, or vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many nations do this actually.  The US dollar is a highly stable currency that's unlikely to experience significant inflation or dramatic swings in exchange rates.  Taking the local government's currency controls away makes it impossible for corrupt/inexperienced officials to manipulate the monetary supply and cause a Venezuela/Zimbabwe style inflationary death spiral.</p>
<p>It also makes it much easier to do business with US companies and government agencies.  The US is often the largest single trade partner for nations that adopt the USD currency.</p>
<p>If you can get your hands on enough actual paper money to run the local economy many smaller nations go with the US dollar for the extreme stability it provides.</p>
<p>The downside is that you lose a lot of economic control.  Inflation and interest rates are dictated to you from the US and they may not be what's best for a developing nation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/01/timo-j31.html" target="_blank">https://www.wsws.org/en/articles/2000/01/timo-j31.html</a></p>
<p>In short, Timor was occupied by Indonesia from 1975 to 2000. After eventually gaining independence, a UN transition government set their official currency to USD.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The UN Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) announced last Monday that the US dollar would be the official currency of the former Portuguese colony and Indonesian territory. As a result, government transactions must be conducted in dollars for at least the two to three years of UNTAET's expected rule.</p>
<p>Private contracts may still be executed in any currency, but civil service wages, taxes and other payments owed to any public authority must be in US dollars. The former official currency, the Indonesian rupiah, may be used to make such payments temporarily, subject to a yet-to-be-determined transaction fee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Timor depends on foreign aid and their oil exports, both of which are in USD, so this decision is rather practical. They are moving towards their own currency, somewhat.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor_centavo_coins" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Timor_centavo_coins</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>East Timor centavo coins were introduced in East Timor in 2003 for use alongside United States Dollar banknotes and coins, which had been introduced in 2000 to replace the Indonesian rupiah following the commencement of U.N. administration. One centavo is equal to one US cent. The coins are in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 25 and 50 centavos and feature pictures of local plants and animals. East Timor does not yet issue its own banknotes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am Linguist and Cognitive Scientist, Japanese is my best second language and I'm a member of the Unicode Consortium to boot.</p>
<p>TL;DR: No, it doesn't help. Language is different than reading/writing.</p>
<p>I think the biggest misapprehension---and it's a very common, forgivable one---is your question conflates language with reading/writing. They are <em>related</em> to each other, obviously, but cognitively, they are dramatically radically different skills. Learning to read/write has a lot more in common with learning to drive than it does with learning language. For one thing, it's &quot;optional&quot; in the sense that you could choose not to learn to read/write. It takes time and effort and instruction to learn. Language existed for probably 100,000 years before we invented writing.</p>
<p>On the other hand, any unimpaired child in a community <em>will</em> learn to speak the language of the community they are in. It requires no particular effort, no specific instruction, only exposure and it is inevitable. There have been and there continue to exist languages without writing systems; there are no writing systems that are not attached to a spoken language.</p>
<p>So in that sense, the nature and structure of the writing system is pretty arbitrary. That's not to say that there isn't a relationship in which the writing system influences the language---it certainly does in a number of ways. But that influence is not inherently different from the myriad other cultural influences that impact language evolution (like politics or technological advancement).</p>
<p>If English was written using a logographic writing system it wouldn't prepare me to learn Chinese any more than English being written in the Latin alphabet prepares has prepared me to learn Swahili.</p>
<p>So what if you rephrased the question: do Emoji help prime us to learn how to write using a logographic writing system? The answer is still &quot;no&quot;, I'm afraid. And for mostly the same reasons that have already been mentioned. The relationship between the pictographic origins of Chinese characters and their meanings have largely eroded away and what remains is a fundamentally arbitrary association of character and sound.</p>
<p>It may seem like there's a lot more upfront rote memorization to learn Chinese characters---and that may be arguable---but the time and effort it takes to become a skilled reader of the writing system is not very different. A skilled reader of a language written in alphabetic system doesn't read each letter; they recognize the form of the entire word. So in that sense it isn't really that different.</p>
<p>Writing on the other hand... well that's another misapprehension we commonly have---that reading and writing are the same fundamental skill. They are not (although they are, again, related obviously). The advantage of an alphabetic system is that <em>writing</em> is significantly easier. If you know the word and the alphabet you can write it. If you don't know the Chinese character for a word, you're kind of hooped (although chances are you'd still be able to get your meaning across between context and other characters with the same pronunciation). Of course this applies best to truly alphabetic systems of which English is a <em>very</em> poor example.</p>
<p>The Japanese are famous for having an incredibly high literacy rate; what they don't tell you is that it is for <em>reading</em>. Not writing. It's weird for us to think of those things as so different, but, literally---and I have done it---you can flash a less common character at a Japanese person and they'd be able to tell you what it is, how to pronounce it, name compounds it's in... they <em>know</em> the character. Ask them to write if? They'd be completely incapable of doing so without looking at the character for reference.</p>
<p>It is a fundamental fact of human cognition that production is a different and harder skill than recognition.</p>
<p>What you <em>can</em> say is that knowing how to write Japanese would help prepare you to read/write Chinese because, even though they are unrelated languages, the Japanese borrowed the writing system from the Chinese. So the base character sets are similar (although in PRC the character sets are reduced and &quot;simplified&quot;) and their meanings will still be somewhat similar.</p>
<p>But Emoji... sorry. They are pretty interesting in their own right tho.</p>
<p>Also, bit of trivia in case you don't know: Emoji is a Japanese word borrowed into English that was originally a blend of the English word &quot;emotion&quot; and the Japanese word 字 (ji) &quot;character&quot; or &quot;letter&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There are some historical connections to actual pictures, some of which feel very dubious and retrofitted, some of which are plausible. But for the majority of characters you soon realize they are built of subcomponents next to each other. As such you have a word being a bunch of basically arbitrary symbols arranged spacially next to each other, which is the same thing we have in (our Western) phonetic alphabets.</p>
<p>So no. Emojis have zero impact on anyone's ability to learn non-phonetic writing systems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I speak English and Japanese(Spanish also but not as well), I love emojis in the Japanese language, but I find them completely different in English.  We create very different emojis for one thing.. :) brand is highly popular in English, they become so much more complex easily in Japanese however.. they're just standard selection for complex emojis on Japanese phones.  In America, rather than showing the displays, we've moved towards replacing certain smiley types into actual small icon displays.. My favourite to tack onto any conversation is usually either ^^ or ^^;; ... yet I have plenty of conversations with people in English that can't even recognize those as faces at all, and they ask what they mean.  Furthermore, I know a bunch of people that have tried to learn Japanese or even other languages, and not truly been able to succeed.  </p>
<p>This doesn't mean that emojis have no impact on the way we communicate, and it even seems likely that language could plausibly evolve in a more emoji based way... but I would call it relatively separate from current day pictorial languages.. for example, even the simple ones like :) aren't actually written, we're changing to typed languages, and further representations that are too complex to draw easily anyway.<br />
Just for fun, I decided to write this post in Japanese too.
楽しみのために、このポーストを日本語でも書きます！
確かに面白い概念なんですけれども、そうではないと思っています。英語、日本語、スペイン語も話せるんですかが。。。日本語の絵文字と英語の絵文字はまた全く違うと思います。例えば英語だと「:)」をよく使うが日本語ではありません。日本である経験では、携帯を使うことでは簡単に複雑な絵文字を見つけれます。。。(<em>^_^</em>)(=^▽^=)
英語を話しても、私のよく使う絵文字は「＾＾」と「＾＾；；」です。でもこの絵文字を英語で使うと、よく「そのものは何の意味がありますか？」とよく聞かれます。さらに、友達の中で、たくさん「日本語を習いたいなぁ」「他の言語を習いたいなぁ」と思っている人はいるけど、たくさんはしない・できない。
それでも、絵文字は言語と話の言い方を影響しないということではないと思います。それより、絵文字のおかげで、言語の進化になる可能性が高そうです。でも、最近の絵文字をあまり書かないので、今はタイピングすることに変わっているし、絵文字を書かないし、多分この進化はまた他の複雑ものだと思っています。</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Also afaik these systems all derive from the Han-letters. So these days there are traditional Han-letters, Han-letters with a japanese touch, simplified Han-letters and weird Han-letters in some Chinese provinces where people decided to spice it up. The majority of Asian people use alphabetic/abjad/abugida systems though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
