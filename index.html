After the explosive lenses are detonated, you (very briefly) have a solid sphere of plutonium created by the explosion.  However the mass of the plutonium is still 3kg - exactly the same as the original mass.  So I guess my real question is this: is the term &quot;critical mass&quot; a misnomer?

As a child conceived from sperm donation, you don't! There is a valid chance you will sleep with someone related to you. Due to the age of my donor, I'm much more worried about sleeping with a half sibling. I usually sit down with people I'm seeing and ask if there's any chance they were conceived from/a parent donated to a sperm bank.</p>
<p>Worst part is that there's always a chance <em>they</em> don't know. Sperm donation is a bit of a taboo subject still, so some parents never mention it.</p>
<p>I appreciate that my parents wanted children so badly, but it's still an ethical grey area for me. I enjoy being alive, but don't enjoy not knowing my father, not knowing half of my medical history, and wondering how many half siblings/cousins/relatives I have out there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for a DOT in their maintenance side. Most paving jobs consisted of some kind of removal of asphalt (although not all jobs). Each job had a contract and the contract would state what happened to the asphalt millings. Usually the DOT tried to keep them, but sometimes they were given back to the contractor. The term we used was RAC (recycled asphalt concrete) or RAP (recycled asphalt product)</p>
<p>If we kept the millings, we would use it as material, similar to how we would use cold-mix asphalt or gravel. Sometimes we would spread it on old roads that badly needed repaving (but were never going to be repaved for various reasons) or use it to build up eroded sections of road. Some of the other areas had machines that would reheat the RAC to a temperature that melted the asphalt binder (the sticky black tar) and then they could use it to patch potholes. It was probably the ideal choice for RAC however the machines were expensive.</p>
<p>If the contractor got the RAC, they took it to their yard to use on other jobs. I believe a certain percentage of recycled asphalt can be used when making new asphalt, but there may be stipulations in paving contracts saying whether or not it's allowed. </p>
<p>Some jobs reuse the RAC right on site using this train of machinery. Here's a website that explains it. It's pretty neat. <a href="http://m.millergroup.ca/paving_construction/pavement_recycling/cold_recycling/index.html" target="_blank">http://m.millergroup.ca/paving_construction/pavement_recycling/cold_recycling/index.html</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We purchase the asphalt from companies that are repaving the roads. We then have it crushed down to a usable size (1/2&quot;).

We are only allowed to put up to 20% RAP back into our mix, due to concerns that the tar (the glue) has lost some of its original characteristics. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>On 21 May 1946, with seven colleagues watching, Slotin performed an experiment that involved the creation of one of the first steps of a fission reaction by placing two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around a 3.5-inch-diameter (89 mm) plutonium core. The experiment used the same 6.2-kilogram (13.7 lb) plutonium core that had irradiated Harry Daghlian, later called the &quot;demon core&quot; for its role in the two accidents. Slotin grasped the upper 9-inch beryllium hemisphere with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he maintained the separation of the half-spheres using the blade of a screwdriver with his right hand, having removed the shims normally used. Using a screwdriver was not a normal part of the experimental protocol.</p>
<p>At 3:20 p.m., the screwdriver slipped and the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a &quot;prompt critical&quot; reaction and a burst of hard radiation. <strong>At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of air ionization and felt a heat wave. Slotin experienced a sour taste in his mouth and an intense burning sensation in his left hand.</strong> He jerked his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation.</p>
<p>As soon as Slotin left the building, he vomited, a common reaction from exposure to extremely intense ionizing radiation. Slotin's colleagues rushed him to the hospital, but the radiation damage was irreversible.[1]</p>

<p>As for the radiation from Chernobyl. It is unlikely that you would've felt it directly. The peak radiation intensity received by one person just after the meltdown is estimated to be somewhat comparable to the total power output of a standard LED lamp.</p>
<p>However, the radiation coming from Chernobyl, while lower in total intensity, is much more damaging than radiation coming from the sun. Solar radiation is, for the most part, too low energy to be harmful (UV being a notable exception), so even though there's a lot of it, it won't do much. The radiation from Chernobyl consisted of much higher energy gamma radiation as well as other types of ionizing radiation. Forms of radiation that can and will damage living tissue, even in relatively small quantities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>You can get burns from microwaves and beta particles, you would most certainly feel burning and it would be extremely unpleasant, most likely from nerve damage it would be hard to breathe, your eyes would literally be being burnt out of their sockets</p>
<p>I remember reading a story about something that emitted just beta particles that 2 Russians found after a patrol in a vehicle crash, a blizzard set in and whatever it was kept them alive but they suffered burns and the rest of the unit came to retrieve it, they retrieved it by having 1 member pick it up and move it for a certain amount of time before passing it off to another before they suffered radiation poisoning</p>
<p>The Russians solve problems by any means necessary</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually worked in TV before computers. We would make the titles with press-on letters (I forget the brand name) and shoot them with a camera. The title camera would be combined with the live camera in a device called a &quot;luma key&quot; that would switch the live camera off and the title camera on everywhere that the lettering appears, based on the brightness. This was with monochrome cameras. With color cameras there was a device called a &quot;chroma key&quot; that would switch based on hue, usually tuned to blue. The same device was used for example to put graphics behind the weather man. You had to be careful the talent didn't wear any blue clothing.</p>
<p>EDIT: found a web page that shows a switcher with built-in luma key, and explains how it works: <a href="http://www.danalee.ca/ttt/switching_and_video_effects.htm" target="_blank">Switchers</a>. Scroll down to &quot;Keys - Internal, External, Matte.&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT 2: I remembered what the letters were called; Tactype. You can buy a sheet of it here: <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-TACTYPE-Lettering-12-x-8-Sheet-Dry-Transfer-5514-Futura-Medium-/272114690476" target="_blank">VINTAGE TACTYPE Lettering 12 x 8 Sheet Dry Transfer 5514 Futura Medium</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Combine that feed with a feed from another camera and you've got titles over, which you can fade up &amp; down, zoom in and out, roll, whatever. Before computers were used in TV there were devices like Chyrons which substituted for the bright letters on black background and the second camera and gave producers a lot more variety and flexibility.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first live television graphics(commonly called 'supers' or superimposement at the time) were created at a national political convention(iirc Republican National Convention) in the late 60's. They were trying to figure out a way to announce the speakers without having an announcer say the name of every speaker that came up. The director and technical director were at lunch at a diner that had a black menu with white letters. They came up with the idea of using a luminance key to overlay the names. They bought the menu and all of the letters off the diner for less than $100 and that's how the first 'supers' were done before computer graphics. Other ways discussed in other posts were used but as far as I know that was the first. </p>

He introduced cue cards that forced anchors to look directly into the camera, only after his experiment with Braille went nowhere.</p>
<p>At the 1952 national political conventions in Chicago, he created a way of superimposing people's names under their images on camera. The idea came to him at a diner that had a menu board with rearrangeable letters.</p>

These are titles that are combined with the base footage as part of the printing of the film, basically think of cel animation, where the negative is exposed by light passing though multiple layers of film. The title layer or layers can be hand drawn cels, just like in animation, or photographed text.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the comments here are close to the money but don't touch it just right.</p>
<p>Alcohol is a toxin to the body. The main area where it is detoxified is in the liver. The detoxification of alcohol produces a few side products that start to accumulate in the liver cells. The most important one is a molecule called NADH, which is used by liver cells for energy production as well as glucose production. An imbalance in this molecule is created because of the alcohol, so the cells get confused and think there's enough energy, so they stop the cellular power plant, but this also stop prevents the liver from producing glucose naturally.</p>
<p>Your brain requires glucose directly from the blood in order to function properly, so once it starts running low on fuel, it begins to malfunction. This malfunctioning is what shows up as drunkenness. As more and more parts of the brain run out of supplies, you start to become more and more drunk. The outer most parts of the brain get affected the most very early on, and the inner parts of the brain are affected later, because brain blood flow works from inside to out.</p>
<p>The hippocampus is a part of the brain that's located very deep inside the brain. Because it's a very old and basic part of every brain, it gets a lot of blood to stay in tip top shape. When you drink enough alcohol to reduce fuel to this area, your brain cells stop firing properly, and they lose the ability to register new information.</p>
<p>It's kind of like writing with disappearing ink. It's there for 10 minutes while you do it, because there are other parts of your brain that allow you to think and act immediately, but it can't be saved to paper.</p>
<p>This process isn't absolute though. In between, people can eat food, or the alcohol starts to get metabolized and a little more blood glucose comes in. This lets the brain save memory in parts, and allows for atleast partial recollection of the events the next day. It's sort of like keeping a brief snapshot, which your friends help fill in the gap with.</p>
<p>Also, alcohol can directly slow down functioning in the brain by mimicking little molecules that switch off or prevent neurons from firing.</p>
<p>TL;DR</p>
<p>The only thing that's known about memories right now is that they are formed in part by brain cells firing off in particular patterns. These patterns are what make memories. Firing off neurons needs fuel in the form of glucose.</p>
<p>The brain needs fuel to work and save memories. Alcohol tells your body's main fuel factory in the liver that there's enough energy, so your brain runs out of fuel overtime. The part of your brain that makes memories runs out of fuel only when the blood sugars are too low, and that's what makes you blackout.</p>
<p>Plus alcohol also directly prevents neurons from firing off by mimicking molecules that act like brakes.</p>
<p>So it's a bit of a combination of both fuel stoppage, and hitting the brakes too hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<div class="question"><span class="qa" title="Question">Q:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I was looking at what would happen as an object accelerated at a constant rate - say, 300 km/s^2.  From what it would appear from my math, the object would experience increasing levels of time dilation (from the perspective a stationary observer).  </p>
<p>A system of (relatively) stationary observers would watch the clock on this accelerating object, and would record slower and slower increments of time.  It looks like this would create an asymptote, or a point in time that the moving object will never reach.  So two questions:</p>
<p>1) Is my math correct here?  Will this object accelerating at 300 km/s ^2 approach a time that it will never actually reach in my frame? </p>
<p>2) If so, I'm having trouble interpreting the results.  In order for the stationary frame to not be &quot;special&quot;, the moving object needs to be able to potentially reach any time within its future... but doesn't this mean there is no corresponding X,Y,Z coordinate that this object will exist in when the clock passes the time I've calculated as the limit?  Wouldn't this mean that this moving object cannot exist in my universe at that time?  Either way, where the heck is it at that time?  </p>
<p>It seems like this would create a contradiction....    </p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that many of these drugs can take weeks to start taking effect. Every body reacts differently, so it's impossible to say if a drug will be effective in someone.</p>
<p>SSRIs stand for Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors. Basically, when your brain sends a signal to certain nerves, it releases serotonin. They float a little bit, and run into the next nerve, which has serotonin receptors. These molecules activate the receptors, and the next nerve continues the signal. <strong>(Think of it like the lighting the beacons of Gondor in LOTR. Each beacon is lit, and then the next beacon sees it, and lights their own)</strong>. </p>
<p>After some time, the nerve that released the serotonin will break it down, and retake the serotonin. This is normal, and the reason is that the nerve has serotonin ready to go the next time that it's fired. <strong>(In the LOTR analogy, this would be the equivalent of saying okay the next beacon should be lit. Let me put out my fire and rebuild the haystacks)</strong></p>
<p>However, if the next nerve didn't get the signal, then breaking down the serotonin will be a bad thing. So, we give SSRIs, which let the serotonin hang out by its receptors for a longer period of time. <strong>(Keep adding hay to the burning fire and hoping that the next guy will finally turn around and light his beacon)</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SSRI's work by blocking the 5-HT reuptake transporter (SERT) in the CNS. Examples include Prosac (Fluoxetine), Zoloft (Sertraline), and Lexapro (Escitalopram). According to the monoamine hypothesis, mood disorders/depression are caused by decreased 5-HT (aka serotonin) and norepinephrine in the CNS. SSRI's selectively inhibit serotonin reuptake in the synaptic cleft by the presynaptic neuron (opposed to SNRI's which inhibit the reuptake of both 5-HT and NE). By blocking reuptake, more 5-HT will be available in the cleft to transmit the signal.
I believe the reason it take ~4-6 weeks to take full effect has something to do with the 5-HT1B presynaptic autoreceptors becoming desensitized(?).
SSRI's are considered the first-line therapy for depression, anxiety, and OCD.</p>
<p>Not everyone responds the same to these drugs. For some people one SSRI works better than another SSRI. Sometimes an individual does not respond to SSRI's, but rather SNRI's or tricyclics amines (TCAs). Although the drugs work similarly, each person can respond differently. It takes time and often can take trying different versions of these drugs to find the therapeutic effect you desire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>SSRI's stop the serotonin from being absorbed back, meaning the brain cell receiving keeps receiving the same serotonin over and over. This means happier outlook.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot of great answers here and they all point out important aspects of it, but the main reason native apps are pushed is User Engagement. I don't know the whys of it, I suspect it's a psychological thing where you feel like you &quot;have&quot; something and so you're more prone to using it, but the data backs it up; if you can get your users to install your app they're more likely to keep coming back and using your product or service which equals more ad revenue or more purchases or more brand recognition or whatever they're going for.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes a certain product works better as a mobile app (games, super-rich UIs) but the main reason is engagement. There's something about the application showing up in that list that causes people to use it more and this is why companies push for it. It makes them money. They ultimately don't give a flying leap about the user's experience so long as they keep forking over (the two are usually related but not always). I'm not sure why this is since users were more than happy to jump ship years ago and get applications out of their Start Menu and into webapps like email, docs, spreadsheets, and even a lot of games, but that's how it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen this listed yet, so I'll jump in late:</p>
<p>Because it's a mobile device, which likely means:</p>
<p>A) A smaller screen
B) A much less precise instrument for pressing links (a.k.a., your fat-ass finger)</p>
<p>These two things complicate each other.  It's obvious that having a smaller screen means less being on a screen at a time (such as menus, links, or the information people actually want to see).  Meanwhile, using a finger to press links means most people are less accurate, therefore links need to be bigger...taking up more of that precious screen space.  (For instance, all the tiny links at the top of the Reddit Desktop Site, of your favorite subs.  For some, such as WTF, my finger covers that, as well as parts of the links to the left or right.)</p>
<p>To compensate, mobile sites will reduce the number of links available, more out of necessity than anything.  Less options = inferior functionality, or in the best instance, harder to find functionality.</p>
<p>To further complicate the issue...with HTML, there are simply less things someone can do than with their own programing.  Such as having the now-familiar set of navigation buttons ever-present on the bottom of the screen that apps can do.  Also, with a mobile web-browser, even with disappearing controls, precious screen space is taken up by controls that have nothing to do with the site.</p>
<p>And, also, some of the aspects of HTML that designers often use are directed a cursor-control, as opposed to finger control  The most obvious of these is what's known as &quot;Rollover&quot;.  When your cursor goes over something, it may highlight, change, or pop something up to tell you your cursor is on it, or to give you more information.  There is no equivalent to doing this with a finger...a tap = a click, and even if something highlights when your finger touches it, you aren't going to know because your finger is over it!</p>
<p>A mobile app, while at times less functional and certainly less familiar, will allow developers to create an experience designed for everything mobile has to do, rather than try to force of cursor-based world onto your finger.</p>
<p>This is one big reason why, pre-2007, you did not see a lot of popular touch-screen computing platforms.  It's not like there weren't touch screens available...there were modification systems to turn Macs and Windows machines into touchscreens.  But the major reason they did not catch on was that shoehorning a User Interface based on a cursor into a finger is not easy.  The most common complaint I heard was that the buttons on Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop were too damn tiny.  It took one company to say &quot;F it, we'll build an entire new OS around touch interface&quot; to help the world open up to the popularity of it.</p>
<p>This is still a longstanding UI issue, and one that is still being debated today.  Microsoft Windows has spent years to create a unified OS that can do both, and particularly the first attempt was panned profusely.  Apple continues to maintain separate OS's (Now 4 versions, including TvOS and WatchOS), but has faced difficulty in getting users to learn using all of them.  Neither approach is failing, but both have faced significant challenges.</p>
<p>That last part will be my final point, I promise: The mobile UI experience is constantly changing.  First there were no styluses, now there are.  Pressure-sensitive screens have given new ways for users to interface with apps, but not all phones have them.  Not to mention the controls for voice-interface that are all over the place.  There are yearly changes to the mobile environment to try and improve user experience...but that means developers have to be on a fast learning curve to learn how to implement them...and then hope they aren't abandoned and changed.  And that's before talking about how to implement the voice control abilities on iOS are different than doing it on Android (not to mention Samsung's separate stuff), doubling or tripling to workload before you even talk about Microsoft's.</p>
<p>It's a complicated, extraordinarily fast-moving world in Mobile, even for the already quick-changing tech world.  Developers are playing catch up constantly, and that means the users are far behind...  And there's no easy solution, other than to hope that the UI world finds its groove in the next few years...</p>
<p>Oh, rumors say the home button's going away on phones???  Oh boy...guess you're going to have to tighten your grip on the reins of this Mobile OS life for a few more years.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, obviously cost was another reason why touchscreens were rare pre-2007, but popularity would drive that...the more you can mass produce, the lower production costs can become.  And the demand just wasn't there...and while I can't produce scholastic proof, my experience of being in tech since the 1990's will tell you the lack of satisfaction of touchscreen interfaces helped limit that demand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
