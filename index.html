		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To perhaps add a few more details to the main difference mentioned already (energy of the light being produced) *and explain differences in the process of creating x-ray beams:</p>
<p>It might first be useful to point out that laser light, unlike that from a light bulb, is coherent, so all the light waves are in phase with one another which is a direct result of how the energy is produced. In standard lasers, this energy is coming from the relaxation of excited electrons (excited by some mechanism, pretty much always deliberate to ensure the highest probability for the relaxation of the energy you're wanting, using something like a flash lamp, electric current, or even another laser, depending on the specific type of laser). The relaxation gives off the light you're looking for. Once this happens in one electron, that light prompts a neighboring, similarly excited electron to do the same with the nice bonus of doing so perfectly in phase with the original stimulating light/photon (this is the &quot;stimulation&quot; and &quot;amplification,&quot; since you're getting two for the price of one, in the acronym that makes the word laser -- Light Amplification by the Stimulated Emission of Radiation). Since this means you need to have the electrons excited to an energy at least as high as the energy you want to get out of the laser, and for a relatively long amount of time as far as atomic/molecular excitations are concerned, the higher the lasing energy, the harder the process is to control and produce. </p>
<p>When you reach the energy of x-rays, this is so much that it will usually just ionize whatever is being excited, stripping off the electron completely, which kills your shot at the whole coherent light production process. The first x-ray lasers got around this by  using just the high energy electrons themselves, produced in <a href="https://portal.slac.stanford.edu/sites/lcls_public/aboutlcls/Pages/About-LCLS.aspx" target="_blank">linear accelerators</a>, using magnetic field to giggle them back an forth fast enough to give of coherent x-rays. </p>
<p>More recently (and using technology I'm still trying to get my head around fully that totally blows my mind), <a href="https://jila.colorado.edu/kmlabs/research/articles/attosecond-nonlinear-optics" target="_blank">table-top x-ray</a> lasers are coming out that are made by -- in the absolute simplest of analogies that doesn't completely capture the process -- almost but not quite ionizing atoms by kind of slingshotting electrons around their nuclei in such a way that the angular acceleration it gains has the x-ray energy you want, which it then gives off as it relaxed back to its regular orbit around the nucleus. Again, the details of this one I'm still catching up on so I hopefully I'm not too off on these points and it still makes some kind of sense. </p>
<p>Not sure how much you already knew about laser physics, so sorry if this is overly in-depth and telling you stuff you already knew. I didn't mention some of the other aspects that will affect the type of light you get out (such as pulsed lasers vs. CW that are a single wavelength emitted constantly), but I'd be happy to further elaborate if you're interested.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What's the safe guard here? I about freaked out last time I had an IV because I saw air bubbles running towards my hand. The nurse just said, &quot;nah, that's fine.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>To clarify: I saw large gaps of air in the IV line throughout the time I was hooked up to it. I'm sure I'm fine as this was almost a year ago, but out of curiosity I've done a bit of research and keep finding contradictory reports. One side seems to believe that a bit of air through an IV won't kill anybody so it's completely fine. The other, claims that it still does damage to certain cells and systems of the body, and there's no reason for air bubbles to be in the lines in the first place. They claim it's a product of lazy medical practice and it should really stop. I, on the other hand, am a landscaper, machinist, and gunsmith in training, who can't understand half of what either side is saying, hence the ELI5.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>RN here. There are two main types of IV lines. Peripheral IVs and central lines. Peripheral IVs are typically inserted into a small vein of the arm or hand and have a tiny diameter. This is what most people think of as an IV. Central lines (google PICC ) have a much larger diameter and are inserted in larger veins and terminate in one of the body's large vessels -e.g Superior Vena Cava very close to the heart. The real danger of air in the circulatory system is that if a bubble is large enough and makes it to the brain it can cause a blockage called an embolism in one of the smaller vessels supplying blood to the brain. This would essentially cause a stroke. A small amount of air passing (&lt;10ml-about the size of a test tube from HS chemistry) passing through a peripheral IV just simply can't form a large enough bubble to pose a danger. In fact it has been estimated that you would need as much as 100ml of air pushed through a peripheral IV to do harm. Those tiny bubbles just get dissolved in your blood very quickly. A central line however is a much different situation. Because they have a much larger diameter and are placed in larger vessels with larger volumes of blood then it doesn't take much air for a large bubble to form. A few tiny bubbles of air that you would typically see in IV tubing is not likely to do any harm but as little as 2-3ml air pushed in all at once with a medication for instance could easily be dangerous in a central line. That's why nurses trained to clear all the air from syringes used for central lines.  It all about how big of  bubble can form in your blood. So if you have peripheral IV in your arm or hand and you see a few bubbles in your IV tubing don't let it concern you it's just not enough to hurt you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most feared complication of an 'air embolus' (in that you could die immediately) requires enough air to obstruct the outflow tract of the right ventricle.  Basically causes an air ball-valve effect that prevents any blood from leaving the right side of the heart.  Smaller amounts of air that are introduced into your veins will simply be absorbed as they move through pulmonary capillaries in the lung and not cause you any issue.  In regards to how much, most traditional studies show that 200cc should be fatal.  Recently case reports have suggested somewhere between 50-100cc could be as well, but I can't find any precisely agreed upon amount.</p>
<p>The other potential complications can occur only if there is some way that air can travel from the right side of your heart to the left, without passing through the lungs.  Most commonly, this would be through a patent foramen ovale, or PFO, that allows blood to be shunted without passage through the lungs.  There are other possibilities but require some kind of 'abnormal' communication.  In that scenario, an air embolism could cause a myocardial infarction or stroke due to obstruction of an artery as mentioned as it was able to cross from venous to systemic circulation without being 'filtered' through the lungs.</p>
<p>So, in practice, we use filters or aspiration of fluid and blood to clear IV lines to try and prevent it, but small amounts of air should not cause any detriment as you noticed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here, at medical school we were taught that anything over 10ccs of air given IV can be lethal, as an air embolus that size can cause cardiopulmonary arrest. All veins are, practically speaking, a non stop highway to the heart, and it is unlikely the air would pass through the heart, and certainly would go no further than the capillary bed of the lungs, which would be the next port of call. 10ccs of air would fill a roughly 90-100cm length of UK IV giving set tubing. Smaller bubbles are usually harmless as they can dissolve into the blood and other tissues without causing any havoc. In fact, tiny bubbles are deliberately injected IV during 'bubble study' echocardiograms which are used to detect holes in the heart. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a very difficult question to answer.</p>
<p>A 2MW wind turbine in the US (60Hz) will <em>probably</em> have a 690V 3-phase 6-pole doubly-fed induction generator with a synchronous speed of 1200 RPM (note: the generator assembly, including electronics, is <em>not</em> synchronous overall, but the machine itself has a synchronous speed of 1200 RPM; see Edit 2, below).</p>
<p>This means that it will have at least 3 armature windings (one per phase) and 3 field windings (one per pole pair). So there are at least 6 copper coils, not just 1.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why it's hard to say how many turns there are is because, even within the assumptions above, there are a plethora of different generator designs that will, more-or-less, achieve the same result. For example, the number of slots in the armature could change the number of turns by a factor of 2. Put more turns on the field windings, or more current through it, and you need fewer armature windings. Change the way the windings are wound (lap winding, wave winding, ...) and the number changes again.</p>
<p>The upshot is that nobody in the wind industry or academia thinks of &quot;number of turns&quot; as being an important characteristic of the generator. This is the domain of a handful of generator design specialists in companies like GE and Siemens who actually make the generators themselves. So, I think you're unlikely to get a good answer to this question.</p>
<p>In general, the output voltage from the armature windings is a function of the magnetic flux (due to the field windings) and the number of turns. The magnetic flux, in turn, is a function of the field current and number of turns. As a rule, you would expect &quot;many&quot; field windings and relatively few armature windings for a low-voltage machine such as this.</p>
<p>If I had to make a semi-informed guess, I would think that the most likely number of turns on each of the 3 armature windings would be &quot;dozens&quot; (based on a one or two layers of a handful of turns in each of 12 or 24 armature slots), while the most likely number of turns for the field windings would be &quot;hundreds&quot; (300? 800? I have no idea).</p>
<p>Edit: in the US (60Hz), the generator is probably 6-pole, rather than 4 (as originally posted). 4-pole generators in wind-turbines are more common in 50Hz countries, e.g. the venerable Vestas V-90 1.8/2.0 MW turbine uses a 4-pole generator for 50Hz and a 6-pole for 60Hz. </p>
<p>Edit 2: There was a bit of confusion here (comments below). AC machines are just arrangements of iron and copper. The mechanical rotation of the shaft bears a fixed relationship to the frequency of the AC output (for a generator) or input (for a motor). In wind turbine DFIGs, clever electronics provide the illusion of asynchronous operation, but the machines themselves are unchanged and have &quot;a synchronous frequency&quot; despite being used in asynchronous service.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The Great Trigonometrical Survey of India started from the ocean in 1802, and 100 feet at a time, took measurements and did a bunch of math, and worked there way across the sub-continent to the Himalayas, completing in 1871.</p>
<p>It was a great scientific achievement, lead during some of its more important years by George Everest, who received a knighthood for his efforts.</p>
<p>The basic technique is fairly simple. You start with two sticks at sea level, a decent distance apart, and measure their exact longitude and latitude. Then you put a third stick some distance away and inland, making a triangle. Based on the distance between the first two sticks and the angles they form with the third stick, you can compute the third stick's exact position and elevation.
Once all that is done, you repeat, planting a stick further inland and drawing a new triangle. </p>
<p>The Great Survey did this with better instruments, better technique, and on a greater scale than had ever been done before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

If you put bubble next to each other, they will naturally form hexagon shape.

<p>The less surface by volume is very important because it put the less amount of stress and the less amount of material for a set volume. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers about hexagons, it's probably also about efficient image processing in the brain. The flat hexagon surfaces create separate, individual small images in the eye which can be processed and put together. Same as our eyes create 2 separate images which are then put together in the brain.</p>
<p>If the insect eye surface was completely smooth, that would create a &quot;fish eye&quot; lens across a huge area. That stretches everything out, and you lose detail. It is also possibly far more difficult for the brain to process that stretched image into useful information, as opposed to processing hundreds of small, flat images in parallel.</p>
<p>I also imagine that having lots of small, neat, individual components makes it easier for the brain to organise wiring and signalling.</p>
<p>ED: It's also possible that, for extra efficiency, the insect brain can pay special attention only to those individual images which change frequently, possibly indicating danger. Like looking at a bank of TV screens - if most of them are still images and only a few are moving, you only need to pay attention to the moving ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Second, it wasn't developed in the sense that &quot;it would never be used&quot; but, rather, in the sense that they wouldn't use it first. It's there as a deterrent for other nations that would attempt to pull such a stunt in the first place. Or, more precisely, Russia at the time.</p>
<p>Now, I'm not american. And I think such weapons are a terrible, terrible idea. However, just because YOU play by the rules, doesn't mean others will.</p>

<p>US would surely do the same towards any country that tried to apply sanctions on them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, what kind of sanctions? US is (or at least can be) self sustaining on everything.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically all animals have nitrogenous waste that they need to get rid of. How they get rid of it varies based on their environment. Fish just release it as ammonia, because they're constantly surrounded by water, so they don't need to put any more effort into it. Mammals concentrate their nitrogenous waste into urea, which packs more nitrogen into each molecule, so we can store more in less water. Urea is a fairly good packaging system for us, because it allows us to put our body's waste in a modest volume of water, and carrying around a modest volume of extra liquid doesn't really interfere with our ability to move around and do stuff. Birds fly, though. For them, weight is mission critical, and they've evolved to turn their nitrogenous waste into uric acid, which packs even more nitrogen into a molecule than urea. Also, uric acid is white. </p>
<p>TLDR: birds store waste differently to save weight, the stuff they turn it into is white </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Especially in a field like this, where there are a handful of groups with the necessary expertise to replicate the work, it can take a while. As I understand it, just replicating it is a feat on the order of the original discovery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even without experimental proof, we know about as well as we possibly can that metallic hydrogen does exist without the need for lab results.</p>
<p>By mass, Jupiter is <em>mostly</em> liquid metallic hydrogen. We still haven't seen it directly, but literally no other substance could fit the bill for such low density to fit the planet's mass, yet high conductivity to fit the planet's enormous magnetic field.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong - lab results are still important, because while tons of computer simulations predict the properties of metallic hydrogen, there are probably still a few surprises about the material waiting for us. Nonetheless, even if this study is debunked, gas giants provide ample evidence that metallic hydrogen does exist.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong> to add some background: To be clear, researchers have been claiming metallic hydrogen in the lab for over 20 years now, usually creating it for a split-second with some kind of implosion. Citations start with <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.76.1860" target="_blank">Weir, et al (1996)</a>, conductivities were measured by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921452698013039" target="_blank">Ternovoi, et al (1999)</a>, deuterium was made metallic by <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.84.5564" target="_blank">Celliers, et al (2000)</a>, claims of <em>atomic</em> metallic hydrogen were made by <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0953-8984/16/39/034/meta" target="_blank">Badiei, Holmlid (2004)</a>, and so on. </p>
<p>What's so different about this detection is that it's the first claim of <em>solid</em> metallic hydrogen, which is difficult since it must be at high enough pressure to be metallic, but also cold enough to be solid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the scientists who discovered that hydrogen may have a metallic phase using incredibly high pressure. They conducted to test to determine if the hydrogen had become metallic and more importantly superconducting. The first was a laser shinning through the sample which was block when the hydrogen went from clear solid to the metallic phase and they attempted to pass a current through it. This gave an inconclusive result as to whether the material had become metallic or superconducting. I don't believe they have published anything more on the discovery so other than what's in the original paper nothing more is known</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can borrow from your own people.  The money that is printed is <strong>FEDERAL RESERVE</strong> (thanks for the corrections) notes--it's <em>technically</em> a debt that the Reserve owes the bearer of the note (but printing money does not technically increase the debt supply--the role of money has changed since fiat currency).  </p>
<p>When you print more money, you are devaluing the rest of the currency that is already in circulation.  This means that if the govt decided to print $100,000,000,000,000,000 (1 quadrillion dollars) in the span of a week, the value of the dollar would probably crash pretty hard (probably...).  This is related because people use money to buy US debt--we're loaning the US govt the very money it prints.  The only reason that this results in anything favorable is because people all over the world value USD and that paper currency represents potential labor, new assets, etc.</p>
<p>If you own a baseball card of Sammy Sosa, there is a chance it could be worth a lot of money.  Now imagine if the card company just mails a Sammy Sosa card to every family in America.  Your Sammy Sosa card isn't worth anything anymore because there are so many of them and everyone has it now.  Now imagine if they mailed another 5 to everyone--the value crashes even harder because there are SO many of them now.</p>
<p>That's the same idea with money. You can't keep printing more money or else the value of it will deteriorate.  But the gov't keeps issuing more debt and we still look at $20 like it's $20, right?  Eventually, there could come a time when we look at a $20 bill and it means nothing to us.  </p>
<p>This is what happened in Zimbabwe where a billion dollar transaction might happen for a loaf of bread.  They printed so much money (without proper secure backing by the gov't) that it just became worthless.  So they started to just increase the numbers on their currency so you can actually pay for something.</p>
<p>Because the gov't theoretically owes its population money, they issue paper as a certificate of this.  You might not have physically went to the bank and traded something in return for paper but you did something that warranted the earning of that dollar.  If you work for a company, they pay you that money because it has value and you can buy things with it.  </p>
<p>The only reason it has value is because the US gov't says it does.  You can pay gov't-related fees and bills with the money they issue and because the gov't is well-secured, people accept it.  If our gov't was unstable, no one would trust the dollars they slept under for warmth because the gov't could just come out and say, 'Sorry we're not paying you guys back'.</p>
<p>Well what would they be paying back?  To whom are they paying back to?  </p>
<p>It used to be gold.  But as we grew as a planet, we ran out of gold to back every dollar with and it just became a nightmare to handle.  Enter, fiat currency, a piece of paper that means nothing except what the gov't says it means.</p>
<p>People used to go to banks with gold and receive 'money' for it.  The banks would literally hold their gold and give them an certificate that says they own a claim of gold in their vaults.  If ANYONE brought that certificate to the bank, they could expect to receive gold for it.  That's what gave it value.  </p>
<p>You could say you want that farmer's potatoes and he can go get $1 of gold from the bankers at his convenience or he could hold onto it and use it just like the person did before him--'trade' it for something else like new shoes.  Why?  Because everyone liked gold and everyone believed gold had value.</p>
<p>Eventually, this took off and people stopped trading for things and we developed currency with quantitative values that allowed for easy exchanges to take place.  </p>
<p>So you might think, 'Well, now that there isn't gold behind my dollar, how is it worth anything even if the gov't say it is?  They won't give me anything in return for it&quot;.</p>
<p>The same thing applies to gold.  No one wants gold unless other people want gold.  If you can't reasonably trade your gold for something else, then what value does it have?  (Someone did point out you can shave gold flakes into your water and drink it, like some companies have chosen to do, but that's on you)</p>
<p>As long as people continue to value dollars, it doesn't matter what it's worth, sans some certain supply and demand laws.  So gold is no different in that regard.  The ONE difference between paper currency and gold is that $100,000 in cash weighs a lot less than $100,000 in gold and is a lot easier to hide too.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I made some slight revisions to correct errors and to try and relate things better to the main topic at hand.  Sorry, I kinda started rambling.  I have also posted below in response to u/penny_eater to correct my errors and explain them in a little bit further detail but it kinda strays away from ELI5 territory.</p>
<p>This kinda seems all over the place but it should be good starter information for someone trying to understand debt markets and macroeconomics, in general.  Monetary supply and debt are pretty hand-in-hand, even if they're not exactly the same thing.</p>
<p>Larger and more complex economies warranted the development of fiat currency which ultimately changed the role of currency, in general.  It no longer represents a claim, per se, but it represents value because the gov't says it has value and will accept it for gov't related transactions and business with foreign entities.  </p>
<p>Also, don't get me started on the petrodollar.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Sorry I wanted to just double clarify.  My main answer to the question &quot;Who does the US Gov't borrow from?&quot; was &quot;It's own people&quot;.  My money talk (everything after that first sentence) was just to lead into the topic of increasing debt, economics, and the value of this debt in the coming future.  </strong></p>
<p>I thought &quot;It's own people&quot; would be a sufficient answer to that but started to get into the reasons why that is starting to look like a bad idea especially in our current economic environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>for instance in the US they'll have debt auctions where usually financial institutions will place bids on debt. Some of these institutions will be retail banks and they offer them as investments to everyday people.</p>
<p>To understand bidding on debt here's a simple example: The US govt says they will pay $1000 to someone in 5 years. What's it worth to you? For the US govt there is basically a 0% chance they won't be able to pay that $1000 so maybe they can sell that promise for $950 today.</p>
<p>They'll do with with billions of dollars on a regular basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
