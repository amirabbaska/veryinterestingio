Normally, there's a normal supply of people walking on it and everyone stays on the path. Sometimes, there's a huge burst of people (looking at something bright). The sidewalk is so crowded that some people end up stepping on the lawn of the neighboring houses. Mr. Sneeze, living in one of the houses, sees this and gets out of his house to yell at the people to get off his lawn.</p>
<p>The process is known as photic sneeze reflex and it affects 18-35% of the population. The mechanics behind it are not fully understood but it may be due to nerve signals being confused when there is a rapid burst from seeing bright light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yay, I can answer this!  I was a court reporter for three years after doing two years at a college to get a certificate for captioning and court reporting.  </p>
<p>The machine that court reporters/stenographers use is called a stenotype.  The keyboard of a stenotype is blank, but <a href="http://www.acrdepos.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/StenoKeyLayout.png" target="_blank">this is what all the keys represent on it</a>.  Multiple keys are pressed at a time, sort of like playing a chord on a piano.  Honestly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> does a way better job of explaining it than I will.</p>
<p>Before we had computer-aided transcription (CAT) software, reporters could either transcribe that code themselves into written English or re-dictate it at a slower, averaged speed for a typist to type up for them.  If a readback was asked for during testimony, the court reporter would have to go back through a ream of paper that their code was printed onto as they wrote and read back the steno code as English.  This is why CAT software is great.  The stenotype connects directly to your computer, and your steno is translated real time into your software, making it much faster to turn around a transcript or do a readback.  The firm that I worked for could provide what we just called &quot;realtime&quot; to lawyers who wanted to be able to review the transcript as it was being written, and we could broadcast it to their laptops as the questioning was happening, which meant that we had to be incredibly accurate and do a lot of editing on the fly; although, a realtime transcript is never as accurate as a completed one.</p>
<p>Court reporters aren't perfect, though.  Sometimes they can be asked for a read back of the testimony, and they won't have it.  I only know of a few court reporters who would feel comfortable working without multiple audio back ups being recorded while they are writing, and most will listen to these again while they edit a transcript after the fact.  </p>
<p>I guess I haven't really answered the question yet.  Because you press multiple keys down on a stenotype at once, you can write entire words, phrases, or sentences with one movement.  A program that teaches court reporting will use a certain theory for what the best combination of keys are for certain things, but once you've been at it for a bit, your steno code definitely becomes your own since you can customize it to how you like to write.  You can define a combination of strokes to come up as anything you'd like in your transcript using the CAT software, including things like paragraph breaks, formatting, stuff like that.  So, say you work a lot in a court setting, you can press a certain combination of keys and it'll bring up &quot;Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,&quot; which is a very common phrase in court cases, allowing you to keep up.</p>
<p>I believe that most programs require a 225 WPM typing speed to graduate.  225 WPM is a decent speed, but when people get excited they can easily break 300 WPM, so constant practice and improvement is key to being a court reporter.  If you're very fast and very accurate, you can do things like realtime, or you can move into captioning live broadcasts.  Anytime you watch the news, sports, anything live with closed captioning, you're watching a stenographer at work, likely in their living room or office at home.</p>
<p>TL;DR: One movement creates entire words, phrases, or sentences that are directly translated to a computer-aided transcription software on a computer, allowing for instant read back of the testimony.  Generally court reporters must
write at a minimum of 225 WPM.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As other commenters have mentioned, we are writing by syllable and sound rather than letters.  We use a lot of short forms that can be whole words or phrases.  </p>
<p>Take the word hello, for instance.  On a regular keyboard you would make 5 different key strokes (one for each letter).  On a stenographic keyboard you'd break that down by syllable, which would look like HEL / LO.  You go from 5 keystrokes to 2. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So lets say you own a company that sells clothes.  You get all the proper paperwork saying that your company is authorized to operate in your home country.  So you are free to sell it's clothes within your own country.  While there might be some minor regulation differences between regions, normally countries take steps to make these &quot;domestic&quot; sales as easy as possible. </p>
<p>But when you want to expand that company into a new country, you'll face a series of problems.  First is that shipping the product itself into the new country will likely incur a kind of tax.  This is known as a tariff or duty, aka an import tax. </p>
<p>The next problem has to do with regulations.  Different countries have different regulations on products.  So my home country might allow the use of red die #1357 but the country I'm trying to expand into might not.  Just different rules for different countries.</p>
<p>A long time ago the people of Europe saw some problems with this system.  European countries tend to be fairly small so companies were always looking to expand into the country next door, and due to the above 2 things this was a giant pain in the ass. </p>
<p>The idea of the &quot;single market&quot; was that they would do away with the import/export taxes.  Second they should take steps so that a product that is legal to sell in Germany is also legal to sell in Spain. This makes it easy for companies to expand their customer base from one country to another.</p>
<p>In a related way, the same idea was applied to the movement of people.  A, Employee is just someone who sells their labor and they should be allowed to sell it in Germany, Spain or the UK. Just like any company can sell it's goods, any person can sell their labor. </p>
<p>So what does leaving this do to the UK.  It means that the citizens of the UK will require special permission (a visa) to live and work in other European countries.  So a Londoner wanting to work in Berlin would face the same challenges as a Londoner who wanted to work in New York. </p>
<p>Next, UK companies would face additional challenges when it comes to selling their products to the rest of Europe.  This would likely mean the prices of those products raise, and sales fall.  This is expected to cause some economic problems for the UK.</p>
<p>Foreign companies would also face higher costs when selling to the UK.  So a product made in Germany would cost more.  This would make it easier for local companies to compete with those foreign companies. So in general there would be a few more jobs, but the costs of almost all imported goods would raise so everyone would be spending a little more of their income on those same goods. In general it is expected that the economic boost from the new jobs will be fairly minor, wheres the damage from increased prices would be fairly large, so a net negative. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basics of the single market have been well explained already but one aspect that hasn't been mentioned yet is renegotiating trade deals.</p>
<p>Trade deals basically determine the conditions under which certain products can be sold in each country. As it stands, the EU has trade deals with lots of different countries and groups of countries that have been negotiated and renegotiated over the years. </p>
<p>When the UK leaves the single market, they will have to create their own trade deals with all of these other nations. This may be problematic for a number of reasons. </p>
<p>Firstly, the UK doesn't actually have many people who specialize in this kind of thing as it was mostly done for them by the EU. </p>
<p>And secondly, these deals are incredibly complicated and have to be done not just for every country, but for every industry too. On top of that, it is technically illegal for an EU member to negotiate trade deals by itself so in theory, the UK won't have any trade deals in place the day it leaves. Although, there will probably be behind the scenes negotiations. </p>
<p>They could use the current EU deals or they could default to the standard WTO deals while the sort out their own but these come with their own problems. </p>
<p>Basically, leaving the common market has made trade for the UK a lot more complicated than it was before. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the single market allows the (currently) 28 EU Member States to move things between themselves freely. This includes goods, workers, services, and capital all without paying any fees (tariffs). For the UK, leaving will mean that they can charge for their goods going to the EU and vice versa (however this could change depending on the final deal, a Free Trade Agreement will be likely). One of the main reasons the UK want to leave the single market is because it will allow the country to restrict the free movement of people (E.G. require EU migrants to have a work permit before arriving, rather than them being free to work and live in the UK).</p>

<p>Once the crash happened and the euro dropped in value all the high quality products that Germany sell became cheaper leading to a boom in the Germany complete with tax rebate.</p>
<p>Who do you think lent all the money to the other european countries? german dutch and nordic banks. once they saw that they were not getting paid the called the government and Sanctions were imposed.

<p>It was really a team effort.  Banks shouldn't have been writing multiple mortgages to folks that work part time at McDonalds, and folks that can't afford $1200/mo shouldn't be taking out loans with $1500/mo payments.  Easy lending makes economies do whatever they're going to do faster.  If times are good and everyone is making payments, the economy grows very quickly.  When times get tough, it crashes quickly.  </p>
<p>Germany's banking system kept restrictions on lending practices, and this was reinforced by their culture that didn't borrow what they can't pay back.  They never really had a crisis of capital where the banks were out of cash to lend due to lack of payment.  The downside here was that their economic growth was restricted during the boom times, but also restricted during a crash.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I figured I'd comment on the automotive industry for a moment since that was a big part of the economic crisis.  I'm not an expert so someone please correct me if I'm wrong.  I studied automotive engineering abroad in Germany in 2009, so I'm attempting to remember what I was told from 8 years ago.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A big part of the problem is that when the industry crashed, dealers were left with big lots of cars that they couldn't sell except for a loss.  In Germany, dealerships are almost non-existent.  People order their cars directly (and custom) from the factory, and then wait for it to work their way though the system and show up.  As such, there was no capital tied up in inventory that depreciated. </p>
</li>
<li>This is the part I'm more fuzzy on, but I believe I was told at the BMW plant we worked with is that <del>part of the taxes paid by the corporation was essentially a &quot;bailout tax&quot;</del> the government has a program (Kurzarbeit) and when the industry crashed, the government had money to put back into it, and essentially paid BMW to keep their workers employed for a while.  This helped keep the economy from bottoming out.</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, if I'm misremember this, please someone correct me.</p>
<p>EDIT:  Clarified kurzarbeit, see child comments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thermoceptors of the skin are not only stimulated by temperature but also some chemicals. Menthol cools, capsaicin warms, etc. These receptors (TRPV1 or -2)  are activated by the stimulus, and when they're activated they send signals to your thalamus and cortex - which perceives that particular signal as &quot; cold/hot&quot;.
So if you stimulated them by say light touch, your brain would still interpret that as cold. Fortunately that's not the case typically. So, each receptor responds to a certain modality of sensation, and when that happens your brain has a particular association with it. </p>
<p>As someone else mentioned, some areas of the body are more densely packed with receptors. Biologically it makes sense that important/vulnerable areas are more sensitive. So you realize danger quickly when appropriate, and don't freeze or burn off your laser-snake.</p>
<p>Interestingly, you can force some receptors to respond to a stimulus that it doesn't normally recognize. For example, exerting a great deal of pressure onto the light sensing photoreceptors in the eye will turn them &quot;on&quot; and your brain perceives light. Hence why you see lights if someone punches you in the face.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

A resister coil adds resistance in a linear state, in order to have the printed scale show what frequency matches for the adjusted antenna length, the scale is printed in a logarithmic scale.  </p>
<p>Most phenomenon involving waves (sound, light, earthquakes, etc.) work in a logarithmic progression. A simple explanation is that for every 10x increase in a log scale, you always move a specific distance on a linear one. The actual scaling can be any number, but 10 is easy to demonstrate.  </p>
<p>So to go from 10 to 100 takes 1 inch on the scale.
Going from 100 to 1 000 takes another inch<br />
1 000 to 10 000 takes another inch</p>
<p>The measure of distance would be from 1 to the number measured. The dial scale does not go down to 1 so you do not see the actual progression from the beginning.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's got to do mostly with the physics of how the tuner works. Most old school tuning knobs adjust a capacitor or resistor (electrical components) in order to change the frequency that your antenna picks up. We find it pleasing to have linear scales (consistent spacing) for the frequency that is being picked up, but it is hard to make resistors and capacitors that adjust linearly. Because it's cheaper to just use resistors and capacitors that don't adjust linearly, the scales on old school equipment are often nonlinear and based on the what components were used in the circuit. However as components became cheaper over time, and the market had an increase in demand for user friendly electronics, aesthetic design became more important that creating the circuit in a cheap manner. Engineers went through an obsession with creating smooth, consistent, linear adjustments for everything. Now volume knobs, tuners, equalization knobs are almost all linear in order to be more intuitive to the user.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party, but can't resist. </p>
<p>Without getting into debits and credits, and the intricacies of double-entry bookkeeping, the prepaid gift card balance is recorded as a liability, more specifically as an unearned (or deferred) revenue line item in the balance sheet. You owe the customer something in exchange for their cash. </p>
<p>While you have collected the funds from the customer, you have not delivered to them whatever good or service you will sell to them (i.e. Revenue) - at least until some point in the future - so it represents potential future sales that you will (likely) make. Pretty simple, really. </p>
<p>The complexity comes up if an individual card (or many cards) gets old and there is indication that it will never be redeemed (think about a lost card...). In this situation, the issuer of the card (seller of goods or services) will make an estimate of the amount of their unearned revenue (gift card) balance that is probable will never be redeemed (sometimes referred to as 'breakage') and recognise that portion in revenue in the current period - essentially free money that they collected a long time ago. The estimates can be complex based on historical redemption patterns and should involve thing like statutory expiration. </p>

<p>Basically the payment for the card is entered as a debit under cash, and then an credit entry for the gift card liability is entered.</p>
<p>When you use the gift card, you have a debit against the gift card liability and a credit applied to revenue.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We had a major electronics retailer (Dick Smith Electronics) go belly-up last year. As the administrators moved in there was a huge backlash when it was announced that customers would not be able to redeem their gift cards as the purchase of the cards was considered a &quot;financial loan&quot; to the company, making a purchased gift card holder just another creditor who had to get in line to be reimbursed. Also want to mention that the store was founded by an exceptional and amazing Australian who sold the chain twenty plus years ago and it was a real shame to see his name tarnished by the new owners. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The fun part (to use made up numbers) is (a) if you can estimate that 20% of gift cards are never used, you can record 20% as profit right away and (b) you can estimate that 95% of gift cards over 5 years old are never used, and record the other 75% as revenue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on company policy. If done correctly they will record it as an unearned revenue. The company policy comes into play regarding the liability. It can be based on a policy similar to accounts receivable and bad debt. Or they can just leave the liability on the books permanently. Or they can say after a certain time has passed so much is now recorded as a revenue.  This does not mean that your individual gift card is void (that is actually in most states now I believe), it just means the company's general account decreased and moved to a revenue account. </p>

We just don't see it written that way in english because the german/old norse heritage didn't have that sound. It was a latin character that sounded a bit like a K, such as in the word Plaque, but otherwise wasn't used until the french invasion. </p>
<p>In theory, Qu could be thought of as it's own letter, since it's really only used in that one way, Kind of like the Æ (Strong I sound) that we don't use anymore. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This spelling convention originated from Latin / French (which originated from Greek), and through a series of phonological changes over time, the letter <q> only appeared before the letter <u> to represent the /k/ sound. Then, behind other vowels, the letter <u> in this digraph became silent.</p>
<p>Now, QU as a digraph represents the /k/ sound before certain vowels in French, in particular: que, quelle, quoi (which is &quot;kwah&quot; but the &quot;w&quot; sound comes from the &quot;oi&quot; NOT the &quot;u&quot;), or quinze. When English acquired words from French and Latin which utilized this QU digraph, the unfortunate tendency was to pronounce what should have been a silent <u>. Hence words like &quot;quadruple&quot; and &quot;quotation&quot; are pronounced /kwadrupəl/ and /kwoteʃən/ in English but in French they are /kadʀupəl/ and /kotasjɔ̃/.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually the other way around. Human can survive on one of the most diverse diet. Most animal have a very specific diet and can't usually change it. If they lose that source of food, they can often be in danger. </p>
<p>Cats for exemple, lack the ability to produce certain aminos-acid and vitamins so they can't survive without meat to give them those things. Human can produce a lot of those so they mostly need a source of energy to produce what they need. They still need specific nutrient, but those are usually frequent and a lot of source of food can provide them.</p>
<p>People can survive on a LOT of different diet. But of course as we know more have the exact need of our body, you can specify our diet to make sure that we get all of what our body need, but that's not needed to be relatively healthy or to stay alive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The problem is, we don't really like that idea. And if you want to live till you're 80, you need to take proper care of your body. And thus people have figured out some pretty great and healthy diets. That's not required (just look at people who eat nothing but junkfood), but it will greatly improve the odds of growing old. </p>
<p>Think of it as maintaining a car. If you plan to scrap it after 50k miles, you can do whatever you want. But if you want to drive 350k on it, you need to change the oil, clean the filters, properly inflate the tires, use the right fuel etc. But you only have to do that if you want it to last a long time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Related to your question about diet is the question of cooking -- specifically, when foods are cooked they can allow us to extract more usable calories from them. As an adult human, your brain requires about 25% of your caloric intake daily. The development of skills like cooking as well as biological specializations to process certain foods makes our large and complex brain (relative to our body size and food consumption) possible!
