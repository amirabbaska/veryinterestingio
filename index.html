<p>When you drink milk does the calcium build up in your system waiting for you to get some D3? Or does D3 sit in your system waiting for calcium?</p>
<p>What happens between the calcium and D3 to turn it into bones?</p></div></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Milk contains various building blocks for the body, and as you've pointed out calcium is one of them. Vitamin D is important in creating bones, but it is in your body anyway, assuming you don't live in perpetual darkness. Yes, children who grow up in dark environments but with ample food typically have lower bone density, but at the same time it's not the key ingredient. </p>
<p>Bodily processes are incredibly complicated, and the process of ossification (making bone) is not as simple as calcium+vitD=bone. There are thousands (that we know of) factors that directly or indirectly affect bone development and repair. Vitamin D and calcium are just a part of the whole equation, and lacking either of them is rarely the cause for problems with bone development. </p>
<p>In fact, it's rarely spoken about, but one of the most important roles of calcium in your body is to do with how cells &quot;stick&quot; to one another - through little anchors that require calcium to properly work. <del>This is why calcium deficiency is more obvious in places like the mouth (scurvy) - where the cells in your gums literally fall apart from one another because of the junctions I mentioned earlier.</del></p>
<p>Calcium and Vit D are important for bone growth, but the equation is much broader than that. Neither waits for the other, and unless you are <em>severely</em> malnourished, they won't be the thing that affects the growth of your bones. </p>
<p>You get plenty of calcium from the food you eat and the water you drink (especially if you live in an area with &quot;hard&quot; water, which is heavy in ions like calcium)</p>
<p>Further, milk isn't there to provide calcium - it's more of a side effect. Many foods like citrus <del>(hence I mentioned scurvy earlier)</del>, cereals, seeds, and fish have a higher content of calcium in the same volume as milk. Milk has a lot of fat and protein which is much more important to the body than the tiny amounts of calcium it needs</p>
<p>Edit: I mixed up Vit C and Calcium in the scurvy point</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Milk doesn't actually help build bones. As
u/yellowyeti14 mentioned, milk actually hurts bone growth. </p>
<p>The idea that milk improves bone growth was a very successful marketing ploy that sounds feasible because it has a reasonable amount of calcium and calcium is useful for bone growth. This however isn't the whole story. </p>
<p>The whole story is that the lactose and casein in milk are acid forming once digested, and since calcium is a base, most of the calcium bonds to the formed acid and is neutralized. Additionally, there is usually more acid formed than calcium consumed, so your body actually starts pulling calcium away from its bones to neutralize excess acid. </p>
<p>If you want to build strong bones, eat green leafy vegetables. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't really turn milk into bones. Bones are made of a combination of a protein called collagen and calcium phosphate. So eating/drinking more calcium and protein (which milk has both) allows your body to make more bone. Think of construction workers building a wall. The wall are your bones and the workers are your bodies processes that mske bone. If you supply the workers with more brick and material they will be able to build a stronger, thicker or taller wall. Similarly if you give your body more calcium and protein (particularly while you're still growing), it will be able to make stronger bones. Vitamin D (which is also in milk) helps your body absorb the calcium you eat, otherwise you will just pee it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vitamin D affects what our body does with calcium in more than one way. Vitamin D's main job is to make sure that there is enough calcium in the blood. Calcium has many important functions. One is as a structural part of the bone tissue. Calcium also functions as a messenger for cell functions, for example in muscle and nerve cells, and also as an integral part in blood coagulation. These are reasons to regulate the amount of calcium available in the blood, as vitamin D helps with in these ways:</p>
<p>1) Vitamin D helps the absorption of calcium through the intestinal cells. This helps the body get more calcium.</p>
<p>2) Vitamin D tells the cells that brake down bone tissue to release more calcium (from the bones) into the blood. The bone tissue is the main resevoir of calcium in the body. Breakdown of bone tissue and release of calcium will happen if the amount of calcium in the blood is to low.</p>
<p>3) Vitamin D helps the reabsorption of calcium from the pre-urine in the kidneys. This helps the body keep the calcium it already has.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earth orbits the sun in an ellipse - it's farthest from the sun in July and closest in January. Thanks to some complicated math worked out by Johannes Kepler, we know that orbits follow the &quot;law of areas&quot; - basically, the wedge that an orbiting body sweeps out will have the same area for equal amounts of time (if you draw the earth's orbit and tick off each day along it, then connect each tick mark to the sun, the wedges will all have the same area).</p>
<p>With the law of areas in mind, we know that a body (earth) orbiting its host star (the sun) will move faster when it's close and slower when it's farther away. Otherwise the areas wouldn't be equal, and the law wouldn't be valid. Thus, the change in times of sunrises and sunsets are farther apart in January simply because the earth is moving fastest in its orbit.</p>
<p>Kepler figured this out in part with Tycho Brahe by observing the orbit of Mars, which is more elliptical than earth's and so easier to note the effect and not attribute it to data noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When I took off the contact lenses and had a normal day without them I felt much more energetic. I wondered why and when I looked at the box for my contacts I noticed that they're &quot;UV-Blocking&quot;. I attributed it to perhaps Seasonal Affective Disorder caused by a low level of light.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All objects emit black-body radiation. This comes in the form of electro-magnetic radiation. The intensity and spectrum (color) of this radiation depends on the temperature of the object.</p>
<p>At room temperature and below, the radiation is too low frequency to be able to seen by human eye, but objects do glow at infrared, and that is why heat vision cameras work. At about 500 degrees celsius, you can start noticing objects to glow at red. Increasing the temperature further makes them brigther, and whiter. And if you continued to heat the object beyond about 6000 celcius, then the glow would transition from white to blue.</p>
<p>The reason why you wont find green hot objects, is because when the objects spectrum peaks at green, it will also emit a lot of red and blue, and this mixture gives the overall white look.</p>
<p>The reason you wont easily find blue hot metals, is because everything evaporates before that. How ever, some stars are hot enough to glow blue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been said, objects emitting light due to their temperature is blackbody radiation. Everything is a blackbody, even you. Thermal goggles can see you in the dark, because they detect the infrared radiation that humans so strongly emit. </p>
<p>One would expect that, the hotter an object gets (and thus more thermal energy it has), the more energetic the light it emits will be. That is, the light will be farther towards the high-frequency violet, UV, etc. side of the spectrum. This is exactly what happens. </p>
<p>If we heated you enough (say to 3500K), you would eventually turn red hot. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law#/media/File:Wiens_law.svg" target="_blank">Check out these blackbody radiation curves</a>, keeping in mind that the cutoff for visible light is in the 390nm-700nm range. The peak starts off far to the right, in the invisible range, and then creeps into the reds as it heats up. Since most of the other visible light is negligibly emitted at this stage, 3500K you appears red. Heating = shifting that peak over to the left.</p>
<p>Now, what happens if we heated you even more? Well, the peak must shift over towards higher frequency light, to account for the energy, but the entire peak rises as well. Take the 5500K curve for instance. It does indeed peak in the green spectrum, but there is a large amount of red light, yellow light, blue light, etc. as well. This means that the green gets washed out and everything appears white. It's hard for your eyes to tell when there's just slightly more of one color when they're all there and at high intensities (or even low intensities, if you've ever picked out paint).</p>
<p>It turns out though that, if you heat up something enough, blue-hot is possible though! For a fun example, look at stars. Stars emit most of their light through blackbody radiation; you can look at the color of a star and determine how hot it is, and from there determine many things about its age and mass. The important thing to note is that more store mass means increased nuclear fusion, increasing the temperature as well. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-type_star" target="_blank">The O-type star classification</a> are extremely massive and hot. This results in a nice blue-hot color, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnitak" target="_blank">as you can see in pictures</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually does. It goes from the lowest frequency (red) to the highest (frequency).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At first, it is just glowing infrared, thus, not glowing in the visible spectrum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, as it gets hotter, it glows red. If you look at the infrared spectrum, it is still glowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then as it gets hotter, it also glows green. But it doesn't look green because it is glowing red AND green. And when you mix red and green, you get yellow, that's why it looks as if it is glowing yellow, because is glowing red AND green.</p>
</li>
<li>Finally, it glows blue. But remember, it is still glowing infrared, and red, and green, and now, blue as well. And when red and green and blue is mixed, it glows white.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue hot does exist. Red hot and white hot exist on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature" target="_blank">color temperature</a> scale, measured in Kelvin. If you heat a black body emitter, like iron or the sun, to a certain temperature, it radiates off light at a specific color. That color is identified by the temperature of the emitter. This is one tool we use to predict the temperature, and therefore the contents of stars, by their color. You've never seen metal heated to blue hot because it begins to vaporize before getting that hot. Iron, for example, vaporizes at less than 5000K, which is still very white. Blue hot is around 8000K or 10000K.</p>
<p>This is also why you see light bulbs rated in Kelvin. An incandescent bulb is about 2000K. Midday sunlight is about 3500K. My favorite color that I've ever seen is <a href="http://www.mercedesforum.nl/forum/download/file.php?id=109843" target="_blank">13000K</a>. Your display cannot accurately represent how brilliant of a color it is.</p>
<p>You'll also hear the acronym CRI in reference to artificial lights creating Kelvin colors, like LEDs. CRI is the Color Rendering Index and is a mathematical comparison (up to 100) of how similar the spectrum of light is to an ideal black body emitter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This can't happen in humans (naturally anyway, maybe with some lab work you could make it happen) because identical twins are by definition genetically identical and therefore necessarily going to both be XX or XY.</p>
<p>BUT</p>
<p>It <em>can</em> happen in some other species where sex is not determined by chromosomes.  Specifically speaking, it often happens in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mangrove_rivulus" target="_blank">mangrove rivulus</a>, one of the fish I did my PhD research on.  This species is one of only a couple of species of vertebrates that are self-fertilizing hermaphrodites.  </p>
<p>This species produces both males and hermaphrodites, with sex mostly controlled by temperature and maybe some other environmental factors.  If you keep a hermaphrodite by itself in an aquarium it will spontaneously produce fertilized eggs, as the gonads contain both eggs and sperm.  This is, genetically speaking, equivalent to identical twins reproducing with each other (you could also have actual identical twins in the species reproduce with each other, but it's easier to study self fertilization because it happens much more often).</p>
<p>So, to actually answer the question, here's what happens.  You don't get a clone.  Instead you essentially get a very inbred offspring.  This is because meiosis and the process of sex shuffle DNA around.  It's a bit tricky to explain without being able to draw, but bear with me and I'll do my best.</p>
<p>So to start out with, your identical twins (or self-fertilizing fish) have the same DNA.  We will represent this as a string of letters, showing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allele" target="_blank">alleles</a> of genes.  If you've done any genetics in school you will probably have seen this before, usually in the context of talking about eye color or something or maybe with punnet squares.  </p>
<p>So here's our DNA string of the parents (it's the same in both, remember, because they are identical).</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>Note that there are two strands here...that's because the parents are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ploidy#Diploid" target="_blank">diploid</a> and have two sets of DNA.  Note that each letter is present on both strand, but sometimes it's uppercase on one and lowercase on the other.  Each letter is a gene, but you can have two copies  of the same gene where each copy is slightly different from the other.</p>
<p>Now, we get to reproduction.  Egg and sperm DNA comes from one  strand of the parent DNA.  So from</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>We can get sperm and eggs with the DNA</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm  _or_ BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>Now, this alone would prevent many offspring from being clones because eggs and sperm meet up randomly, meaning that you <em>could</em> get clones with </p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>but you could also get</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BTArwFm</code></pre>
<p>or </p>
<pre><code>BtarWfM
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>both of which are quite different from their parent (for example, the parent had Tt at the second gene, the offspring have TT or tt</p>
<p>In reality, though, it's even more impossible to get clones because DNA is seperated onto multiple chromosomes and because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_recombination" target="_blank">genetic recombination</a> during meiosis.  Basically, before eggs and sperm are formed, the DNA gets shuffled around.  So a cell that starts out with DNA</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>swaps some of the DNA when producing offspring (swapped DNA is bolded, EDIT sorry can't bold in code mode)</p>
<p>BT<strong>arW</strong>Fm</p>
<p>Bt<strong>Arw</strong>fM</p>
<p>Now this cell produces four sperm or an egg with the new genomes</p>
<p>BT<strong>arW</strong>Fm  or  Bt<strong>Arw</strong>fM</p>
<p>And this happens in different places every time.  So in practice you'll have, eg, a sperm cell with code</p>
<p>Bt<strong>Arw</strong>fM meeting up with an egg cell with code <strong>Bta</strong>rwFm</p>
<p>producing offspring with </p>
<pre><code>BtArwfM
BtarwFm</code></pre>
<p>compare to the parent</p>
<pre><code>BTArwFm
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>Ok, if you managed to make it through all that good job.<br />
So what <em>does</em> happen?  Well, offspring tend to be more inbred and homozygous, which means they have the same allele on both strands.  For instance, in our example above the parent was homozygous in one place: it had BB for the first gene.  All the other genes had differing alleles (represented by one upper and one lower case letter).  But the <em>offspring</em> was homozygous in four places! (BB, tt, rr, ww).  Why does this matter?  Well, most genetic diseases show up when you have two copies of the same allele (for example, tt might produce a birth defect, while TT or Tt do not).  This is a big reason why  inbreeding can produce bad outcomes for offspring in people an animals.  </p>
<p>However, in mangrove rivulus this interbreeding happens generation after generation and all the individuals with the deadly alleles get weeded out.  Eventually you get totally homozygous fish with genomes like</p>
<pre><code>BtarWfM
BtarWfM</code></pre>
<p>at this point their offspring <em>are</em> basically clones, because even if their DNA recombines it's already the same on both strands.  But you'd have to breed identical twins for generations to get this to happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Okay, so ignoring the fact that human identical twins are gonna be the same gender and all that, the answer is, oddly enough, <strong>no</strong>. Their offspring would be genetically different from either parent.</p>
<p>This comes into play with plant breeding. It's really easy to clone plants, and you can often stress plants into becoming hermaphrodites capable of reproducing. By doing that, you can breed a plant with a clone of itself.</p>
<p>The offspring, however, is going to be different. That's because genes come in pairs. You might remember the punnet square from high school biology - if you have two dominant genes or a dominant and a recessive gene, the dominant gene expresses itself, and if you have two copies of the recessive gene then the recessive gene expresses itself.</p>
<p>When reproduction happens, you basically pick one of the two genes from each parent at random, and then they're combined into a new pair.</p>
<p>So, say that the clone/twin has a gene for brown eyes and a gene for blue eyes. Both twins are going to have brown eyes, because that's the dominant gene - but the blue eyes gene is still there, lying dormant.</p>
<p>When the clones reproduce, the offspring could get both brown eye genes (one from each parent) a brown eye gene from one parent and a blue eye gene from the other parent, or they could get the blue eye gene from each parent. In the first two cases the offspring would have brown eyes, but in the latter case it would have blue eyes!</p>
<p>This is a bit more simplified than the entire picture (genetics can get complex) but the basic concept holds. The offspring of the twins will have a different combination of their parent's genes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Edit: </p>
<p>Story below in the comments but just thought I’d put it here as well </p>
<p>Its just good to have. We honestly couldn’t’ve prevented our situation. Friends foot was bleeding intensely and as a result we were not keeping pace with our water consumption. It was desert weather mid spring and no rivers, so we had to carry all our water the entire trip and it would’ve taken days for my friend to get back, so we would’ve run out.</p>
<p>Ended up giving almost all our water to one guy so he can go all the way back himself to his car and go off-road to either come get us or get help. It was weird how valuable water sorta became, made me change my perspectives on life in a few ways. In a sense I knew that we could eat cactus to stay alive, and we knew the way back to the road, but just being put in that situation where things are kinda uncertain was strange. I remember giving that guy almost all our water and thinking that there was no way for me to know what is about to happen until it just sorta happened.</p>
<p>Interesting experience 10/10 for life lessons 2/10 would do again</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My time to shine. I've written software for this -- if I say anything more, I might be identified easily by the people who know this. </p>
<p>Edit: Important and useful distinction: At least one carrier needs to have coverage in the location you are trying to make an emergency call from. If none of them do, your cellphone won't be able to connect an emergency call. It's not magic, just engineering :)</p>
<p>Edit: Since this got upvoted like crazy, disclaimer time. Do not use anything I've said here to make decisions on how you want to act in an emergency. Assume anything I've said below can be completely wrong. Having said that, I've been as truthful as I can be and as my memory serves me.</p>
<p>The physical components for connecting to cell phone towers of various carriers and various tech (2G, 3G, etc) are mostly the same. The difference comes in which cell towers you tune to. A cell phone connects to a tower by &quot;tuning&quot; into what are called bands or channels. For something simple as GSM, it is literally frequency bands. For newer tech like CDMA and LTE, it's a bit more complicated because the tower signal jumps frequency bands and is mathematically encoded (stuff that even I don't understand well). </p>
<p>When you buy phones from different carriers, they are set to ignore bands or channels that the carrier doesn't use. It serves several purposes - 1) to make sure you can't take to phone to another carrier 2) to make sure your phone doesn't waste time and battery tuning to cell towers that won't accept them (if you have an AT&amp;T service, the T-Mobile tower will reject you even if you can talk to it) 3) Less testing of the phone necessary, etc. There's software that picks the best tower out of all the towers your phone can hear/talk to
(you might be able hear/talk to multiple towers from your carrier, you want to pick the closest one or the one that supports the fastest data, etc).</p>
<p>When you make an emergency call, the software that's responsible for picking to tower tells the tuning software &quot;THIS IS A FUCKIN EMERGENCY CALL. FULL SPEED AHEAD! CONNECT TO WHATEVER YOU CAN FIND&quot;. The tuning software also keeps track of the last few bands/channels in which it saw any signal. It'll try them first so that you can connect the call quickly. If it can't find any, it'll do a full sweep of all the bands the physical hardware can possibly tune to. </p>
<p>Once it finds a tower, the software for making calls says &quot;HEY MAN, I KNOW WE MIGHT NOT BE COOL WITH EACH OTHER, BUT THIS IS A FUCKIN EMERGENCY CALL MAN! CAN YOU PLEASE CONNECT THIS?&quot;.</p>
<p>The tower goes &quot;OH FUCK! SHIT! I'll connect you&quot;. If the tower is at full capacity, it'll kick out someone who's not in an emergency call and then connect the incoming emergency call.</p>
<p>In fact, you don't even need a SIM card (in some countries) or ever have had service in a cell phone to make an emergency call. That's why when there's no SIM card, the phone will still tune to a tower with good signal and show &quot;Emergency call mode&quot;. This is to make sure we don't waste time when you actually need to make an emergency call. This is why if you are in an area with no cell service from any carrier, your phone drains the battery soon - because it keeps searching each band asking &quot;Can any tower hear me?&quot;. So you should put it in airplane mode. And if you are in airplane mode and make an emergency call, it'll automatically get out of airplane mode. Again to save you time.  </p>
<p>In case your call disconnects, you phone will connect back to the same tower again. This is so that the carrier can try to locate you using the tower signals. If you had connected to another tower, the emergency people might have to connect to the different carrier and start locating you all over again. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: don't try the next part in a real emergency unless you really don't have any other options. I'm not sure all phones do, but a significant portion of them will. </p>
<p>Each country has a different emergency call number. It's 911 in the US, it's 112 (I think) in Europe, something else in Japan. What if someone goes to a different country and get into an emergency? They won't remember what that country's emergency number is -- so the software in your phone will see you are dialing 911 in Europe and go &quot;this person just wants to make an emergency call. I'll just connect to 112 instead&quot;.</p>
<p>There's a ton of cool stuff that goes on in your phone and the carrier to make sure we do absolutely anything possible to connect an emergency call. </p>
<p>Hope this was an interesting read. </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Wow, this blew up way more than I expected. My most up voted comment by a wide margin. Really happy that so many of you enjoyed it as much as I did writing some of this software. It makes me emotional when I think about this work. And obligatory thanks for the Reddit gold. </p>
<p>Edit: Also, so many people assuming that this means it's feasible to hack or asking if it's feasible to hack. No, it's super trivial to avoid hacking this to make free calls. The tower just needs to check the number you are calling is an actual emergency number. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if the emergency calls have special routing behavior to make sure it goes to your nearest call center. So it's even more easy to prevent free phone calls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It might have the same nutrition, or less, or more. If it has more, it is likely due to the cooking process altering or breaking down structures that are hard for you to digest, making it so that you digest more than you would from the uncooked food (i.e. instead of breaking down in your gi tract, it passes out intact as poop).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Living things run on sugar.  When you digest food, you eventually break it down into sugar which feeds your cells.  Unless you are eating raw sugar, your body has to convert your food into sugar so your cells can use it.  </p>
<p>Luckily, the plants and animals we eat also run on sugar.  However, the sugar in plants and animals is usually stored not as sugar but as a different chemical which is more stable and easy to store (like how you can stack plastic cups so that they take up less room).  Animals store sugar as fat, and plants store it as starch or celulose.  </p>
<p>When you eat plants or animals, you are mainly eating the storage chemicals which need to be broken down into sugar so your body can use it.  This takes extra work and energy.  This means you have to use energy to extract energy from food.  In some cases, it takes more energy to break down (digest) food than you get out of it.  For instance, if you ate only cucumbers or lettuce, you would starve to death, because these foods are hard to digest and you actually use more energy than you gain.  </p>
<p>Cooking for helps to break down the complex molecules in the food so that they are easier to digest.  This means you can get more energy eating the food, because you use less energy to digest it.  </p>
<p>Cooking food was important to humans developing as an intelligent species, because our big brains require so much energy.  We couldn't get enough nutrients to support our big brains if we just ate uncooked leaves or raw meat.  </p>
<p>Note this is the ELI5 answer, there is also a lot of other stuff going on regarding protiens and and other nutrients that I do not mention.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a marine biologist at Palmer station in Antarctica for a winter season. There are species of fish in the Antarctic circle that have antifreeze glycoproteins to help prevent their blood and muscles from freezing. The man who discovered this is named Art Devries. I forget his university affiliation. His wife, Chris Cheng, also works with the protein. </p>
<p>My research didn’t pertain to the protein, but you can look up a species name if you’re interested:  Chaenocephalus aceratus. </p>
<p>To help answer your question though, the carcasses will get eaten. Very strange creatures live at some incredible depths in the Southern Ocean (and other oceans for that matter). When fishing the Banana Trench, my research team and I actually caught a sea pig. There’s a great video on youtube called “True Facts about the Sea Pig” that you should watch to get a sense of the weirdness. Anyway, back on topic - other fish eat the carcasses, weird little sea critters will eat them, etc. Nothing goes to waste. </p>
<p>I saw a leopard seal right after eating a penguin when I was fishing in shallow waters in a zodiac. The remaining bits of the carcass was getting eaten by Skuas and other birds. If it weren’t eaten by the birds then I’m sure it would have sunk eventually and been eaten by the fish. </p>
<p>Hope that helps! Sorry my reply is a jumbled mess. I’m on my phone and just got back from another stint on the ice so my brain is still a little fried. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an extremely difficult to answer question in a manner for a 5 year old to understand because it requires a basic biochemistry background to understand but here it goes:</p>
<p>In starvation mode your body is conserving energy. It takes a little energy to digest food and get things going. To make this energy your need the elements potassium, phosphorous and magnesium (how and why is beyond the scope of this question)</p>
<p>Since you have starved, your body's supply of potassium, magnesium and phosphorous are low and are supplying energy to the necessary functions of your body for survival. When you eat, the demand for energy increases to the point where your body cannot produce the necessary energy to digest the food (you lack the 3 key elements in sufficient quantities). Your blood levels of potassium, magnesium and phosphorous go into dangerously low levels that cause cardiac arrest, irreversible neurological problems (because your body's reserves of those elements gets immediately depleted while your gut tries to make the digestive acids, bile, energy for movement through the GI tract).  This is <strong>&quot;refeeding syndrome&quot;</strong></p>

<p>When you’ve been starving/deprived for a long time, your body shuts down everything it can get away with. Growth, reproduction, anything that can go offline or run at bare minimum will start to do so. Remember that physical processes (including digestion) demand energy and nutrients to do, which a starving body can’t spare. Everything has to go towards the absolute essentials, keeping the heart and brain going.</p>
<p>If you were starving and were suddenly given a lot of food (especially rich food) <em>your body wouldn’t know what to do with it</em>. You’re still in starvation survival mode, so non-essentials like digestion are basically ignored. If they function at all, it’s bare minimum. All the food overloads this barely functioning system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is due to the Refeeding Syndrome. When a person is starved, the body switches from sugar to fats and protein as fuel. Also, many minerals and electrolytes are being used up, even if it appear to be of normal levels in blood. Insulin (a hormone to control sugar levels in blood) levels are also suppressed because there's very little sugar. </p>
<p>Then, when you feed the starved person with a lot of food, the insulin level rises, to help use the sugar that is now available. This also cause the body to start regenerating the fats and proteins that was used up earlier. </p>
<p>Those processes requires a lot of the minerals and electrolytes that are already depleted. The cells' fuel, called ATP, is also affected as the processes above and ATP both competes for the same thing (phosphate), which is a bad thing. </p>
<p>Also, as minerals and electrolytes are pulled into the cells, the levels remaining in the blood plunges. This can have impact on how the heart functions and affect its normal beating, and also increases the risk of dying. </p>
<p>Thus, never give a starved person normal quantities of food, or their body cannot handle it and start causing harm. You don't want the body to immediately start making the proteins and fats before the electrolytes and minerals level returns to normal (for the body as a whole, not just for the blood). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
