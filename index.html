		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so I was victim of identity fraud.</p>
<p>Here's how it went down, I'm Dutch though so it maybe different wherever you're from.</p>
<p>About a year after I moved from The Hague to a smaller town, I got a letter in the mail from a debt collectors office stating I hadn't paid bills for an iPhone 6 by a certain provider. Two things: I did not own nor have I ever owned an iPhone 6, and I had never been with that particular provider. So I called the debt collectors and told them about this. I also asked for any information they could give me, but they couldn't release an info at that time. So then I called that provider and explained what had happened. They couldn't give me very much info, but they were able to tell me that my passport had been used to sign the contract, no payments had ever been made, and the adress given was an adress I've never lived at. They couldn't tell me what the exact adress was but they were allowed to disclose the street name to confirm I did not live there. The provider was going to start an investigation and adviced me to file a report with the police additionally. </p>
<p>I looked up the street on Google maps and found out it was very close to the building I used to live. I lived in student accommodation then and I highly suspect it was an employee in the facility. I had never shown my passport to anyone, I wasn't social in the building at all, I had also never lost it. I did however, have to leave a copy at the front desk. So yeah.</p>
<p>I filed a report with the police and any charges from the provider against me were dropped. I never found out who it was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got a bank card in the mail once I didn't open, called to cancel and it was like an online bank I'd never heard of. No clue. Cancelled it before anyone could do any damage with the online account, because card has to be activated first anyway. Apparently this was a test to see if my info is valid before moving on to harder pulls because this online bank is mostly used by students for building credit or something and its easy for ANYONE to get approved no matter credit score. I then put in a police report, filed fraud with that banks fraud department, and I changed all of my passwords immediately. Even reddit. I also monitor my credit religiously, which helped me learn a lot more about it, and I've boosted my score to like top 1% of users. All in all, if you don't pay attention and aren't knowledgeable you can get screwed over pretty quickly. I always check for card scimmers at stores too, and worry about Target or Home Depot hacks like near the holidays. I always try and pay cash on Black Friday or doing holiday shopping now and for like a month before and after. Basically never use my cards at any stores October to January if I can help it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>
<p>These thoughts are called intrusive thoughts and pretty much everyone gets them!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are creep up on us, and are usually pretty horrible thoughts such as kicking an old lady into space, or slapping a child. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They aren't dangerous, just try not to push them out of your head as studies have shown that doing so will just cause you to think about them more.</p>
</li>
<li>Also, try not to monitor them it is said that if you do you can develop a form of OCD that ties in with these thoughts.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question! Scientists in the 19th century really wanted an answer. They saw two possibilities:</p>
<p>1) Light is a particle, so its speed is relative to whatever emitted it. Trouble with that is that is implies that, perhaps with clever use of vibrating mirrors, you ought to be able to slow light down and eventually fill a bucket with it. Since nothing hinted at any sort of &quot;slow light&quot; this was a hard sell.</p>
<p>2) Light is a wave. In that case, it would always move at the same speed with respect to whatever medium was transmitting it. To make this work, they imagined the universe was full of a substance called &quot;ether&quot;. Lots of work went into clever experiments to try to measure the speed of ether.</p>
<p>To see this particle/wave difference more clearly, imagine that you shoot a bullet at a target. Let's say the bullet moves at 600 mph. The sound wave from the bullet moves at 770 mph. Now I drive up in a car at 100 mph and do the same thing. The bullet now goes at 700 mph (because it adds the speed of the car) but the sound wave still goes at 770 mph (because the air isn't moving). That's relative to the ground. Relative to the <em>car</em> the bullet still moves at 600 mph but the sound wave only goes at 670 mph.</p>
<p>The question was: what would light do?</p>
<p>The answer was that both the guy on the ground <em>and</em> the guy in the car measured it as moving at exactly the same speed. <em>Not</em> what anyone expected.</p>
<p>Einstein figured out that the reason for this is that space and time twist themselves into a pretzel to make this work out. He came up with a beautiful system that preserved all the laws of physics, that did not require any special reference frame (i.e. no ether), and which guaranteed that the speed of light in a vacuum, when measured in any frame, was always the same.</p>
<p>But the result was length and time contraction. Those were easy to test by experiment, and have been observed over and over.</p>
<p>As others have said here, when two objects approach each other, their velocities don't really add in a simple way. At velocities <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> you get (<em>u</em> + <em>v</em>)/(1 + <em>uv</em>) (using velocities that are light-speed fractions). So in your example, we get (0.6 + 0.6)/(0.6^2) = 0.882. So each observes the other to be moving at 88.2% of the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything!</p>
<p>This is actually the big trick with relativity - the speed of light is the speed of light relative to <em>any</em> observer. This only works if you change the equations of time and space from the classical forms into the new relativistic forms.</p>
<p>You also need to change the equation for how you add and compare velocities - it's more complex than just adding the two numbers, and you can see the equation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula#Special_relativity" target="_blank">here</a> if you're interested. It turns out that if two cars are moving towards each other at 100 km/h, their relative speed is actually <em>slightly less</em> than 200 km/s relative to each other. This effect is small at low velocities, but becomes extremely important at large velocities. If you go through the maths, you find that if two objects move towards each other at 60% of the speed of light, each one observes the other moving towards them at 88% of the speed of light - not 120%. This is again just a result of the new equations for velocity and time and space that you need to use in relativity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Imagine two spaceships, ShipA and ShipB, in deep space, traveling towards each other.  You're on ShipZ, and you note that both of them are moving at each other at 60% of the speed of light.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From your perspective on ShipZ, you are still, and both ShipA and ShipB are traveling towards each other at 0.6c (60% of the speed of light). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the perspective of ShipA, ShipA will think they are &quot;still&quot;, you (ShipZ) are coming at them at 0.6c, and ShipB is coming at it at 0.88c.</p>

<p>Nobody's perspective is more correct than any other.  An exception to this is spinning.  It does seem that &quot;not spinning&quot; is an absolute measurement since any spin produces a centripetal force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The correct answer, as many others have said so, is, any reference point. The important question is why? It betrays common sense in the sense that if I am moving and trees are not moving, then, I will see them going backwards. How do we convince ourselves that this does indeed happen? The following is a user-friendly approximate model for understanding this. </p>
<p>So, there are three parties to this question. </p>
<ol>
<li>Relative motion - The tree seems to be moving backwards thing. </li>
<li>Inertial frames - Newton's laws are valid in all inertial frames. Inertial frames are those which are unaccelerated. </li>
<li>Maxwell's equations - The four equations linking magnetism and electricity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Light is an electromagnetic wave. It is basically two waves producing each other - the electric field at a point gives birth to the magnetic field at the next point and the magnetic field gives birth to the electric field at the next point. This whole supporting each other part comes very neatly from Maxwell's equations and Newton's laws. </p>
<p>When one tries to apply Maxwell's equations on EM Waves, one gets two results -
[math]E_0 = c B_0[\math]
[math]c = \sqrt{1/\mu_0 \epsilon_0}[/math]
(c is the speed of light)</p>
<p>It all works sensibly, and if you know high school level calculus, you can understand it pretty well online. Now, here is the heart of problem - pay attention - this derivation can be repeated in any inertial frame. The derivation says, the speed of light is equal to c in any inertial frame which directly contradicts relative motion. Thus, we have ended up with an inconsistency. Either, our notions of relative motion are wrong, or our understanding of NLM is wrong or we are missing something with Maxwell's equations. Obviously, for a layman, the most intuitive of these is relative motion and we would have been tempted to see if we have been wrong about NLM or Maxwell's equations. </p>
<p>Here comes this Einstein guy. He imagines a world where speed of light is constant in any frame and tries to understand it. This assumption is equivalent to saying, &quot;Hmmm, okay, let me assume our understanding of relative motion was wrong&quot;. So, he starts with this assumption and starts building his world consistently, much like a very good fantasy writer would do, if he is very serious about following the rules of his world. His world comes up with weird results like time dilation and length contraction and plenty of weird stuff. </p>
<p>Based on this world, we can figure out a model of relative motion called Lorentz transforms, which reduces to the common sense model of relative motion is velocities at much lesser than speed of light. So, Einstein's world acts like our own at low speeds without any fuss. </p>
<p>For years, this was just theory, most plausible but still without any proof. People tried to do experiment to measure the speed of light with a lot of elaborate apparatus and they did figure out that this assumption is correct. The most convincing argument for me is that Einstein's theory suggests a correction in GPS satellites. It is a very small error, results in milli-seconds correction over an year, but it causes the GPS predictions to go hay-wire. However, if we assume the Einstein's world, the GPS predictions are perfect - bang on target. So, we are inclined to believe that Einstein's world is the real world and not a fantasy. </p>
<p>So, in Einstein's world (which we believe to be the most correct approximation of real world), two objects moving at 0.6c towards each other don't see the other at 1.2c. Rather, it would be something like 0.9c. (How do we know this? - Relative motion is now governed by Lorentz transforms which is a property of Einstein's world)</p>
<p>Is that the truth? Honestly, I don't know but I would bet so. We can't do an experiment to verify this exact scenario, but as I said, Einstein's stuff predicts quite correctly in the experiments which we were able to do. The number of scenarios where this holds true is quite large and no other theory comes close to explaining all those experiments this elegantly. So, I hope, if we are able to do some experiment where we can verify this, we would indeed find our predictions to be accurate. In case, we don't, scientists will have a lot of work to do. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: <em>It's a personal question that may make the person you're asking very uncomfortable, and there are sometimes business reasons to not answer it.</em> </p>
<p>First, the heart of the rudeness element is you're invading the person's privacy with what some people feel is a very nosy question. </p>
<p>Salary specifics are generally not publicly known and it can be embarrassing for some person to reveal how little they are actually making if they think they're not making very much, and uncomfortable to others who might be doing well. </p>
<p>Answering runs the risk of being judged. &quot;You only make THAT much? Gee, you're letting them take advantage of you&quot; or &quot;Wow, how do you even look after your family with so little income&quot; in the first case. &quot;Brag much? Who'd you blow to get that salary?&quot; or &quot;Well, la-de-daa lookit Mister One Percent over here!&quot; in the other.</p>
<p>And in some corporate cultures, it can be a bad thing if other people learn how much you make, particularly if what you make is more than your co-workers. A number of years ago, a financial-team coworker found an IT team's paystub and absolutely freaked out that the difference in salaries was so high, and it caused a real shit-storm. </p>
<p>So there's a bit of an unspoken rule that you don't talk about salaries, and people that negotiate or earn good salaries have no interest in sharing the fact that they get a bigger piece of the pie, and managers that know salaries don't share because they usually are not empowered to just give a good but underpaid worker a bump whenever they want.</p>
<p>Since it's uncomfortable or unwise to ANSWER the question, it's rude to ASK it, and generally people don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's something called the &quot;LD50 value&quot;, which is how much of something you can drink before you have a 50/50 chance of dying from it. For alcohol, it's about 5-8 g per kilogram of human weight. For 185 lb (= 84 kg), that's about 420-670 g of pure ethanol. Basically, an entire pint of pure ethanol.</p>
<p>So if you had something that was 10% alcohol (lower end for wine), you'd need to drink 10 pints of it in a short period of time to have a 50/50 chance of death. For something that's 5% alcohol (lower end for beer), you'd need to rapidly drink 20 pints.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>0.40% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is the low range for meaningful risk for coma or death by respiratory failure are estimated.
0.50% BAC is where death is more likely.</p>
<p>For a 180 pound person without odd metabolic or medical issues, it would take 24 shots within 1 hour to get over 0.50% BAC and have a significant risk of death or coma.</p>
<p>However, high tolerance has allowed several cases where people reached higher BAC levels, including <a href="https://guardianinterlock.com/blog/highest-blood-alcohol-concentration-ever-recorded/" target="_blank">the highest ever recorded at 1.48% BAC</a> but that's at the extreme margins. Also, different measurement mechanisms give different results: police breath or blood tests will actually measure lower than hospital blood tests because of different assumptions in calculating BAC (for example, partition ratios of 1:1400 to 1:2100 give widely different results). </p>
<p>One of the advantages of alcohol is that most people will pass out long before they reach these levels. Short of remarkable tolerance from years of hard drinking or drinking loads of shots in a very short period of time it's hard to drink that much. </p>
<p>But ask something harder, like a retrograde extrapolation hypothetical!</p>
<p>For clarity: </p>
<ul>
<li>1 shot = 1.5 oz of 80 proof liquor </li>
<li>1 glass of wine = 5 oz of 12% alcohol (24 proof)</li>
<li>1 beer = 12 oz of ~5% alcohol </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So let's look at an equation like 3 â€¢ 5 = 15. Easy. Now watch how we can take that equation and turn it into 3 = 15 Ã· 5. Also easy.</p>
<p>Now let's put zero in the mix. 3 â€¢ 0 = 0. Okay. So then it would follow that 3 = 0 Ã· 0. And if we change 3 to 4, we would get 4 â€¢ 0 = 0 and 4 = 0 Ã· 0.</p>
<p>Division by 0 is undefined because it isn't equal to any one value. It could be equivalent to anything we like using the above reasoning. This is a problem because the arithmetic operations are actually functions like you learn about in algebra, and functions are only allowed to have one single output for any given input.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that zero isn't just a number, it represents &quot;something&quot;.  Or in this case, zero represents nothing and you can't divide by nothing.  If you tried to divide 1 by 0, that's impossible because you can't divide by something that isn't there.  Same goes for when you try to divide 0 by 0.</p>
<p>Another example.  Let's say you have four apples.  You have to define how you're going to divide up those apples.  You can divide by two, so you'll have two groups, but you can't have no groups at all -- you'll always have at least 1 group with 4 apples in it. </p>
<p>Now, you can divide 0 by 1 because you can divide nothing up however many times you want but you'll still have nothing.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this:</p>
<p>Let's &quot;pretend&quot; that 0/0 is defined and has a numeric value. If we do so, then let us write this:</p>
<p>0*3=0</p>
<p>By algebra, let us divide by zero:</p>
<p>0/0=3</p>
<p>Let's try it again, but this time using 0 instead of 3.</p>
<p>0*0=0</p>
<p>0/0=0</p>
<p>Since we stated above that zero divided by zero is equal to three and it is also equal to zero, then:</p>
<p>3=0</p>
<p>Since 3 is definitely not equal to 0, there is a problem in the math. This is part of the reason why the value is undefined. It appears that we can let zero divided by zero equal anything, which is not arithmetically possible. That is why it is undefined in mathematics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coolness often rests in detachment - a character isn't affected by their surroundings or showing much emotion. Smoking allows a character an opportunity to exhibit this detachment in a way many activities can't. Eating is noisy, both in visuals and sound. Walking generally puts the focus on the surroundings, rather than the character, and involves a lot of movement. Smoking is much more reserved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoking is very &quot;analog&quot;. You have fire, smoke, caustic smells, so it suggests the character in question is sort of unpretentious, down to earth. It also has a long history with society, so regardless of its actual nature, it does have a pedigree of sorts. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoking is hazardous to your health, but a character who smokes clearly doesn't care for such sensibilities. This is related to coolness-as-detachment - it's a mild, relatively clean way of showing that the character does not feel obligated to respect a common societal norm.</p>
</li>
<li>Smoking lets the audience connect with the character during otherwise uncrowded scenes. If a character is smoking, the viewer doesn't need to constantly wonder where the scene is going or what they are supposed to be paying attention to. In such scenes, the cigarette means the character is relaxing, clearing their mind in solitude. Without the cigarette, the mental state of the character is less clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an aside, I am sometimes  jealous of smokers from time to time, because if a smoker goes outside and just feels the night air for a bit, takes a few minutes to themselves, then no one questions them. If I do the same, then people are looking out the window, asking you what you're doing out there, why are you outside, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple reasons in my mind as someone who is starting now to work on feature films. </p>
<p>Firstly, cigarettes are relatable and have been around forever. So even if we may know they are bad we can still see them as something that the &quot;bad guy&quot; has been doing in movies forever! And a lot of times the good guy too. Cigarettes are more widely known and relatable than vaping, though some movies are now using that too. Relatabilitty to a character is key whether they are good or bad. And this plays into the next part...</p>
<p>Smoking allows insight into a character and can often be a flaw despite it looking &quot;cool&quot;. For example of a bad guy, let's imagine Grimsrud from &quot;Fargo&quot;. He is a bad dude and his demeanor, his silence and his smoking clues is in on this almost immediately. As a matter of fact I believe Steve buscemis character even mentions the smoking and asks to roll up a window. So smoking is a negative, silence is a negative, and being a silent smoker who is a behmouth of a person is a negative. Right away we know he is out villain. Now imagine a good guy who smokes like McClane in &quot;Die Hard&quot;. This guy is our hero and a total badass. Now, the smoking does lend itself to the feeling of a badass but also resonates with the audience as a character flaw. Here's this dude going through a rough patch and he's a smoker who becomes a hero. The smoking deepens our understanding of who he is without us being told. </p>
<p>Another reason it may be this way is to show antime period. &quot;Mad Men&quot; is the easy example here. People smoked everywhere back then! The show even deals with the early fallout for advertisers as research on cigarettes and health developed. And the characters think it's bullshit. This really helps sell us this time period and provides some irony. Here are advertisers working for lucky strike who think the cigarette health risks are bullshit. But we are in 2017 and we know better than them which gives us a bit more emotional investment. </p>
<p>Lastly, smoking just looks good on camera. Whispy smoke=cinema good. Flammable things=gold. Hazy rooms that create nice pillars of light=wet dreams for directors and cinematographers. It just lends itself to looking great on camera and because it looks great on camera we think it looks cool.</p>
<p>The last reality is that today smoking is bad and we know this. And things that are taboo or are wrong always look cool! Do any of us want to go blow up a hospital? No, but god did the joker look badass doing it! Do any of us want to rob a bank? No, but every time we watch a movie about it it sure looks fun! Taboo activities are fun and exciting to see because it allows us as normal folks to get a tiny little taste of what it might be like to be the &quot;bad guy&quot;. </p>
<p>I predict in another few decades (if vaping isn't halted by the FDA) that we will see a lot of movies start to use vaping in films. But the cigarettes won't vanish. Both will be in play. I myself have written a feature script (unproduced as of yet) that takes place 70+ years in the future where the American legal system had been revamped into a type of very strict law enforcement that dishes out eye for an eye punishment. My main character in the film vapes. Why? Because it is a flaw since he is not all good but also because in this world cigarettes have been outlawed and only vaping remains allowed as a safer alternative. So all at once it serves to demonstrate a character flaw, the world my characters live in, and provides us the same type of cinematography and aesthetic appearance that cigarettes would have. And likewise, one side character still sneaks real cigarettes from a stash he's amassed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of it is to highlight a character's rebelliousness and all that this represents. However, I believe that it is the cinematography of smoking which is what keeps it alive in movies. It's because burning things and smoke do cool visual things, more than &quot;this character is inhaling tobacco&quot;. Which is why you never see vaping. It also allows for nonverbal dialogue enhancers.</p>
<p>Smoking can affect the lighting in different ways. A lighter close to the face lights up a face in the dark. So can a slow drag on a cigarette. The smoke can obscure things and dance around in the light. </p>
<p>The actor has a prop that can say things that dialogue can't. Especially in close ups. Blowing smoke in someone's face shows contempt. Fidgeting with a cig can show stress or anxiety. A slow pull with a raised eyebrow shows contemplation. No character <em>needs</em> to smoke, disrupting dialogue to have a character take a smoke break won't happen for realism. Smoking just allows visual shorthand to a lot of cliches that smokers and nonsmokers understand without dialogue easier than other nonverbal cues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The moment you feel the slightest inkling of a canker sore coming on (or you bite your cheek or otherwise injure your mouth), immediately rinse with standard H202. Do this a few times a day until the threat has passed. I just take a swig out of the bottle and swish it around for about 30 seconds. I don't rinse with water (or drink water) for at least 15 minutes afterwards.</p>
<p>Using this method I have been mostly canker sore free for years. Even when one gets started, prompt and consistent application of Hydrogen Peroxide makes the sore heal quicker and be much less intense.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is a great question! The mouth and eyes tend to swell more than other parts of the body (like the back, for example) likely for a couple of reasons. One the eyes and mouth have many many blood vessels which means there is going more edema (fluid leaking) and more inflammation (more immune cells which release chemicals or cytokines that can promote swelling). Second, both the areas have very thin skin which means the swelling is more pronounced. That why if you get punched in the eye or lip (vs the back), the area swells fast. Clinically it changes the way I practice. For example, when I do surgery around the eye/upper cheek or do filler in the lip, I have the patient ice for a few hours immediately after to reduce the swelling. </p>

<p>T-Cells are big part of your body's response when you have an allergic reaction or are fighting an infection.  So it makes sense that, since canker sores are caused by that action, that they would swell up (and hurt and be hot) just like a cut that is infected.</p>
<p>It's basically your body having an infection reaction without actually having an infection (since research has shown no evidence of bacterial causes).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
