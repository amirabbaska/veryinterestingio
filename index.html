		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel that the other answers are all missing some clarity, so I'll attempt my explanation here of <strong>The Standard Model</strong>.</p>
<p>As far as we know, all the matter that we can see in the Universe (ie: &quot;stuff&quot;) is made up of two types of particle: <strong>hadrons</strong> and <strong>leptons</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>hadron</strong> is a <em>composite</em> particle; they are composed of several other more <em>fundamental</em> particles: <strong>quarks</strong>.</p>
<p>We currently know there are 6 different types of quark (Up, Down, Top, Bottom, Strange and Charm) each very similar but with slightly different properties. As /u/Aelinsaar pointed out, quarks cannot exist on their own, so they group together in two's (<strong>mesons</strong>) or three's (<strong>baryons</strong>) (<del>and theoretical groups of five</del> and also less commonly, in groups of 4 and 5, as /u/mfb- points out below). <em>Protons</em> and <em>Neutrons</em> are baryons (which makes them hadrons), composed of Up and Down quarks only (2 up + 1 down and 1 up + 2 down, respectively). Protons and neutrons make almost the entirety of the visible Universe, and it's why we can refer to &quot;stuff&quot; as <em>baryonic matter</em>: stuff made of baryons.</p>
<p>There are many other types of baryon and meson formed by different combinations of quark, many of which can be studied in the LHC (a large collider of hadrons, or alternatively, a collider of large hadrons), but they are all &quot;exotic matter&quot;.</p>
<p>A <strong>lepton</strong> is a <em>fundamental</em> particle. There are six known leptons: three <em>charged</em> leptons (the <strong>electron</strong>, the muon and the tau) and three <em>neutral</em> leptons (the neutrino, the muon neutrino, the tauon neutrino). They are all very similar to each other, the main difference being that they are respectively <em>more massive</em> than the previous (the electron and the neutrino are the smallest of their groups).</p>
<p>So, these so far are all the <em>fundamental</em> particles of matter. Normal, everyday stuff is made of protons and neutrons (up and down quarks) and electrons. For all elements (except hydrogen) in their neutral state, that means a small, tight nucleus of protons and neutrons surrounded by a large, diffuse &quot;cloud&quot; of electrons. This answers the main scope of OP's question, but I'll carry on for a bit more.</p>
<p><strong><em>What about anti-matter?</em></strong></p>
<p>Above is only half the picture. It turns out that all of the <em>fundamental</em> particles I mentioned have a corresponding <strong>anti-particle</strong>. All of the fundamental particles above have a property called &quot;charge&quot; (of electric charge) which can be positive or negative, and one of the things that differentiates some of those particles from the other is how much charge thy have. The easiest way to think about a particles anti-particle is that they are identical, except they have the opposite charge (this is not strictly true - neutrinos are neutral, so an antineutrino differs through a different property - the <em>lepton number</em> which I haven't gone into here, but you can look it up if interested). When a particle comes into contact with its anti-particle, they annihilate (they release a lot of energy). Anti-particles are created all the time in natural processes, but they annihilate almost immediately. A big open question in modern physics is why the Universe seems to be made of &quot;matter&quot; rather than &quot;anti-matter&quot;; we believe that when the Universe was created there were equal amounts of both.</p>
<p><strong><em>What about the photon? Isn't that a &quot;fundamental particle&quot;?</em></strong></p>
<p>I've gone over &quot;what stuff is made of&quot;. However, stuff needs to be able to &quot;interact&quot; with other stuff, otherwise what's the point? It turns out that the Standard Model also takes into account how stuff &quot;interacts&quot; with other stuff, and that's where the photon comes out.</p>
<p>There are four main ways that all the above matter interacts, known as the four <em>fundamental forces</em>. They are <strong>electromagnetism</strong>, <strong>gravity</strong>, <strong>strong force</strong> and <strong>weak force</strong>. Explaining properly how they fit into the Standard Model is a bit beyond ELI5 territory, involving some rather nasty an complicated maths and physics (gauge theory). However, it's not entirely incorrect to say that when particles interact with each other, they do so under one of these four forces, and that this interaction takes places as the exchange of a particle, called a <em>force carrier</em>.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Electromagnetism</strong> is by far the most studied and well understood of the forces, and is the one everyone is most familiar with. It determines everything from the fact that the sun shines with light and heat to the fact that your fingers can &quot;come into contact&quot; with a wooden table instead of passing through. The force carrier is the <strong>photon</strong>, and all electromagnetic interactions can be said to involve the exchange of a photon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>strong force</strong> as mentioned by another user is the force that mediates how quarks interact with other quarks and holds them together into baryons and mesons. It is also responsible for holding together protons and neutrons in an atomic nucleus. The force carrier is the <strong>gluon</strong>, and all strong interactions can be said to involve the exchange of a gluon. The strong force is about 137 times stronger than electromagnetism (at very small scales)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <strong>weak force</strong> is responsible for radioacive decay and nuclear fission. It's not often studied alone, but usually together with electromagnetism as they are very closely related. The force carriers are three: the <strong>W^+ boson</strong>, <strong>W^- boson</strong> and the <strong>Z^0 boson</strong>. It's thousands of times weaker than electromagnatism.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Gravity</strong> doesn't actually form part of the Standard Model. This is another Big Question in Physics: how to unify Gravity (whose main theory is General Relativity) with the Standard Model. The force carrier in this case is thought to be the <strong>graviton</strong>, but it's never been observed and some scientists debate it's existence at all. It is by far and large the absolute weakest of all the forces, billions and billions of times weaker than electromagnetism. Think about it: with your puny little hands you can lift something up, immediately and easily counteracting the gravitational pull of the entire planet Earth.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>What about the Higgs Boson</em></strong>?</p>
<p>Of all the fundamental particles I've mentioned (quarks, anti-quarks, leptons, anti-leptons and force carriers), the only one missing from the Standard Model is the <strong>Higgs Boson</strong>.  I won't go into much detail at all other than to say that it is another fundamental &quot;force carrier&quot; which we currently understand to be responsible for the mechanism by which all the other particles gain mass.</p>
<p><strong><em>What's this everyone else has mentioned about bosons and fermions?</em></strong></p>
<p>All of the mentioned particles have several intrinsic properties (although not all of them have them all). Some of the most common and that we are most familiar with are mass and charge (like electric). Turns out almost all of them have an intrinsic property called &quot;spin&quot;, which is related to the intrinsic angular momentum of each particle. The easiest way to visualise spin is to think of the particles actually spinning (although this is completely incorrect!). Spin can have a direction (up or down) as well as a magnitude (an &quot;amount&quot; of spin). This amount can come in half-integer values (1/2, -3/2, 5/2, etc) or integer values (0, -1, 2, etc).</p>
<p>Almost all particles have spin. <em>Composite</em> particles have a total spin which is the sum of the spin of their components. All quarks and leptons are &quot;spin-1/2 particles&quot;, which means they all have a spin of 1/2 or -1/2.</p>
<p>All particles with &quot;half-integer&quot; spin are <strong>fermions</strong>. All particles with &quot;integer spin&quot; are <strong>bosons</strong>.
The main and most important difference between fermions and bosons is that at low energy, they &quot;obey different statistics&quot;. What this means is that when you want to describe a collection of particles (which we often do) and you have to describe their behaviour statistically (because they are too many and too small and too similar to be described individually) you need to use different statistical methods to describe their behaviour (Fermi-Dirac statistics for fermions and Bose-Einstein statistics for bosons).  This leads to a big difference between fermions and bosons - the <em>Pauli Exclusion theory</em> which states that two identical fermions cannot occupy the same &quot;state&quot;, but two identical bosons can - which is a very important phenomenon in quantum physics.</p>
<p>Although all leptons and quarks are fermions, that is not the case for atoms. Depending on the amount of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, atoms can be either fermions or bosons. This means that sometimes different isotopes of the same element can have vastly different properties at low energies.</p>
<p>This was an overview of the Standard Model which obviously is missing out a <strong>LOT</strong>. However, I think I've covered almost all of the basics in an easy-to-understand manner. Please do let me know if something is unclear (or incorrect).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right, so here's the deal since school:</p>
<p>The atom is composed of just what you said, but there is a strong indication that protons and neutrons are composed of more fundamental particles called Quarks, as you said. They're the constituents of a family of particles called Hadrons which are all of the particles which are dominated by the 'Strong' force/interaction (i.e. 'The Strong Nuclear Force you learned about, I would guess). In particular they're a subset of that family called Baryons, which are composed of three quarks, and Mesons of two quarks which we can ignore. </p>
<p>Now, quarks (at normal energies) can only exist in bound groupings; the force which binds them gets <em>stronger</em> as you try to &quot;pull them apart&quot;, to the point where instead of doing so, you input enough energy to create new bound sets of quarks and other particles. This is getting very non-ELI5, but I'll bring this back, I promise you.</p>
<p>So we have the basics: Hadrons are systems of bound quarks (the only way we get quarks), and protons and neutrons are a subset of Hadrons called Baryons. You can't study individual quarks, and if you try to break their bonds you just create new groups of bound quarks scattering around. So... why does this matter? Obviously in most of our lives, in chemistry, you can treat a proton as being fundamental.</p>
<p>Enter the LHC, the Large Hadron Collider, which discovered the Higgs Boson you may have heard about over the years. Now you may have some idea about what that name means, because you know that they must be &quot;colliding&quot; neutrons and/or protons. In fact they do, and at velocities <em>very</em> close to the speed of light, with truly drastic energies. </p>
<p>When these protons (beams of them really, but lets treat this individually) collide, they undergo something called scattering; scientists can study the tracks left by little subatomic particles which result from the process of trying to overcome the Strong interaction I talked about above. You don't get to see quarks, but you can see the evidence of interactions that are best described in terms of quarks. </p>
<p>As to why this matters... well... if you want to confirm existing physics or discover new physics, you need to explore new conditions (in this case very high energy levels). It's not easy; to paraphrase a much smarter person than me, it's like trying to study clocks and clockmaking by smashing clocks together and studying the pieces. </p>
<p>Except the pieces only exist for brief instants, and you can only study evidence of that existence, or infer it from math which says, &quot;If I start with 1 unit of energy, I must end with 1 unit, always&quot; followed by clever accounting from known sources. </p>
<p>Edit: Oh, and you asked about the Electron, which is a fundamental particle called a Lepton, which is not believed to have any constituent parts. That said, you probably learned about a model of the atom in which electrons were treated as discrete particles orbiting a nucleus; the &quot;billiard ball model&quot; which is so well loved and well known. Now that understanding has given way to the notion of energy levels and a probabilistic view of the electron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Super simplified just to give you something to grasp, read the others of you want more details. </p>
<p>Atoms are made of protons, neutrons, and electrons. </p>
<p>Protons and neutrons are things called hadrons</p>
<p>Hadrons are made up of quarks, specifically 2 &quot;up&quot;s and 1 &quot;down&quot; all tied together with gluons</p>
<p>Fermions are just a category of subatomic particles. It includes quarks and even things made of quarks like neutrons. It also includes nonquark things, but thats the general idea</p>
<p>Bosons are the other category of subatomic particles. In my mind, these are more &quot;energy&quot; things. It includes photons and gluons</p>
<p>So quarks are the atom of atoms. Imagine all of those Styrofoam ball models you made in middle school being made of even smaller balls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Electrons are elementary particles, meaning there is nothing smaller, or nothing smaller that we know of, but protons and neutrons are made up of quarks. There are also other particles that are not in atoms. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model" target="_blank">The Standard Model</a> is our current model for particle physics. If you look at the table, you can see the different elementary particles and what they do. For example, Fermions are the &quot;mass&quot; particles, and the gauge bosons mediate 3 of the 4 fundamental forces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Re-defining protons and neutrons to be formed of these quarks that have 6 flavors and &quot;color&quot; charge (similar to how the electron has electrical charge) allows quantum theory explanations of the weak (radioactive decay) nuclear force and the strong nuclear force, that mirror the quantum electrodynamics theory that describes electromagnetism, and allows for a unified (quantum) theory for 3 of the 4 fundamental forces of the universe.</p>
<p>Quantum gravity is still an issue; the force of gravity is still best explained in terms of deformed or warped spacetime, rather than an interaction between fundamental particles that's mediated by the &quot;graviton.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ant colonies can die off in a variety of ways. Mites, other forms of parasites, ant wars, death of the queen, lack of food or sugar or water, predators, disease, and so many more. A colony can usually grow proportionate to its amount of resources, and room to roam. I am not sure how old the oldest ant colony is, but many colonies in captivity have survived for many years. Most colonies with only a single queen only last until her death. This is due to the fact that queen alates(young queen ants and their male equivalents) participate in yearly nuptial flights when they leave to mate. Male alates die right after this, but female alates that do make begin an entirely new colony, with only a few eggs to start. There are some species of ants that can have several queens however, and if the acclamation of the new queen goes well each time theoretically a colony could live forever.</p>

<p>&quot;David Holway, an ecologist and evolutionary biologist from UC San Diego, takes us to a driveway in Escondido, California where a grisly battle rages. In this quiet suburban spot, two groups of ants are putting on a chilling display of dismemberment and death. According to David, this battle line marks the edge of an enormous super-colony of Argentine ants. Think of that anthill in your backyard, and stretch it out across five continents.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ant genetics are a little weird. The females come from fertilised eggs, while the males come from unfertilised eggs, meaning they're haploid. Since the workers are all female, it means the queen needs a ready supply of sperm, preferably not her own sons. So they store sperm from the nuptual flight in an organ called spermatheca. Though it will be rare (due to other forms of mortality), the queen can run out of sperm. The colony can't make more workers, so it will eventually die off.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Resonance frequency.</p>
<p>Microwaves operate at a frequency/energylevel designed to heat water in a food.  If you deviate either of those, then your microwave will actually take longer to cook food.</p>
<p>But that frequency/energylevel can also be shared with other objects.  Some of those will absorb the waves just as readily, if not more so, than water.  This is where our nonmicrowave safe container labels originated.</p>
<hr />
<p>Check this out.  It's for neutrons, but the concept translates for any particle.  <a href="http://nuclearpowertraining.tpub.com/h1019v1/img/h1019v1_113_1.jpg" target="_blank">http://nuclearpowertraining.tpub.com/h1019v1/img/h1019v1_113_1.jpg</a></p>
<p>The neutron is created at a high energy on the far right, and has a low chance of interaction (cross section) with a particle.  But as it collides, it loses energy.  As it loses energy, it has a higher chance of interaction.</p>
<p>Those peaks in the middle?  That's the Resonance Absorption Region, and it's where a microwave is designed to work.  In that area, we have a very high chance of the neutron just getting absorbed.  </p>
<p>In a reactor, that's bad, the neutron was wasted and didn't cause a fission.  In a microwave, it's good.  We just heated the water up even more.</p>
<hr />
<p>Next.  Heat propagates through materials differently.  So yoru plate might heat up just as quickly as the food, but the hot spots spread out very quickly and burn your hand when you grab the rim.  </p>
<p>An option for you, add a little water before you microwave something, especially if it's drying out.  The free water will boil and the steam will heat up your food as it rises through it.  It'll be a lot faster than trying to boil just the internal water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves induce rotation of water/fat molecules at the atomic level, which generates heat. If your food is frozen the rotation doesn't occur very well. The portion of the food touching the plate thaws first, allowing the free molecules to move. So most of the heat is generated right where the food touches the plate. Hence the plate gets hotter than the food. </p>
<p>The material of the plate or possible coating might conduct heat very well allowing that plate to absorb more heat from this process, which will also make your plate feel much hotter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the different materials (plate vs food) absorbing radiation differently and heating differently one should also consider how we perceive temperature. Your skin does NOT measure temperature, it senses the transfer of heat. </p>
<p>For example if you go into a room with a wooden table and a metal chair both are the same temperature (room temperature). However if you touch the metal chair it feels much colder. This is because metal can transfer heat much faster than wood, as a result the heat leaves your hand and flows to the metal chair very fast leaving your hand feeling cold. </p>
<p>If you stood in outer space without any clothes on you would not feel cold as there is nothing for you to transfer your heat to, you will slowly radiate heat in the form of light but this would take a long time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little late to the party but I read something interesting on it a while back. The idea that prevails currently is that your brain has 3 (and a half?) ways of knowing whether or not you're moving. 1) it's telling your legs to move and they are 2) your inner ear says you are 3) your vision says you are (and a half: your peripheral vision says you are). If there is a mismatch on any of these fronts ie: you're in a car reading (legs say they're not moving, direct vision says you're not, peripheral says you are, and inner ear says it's confused depending on how bad the driver is) your brain wants to know why. Because your brain hasn't evolved as much as our modes of transportation have it can come up with only one explanation, you're being poisoned. The fastest way your brain has to get you unpoisoned is to forcefully eject whatever nasty thing you put in your face back out of your face bits. How much your brain actually believes it's being poisoned varies from person to person so not everybody gets car/ motion sick. </p>
<p>Tldr
Brain: wtf is happening guys?
Legs/ears/eyes: yes things are a happen
Brain: uuuuuhhhhh poison? Idk man just to be safe empty out whatever we just ate and we'll call it good. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I frequently suffered from motion sickness and only recently discovered the reason.</p>
<p>It's because the jerks / accelerations felt by you inside the vehicle give the illusion that you are moving, but the still insides of the vehicle give the illusion that you are at rest. Your brain can't handle these conflicting inputs and hence - motion sickness.</p>
<p>An interesting corollary of this theory verified by observation is that <strong>the driver does not feel motion sickness, even when the other passengers might.</strong></p>
<p>This is because the driver's attention is fixed on the road, and therefore their brains realize the fact that they are indeed moving, corroborating the input felt through the accelerations experienced by the driver.</p>
<p><strong>Fix for motion sickness</strong> : </p>
<p>If you're in a car, look out the windscreen and concentrate on the road in front of you. I've done this experiment many times now. Everytime I don't do it, I feel motion sickness. When I do it, I feel just fine.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: The purpose of concentrating on the road is to anticipate the turns and the bumps of the motion in advance, and prepare yourself for them. The driver is the one guiding the vehicles, so they already have this covered. For other passengers, you need to make a conscious effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the UK. The NHS does help out some with dental charges but it's not free, unless you get various means-tested benefits. Although it's undoubtedly still a good deal:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three NHS charge bands:</p>
<p>Band 1: £20.60 covers an examination, diagnosis and advice. If necessary, it also includes X-rays, a scale and polish and planning for further treatment. </p>
<p>Band 2: £56.30 covers all treatment covered by Band 1, plus additional treatment, such as fillings, root canal treatment and removing teeth (extractions).</p>
<p>Band 3: £244.30 covers all treatment covered by Bands 1 and 2, plus more complex procedures, such as crowns, dentures and bridges.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any further treatment in the same band or below is then free for the next two months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, dentistry wasn't a medical profession. Dentists weren't doctors with degrees who went to school for 6 years and then apprenticed for another 6. Dentists were your local barber or blacksmith. Basically anyone who had the tools to pull a tooth from your head.</p>
<p>Because of that 'tradition', dentistry is a completely separate medical profession from everything else. A dentist is a D.D.S -- a medical doctor (cardiologist, dermatologist, endocrinologist, GP) is an M.D.</p>
<p>All of that carries over to insurance.</p>
<p>On a side note there are free health care system that include dentistry, like for example the health care system of Poland, where a visit to the dentist is covered under the free national health care.</p>
<p>In simplest terms it's insurance companies, capitalising on the traditional split of medicine and dentistry to find an excuse not to cover dental needs under a general health care plan so they can bill you for it separately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dentistry is its own profession, distinct from medicine, mainly for historical reasons. A Frenchman, Pierre Fauchard, is thought to have really got modern dentistry started back in 1728. That's over a century before doctors generally accepted that germs cause disease, for example.</p>
<p>As for why it's not funded, it's down to what the government decided. In the UK specifically, changes made in 2006 led to the government not adequately paying dentists for NHS work. In particular those changes mean that a dentist would receive no more money for a 'course of treatment' involving several fillings than they would for a single filling. This has resulted in many former NHS dentists switching to only treat patients on a private basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a college curriculum, courses are numbered to indicate both the level (100-level courses are more basic than 200-level courses) and, frequently but not always, the sequence of courses (you have to take Biology 101 before you can take Biology 102). </p>
<p>A course with a number of 101 is typically the first introductory-level course offered in a discipline. </p>
<p>Why isn't it 100, though? Well, first, it's the sequency. If you have to take 101 before 102, it's easier to understand and remember that 10<strong><em>1</em></strong> is <em>1st</em> and 10<strong><em>2</em></strong> is <strong>2nd</strong> that it would be to remember that 100 is 1st and 101 is 2nd. </p>
<p>Also, at some institutions, the number 100 is reserved for remedial courses. So as a typical first-year student at a US university, you would be likely to take English 101 in the fall and English 102 in the spring ... but that assumes that you have the basic skills in reading and writing from high school. If testing shows that you aren't quite ready for the college-level English courses, you might have to take an English 100 class to brush up those skills before moving on to 101 and 102. That's only at some institutions, though, and not as consistent as the 101, 102 style numbering. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The <em>first</em> first year course you take often <em>ends</em> with a 1.  A new freshman in their first semester might be taking Psychology 101, Chemistry 101, and Economics 101.  The second semester general courses would be 102, and a second year course would be 201.  As courses get more specific and electives become involved, the courses are no longer sequential.  Child Psychology might be 335, while Abnormal Psychology might be 470.</p>
<p>Note that this system is not universal, and most colleges today use 4 digit class codes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason hotel rooms often start at 101, because it's helpful to attach 1 to the number to indicate first (floor/year) so as to not later mess it up later. If the rooms on the Hotel's first floor were 1, 2, 3, the second floor would be 101, 102, 103 (or even worse, 45, 46, 47 if we just straight up count). Similarly by attaching 1 to the beginning to indicate first year courses as &quot;101&quot; we can indicate that they're first year courses and &quot;201&quot; or &quot;250&quot; are second year courses and &quot;301&quot; and &quot;375&quot; are advanced/third year courses.</p>
<p>100 is usually reserved as a pre-101 course that is somewhat remedial in nature (e.g, for a person who is capable but for whatever reason isn't familiar, like a returning student who hasn't taken math in 20 years), with numbers from 95-100 being <em>really</em> remedial (I had a friend who had to take Math 97 their first semester of college, which was like high school freshman-level algebra)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's really because of college department class numbers.  Numbering systems definitely vary a lot, but it seems that a common way to organize class numbers is to have 100-level classes being undergrad classes, 200-level classes being grad classes or maybe advanced undergrad classes, etc.  Really, the numbering is kind of arbitrary, but there's this convention that the intro class to something is 101.  So as a freshman studying psychology, you'd take Psych 101, which would give an overview of the entire field of psychology.</p>
<p>But class numbers don't have to work this way.  The place where I went to school didn't do that.  In the math department, for example, 100-level classes were undergrad classes and 200-level classes were grad classes, but the general intro classes were 000-level or even lower.  So Math 1a and 1b were first and second semester calculus; Math 21a and 21b were multivariable calculus and linear algebra, respectively; Math 23a/b, 25a/b, and 55a/b were progressively more difficult honors versions of multivariable calculus and linear algebra; Math Xa and Xb were precalculus (I think there were two semesters, but I didn't have to take those).  Then, 100-level classes were the specific stuff.  I think 122 and 123 were Abstract Algebra I and II, 138 was Classical Geometry, 110's were analysis (I took complex analysis but I don't remember what the number was), 140's were logic (didn't take any), 100's were basic proof stuff, and so on.  On the other hand, I took one economics class, Ec 1011a, which was the hardcore version of microeconomics (1010a I think was less math-intensive and 1011b was the hardcore version of macroeconomics, but I only needed the one semester).  The prerequisite (which I didn't take) was Ec 10.  For whatever reason, the economics department had four-digit class numbers.</p>
<p>Then again, I think the college I went to is pretty unique.  Most other places probably have a more standard way of doing things.  And that standard way of doing things is for intro classes to be numbered 101.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Dillon and his team of researchers found that the bees they collected could fly at air pressure equivalents exceeding 24,275 feet (7,400 meters) above sea level, equivalent to some of the lower peaks in Nepal’s Annapurna mountain range. Two bumblebees were able to fly at more than 29,525 feet (9,000 meters)—higher than Mount Everest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Bees exist in alpine regions, thousands of feet about sea level.  In terms of oxygen, pressure, and temperature, those are exactly the same as flying that high in the air.</p>
<p>The only real issue would be fatigue, no place to stop and rest going straight up.  I couldn't find an information about bees, but a housefly can travel about two miles without rest.  It would be a little harder to fly straight up, but a mile seems doable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
