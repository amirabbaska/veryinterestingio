This number would also include processed oil that has not been consumed yet (i.e. burned away or used in a way that makes it unrecyclable) Is this estimation even possible?</p>
<p>Edit: I had no idea that (1) there would be so much oil that we consider unrecoverable, and (2) that the true answer was so...unanswerable. Thank you, everyone, for your responses. I will be reading through these comments over the next week or so because frankly there are waaaaay too many!</p></div></div>
