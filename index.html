<p>So when you start moving, inertia keeps the gas stationary until friction with the sides of the moving walls causes the gas to start moving along with the tire. Eventually it all comes up to the same rotational speed. When you start stopping, the gas keeps moving until friction with the slowing tire walls cause the gas to slow as well. Once stopped the gas continues to move until friction brings it all stationary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Been a while but something along the lines of this...</p>
<p>Different molecules absorb certain wavelengths of light. In a lab we can kinda shine light though some molecules and then when viewing that light's spectrum, see which wavelengths are missing (absorbed by the molecules). So in a lab we can make a sort of spectral map for any type of molecule. &quot;When light shines though <em>these</em> molecules the remaining spectrum looks like this, and when we shine light though <em>those</em> molecules the remaining spectrum looks like that.</p>
<p>Now we just need to look at the remaining spectrum from the light of stars and see what wavelengths are missing and match it up to our lab made maps. &quot;The light from that star is passing though such and such type of molecules.&quot;</p>
<p>The cool thing is that there are many different types of molecules in a star, so we will see many many missing wavelengths, but we can match them up to maps we have and figure out all the types of molecules present in the star.</p>
<p><a href="http://sites.oglethorpe.edu/mrulison/files/2016/07/spectrum_binary-1698rt5.gif" target="_blank">Here is sort of an example</a> of two different spectral emission maps combined. The black lines are the wavelengths that have been absorbed by molecules. The top one is apparently from a star rich in hydrogen, and the middle is from a star with lots of heavier metals. The bottom is actually the light from the two stars (a binary system), but it's kind of the same type of spectral map you would see from one star with two different types of molecules blocking wavelengths.</p>
<p>EDIT: I just noticed that you specifically asked about planets, not stars. I've never looked into it, so take this with a grain of salt, but I can only imagine that it has to do with taking the spectral map of the star without the exoplanet in the way, and taking the spectral map of the star <em>with</em> the exoplanet in the way, and then somehow comparing the two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astrophysicist chiming in here. There are essentially 3 things we can measure on exoplanets: radius, mass, and atmospheric content. I answered a similar question about the first two <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/6box89/astronomers_discover_a_puffy_planet_with_the/dhowlgf/" target="_blank">here</a>. For HAT-P-26b, there are a few things I would like to address in terms of what the predicted atmospheric content is.</p>
<p>First off, the water detection. When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star, the light from the star will also go through the atmosphere of that exoplanet (assuming it has one). When light interacts with with the gas in the atmosphere it can be absorbed and scattered. This means that if we look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-spectrum_light" target="_blank">spectrum</a> of light, which is just the intensity split out into wavelength, then we can tell that certain parts of the spectra look different before and during the transit. In the case of HAT-P-26b, there was a clear <a href="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/356/6338/628/F1.medium.gif" target="_blank">drop in the light intensity</a> that corresponds to water. Taking this spectra, you can do some computer modelling of the atmosphere and get some information about the content of said atmosphere. This is essentially how exoplanet spectroscopy works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;found fewer heavy elements than they had expected&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is where the interpretation gets a little less straightforward. In astronomy, we like to use the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity" target="_blank">metallicity</a> which is essentially how much stuff is there other than Hydrogen and Helium in an astrophysical object (it doesn't have to be a metal). For HAT-P-26b, the scientists used the water content as a predictor of the total metallicity of the planet, and then compared that to the planets in our own Solar System, in particular Neptune and Uranus. They found that the metallicity was a lot lower than our Solar System. This is a fine approximation, but water isn't the normal &quot;species&quot; that we use to determine the metallcity in Neptune and Uranus. Methane is considered to be a more accurate tracer of metallicity. Further still, you have to consider the metallicity of the star that these planets orbit. HAT-P-26b's hosts star is considered &quot;metal poor&quot; by some estimates, meaning that you would expect any planets to also be metal poor.</p>
<p>So while the water detection is certainly a very interesting discovery, I don't necessarily agree with some of the interpretation. If anybody would like to read the full paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04354" target="_blank">here</a> is a free link to it.</p>
<p>Edit: I would also like to direct people to /u/Astromike23 and his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6ca2j8/in_as_simple_a_way_as_possible_how_are_we_able_to/dhtat9j/" target="_blank">really great response</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've got a story for you :-)</p>
<p>They can't using &quot;only a telescope&quot;.  They also need some sort of spectrograph.  </p>
<p>So our eyeballs only see three colors (one might argue 4 if you included rods, but whatever).  But light can have infinite different wavelengths.</p>
<p>When you shine light through a prism or diffraction grating, light is bent a different amount based on its wavelength.  Here's a silly picture of a lamp viewed through a diffraction grating I found in a little kids science book:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eNBO0CC.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/eNBO0CC.jpg</a></p>
<p>So the rainbow produced by the prism/diffraction grating, you have the different wavelengths separated by <em>distance</em>.  </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/WDHlMfh.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/WDHlMfh.jpg</a></p>
<p>Now this is a kids diffraction grating and a regular old camera, but it's the same basic idea as what fancy scientific equipment does.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of the spectrum emitted by that lamp (which has a compact flourescent bulb in it)</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TCe6K2Z.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/TCe6K2Z.jpg</a></p>
<p>See some spots are brighter than others.  I looked up the spectrum of CFL bulbs online and found this graph, and overlaid the graph over the spectrum I produced </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IXZJzLU.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/IXZJzLU.jpg</a></p>
<p>Lines up pretty well, eh? :-D</p>
<p>Those spikes are associated with certain elements.  For instance, that bright blue spike on the left is emitted by mercury.  The bright green spike is terbium and mercury.  The bright red one is europium.  And so on.  The spectra of different elements and molecules has been categorized, so by looking at where the spikes are, we can tell what something is just by looking at the spikes.</p>
<p>So for stuff that doesn't glow, we can heat it until it glows, shine the light through a diffraction grating, and voila!</p>
<p>For things where that's not possible, we can do the inverse...  Shine full spectrum light on them (e.g. from a sun) and they will <em>absorb</em> at specific spots in the spectrum.  That's information is all categoried nicely for scientists too :-)</p>
<p>I wrote some software to process the images off the camera, and produced a similar graph to the one I found online using just the data from the pixels in my image.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/a3G0VpC.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/a3G0VpC.jpg</a></p>
<p>The red, green, and blue are because consumer digital cameras have a bayer filter over the sensors, so i'm not getting raw data, just data through red, green, or blue filters.  </p>
<p>And that's the story how I made a spectrometer with a digital camera and a kid's science book.  The scientists are doing the exact same thing, except with something <em>much</em> dimmer than a light bulb a couple feet from me and with <em>much</em> fancier, more expensive equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the answers here are saying, &quot;just take the spectrum of the planet.&quot; While that's the basic theoretical way to do it, in practice it's a lot tougher than just taking the planet's light and passing it through a prism, since that signal is almost always too weak for exoplanets.</p>
<p>Remember, the only way we can even detect that HAT-P-26b exists is because it passes directly in front of its parent star from our point of view - it's basically a very tiny eclipse. When we observe the star from Earth, the star's brightness drops by about 0.5% when the planet passes in front of it. If the planet were bigger, it would block more light during the eclipse; if the planet were smaller, it would block less light during the eclipse.</p>
<p>Now it turns out that water vapor is very good at absorbing light with certain colors. Specifically, water vapor will absorb infrared light with a wavelength around 1.4 microns (different wavelengths are just different colors), while letting most infrared light at other wavelengths pass through.</p>
<p>So, let's say there's lots of water vapor in HAT-P-26b's upper atmosphere. When we observe the eclipse, the amount of light from the star that's blocked out by the planet will depend on the wavelength of that light. Water vapor will absorb any 1.4-micron infrared light that passes through the upper atmosphere, but will let through infrared light of other wavelengths. The result is that the eclipse in 1.4 micron light will be deeper (more total light blocked) than in other wavelengths.</p>
<p>What we end up doing, then, is observing these eclipses in a lot of different wavelengths by placing different filters on the telescope that allows each wavelength to pass through. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/hYyQtgS.png" target="_blank">This graph</a> is from the original paper, showing all the different wavelengths the eclipse was observed in. The dip in the middle of each line there is how much light gets blocked for each wavelength during each eclipse.</p>
<p>When you then compare how deep the eclipse was for each wavelength, you end up with <a href="http://i.imgur.com/j9UoP3L.png" target="_blank">this graph</a>, also from the original paper. The black dots are what's important here (the colored lines are all just different models). The black dots around 1.4 microns are a lot higher than the rest, telling us that a lot more light near those wavelengths are blocked out during the eclipses, and so we can conclude that there must be a good deal of water vapor in the upper atmosphere blocking out that light.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: We observe eclipses when the planet passes in front of the star in many different colors. Water vapor blocks out certain colors better than others, and we see deeper eclipses in those colors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>You are right in that many DJs perform by 'hitting the play button'. However, there are several other methods to perform live as a DJ as well. </p>
<p>Using Ableton in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pj6M_rpDOCk" target="_blank">performance mode</a>, is a popular choice for many DJs and allows you to manipulate which tracks play in real time. For example, the DJ might have isolated vocal mixes and isolated pre-made backing tracks (these isolated tracks are called <em>stems</em>) and might mix and match them to create music in real time. </p>
<p>Another alternative is to play parts on a synthesizer and sampler/drum machine live and record them into a step sequencing machine, which loops the patterns, allowing you to manipulate the sounds on the synthesizer(s) and add layers to the song, a technique demonstrated <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE25XQpFW7M" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
<p>Another option is to use a DJ deck in order to mix and match backing tracks and vocals or other instruments, allowing you to create unique mash ups. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CmMRIOOABBg" target="_blank">Here is an example of this method in action</a>. </p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong> There are different styles of performing electronic music live and it's entirely dependent on the DJ for whether they want to 'hit the play button' or not. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/deadmau5-clarifies-press-play-comments-about-fellow-djs-20120625" target="_blank">Here</a> is an interesting article about performing electronic music, with some comments from Deadmau5. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of EDM DJ's use the Pioneer CDJs and mixer that are at the venue – they are essentially digital turntables.</p>
<p>Before a gig, a DJ uses Pioneer's Rekordbox software to analyze all their tracks to get the tempo, key, and cue points they may have set, and then they typically export their set (playlist) onto a USB flash drive. When it's time for the show, they plug the USB into the CDJ/mixer setup, and then they can instantly access all of their music; the equipment allows them to do things like change tempo, sync tracks, apply turntables FX (vinyl stops, etc.), mixer FX (delays, reverbs, etc.), and even beat juggle and scratch if they want to/can.</p>
<p>The advantage of this system is that you: don't need to bring your expensive computer into the booth where it's liable to get stomped on, have drinks spilled on it, or even stolen; there is very little chance of having a software issue – e.g. the computer operating system crashing; if you lose the USB, you can just create a new one; you can store an absurd amount of music – more than any vinyl-vased DJ ever could – on a single USB; and, lastly, when you don't have a computer screen in your face, you can connect with the audience a lot more easily – nothing is less appealing to a crowd than seeing someone up on stage with that glaring white light splashed across their face while they scroll through songs or their email or Twitter feed (yes, this happens 🙄).</p>
<p>I have met DJs, famous and not famous, who use Ableton to DJ, or just push play; if that's how they want to do things, well, no one is going to stop them, but I, personally, love mixing tracks live without a pre-arranged set. It is just like playing an instrument, and it allows for all sorts of awesome, happy accidents to occur; also, if the crowd isn't feeling a track, it gives you the flexibility to mix out quickly and switch up the vibe. Lastly, it's just more fun; mixing live is challenging, and I would be bored to tears if I were just standing up there while the music played.</p>
<p>I hope that helps! I started on piano when I was 4, and I dropped out of med school to pursue music. I have been Producing/DJing since 2012, and I have played at EDC Las Vegas, Life in Color, Beyond Wonderland, Trapfest, Freaknight, What the Festival?!, Foam Wonderland, and I have been direct support for people like Datsik, Flux Pavilion, Dillon Francis, Antiserum &amp; Mayhem, Blasterjaxx, Herobust, Wuki, Loudpvck, Gladiator, Riff Raff, Lil Debbie, Brillz, Milo &amp; Otis, TJR, 12th Planet, and a bunch of other folks.</p>
<p>I'm happy to answer any other questions regarding behind-the-scenes DJ/Producer stuff; I've seen so much bullshit backstage and at after parties, and it's really obvious who makes their own music and who doesn't, and who knows how to DJ and who doesn't.</p>
<p>The best DJ I have ever seen, still, to this day, is DJ Craze. He is unreal, and I am thankful I got to peek over his shoulder at a sold out show. Mind = blown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I know I'm late to this post but I hope some people that have the same question as you, see this. There are plenty of &quot;press play&quot; DJs that are more about the spectacle than the music (think Steve Aoki with his cake throwing and crowd innertubing), but there are lots who either still use vinyl or do the equivalent of live mixing, just with digital files instead of records.</p>
<p>But there's a new wave of DJs really trying to step things up and change the game. I'm biased but one of my favorites is Derek Vincent Smith, aka Pretty Lights. He started as a live mixing digital DJ but with a twist, he had a live drummer (Adam Deitsch) for the first few years. He went solo for a while but became bored and really stepped things up.</p>
<p>Here's where the Analog Future band comes in. Derek mixing in the middle, occasionally playing some bass or other instruments. Keyboard. Horn sections. Guitar. All with a crazy light show and being mixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ZymzS8ntxZ0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/ZymzS8ntxZ0</a></p>
<p>Now he's doing something even crazier... On recent tours he's doing an &quot;Episodic Festival&quot; thing and they have improvisational breaks thrown in, even the mixing. </p>
<p>Beyond all that he started the Pretty Lights Music label that has brought us some of the best contemprary names in the game... Gramatik, Michal Menert, Break Science. </p>
<p>Derek is a goddamned musical genius and I fucking hate that Pretty Lights never gets the credit he deserves. Check out some of the Analog Future and Episodic Festival gigs and tell me he isn't singlehandedly changing the game right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DJ here.  When it comes to DJs with ACTUAL talent (and there are a lot of hacks in the industry doing the above), it's about using technique (mixing, cutting, scratching) to create one large music piece out of many other music pieces, as well as creating entirely new pieces of music out of elements of others (mash ups).  For example, for a show tonight, im doing a live mash up of an Odesza track with the vocals of &quot;black hole sun.&quot;  I do it live, so i use the decks to manipulate the vocals (using cue points and controlling the speed) and layer it over the track in a coherent and believa ble fashion.  this live mashup is then mixed in from another track, and mixed out into the other track seamlessly.  Coupled with everything else, the point is to tell a story live to the listener that blends and moves seamlessly as if one piece.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in a mega club, so I feel like I should chime in something. The top comment right now, is right to a certain extent. There is a degree of deconstructing and reconstructing going on. Though a large majority of the time, it is not happening live. A lot of EDM and Dubstep dj's would love to have you believe they're manipulating all this wildness in real-time, but it just isn't happening. </p>
<p>My job was L2, which basically means, I was the back-up lighting guy. I would fix a light if it started to wig out, swap a light out entirely if needed, refill foggers and gazers, operate lights when the main LD wants a break. Many times, I would find myself on stage teching a light next to the dj. Generally, after I would fix them, I would hang low and out of sight for a minute or two behind the dj to make sure it was working fine. </p>
<p>Sometimes while doing this, I would look at what the dj was doing... if you saw two tracks playing at the same time in Serato or Traktor, you knew he was mixing. Although, most, if not all use Auto-Sync these days. Their reasoning is that it sets them up to do more &quot;performance&quot; oriented stuff like a filter sweep. Other times, if you only saw one track playing and the wave form barely moved at all, then you knew that they're just hitting play on a pre-mixed set at home and twiddling knobs to empty channels. I've seen amateurs do this, and I've seen the highest paid &quot;professionals&quot; do this.. My problem with this is, we (the club) are paying you 75,000$ for 3 hours, and you come in with a premixed set and fake everything. On the flip side to that, if you come in with a premixed set but have a video guy and lighting guy that know that set by heart and have content made for it, then that premixed set can be a REALLY awesome experience... Most notably, Paul Van Dyke and Excision.</p>
<p>When I worked there, the idea of premixed sets pissed me off to no end. It jaded me a lot on dj culture and the entire idea of what djs do. But, now that I'm older, I've just learned to ignore and try to have a good time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What these two have said is correct. The s denotes a theoretical state the working fluid came to via a theoretical isentropic process. This is usually in cases in which we assume the ideal machine model, in which the device  (turbine, compressor, pump) is adiabatic and reversible, and thus isentropic. In reality, friction and heat transfer (irreversibilities) occur in the device, and so the machine is not isentropic, and would put the working fluid through a process that would bring it to a different state (sometimes this state will have an &quot;a&quot; subscript, for &quot;actual&quot;). As previously stated, the entropy will increase across the device. When analyzing these devices, we often calculate the isentropic efficiency of the device, which compares the actual performance of the device to the theoretical isentropic performance of the device. Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

What is meant is that it takes that long for the thermal energy in the core to make its way to the surface. The predominant mechanism for thermal energy transfer inside the Sun is radiative but that doesn't mean that one single photon is bouncing around making its way to the surface. Rather, a photon will hit an atom or electron and accelerate it, then later that atom or electron will emit a photon and in that way the thermal energy from the core will eventually filter out to the surface, cooling off along the way though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Photons are bosons, which means that apart from a handful of obvious physical properties (energy, direction, polarization) they are <em>literally the same</em>, in the strongest possible meaning of the word. There is no way to distinguish photons with same quantum numbers. None, nada, the nature itself doesn't distinguish them, and we can prove it by studying their statistical properties. It's not some peculiarity of the photons, all quantum particles obey this law. For each one there is but a handful of parameters that distinguish them, and a part from that they are physically the same. An electron in your room isn't different in any sense from an electron inside the sun, they could swap places and nobody would ever notice.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a delicate point about time translations in general relativity, which corresponds to a delicate point in the definition of energy. </p>
<p>As you might already have guessed, continuous transformation to a physical system correspond to a certain associated quantity (called a &quot;charge&quot;) that &quot;generates&quot; the transformation. If a transformation is a symmetry, then the corresponding &quot;charge&quot; is conserved, which is Noether's theorem.</p>
<p>Now, energy is <strong>defined</strong> as being the &quot;charge&quot; to time translation. But what are time translations, exactly?</p>
<p>Our current understanding of fundamental physics takes the form of a pair of interacting, but very distinct entities: the stage (spacetime) and the actors (&quot;matter&quot;). It's not a trivial fact that you can always separate spacetime from the things that move on it, and for example theories of quantum gravity such as string theory tend to blur this line. But as physics stands right now, they're two different things, and both of them are dynamical objects and evolve in time according to specific laws, the famous equations of motion (eom). So &quot;matter&quot; (in which I include everything that isn't gravity) has its system of eom, while the shape of spacetime (the <em>metric</em>) evolves according to <em>its</em> own eom, which are the Einstein field equations.</p>
<p>Note that these two eom are <em>coupled</em>. The eom of matter depends on the shape of spacetime, which affects the motion of particles for example, while the eom of spacetime depends on the matter content, which can create curvature.</p>
<p>Ok, now, back on track: you want to translate something in time; i.e. move all events so that they happen, idk, one second later. It seems completely natural that you should do this by translating <em>both</em> matter and spacetime. They are two physical, dynamical interacting subsystems, they are your physics. They should both be subject to the transformation. Is this always a symmetry? Yes. Both the eom of matter and the Einstein field equations do not depend in any way on what time it actually is, and nothing will actually change. So... let's call the associated charge <strong>the</strong> energy and it has to be conserved, and we're done, right?</p>
<p>That doesn't work. Here's why: if you move both spacetime and matter forward, say, 1 year, this is obviously entirely equivalent to keeping everything where (when?) it is, but assigning a time of 1 year less to all events. Imagine if we were to rewrite all books and all information so that dates are shifted back one year, 2017 -&gt; 2016 and so on. Would <em>anything</em> physically change? Not at all. Is this <em>really</em> a nontrivial transformation?</p>
<p>It's not. It's just a change of coordinates, because time t is just a coordinate on spacetime. And coordinates have no real meaning. That's a fundamental point of general relativity, actually. Since our transformation is dumb, the corresponding &quot;charge&quot; is also dumb: it's always zero*. This is why you sometimes hear of the <em>total</em> energy in the Universe being zero, and I'll clarify in a minute in which sense this is &quot;total&quot;. The point is this definition is almost completely pointless because what good is a physical quantity that is always zero no matter what happens to the system you care about, and what good is it to know that it is conserved (well, duh)?</p>
<p>That's why you actually define time translations in a slightly different way. You only translate matter, not spacetime. If you do it this way, then if the metric of spacetime does change in time, the same matter will find itself in a different shape of spacetime, and so this will not be a symmetry <em>unless</em> the specific shape of spacetime itself is time-translation invariant. In other words, you are acting only on the matter and its own eom, while the metric is more in the role of &quot;background&quot;; since the eom for matter does depend on the metric, it's not, with this philosophy, invariant under time translations. Note how delicate, in the interpretation of the sentence &quot;the laws of physics are/aren't invariant under time translations&quot; is what you actually call the laws of physics and what you call background. The charge associated to these transformation is energy (let's call it physical energy), and is the energy you're more familiar with. And it is not conserved if the metric of spacetime is not time-translation invariant, like in cosmological expansion.</p>
<p>But the &quot;stupid&quot; energy is useful because it gives us an interpretation of the &quot;lost&quot; or &quot;gained&quot; energy in expansion. The physical energy just defined does not include gravitational potential energy. In fact gravitational potential energy is associated to time-translating the metric. Thus the &quot;stupid&quot; energy being conserved just means that (physical energy of matter) + (gravitational potential energy) is conserved. It's not a particularly useful idea in terms of calculations, but it's the approximate physical interpretation you can give of this. So when CMB photons get redshifted by cosmological expansion, you can definitely answer the question &quot;where does the energy go&quot; with &quot;energy is not conserved, because the metric is not time-translation invariant, period&quot;, but you can actually equally well say &quot;it becomes gravitational potential energy of the photons. The other masses in the Universe are getting farther from the photon and so its gravitational potential increases.&quot;</p>
<p>Ok. With that out of the way:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and you can generate infinite energy,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>yes, you can. It's easy: put a spring with two endpoints a cosmologically-sized distance away. The spring will be stretched by dark energy and you will be able to extract work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>would it also invalidate the law that entropy always increases</p>
</blockquote>
<p>no, but that's really subtle. Gravitational phenomena are able to reduce entropy in a small subsystem but at the expense of creating a much larger amount of entropy in a larger subsystem. (I've talked about this in detail <a href="http://rantonels.github.io/gravity-entropy-and-life/" target="_blank">here</a>). Living beings (including humans) are also able to do the same thing.</p>
<p>The point is that to do this, you need to shed matter that should carry away the large entropy. The second law can <strong>never</strong> be violated (the possibility to create energy out of nothing does not actually help with that). If you need to continuously shed matter to decrease entropy, you're gonna have to get smaller and smaller, and at a certain point you will run out of matter. So there is simply no way to escape the heat death: at some point in the future, any existing structure, computational mechanism, or order of any sort will be dismantled.</p>
<p>* more precisely, it can also be a constant independent on the actual state of the Universe. But still equally pointless, and the rest of the reasoning is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Short summary:
You have the ability to control your tensor tympani muscle, which is used to control your cochlea in response to loud sounds. This creates a rushing, rumbling sound in your ear.  Some people can only do it with eyes closed, some for only a limited time. Some people experience a clicking sound before rumbling. It varies from person to person. I can do it by closing my eyes, opening my mouth wide, or just normally, but for a short time. </p>
<p>It is a very rare trait. Other ear rumblers can be found at r/earrumblersassemble </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer: It is not possible.  </p>
<p>Longer Answer: Your identity getting stolen has a lot more to do with what the corporations and entities that have your information are doing with it than anything you are doing.  </p>
<p>Under a few specific circumstances, like say getting hacked and having health data stolen because you weren't following the law with regards to how it had to be handled, you can get in trouble for actions that will result in identity theft.  </p>
<p>But someone paying for LexisNexus data and then going out to steal your identity is probably one of the easiest ways. They already collected all the data that you need from public records ect. Unless it becomes illegal to traffic in data on people that can result in identity theft, its going to keep happening.</p>
<p>There are also a variety of other factors in play:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies collect data that can be used to steal your identity, like your social insurance number, as a means of identifying you</li>
<li>There isn't any consequences to just covering up the fact you got hacked instead of disclosing it to people</li>
<li>If you do get hacked and a bunch of data stolen that lets other people steal identities, you aren't the person who deals with any repercussions, so no incentive to protect against it in the first place</li>
<li>Banks are the major fraud targets, and their &quot;solution&quot; to identity theft has typically been &quot;more of the same&quot; like asking additional questions about who you are on the phone ... which are frequently also stolen via the same methods thieves use now. Until some kind of two-factor authentication shows up that banks feel like integrating, no one else will follow suit</li>
<li>The &quot;Everyone else does it this way&quot; factor is really large in business. Its an excuse a lot of people hide behind for not having better processes in place, or just not collecting data they don't need in the first place</li>
<li>And if I recall, the terrorism laws after 2001 led to a proliferation of entities collecting Social Security Numbers, like clerks at CVS collecting them for those prepaid credit cards you can buy. This made it a lot easier to get ahold of them, and meant there were more places to find them, like the junky computer from 1993 CVS has in the back that has never been updated</li>

<p>2015</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Thursday revealed that 21.5 million people were swept up in a colossal breach of government computer systems that was far more damaging than initially thought, resulting in the theft of a vast trove of personal information, including Social Security numbers and some fingerprints.
Every person given a government background check for the last 15 years was probably affected, the Office of Personnel Management said in announcing the results of a forensic investigation of the episode, whose existence was known but not its sweeping toll.</p>

<p>May 26, 2015</p>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said on Tuesday there were about 200,000 attempts to illegally access tax information from February to May this year.
He said of those, about 100,000 were successful. The hackers used the &quot;get transcript&quot; application, which calls up information from previous returns, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2016</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In February, a seemingly rogue hacker targeted the FBI and DHS, publishing contact information for 20k and 9k employees, respectively, on Twitter. The hacker compromised the email of a DoJ employee, which gave him access to the information. One of NASA’s drones was allegedly hacked by the known hacktivist group Anonsec, and data on over 2,400 employees, along with flight log and aircraft videos were released. A 300-page zine was released, detailing the information and security failings of NASA. The hack was executed through brute-forcing an administrator’s SSH password left with a default password, which led to root access to three network-attached-storage devices. Lastly, the IRS was hacked in February and an estimated 700,000 social security numbers and other sensitive information was stolen, just months after its most recent hack in May of 2015 (not counting compromised information resulting from a lost flash drive in August 2015). The attack, which took advantage of the ‘Get Transcript’ program, allowing you to check your tax history, severely increased the risk of identity theft for all victims who had data compromised.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe you should go to the source:  I've written 3 books about this starting in 1998 -- and all of these appear to be related to the same threads -- over 2 decades. </p>
<p>Here's a free copy of the latest book, &quot;The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal &amp; Free the Net&quot;, which we put up a few weeks ago because few, if anyone actually bothered to read how the calculations were done. They were based on the telco's annual reports, state filings, etc.-- and the data is based on 20 years of documentation-- Bruce Kushnick
<a href="http://irregulators.org/bookofbrokenpromises/" target="_blank">http://irregulators.org/bookofbrokenpromises/</a></p>
<p>I've been tracking the telco deployments of fiber optics since 1991 when they were announced as something called the Information Superhighway. The plan was to have America be the first fiber optic country -- and each phone company went to their state commissions and legislatures and got tax breaks and rate increases to fund these 'utility' network upgrades that were supposed to replace the existing copper wires with fiber optics -- starting in 1992. And it was all a con. As a former senior telecom analyst (and the telcos my clients) i realized that they had submitted fraudulent cost models, and fabricated the deployment plans. The first book, 1998, laid out some of the history &quot;The Unauthorized Bio&quot; with foreword by Dr. Bob Metcalfe (co-inventor of Ethernet networking). I then released &quot;$200 Billion Broadband Scandal&quot; in 2005, which gave the details as by then more than 1/2 of America should have been completed -- but wasn't. And the mergers to make the companies larger were also supposed to bring broadband-- but didn't.
I updated the book in 2015 &quot;The Book of Broken Promises $400 Billion broadband Scandal and Free the Net&quot;, but realized that there were other scams along side this -- like manipulating the accounting. </p>
<p>We paid about 9 times for upgrades to fiber for home or schools and we got nothing to show for it -- about $4000-7000 per household (though it varies by state and telco). By 2017 it's over 1/2 trillion. </p>
<p>Finally, I note. These are not &quot;ISPs&quot;; they are state utility telecommunications companies that were able to take over the other businesses (like ISPs) thanks to the FCC under Mike Powell, now the head of the cable association. They got away with it because they could create a fake history that reporters and politicians kept repeating. No state has ever done a full audit of the monies collected in the name of broadband; no state ever went back and reduced rates or held the companies accountable. And no company ever 'outed' the other companies-- i.e., Verizon NJ never said that AT&amp;T California didn't do the upgrades. --that's because they all did it, more or less. I do note that Verizon at least rolled out some fiber. AT&amp;T pulled a bait and switch and deployed U-Verse over the aging copper wires (with a 'fiber node' within 1/2 mile from the location). </p>
<p>It's time to take them to court. period. We should go after the financial manipulations (cross-subsidies) where instead of doing the upgrades to fiber, they took the money and spent it everywhere else, like buying AOL or Time Warner (or overseas investments), etc. We should hold them accountable before this new FCC erases all of the laws and obligations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the agreement had no teeth, probably because it didn't define the problem in actual terms that could be acted upon in the case of failure.</p>
<p>Really, how would you want the contract written to require broadband for everyone? You can't require 100% coverage because my grandmother doesn't want it. You can't​ require everyone that wants it gets it because there is that guy in Alaska that lives 500 miles from his closest neighbor. You can try to say 80% of people who ask can get it, but what happens for those that can't get it? They can't get it because they are not in XYZ's coverage area. But they are asking because they are in nobody's coverage area, so what company puts them down as a no when none applies, who do you blame for not expanding? That metric doesn't work either.</p>
<p>The problem is the only concrete stuff you can do is tell them where to spend it, if that's on ”installing fiber&quot; then that's what they'll spend it on. But ISPs are constantly installing fiber, in fact that may be spending billions a year just to replace existing fiber, if you tell them you'll pay for it they'll just stop paying for installing fiber and let you pay, the money saved can be given out to shareholders. That of course is equivalent to just giving the money away, but there wasn't anything that said they can't​ do that.</p>
<p>So really it's a very hard problem to define, there can be some requirements on it, but they can't be tough, and that makes it just about equal to giving it away. If the government wanted their money spent on expanding access to specific markets they would of been required to tell the ISPs exactly what they want built and then maintained ownership of it, the way the power company where I live works. But that's government run ISPs, and everyone seems to hate that idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also helps to start in the 1980s with the history of how we got our current ISPs.</p>
<p>The TLDR version is:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Corporation#Monopoly" target="_blank">AT&amp;T had a monopoly</a>.  They built a lot of their infrastructure via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eminent_domain" target="_blank">eminent domain</a> law and taxpayer money, for the &quot;greater good.&quot;  As a business, using other people's money to grow is a good move.  The issue currently is ISPs don't want the government telling them what to do with the infrastructure.</p>
<p>See, in the 1980s all these other people wanted to get into the same business AT&amp;T had, but they didn't want to invest in building infrastructure when AT&amp;T already did, using eminent domain and tax money.  These other businesses argued that AT&amp;T having sole control over the lines was unfair, since taxes paid for some of it.  The government stepped in and said, &quot;sorry, Ma Bell, but you have to share.&quot;  Because of this we got a lot of ISPs that sprang up in a short amount of time, and until a few years ago all those ISPs were fighting for their own chunks of business.</p>
<p>Now we're stuck with a few large ISPs that control everything, just enough to the point of legally being able to say it's not a &quot;monopoly&quot; when for the most part people have no choice in their city for an ISP.</p>
<p>America has been sick of having no choice, and poor internet speeds, so the government has once again tried to encourage growth by using tax money as an incentive to expand.  </p>
<p>The problem is the ISPs are deathly afraid of expanding while the Net Neutrality laws exist because they don't want other small ISP startups coming along and using the infrastructure they're making.</p>
<p>What I mean to say is, the big ISPs don't want to expand with better fiber service anywhere unless they can control it, but they also won't pass up free tax money.  They take any free tax money they get from the government and then exploit loopholes from shoddy contracts to avoid actually expanding.  They invent excuses to avoid actually expanding.</p>
<p>Basically the ISPs have been holding internet infrastructure expansion hostage until the FCC rebrands them, because they don't want to be held accountable to governmental oversight.  They want to monopolize the new fiber system before they actually build it, and recently the FCC caved in to their demands.  </p>
<p>I'm not just regurgitating stuff I've read on the internet here.  I used to work for MCI, a company that wouldn't have existed if the FCC didn't break up Ma Bell in the 80s.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These figures seem to all be laid out by Bruce Kushnick, chairman of Teletruth and Director of the New Networks Institute, who also wrote the &quot;The Book of Broken Promises: $400 Billion Broadband Scandal and Free the Net&quot;. In his previous 2006 book named &quot;$200 Billion Broadband Scandal&quot;, which can be found at <a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/broadbandgrants/comments/61BF.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.ntia.doc.gov/legacy/broadbandgrants/comments/61BF.pdf</a> as it seems to have been given in its entirety as a public comment, and as the ycombinator commenters point out, the author seems to arrive at the ~$200 billion figure based mainly on overcharging that the author figures should have been better regulated by the government.</p>
<p>I think where the confusion stems is from the line in blog for the new book which says: &quot;<em>America will have been charged about $400 billion</em>&quot;, which may have gotten confused as being entirely some form of subsidy or handout from the government while the author probably means the overcharging of each individual American customer plus the tax write-offs as per his 2006 book. Without seeing the book we can't be certain but given the author's very similar claims from his 2006 I would say it's a safe assumption.</p>
<p>As for why all this overcharging happened: it was not just the ISPs which were doing it. Computer technology in the home and office seriously exploded from around the 1980s and on at a pace that made it ripe for exploit as it was all so very new without nearly as many expectations and understanding as we have today. Part of that exploitation was monopolies that probably shouldn't have happened, including Microsoft which lost an important anti-trust case in 1998. The main argument seems to be that Internet, which is even replacing phone service in some parts and will do so even more then true 4G is fully rolled out, should be a well-regulated utility like phone service currently is in the US. Based on this notion we have the idea of the US government &quot;letting&quot; the companies have all this money from the American people.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How does anybody pocket anything? You give me $200 billion to do something.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Well that something requires a plan. So I pay myself $500 million to explore and investigate that plan. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After I finish the investigation of that plan to do something, I pay myself another $500 million to work out the logistics of implementing the plan and creating the jobs necessary to complete the plan. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We start doing that something, but only a little, and way over budget. I pay myself the leftover $1 billion doing very little of that something.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're way past deadline, way over budget, and I've moved all the money from the fund to my own pocket. So I stop doing that something and wait for you to give me more free money.  </p>
</li>
<li>You're not getting your money back suckers. <em>What u gonna do about it? Cash me outside. How ba da?</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The mistake was our politicians giving corporations large sums of money to do something without effective enforcement mechanisms. The politicians were either corrupt or egregiously naive to think a corporation would act in society's interest rather than shareholder's interest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
