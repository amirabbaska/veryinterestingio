		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the pressure drops, the equilibrium of CO2 dissolved in liquid should favor the atmosphere. That's the opposite of what you are experiencing.</p>
<p>When you moved, is it significantly hotter? Or are your drinks not staying as cool as they were? Higher temps would also make the CO2 favor the atmosphere over being in solution. </p>
<p>Another thing you might consider is that your sense of smell and taste vary, given humidity and altitude. I grew up in high altitude Albuquerque NM, and currently live in Austin TX, which is about sea level. I always feel like soda is &quot;crisper&quot; when I'm in Albuquerque, compared to when I'm in Austin. Same with water. I'd guess it probably has something to do with the difference in humidity, at least in my case.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> /u/fraghawk points out that it may be mineral/contamination from water. If you get soda from fountains or use ice, this may be the difference as well. There is a limited amount of stuff you can dissolve in water, so if there are a lot of minerals in the water, it can make the CO2 less soluble as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you open a carbonated beverage it starts to come back to equilibrium, that's why there are bubbles.
Increasing the atmospheric pressure will increase the amount of a gas that will dissolve, decreasing the rate that bubbles form. Decreasing the temperature will also increase the amount of a gas that will dissolve.</p>
<p>This is how carbonated beverages are made, the beverage is passed through an atmosphere of pure CO2 under pressure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the air pressure things been touched on already by the top comment, wanted to explore another avenue. While pressure might be higher at lower altitudes and theoretically your soda should take longer to go flat, another factor to consider is temperature! For gasses, the solubility actually decreases at higher temperatures! So another thing you might want to look at is purely if where are living now is generally warmer than where you were before. Maybe you are comparing your sodas summer fizz vs your usual winter fizz. Just a thought :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, just because two objects attract does not mean that they will hit each other. The sun attracts the earth, but that doesn't mean that the earth falls into the sun, it stays in a stable orbit. Gravity curves the trajectory of the earth towards the sun, but that results in a stable orbit instead of collision. The Coulomb force between two opposite charges follows the same power law as gravity and therefore comes with the same dynamics - so a negative charge can orbit a positive one.</p>
<p>But that's not the whole explanation for the atom case. What keeps the previously mentioned orbits stable is the fact that the two bodies have angular momentum relative to each other: If you would cancel the motion of the earth relative to the sun and then unfreeze it again, it would fall into the sun.</p>
<p>For atoms in the other hand we have stable configuration even without angular momentum. Here quantum mechanics comes into play: The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_principle" target="_blank">uncertainty principle</a> dictates that the electron cannot be perfectly localized at the position of the nucleus in its groundstate, but is delocalized in some finite area around the nucleus. </p>
<p>Even so the electron still has some probability to be at the position of the nucleus with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_capture" target="_blank">observable consequences</a>. But if the electron doesn't undergo a reaction with the nucleus, then it this probability to be in the core does not really affect the properties of the atom and it will effectively have a shell with finite extension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a couple of things going on.</p>
<p>Even in regular old boring classical physics, things which are attracted to each other don't have to hit each other. So the Earth doesn't have to collapse into the Sun, because the Earth is going sideways fast enough that it just falls around the Sun instead of into the Sun.</p>
<p>It's quite popular to think about the atom as being a bit like a solar system, with the nucleus being like the Sun and the electrons being like planets orbiting it, but this actually couldn't really work. An accelerating charged particle (where acceleration here doesn't just mean speeding up, it means any change in velocity, that is how fast or in which direction you're going) emits electromagnetic radiation. So if the electron really did orbit the nucleus like planets orbited the Sun, it would lose energy through radiation and crash into the nucleus.</p>
<p>What saves the day is quantum mechanics. The electron doesn't behave at all like a planet going round the sun. It's often said that in quantum mechanics things act like waves and particles; in this case, it doesn't really look much like a wave, because it's a wave that's forced to wrap around the nucleus, which is not really the sort of thing you see often.</p>
<p>Possibly the best metaphor to help grasp a bit what it's like is to think about a string fixed at each end. If you start that string vibrating, there are a few ways it prefers to vibrate, and these are called modes; you can see them <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Waves/imgwav/strhar.gif" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>An electron is a bit like that; because you're forcing it to wrap around the nucleus, it can only exist in one of a bunch of discrete modes, and even the most fundamental, lowest energy, mode is kind of a spherically-symmetric cloud around the nucleus, where the density of the cloud tells you how likely it is that the electron will be there. There is a chance the electron will be inside the nucleus, but it's much more likely to be elsewhere.</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.falstad.com/qmatom/" target="_blank">Java applet</a> (physicists who write code have a surprising love for obsolete things) renders what the probability clouds (or orbitals) look like. n=1 is the lowest energy level, and the l number is angular momentum. These discrete energy levels are actually what determines chemical behaviour: you'll note that the l numbers are labelled s (l=0), p (l =1), d (l = 2), f (l = 3), and you might recall s, p, d, and f from chemistry. You may also notice a correlation with the periodic table; it gets wider as you go down the rows, just like there are more possible l states the bigger your n number is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's nothing like an orbit. </p>
<p>That metaphor is useful if you don't really care to know anything beyond the fact that atoms consist of a central nucleus surrounded by electrons. (Even so, they really needed to get that little diagram out of school textbooks decades ago.)</p>
<p>So it turns out that an electron around an atom is required to have certain specific energy levels. We're still good. The reasons for this are complex but partly have to do with things I'll discuss in just a second.</p>
<p>It also tuns out that certain other measurable properties are required or forced by various reasons, to take on a limited set of discreet values. Such as, angular momentum, magnetization, etc, etc.  This was all discovered experimentally by observing the energies of photons given off by various excited atoms.</p>
<p>I also think I need to go over the idea of momentum as a vector, that Is, a quantity that has both absolute magnitude, and direction. </p>
<p>Still with me on all this? Now to the meat of the issue. </p>
<p>It turns out there's no force or effect in the subatomic world that forces an electron to have any particular direction of momentum, or any particular location. To an electron one position can be valid as another. Or at least a certain range of positions. And a certain range of directions of momentum are equally valid. There is nothing stopping this. </p>
<p>In fact this must be the case.</p>
<p>A consequence of the mathematical relationship between position and momentum, is that the range of possible values of directional momentum is inversely proportional to the range of possible locations.  That is, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle.</p>
<p>At best you can say that it's less likely for this odd creature we call an electron to be in some areas, and more likely for others.</p>
<p>This is what prevents the electron from colliding with the nucleus. That would mean it's range of possible locations was extremely, unbelievably small. In turn, that would force it's momentum to be impossibly large. </p>
<p>With some uncertainty, you can actually measure the momentum of electrons ejected from hydrogen atoms, for example. It turns out to be no where near the figure you'd need if you supposed the electron was confined to a space as small as the nucleus.</p>
<p>This means that the idea of an orbit which has one specific position and direction at one specific time, is illogical.</p>
<p>Experimentally, it was found that if a beam of electrons was bent by an electric or magnetic field, they would lose energy by emitting photons and slow relative to the source of the field.</p>
<p>So a pure particle electron orbiting in a classical sense would quickly lose kinetic energy and collide with the nucleus.</p>
<p>In a certain sense the electrons around an atom might be said to not accelerate at all. But if they have a net kinetic energy, how do they avoid escaping the atom without accelerating?  Who knows? This is probably more a result of the inability of the particle model to sufficiently describe electrons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>This has perhaps not been explained here. The formula you stated for factorials is a 'special case'. It is not a general formula. </p>
<p>There are many such special cases.</p>
<p>For example, the general formula for a polygon of equal sides (edit: and equal angles) is 0.5 x perimeter x apothem.</p>
<p>But in the special case of a square, and only for a square, which is a 4 equal sided, equal angled polygon, the area can simply calculated as (side)². </p>
<p>Similarly for the special case of n ≥ 1, the factorial can be calculated a n(n-1)...(1). This way is not applicable for calculating other factorials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After following the reference bread crumbs for a while (curse Wikipedia editors who cite science journalists who in turn don't link to the actual paper!), the source of the uplift rate numbers comes from this <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/318/5852/952.full" target="_blank">2007 paper in Science</a> that found an acceleration of rates up to ~7 cm/yr since 2004, but present a record of surface uplift rates going back to 1923. To construct this record, they use all three of the common techniques to detect vertical surface deformation: InSAR, GPS, and leveling data. I'll describe each method below, but an additional resource to look through is this <a href="https://www.unavco.org/education/resources/modules-and-activities/gps-yellowstone/module-materials/activity-files-yellowstone/ground-deformation-w-notes.pdf" target="_blank">presentation produced by UNAVCO (pdf)</a> designed for high school students to understand how we measure the changes in surface deformation of Yellowstone.</p>
<p><strong>InSAR</strong>, or interferometric synthetic aperture radar, uses differences in phase of radar pulses bounced off the surface of the Earth between multiple passes of a satellite to measure vertical deformation (in actuality, what the satellite can measure is changes in distance in the line of sight of the satellite so if using just radar images from the same look direction of a satellite, it may not be strictly vertical deformation). <a href="http://www.geo.cornell.edu/eas/PeoplePlaces/Faculty/matt/vol59no7p68_69.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a write up of how InSAR works that is sort of pitched to the laymen</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometric_synthetic-aperture_radar" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> page also provides a decent amount of information for how InSAR works and its uses, and if you really want information overload, check out the <a href="http://vldb.gsi.go.jp/sokuchi/sar/qanda/qanda-e.html" target="_blank">FAQ page from GSI, the Geospatial Information Authority of Japan</a>. InSAR is used extensively to measure vertical surface deformation related to earthquakes, volcanoes, and groundwater extraction. Under good conditions, InSAR can measure vertical changes on the order of millimeters, but with atmospheric disturbances and changes in ground cover between satellite passes, the precision is usually centimeters at worst. The precision can improve when doing long time series of successive radar images (as with the Yellowstone data).</p>
<p><strong>GPS</strong>, or Global Positioning System (now that everyone has one in their phone, not as much need to explain that acronym). Geologists and geodesists use GPS systems to measure movement of the surface of the Earth (these are not your run of the mill GPS units like you have to go hiking, these <a href="http://kb.unavco.org/kb/article.php?id=55" target="_blank">are pretty expensive and very sensitive pieces of equipment</a>). Geologists often focus on what these data tell us about horizontal motions, but a GPS station is recording its position in X, Y, and Z at all times so you can extract information about changes in a position in all three directions. GPS stations/measurements come in two flavors 'campaign' and 'continuous'. A campaign survey is where you install a series of benchmarks (i.e. put some semi-permanent marker in a spot, some concrete, rebar, etc) and you 'occupy' these benchmarks for a few days with a GPS unit maybe once a year over several years and use the change in position between successive surveys to calculate the movement of that spot. Continuous surveys, as the name implies, is where you instead set up a GPS receiver and leave it there to log its position semi-continuously. In the case of continuous receivers, you can develop time series of the stations position like <a href="https://sideshow.jpl.nasa.gov/post/tables/GPS_Time_Series.pdf" target="_blank">this (scroll to the last page of this pdf for an example)</a>. You can see the change in the position of this station in latitude (Y), longitude (X), and height (Z). It's common for height to have seasonal variations like you see in this data set related to changes in groundwater, so if you're interested in the longer term vertical change you need to remove this seasonal signal / average across the time series. You can look at the time series for the <a href="http://www.uusatrg.utah.edu/ts_ysrp.html" target="_blank">continuous stations in Yellowstone (click on a station to see its data)</a> for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Leveling</strong>. While we have technologically impressive ways to relatively quickly measure vertical deformations on either very short time intervals (GPS) or over large areas (InSAR) the tried and true method of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levelling" target="_blank">leveling surveys</a> still provides quite robust data. This also has the advantage of having been around (and the precision hasn't gotten that much better) for decades so it can provide longer term datasets (this is how they have a record going back to 1923 in Yellowstone). Leveling surveys were basically the earliest data to allow us to look at surface deformation on short time scales and there are numerous examples of it being used before wide spread availability or application of GPS or InSAR, like this <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/92GL01638/pdf" target="_blank">classic example from the Himalaya</a>, but it is still used today, like this <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2011JB008242/full" target="_blank">paper looking at surface deformation in Taiwan from a recent(ish) leveling survey along with  GPS</a>. While laborious, leveling surveys can produce comparable results to GPS and InSAR in terms of precision and are cheaper and don't require sophisticated equipment (beyond the survey gear) to capture or analyze the data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So i had to remove the top reply in this thread.  I know people are going to want to know why, and my explanation is buried there.</p>
<p>It was a copy and paste of <a href="https://redd.it/5640rc" target="_blank">this comment by /u/TheTimeNotTheMiles</a>.  That is one of the reasons that the OP of the removed comment didn't respond to anyone.</p>
<p>That violates our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/about/rules#" target="_blank">rule #3</a> explicitly.  I think though that it violates the spirit of rule #1 as well.  </p>
<hr />
<p>I'll post the contents of that original comment here for convenience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So lets say we have a scalpel, right? Simplest medical device there is. There's a number of ways to make it totally(ish) sterile- gases, steam, dry heat, gamma radiation.</p>
<p>But as you ask- the little bacterial corpses are still there. Waiting, one presumes, for tiny necromancers.</p>
<p>The problem occurs when you stab someone with the scalpel, preferably in a medicinal way. The bodies immune system works by identifying certain chemical triggers in bacteria, and has no way to know that, for example, the lipopolysaccharide hanging around in someone's heart is not part of a bunch of living bacteria, but the floating corpses of dead bacteria.</p>
<p>The dead byproducts of bacteria are called &quot;pyrogens&quot; because they cause (among other things, such as death) fevers.</p>
<p>Where do they go? Nowhere. Bacteria are small enough that water has completely different properties on their level. Beyond rinsing off gross matter and reducing bacterial load, washing can't do much.</p>
<p>So for things like heart surgery scalpels, there will usually be a second step of &quot;Depyrogenation&quot; This is the process, not of killing bacteria, but of removing the bits left behind so they don't trigger an immune reaction. This varies widely in complexity depending on what you have to depyrogenate- steel scalpels are easier than an injectable drug, for example. Typically, the goal of the process is to so thoroughly break down the biological material left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Are my hands covered in bits of dead bacteria?</strong></p>
<p>No your hands aren't covered in dead bits of bacteria. They're covered in happy, healthy bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>Then why wash my hands??</strong></p>
<p>Washing your hands removes dirt and debris that carry the nastiest bacteria. Sterilizing your hands is a ridiculous notion however- your hands are made of cells, bacteria are made of cells. Anything that would kill them would kill your cells. Your hands, and literally everything else on the world not currently under direct gamma radiation bombardment, are covered in bacteria,</p>
<p>Quick run down on terms:</p>
<p>&quot;Cleaning&quot; a medical device is basically doing dishes-getting blood n bits off the reusable ones. (plz dont reuse single use medical devices that makes regulatory professionals sad 😭)</p>
<p>&quot;Disinfecting&quot; is using chemicals to get something purty darn clean.</p>
<p>&quot;Sterilization&quot; is killing all* the germs on something</p>
<p>&quot;Depyrogenate&quot; is taking bacterial corpses and reducing their remaining structure to a point where your immune system won't recognize it and freak out.</p>
<p>*SALx10-6 is the typical sterility level for a medical device. one in a million germs/one in a million devices</p>

So even if you combined all of the rocky material in the solar system into  one planet it would have a mass of 0.02% of that of the Sun, around Saturn's mass (100 Earths). </p>
<p>More realistically, you might see a rocky planet form with a mass similar to that of Neptune (around 10 earth masses). If it formed very close to its star, it might be unable to grab any gas (too hot) and it would remain rocky. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>you could conceivably stand on</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So that's actually enough to calculate the average density your planet would have. If you don't wanna be killed by that planets gravity you should have a surface gravity (at most) simular to earths, so about G=10m/s^2. Assuming with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the size of Jupiter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>you mean with the same radius: you want a radius of about r=70Mm
Using Newtonian Gravity we get: G = gamma <em> M/r^2 (gamma = 6.67</em>10^-11 m^3 / (kg <em> s^2) and M the mass of you planet) with M = V </em> rho = (4/3) <em> pi </em> r^3 <em> rho (rho is the density) and some rearranging: I end up with rho = 3 </em> G/(4 <em> pi </em> r * gamma). For the values above the density is about 500 kg/m^3 so your planet couldn't be a solid rock. Just for comparison, the density of lithium is about 534 kg/m^3. Even if you assume that your gonna train really hard and only stay for a short time you might be able to survive a surface gravity G of 20m/s^2 than you can have a planet with about 1000 kg/m^3 and your planet could be a Jupiter sized water world. But if you wont a planet the same density as earth you would probably die very quickly because the associated surface gravity is about 100m/s^2 or 10 times the level you experience on earth. If you happen to be a well trained military fighter pilot wearing a well designed suit you might not die instantly but you couldn't stay for long.
Don't even think about the Sun. rho(r=1.4e9m, 10m/s^2) ~= 24kg/m^2 so your sun sized planet couldn't really be made from any solid material I am aware off.</p>
<p>Note: I am assuming constant densities here. Something like a very light core and a thin  rocky surface might still exist although I doubt such a thing could form...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

With a radius only 2.35 (2.31 to 2.44) times that of Earth (and so a volume 12–15 times that of Earth), and a density higher than Earth's (6–8 g cm−3), it is unlikely to contain significant amounts of hydrogen and helium gas. Outgassed or accreted hydrogen-rich atmospheres would have been lost over the 10.6 billion-year lifetime of the Kepler-10 system. Instead, the composition is likely to be mainly rocky, with a water fraction of 5–20% by mass. The bulk of this water is likely to be in the form of high-pressure &quot;hot ice&quot; phases</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely. Sound is simply longitudinal air waves cause by the vibration of an object at a particular frequency. When we say that humans can only hear a certain range of sounds, it means that the little hairs that are connected to nerves that connect to the brain can only vibrate (and therefore interpret) those sounds. But what matters for hearing loss is the 'magnitude' of those sounds, ie their decibel value, how loud they are. A good example of this is found in case studies of people who live near wind turbines. These generate a lot of low frequency noise which is mostly inaudible, but there have been reports of hearing loss from them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That &quot;u&quot; shape at the top of the water.  The attraction between the surface and the water molecules is stronger than the attraction of the water molecules to each other.</p>
<p>So, when pouring, the force of the gravity on the water needs to overcome this surface tension to pull the water away from the container.  When the angle between glass wall and vertical direction is small, the component of gravity perpendicular to container wall is small and surface tension is stronger, causing the water to stick to the container and run down the outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: You're pouring too slow. </p>
<p>Everything about water can be explained with two of its properties: </p>
<p>It is <em>cohesive</em> (sticks to itself) and <em>adhesive</em> (sticks to other stuff). </p>
<p>In this case, the water sticking to itself tends to make it follow, uh, itself, out of the container in a smooth pour. </p>
<p>But the water sticking to other stuff, like the container, will tend to make it dribble over and down the sides. </p>
<p>Which properties dominate depends on a lot of things, like material properties and time spent forming bonds (ie speed of the pour). If you pour too slowly for how &quot;sticky&quot; the container material is, the water spends too much time bonding to the container and some of it bonds more strongly to the lip instead of its water molecule brethren. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is talking about how liquids interacts between hard surfaces and softer surfaces, but I'm assuming you mean when pouring from the same or similar container. For example, if you're using the same glass or bowl each time and sometimes it pours and sometimes it doesn't the answer is simple: Water sticks to water (cohesion) and if there is water on the lip/rim of the container then it will stick to that water and spill everywhere. If the lip/rim of the container is dry then it will pour correctly.</p>
<p>You can try this yourself. Next time the water is pouring all crazy just take a towel and dry the lip/rim of the container and then continue pouring. It will then pour correctly.</p>
<p>Now not all liquids are as cohesive as water and so this effect may differ between liquids, but is the same general idea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's one influence missing from the answers. It's the interaction of the fluid with the solid surface. Although this closely related to surface tension, it is a different result. In engineering it's called &quot;wetting&quot;. It's the affinity a liquid has with a solid surface.
You can tell if a fluid has good wetting properties by looking at the shape of a single drop on the surface. If it's very spherical the surface tension is higher than the affinity towards the solid. If the drop smears itself out it has higher affinity.
So in the end you have several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>surface tension vs wetting properties: low affinity liquids will want to detach from the canister surface quicker.</li>
<li>pouring speed: higher speed means higher inertia, which means the flow will rather go straight on as opposed to follow the shape of the spout.</li>
<li>fluid viscosity (thickness of the fluid): thicker fluid will have a laminar flow, which means the fluid speed  is quite low near the surface of the canister. Low speed means low inertia, means it's difficult to flow straight on. Which is why syrup pours poorly.</li>
<li>spout shape: a sharp edge or smaller radius of more difficult to follow due to inertia.
Now you have all factors involved! So it's chemistry as well as physics and shape.
Cheers!</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You mean &quot;micro gravity&quot; as &quot;anti-gravity&quot; is more of a science fiction term (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-microgravity-58.html" target="_blank">micro-gravity is NASA's term</a> about living and working in/on spacecraft). Or more likely just &quot;weightlessness&quot;.</p>
<p>Female astronauts have the option of carrying their preferred pads or tampons while in space (<a href="http://www.popsci.com/brief-history-menstruating-in-space" target="_blank">Popular Science 2016</a>). If they choose to not get their periods they can medically induce amenorrhea, or stop their periods from happening (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/04/menstruating-in-space/479229/" target="_blank">The Atlantic 2016</a>). There was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npjmgrav20168" target="_blank">a scientific paper</a> written on medically induced amenorrhea in female astronauts in 2016. </p>
<p>There are several ways to induce amenorrhea, through hormonal pills, injections or intrauterine device (IUDs). While it is safe to have your period in space, it may not be all that convenient to switch pads or tampons and deal with disposal. The water treatment is also set up to recycle water from urine, but not menstrual blood so that is also an issue (<a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2014/acs-presspac-april-9-2014/recycling-astronaut-urine-for-energy-and-drinking-water.html" target="_blank">American Chemical Society 2014</a>).</p>
<p>According to National Geographic (link below) if a woman spent three years in space she would need about 1,100 pills, which adds some weight to a mission but is less unwieldy than many tampons. Alternatively, three years worth of tampons (or pads) still weighs more than three years worth of pills.</p>
<p>Female astronauts' periods have a long history. National Geographic has a great opening paragraph in one of <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/22/how-do-women-deal-with-having-a-period-in-space/" target="_blank">their articles</a> on the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sally Ride’s tampons might be the most-discussed tampons in the world. Before Ride became the first American woman in space, scientists pondered her tampons, weighed them, and NASA’s professional sniffer smelled them—better to take deodorized or non-deodorized?—to make sure they wouldn’t smell too strongly in a confined space capsule. Engineers considered exactly how many she might need for a week in space. (Is 100 the right number?, they famously asked her. No, Ride said. That is not the right number.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think what you were getting at is how does the blood come out without gravity? Because in that case it actually doesn't require gravity, the muscles in the uterus push it out sufficiently enough that it's unnecessary to worry about, but the comments about how you would deal with it are all correct and quite frankly hilarious on the scientists part. As a physicist who is a part of mission planning it's obvious that none of the men (who make of 90% of the field) would have any idea how to deal with such an issue. </p>
