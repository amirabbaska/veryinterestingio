		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cambridge!</p>
<p>In or before 1688, Cambridge University used a ranking system for students to help professors keep track of student progress: Fresh Man, Sophmore, Junior Sophister, Senior Sophister.  These terms relate to the Greek &quot;Sophos&quot; meaning knowledge and were meant to reflect the amount of knowledge the student possesses.</p>
<p>Every major English-speaking University copied this in some form or another. It is why we now consider 4 years necessary to obtain a bachelors degree. The actual names of each rank varied from campus to campus. Importantly the names used at Harvard University were &quot;Freshman, Sophomore, Junior Soph, Senior Soph.&quot;  Sometime before 1800 &quot;soph&quot; was dropped from the upperclassmen titles. </p>
<p>In the 19th century the US greatly expanded its high school and university offerings. With many founders educated at Harvard, their system was exported across the US.</p>
<p>So the question should be, why did the British Empire stop using these terms? The answer is Empire. The older Universities in Scotland and Ireland adopted the 4 year system but, because they were not founded by Cambridge alumni, they adopted their own ranking terms. At St. Andrews University, for example, the ranks were bejaune, semi-bejaune, tertiand, and magistrate. As the U.K. sought to standardize education throughout its territory, it sought to not impose one campus culture on another, instead going with very clinical 1st-4th year. </p>
<p>The U.K. Terminology translates easily and is unambiguous even in the US, so it should be used in most cases. </p>
<p>TL;DR - Frontier principals had <del>dilutions</del> delusions of grandeur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These English terms originated during the Renaissance at Cambridge University, which had a three-year course of study. </p>
<p>As other answers have pointed out, <em>freshman</em> is a compound that means &quot;new man&quot;, &quot;novice&quot;. At that time, the upperclassmen were split into <em>junior sophisters</em> (&quot;lesser&quot;, &quot;secondary&quot;) and <em>senior sophisters</em> (&quot;superior&quot;, &quot;greater&quot;, &quot;primary&quot;). <em>Sophister</em> is derived from the Greek <em>sophos</em> meaning &quot;wise&quot;, and in that time meant &quot;arguer&quot; or &quot;debater&quot;.</p>
<p>In the 1600s, a fourth designation came into use: <em>sophumer</em>, which was a synonym for <em>sophister</em>, derived from French instead of directly from the Greek (Think <em>regal</em> vs. <em>royal</em>). This term denoted advanced underclassmen, but at the time was not a separate year of study. Over time, and probably in America first, <em>sophumer</em> became <em>sophomore</em>.</p>
<p>John Harvard, the founder of the university that bears his name, encountered the categories during his study at Cambridge and brought them over to Cambridge, Mass. in the 1630s. Being used at Harvard, they spread to other American universities and came into use in high schools in the early twentieth century.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>in high school, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th grade are used synonymously with freshman, sophomore, junior, and senior (respectively). in university, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year are associated with these terms.</p>
<p>these terms are used both in high school and college/university and are uncommon outside of the US. canadians typically use grades 9-12, and they'll use first-fourth year (or further, if they've taken extra credits) for university.</p>
<p>a freshman means someone who is new, or a novice. it's a slang term that eventually became official. how it became official? it's unknown but it's likely that because these terms were in use for so long, they started being used in official capacity.</p>
<p>sophomore comes from greek, meaning sophos (think 'philosophy) meaning wise, and moros (think 'moron'). something that is sophomoric, is something that it thought to be a good idea but isn't at all. basically a beginner mistake. why sophomore is used for 2nd year or 10th grade specifically? again: we don't know. it may be that the term was a denigrating term used by juniors and seniors. </p>
<p>junior and senior are upperclassman levels. upperclassmen are people who have been in the school system longer, and may have been a subjective term in the past. now, it's fixed. a junior is a 'junior upperclassman', meaning they're a younger upperclassman. a senior is a 'senior upperclassman', meaning they're an older upperclassman.</p>
<p>so... why these terms instead of year 1, 2, 3, and 4?</p>
<p>in high school and university, one's 'year of study' is not denoted by how many years they've been in the system. it's denoted by how many credits they have toward graduation. this may be an explanation for why 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th year are not as commonly used: their year of study does not adequately describe how many credits (or years of study) they have to graduate. it's not a perfect explanation, though, but it's the best non-etymological one i can think of.</p>
<p>to make things more confusing, there are multiple types of freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors. there are 'redshirt freshmen', who are in their 2nd year of study but play a sport at a freshman level. there are '5th year seniors' (or further on such as 6th year, often called 'super seniors') which are a result of the above paragraph: people which not enough credits to graduate but have been in the program for longer than 4 years. 4th year juniors are often a result of redshirting one's freshman year (or delaying eligibility to play a college sport while still enrolling in the school)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't see why the uncertainty principle would limit this situation from happening. The scale is too large. I did not read the question as either particle being absolutely fixed at one precise coordinate in space the whole time. Yeah, that would not be physical. Rather I read that the situation starts with initial separation of ~1 meter.</p>
<p>There would initially be a coulombic attraction proportional to the inverse distance between them squared. After a certain point the electron would be trapped to an orbital of the proton in a standing deBroglie matter wave forming a hydrogen atom. The Schroedinger equation has near zero probability of the electron falling into the proton. The potential energy of such a situation would decrease (nature loves that) however the total energy would (always!) remain constant so the momentum of the electron increases the energies balance into orbitals.</p>
<p>Sometimes however the proton does grab an electron. This is rather rare, but does have a probability. In this instance the proton and electron collide and form a neutron and a neutrino.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think people are missing the <em>intent</em> of this question. Let's not take it so literally, but consider the idea of what would happen to an electron and proton in &quot;relatively neutral conditions&quot;, where they are close to a standstill. I think that's the point of the question here. Let's say they are one meter apart with minimal momentum, or possibly a minimal momentum in the same (parallel) direction if that helps (to see if the particles attract each other, and if so how quickly). </p>
<p>So... what would happen if you had a proton and electron <em>approximately</em> one meter apart with a <em>minimal</em> or nearly negligible momentum in the same parallel direction? </p>
<p>Thoughts? Answers? </p>
<p>Will the weak attraction be sufficient to alter any probabilistic vectors? If so, how quickly? And why is the likelihood of the pair forming a hydrogen atom? Low I imagine....?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This situation is not strictly possible due to Heisenberg uncertainty. You can solve the problem classically.</p>
<p>Quantum-mechanically, you'd have to loosen up the restrictions. They can't both be stationary <em>and</em> localized at a fixed distance initially. You can fix them at some distance, in which case they have a superposition of many momenta, or you can have them move towards each other with fixed momentum but no definite position. Or anything in between, as long as the HUP is satisfied.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The exact experiment would be impossible to carry out because of uncertainty, but you could get pretty close. In that case the system would approach a bound system with the excess energy radiated away as photons. How it gets there is where it gets interesting as there are a bunch of different routes to get from your initial condition to the final state. Additionally, in some sense it actually takes all possible routes that couple those two states. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

HBO gets paid via subscribers, shows like Game of Thrones help pull in people who might not otherwise have subscribed.  Add in DVD sales, and you've got pretty much it's whole pool of available money.  </p>
<p>For most TV it works a bit different through.  </p>
<p>Ratings:  Ratings indicate how many people are watching a show.  They're typically measured by the Nielsen group, which hands randomly selected family a special box that monitors what they watch.  If 1 in 10,000 families have a Nielsen box, then each Nielsen box represents 10,000 views.  It's honestly a terrible system, because certain types of are more prone to be selected/be willing to be a Nielsen family.  It also doesn't take into account things like DVR, streaming, etc. </p>
<p>Based on a shows ratings, a sponsor can estimate how many people will see a commercial if they buy air time during the show.  A show like &quot;The Big Bang Theory&quot; that is routinely the highest rated sitcom on TV, can offer a huge audience, which makes its time more valuable.  A 3rd string show on a smaller network gets less viewer, and thus demands less money.  </p>
<p>Ultimately the networks sell ad time to sponsors, at a rate based on ratings for the show.  The network &quot;buys the show&quot; at a fixed rater per season, by paying the production company that makes the show &quot;$300,000 per episode&quot; or whatever, again based on ratings and thus earnings potential for the show. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As far as ratings go, that's how TV networks know how much to charge for the advertising time. Take the Super Bowl for example. It is notoriously known for having ridiculously high ad prices because they know a shit ton of people are going to be watching. </p>
<p>TV networks don't receive money for having high ratings, per se. There is an independent company (Nielsen) that conducts the ratings and then the Account Executives of the networks use those numbers to sell ads.</p>
<p>I worked in radio advertising for a bit and they operate in much the same way as television.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/craigengler" target="_blank">craigengler</a>
		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers explain how TV networks make money airing shows, but shows are also profitable in and of themselves for the studios that produce them. Here's how it usually works:</p>
<p>The Studio develops an idea for Awesome Show and sells it to a network. In this case we'll say the network is ABC.  ABC doesn't actually buy the show outright though, they essentially rent it for a limited amount of time. This is called licensing. If the show costs The Studio $100 per episode to make, ABC might license it for $30 per episode, for the right to air it first and for the next 5 years. </p>
<p>The Studio is now getting $30 back for every $100 it spends. Not enough to make money, so it goes to other networks in other countries and tries to sell the show to them. Maybe a network in Germany buys it for $10 an episode, a UK network buys it for $15, and a French one buys it for $5.  That's another $30 per episode.  Combined with the $30 from the US, The Studio now gets $60 back for every $100 it spends. Still not great. </p>
<p>To cover that deficit The Studio will shoot the show in a location that gives them a tax credit for bringing shooting the production there (many states and other countries have give shows tax credits because the shows create jobs and spend $ wherever they go). So The Studio shoots Awesome Show in Canada where they can get a 30% tax credit (essentially a cash rebate), which is another $30 they can add to the pot. So now they are making $90 back for every $100 they spend.</p>
<p>Now surprisingly, this may be all the studio is able to get at first. So they end up making the show at a loss and covering the difference themselves. This is called &quot;deficit financing&quot; and it's how most shows are made. If the show runs only one season (or just a few episodes) and is canceled, the studio is just out all that money.</p>
<p>But if the show runs a long time (let's say 7 seasons) the economics really start to favor the studio. That's because they will continue to try and sell the show around the world, and the more successful a show is and the longer it runs, the more other people want it. So in season 3 they are suddenly able to sell the show in Belgium, Denmark, Croatia, Italy, Costa Rico and Portugal, for a total of $25.  Now they are making $115 for every $100 they spend. AND, that money comes in for all three of the original seasons, retroactively covering their deficit and putting them in profit for every episode the've made.</p>
<p>And after ABC's 5 year window expires, the money pot grows even bigger because now The Studio can sell Awesome Show in the U.S. to other markets again. When you see a show that originally aired on NBC run in repeats on TNT, that's the studio selling it again and making serious money.</p>
<p>They'll also sell it to other services like Netflix or Amazon, sell it directly to consumers via iTunes, and if it's popular enough, put it out on DVD. All that is more retroactive income. </p>
<p>AND, The Studio can continue to Awesome Show like this FOREVER. After TNT's second window expires in another 5 years, they'll sell the show to another market, then another and another.  And now when they do the sale, it's for the full run of the show. So it's not just $5 an episode for one season, it's $5 an episode for 7 seasons. All pure profit at this point. And as new markets are created (Hulu, Netflix, iTunes) they'll sell it there too. </p>
<p>You know how you see shows like the original Star Trek still appearing on places like Netflix or your local TV network? That's a 50-year-old series STILL generating money for its owner. And once the original cost is covered, that's pure profit for almost no work. This snowball effect can make shows insanely profitable. A successful show that runs for many season and sells well can generate BILLIONS of dollars over time. Seinfeld is estimated to have generated $3.1 billion in profit for example. And it's still selling today.</p>
<p>I know of one show that was almost canceled every season and barely made it to five seasons (two of them shortened) and still made $100 million in profit.</p>
<p>That's why many companies that own TV networks also own their own studios. They can sell a show to their own network (or surprisingly to other networks), and make money both on the licensing side (through ad revenue) and on the selling side. It's a money machine. </p>
<p>(Note: This works differently for pay services like HBO and Netflix, which often pay huge sums to own their shows outright...I'm mostly talking about broadcast TV and basic cable shows).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two answers already given answer the basics of your question.  TV stations make money selling ads during the shows.  Shows on commercial free TV and other subscription based services make money on the subscriptions.  Of course, there is also money to be made later on when a show is sold/licensed to Netflix or syndication.</p>
<p>But on the subject of ratings, it isn't just a question of how many people are watching.  They also monitor the demographics of those people to know how many men vs. women watch, what age group they are in and more.  All of that together gives them the data to use in selling the ad space during those shows.  These days the Nielsen ratings are just part of how they do this.  They can also track what shows are recorded by DVR's, if the shows are watched and within how many days.  And for online views, they can collect a frightening amount of data, down if and how often you pause the show.  How much of this data they take into account to determine the success or failure of a show will depend on the network.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scabs are very similar in feeling to a foreign body stuck to your skin. Cleaning foreign things off our skin is often a good thing, such as if you have a tick stuck to you, or a dried piece of cake batter on your face. Self-cleaning and grooming is important to stay healthy and sanitary. Thus if you can't immediately feel the difference between a scab and something foreign, your grooming instincts will kick in. If the scab is too large or fresh it may hurt to try to remove, so whether you continue to do so depends on the balance of your own innate desire to self groom, and the pain of removing the scab. Often scabs can be safely removed long before they fall off naturally, as the skin underneath has mostly healed. Just like pulling a piece of tape off your skin may be slightly painful, it certainly won't do you harm in the long run. Thus the grooming instinct very often wins out.</p>
<p>Also, an additional tidbit that might motivate the grooming instinct for scab-picking is cosmetic reasons. Looking healthy/good/not-covered-in-scabs is important for a lot of people. Picking off a dark scab can often look better than the slight redness underneath (depending on personal complexion and how healed the wound is).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I think it's a way for a dog to identify who is who as well as understand chemical signatures of a person to judge your health, current mood etc.</p>
<p>It's also something they do the same way human babies constantly hold onto things and grab things, it's part of them exploring. Dogs don't have hands so they use their mouths, nose, ears and tongue to explore, identify and classify. It is important to teach a dog to not bite but remember as puppies they don't bite down hard deliberately but to grip you like a baby does with his hands so don't get too angry when they do it, just remember to give them their shots before you let their teeth near you.</p>
<p>A dog could remember a specific person by a particular characteristic smell, taste, voice and touch. Unlike us which we use our eyes to distinguish who is who and remembering names and personalities. </p>
<p>Heck dogs could even remember the sound of the way your feet hit the ground and know exactly who that is as well as the type of sound you make when you close your car door. This is what people confuse with the dog's sixth sense, dogs use every sense in very unique ways that it surprises people that dogs can tell exactly who is coming from the parking lot to home without even having to see far off in the distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to asking the question: Why do people cry? Dogs will lick faces for a variety of reasons just like a humans will cry for a bunch of different reasons. Puppies specifically are likely trying to learn about you and the world around them. Human babies also do this, if you think about the first house you lived in and the floor there I bet you can remember how it tasted. Puppies also lick the faces of their mothers to trigger a regurgitation reflex so it is possible they are trying to communicate that they are hungry.</p>
<p>Dogs in general will also lick a humans face for a variety of reasons. The salt on humans skins is often enjoyable to dogs and they lick it for this reason, they could be curious about your feelings as their noses and mouths are sensitive enough to sense chemical differences in a stressed human or a happy human. It could be that they are submitting to you, or it could be that their owner when they were a puppy indicated that they liked getting licked and so the dog continued to do so as a learned behavior.</p>
<p>here is a link explaining other reasons as to why they lick:<a href="http://pets.thenest.com/dogs-lick-humans-faces-5892.html" target="_blank">http://pets.thenest.com/dogs-lick-humans-faces-5892.html</a></p>
<p>TL;DR:
Dogs lick for lots of reasons, puppies mostly out of indicating hunger and exploring the world around them like all babies do. In short: because they're good dogs, Brent.</p>
<p>Edit 1: Was not expecting the ton of response from the floor licking thing. Yes I do remember what the floor in the first house I lived in tasted like. It was a carpet though I have almost no recollection of the house in general. Many people (though not all) will be able to remember this or something similar because it is one of the first memories that forms a negative experience and tell the brain 'Yeah. No. Don't ever do that again.' So it forms a very strong permanent memory. If you don't remember either you didn't care what the floor tasted like so that negative reaction isn't there, you have forgotten because brains are weird and awesome and complicated, or your parents kept you from doing it in some fashion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Licking the face (self) is a sign of stress -- be that eustress (oh boy, yay!) or distress (oh boy, oh no!). </p>
<p>Licking is often an appeasement gesture.  Appeasement is not submission in the out-dated 1970s idea of wolves. Appeasement is more like &quot;Here I am, no threat, you can stop doing the thing I don't like.&quot;   A dog may lick you if he is nervous about something or someone, including you. It's a deescalation social gesture, much like how humans raise hands out in a in front wide &quot;hey, it's okay, no worries&quot;.  We do this subconsciously to indicate our hands have no weapons, they are not in a position to throw a punch.  Dogs also turn heads away, yawn, shake their heads, or scratch to help relieve stress. </p>
<p>Licking can, of course, be due to taste such as lotions and sweat.  Many dogs like to lick humans fresh out of the shower and seem attracted to the body wash remnants. Do not allow a dog to lick lotion, especially medicated lotion or sun lotion, off your hands or face.</p>
<p>Like humans, dogs can develop OCD behaviors. Some classic dog OCD behaviors include a frantic attempt to 'catch' light that never ends, escalating to more and more diffuse light sources, and licking /gnawing at an existing wound, creating a point of infection that does not heal.   It's important to interrupt and redirect any start of OCD type behavior and to consult a behaviorist as soon as possible if a dog can not be easily distracted from tail chasing, light chasing, or licking. The behavior can become consuming without intervention. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sometimes it's impossible to tell. But most times it can be sleuthed out by examining the site specifics such as the fuel type, accessibility, any evidence or signs left behind. The indices of the day are an important tool, they help us understand the likelihood of ignition occurring. </p>
<p>If an arsonist uses an incendiary device (time delayed ignition thingy) then there's going to be obvious evidence of this when personnel zero in on the origin site of the fire. At the origin, the fire is low intensity and doesn't burn hot enough to remove evidence like that. As the fire travels with the wind, it gains intensity and burns increasingly heavier fuels. But at the outset it's only really going to burn fine, flashy fuels. </p>
<p>If the fire originates in the ditch of a quad trail, it's typically chalked up as having been started by an exhaust clinger from a quad or side-by-side. I've seen cases of this where the operators have stuck around to own up to it and offer statements, as well as cases where they've taken off. Hell, I've arrived on a fire where a Polaris side-by-side had apparently over heated and was fully involved by the time we got there. </p>
<p>If the origin of the fire is downwind of a flare stack, typically there will be follow up with the operators at that work site if they weren't already involved. Occasionally, flare stacks will &quot;burp&quot; up some flaming bitumen bits and that'll cause a fire with the right indices. Or their flare will go out and they'll reignite it by shooting a flare pen/gun etc at it. This is illegal for obvious reasons. I've had to work on such a fire. Idiotic. </p>
<p>When it's lightning caused it's fairly easy to figure out. There's typically a blown up/burnt /scarred tree at the origin site. Our province does a pretty good job keeping track of lightning activity and we know based on lightning frequency and indices how likely we are to see smoke puff up due to a lightning hold over. </p>
<p>Sometimes fires are due to abandoned campfires and these are beyond obvious to identify. </p>
<p>Burn piles left unattended (think farms, industrial lots such as forestry slash and such) can occasionally creep off and lead to wildfire. These are easy to tell. </p>
<p>When a downed powerline is the cause, again, it speaks for itself. </p>
<p>For the human caused fires, often there are witnesses. In these cases it helps a lot to remove any guess work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some interesting answers here, but look at the common denominator: you have to know <em>where</em> it started.</p>
<p>If you have a witness, then you pretty much go from what they say started it.</p>
<p>From there, it's basically a guessing game. If they test something in the area and it comes up positive for whatever flammable chemical, then you blame it on that chemical, and it's arson if the chemical wasn't supposed to be there. If there is a campfire site in the area, then it's blamed on a campfire. If there are 4-wheeler trails in the area, you blame it on 4-wheelers. If there's a smoke stack upwind, then you blame it on that. Lightning strikes in the area and a blown tree are probably one of the more scientific findings.</p>
<p>Fire investigation is not nearly as sound of a science as it's been made out to be. Texas executed someone recently based on this false science, which begs the question of just how many investigations these fire investigators/wannabe detectives have broken. Imagine how there have been entire conventions and training programs that are basically just Joe Blow fire-fighters teaching their peers their uninformed hunches, labeled as hard fact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scratch-and-sniff stickers are one of those novelty technologies that sound like such a good idea... But they never really caught on except in children's books and the occasional perfume strip in a magazine. Why shouldn't nasal information be just as important audio and visual information? Perhaps because no one has figured out how to encode language in smells.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if you have kids, you probably have a scratch-and-sniff book around the house. And even if the book is 20 years old, it still works! The reason the stickers last so long is because of the microencapsulation technology used to create them. The basic idea behind scratch-and-sniff is to take the aroma-generating chemical and encapsulate it in gelatin or plastic spheres that are incredibly small -- on the order of a few microns in diameter. When you scratch the sticker, you rupture some of these spheres and release the smell. The smell is essentially held in millions of tiny bottles, and you break a few of the bottles every time you scratch the sticker. The tiny bottles preserve the fragrance for years.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll copy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1lncep/why_are_tornados_predominantly_a_north_american/cc14g8x" target="_blank">one of my old answers</a>. It's not exactly for five year olds, but I hope it's easy enough for the layman:</p>
<p>There are many factors which go into making a large part of the US the perfect tornado breeding ground, but the most important are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Access to heat and humidity for a large portion of the country.</strong> A major ingredient needed for tornadoes is heat and humidity near the earth's surface, as this allows for high <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_available_potential_energy" target="_blank">Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)</a>, or atmospheric energy which can be converted into rapid rising motion found in strong thunderstorms. Because the eastern half of the US is north of the very warm Gulf of Mexico, and the central portion of the US is flat with very few terrain features, heat and moisture can easily stream north and cover a large portion of the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To expand on the above point, <strong>large areas devoid of major terrain</strong>. Tornadoes, while powerful, are quite sensitive to terrain variations. Tornadoes can occasionally form in mountainous areas, but it is much easier to form tornadoes in a flat region, such as that found in much of the central and southeastern United States, than it is in a mountainous region. Trees, however, have little or nothing to do with the prevalence of tornadoes: the southeastern US is heavily forested yet still sees <a href="http://www.ustornadoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/violent-tornadoes-f4-ef4-and-f5-ef5-in-the-united-states.gif" target="_blank">a great deal of violent tornadoes</a>. A few people on my original post fairly criticized my point that tornadoes need a flat area to form. This may not be entirely true: the vast, flat plains of the central US do allow for warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to easily flow northward, which is a major factor in making favorable conditions for tornadoes over a large area, but while <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/WAF957.1" target="_blank">it's generally accepted that rough terrain may impede tornado formation</a>, it's certainly not proven, and strong tornadoes can and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teton%E2%80%93Yellowstone_tornado" target="_blank">have occurred</a> in mountainous areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Location in the mid-latitudes, 30-50 degrees from the equator</strong>. This is important because further north tends to be too cold (which inhibits CAPE), while further south lacks access to the <a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/cyc/upa/jet.rxml" target="_blank">jet stream</a>, which provides upper-level winds that are required to maintain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell" target="_blank">supercell thunderstorms</a>, which spawn almost all significant tornadoes.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>A large mountain range and high desert in the west</strong>. This reason is quite complicated but arguably the most important. The high terrain allows for the formation of a warm, dry layer in the mid-levels of the atmosphere known as an <a href="http://bangladeshtornadoes.org/EML/emlpage.html" target="_blank">Elevated Mixed Layer (EML)</a>, which is then transported eastward over the rest of the country. This EML works to promote tornadoes in three ways. First, the warm layer acts like a &quot;lid&quot; on the atmosphere, preventing thunderstorms from forming right away and allowing the sun to warm the surface for longer during the day. Second, once the storms do begin to form, only the strongest updrafts will make it through the layer, preventing weaker storms from using up the available instability. Third, once the strong storms do form, the rain evaporates in the hot, dry layer, which causes it to cool and increases the surface-based instability even more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: as for why they are relatively rare in the rest of the world, most other areas lack one or more of the above ingredients, and those areas that do have all the same ingredients are much smaller. For example, the one tornado hotspot that probably rivals the central US in severity is Bangladesh and far eastern India, but this area is only about the size of Iowa, so tornado outbreaks tend to be smaller and less common..</p>
<p>I'm more than willing to provide clarification or answer follow-up questions.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Desserts are hot, tundra's are cold, mountains are rough, valleys have odd wind currents.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tornadoes don't just form on a whim, there are certain conditions that need to be present in order for one to occur. The most deadly tornadoes spawn from supercell thunderstorms, which are rotating thunderstorms with a well defined radar circulation, called a mesocyclone. Some areas are more prone to tornadoes because the conditions are conducive to the storms that produce them. In Tornado Alley, for example, the plains get very hot, creating updrafts. When unstable hot air near the ground rises in these updrafts.These collide with the cold, polar air up in the clouds, generating convective precipitation along the collision boundaries. In addition, air in the mid-latitudes often flows at different speeds and directions at varying levels of the troposphere, which causes rotation within the storm cell. So, simply because the large number of convective storms and the favorable conditions, the odds are increased that some of these storms will produce tornadoes. A good percentage do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that a lot of these other posts don't mention is that, in the 1980s, Tony Hawk's father, Frank Hawk, founded the National Skateboarding Association which provided a series of contests to promote skating every year. And Tony Hawk was one of most dominant contest pros of all time. I can recall Transworld repeatedly referring to him as 'The Michael Jordan of Skateboarding.'</p>
<p>Also, he was on the most popular skate team throughout the 80s, Powell-Peralta, that invented the concept of a skate video. And Hawk's parts were legendary. Bones Brigade Video Show and Animal Chin both helped get Tony Hawk's skating into people's living rooms early on. And long before he landed the first 900, he landed the first 720--a trick that only a handful of skaters could land, much less in competition. </p>
<p>Then he founded Birdhouse, one of the most popular skate brands of the 90s and made himself a household name all over again by winning the X-Games broadcast into people's homes year after year. People love watching winners, even if the sport isn't usually popular. How many cyclists could your average American name when Lance Armstrong was winning the Tour de France every year? Or how many swimmers other than Phelps and Lochte? </p>
<p>And so finally, with his career of contest wins on some of the most popular teams of multiple eras, with tricks nobody else could match, and with a fairly clean public image as a skateboarding goodwill ambassador (in no small part to Frank Hawk's involvement,) Hawk was approached by Activision about a series of skateboarding video games with his name on it. Those games reached demographics that would never touch a skateboard in real life and Hawk's name was front and center. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

My best friend Sean and I were HUGE Tony Hawk fans, and skateboarding was really taking off at that time. There was a skate shop 2 blocks away from our houses, and we hung out there a lot during the summer. No internet back then obviously, so we would just loiter in the shop for hours watching the newest skate videos and reading Thrasher Magazine. There was a flier up on the wall for a show to be held at the fairgrounds, and Tony Hawk and Gator Rogowski were going to be skating. I remember two things from that show, one was the first time a saw a t-shirt gun, and second was watching Tony Hawk ollie over a Porsche. Here we are 29 years later and Tony is still the most popular skater in the world. Gator is in prison for rape and murder. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In 1999 when <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> came out, video games hadn't yet exploded to the level they are today so each year produced just a handful of major hit titles. It was hard <em>not</em> to know which ones were the huge hits even if you didn't own a console. <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em> was one of those games that everyone who played games, even those who didn't skateboard themselves, seemed to be playing. </p>
<p>Added to the fact that for 12 straight years he was the National Skateboard Association world champion, plus during the early days of the X Games he was major of star. It was at the 1999 X Games that he performed what is still believed to be the very first 900 and the first <em>Pro Skater</em> video game came out that same year. Plus, he is very media friendly (ie, cleancut) back in an age when almost any drug use even weed made media outlets &amp; advertisers nervous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
