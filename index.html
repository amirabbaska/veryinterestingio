		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume it's the same for soap, but as a hairdresser I can say that yeah, shampoos and conditioners for different things actually are different, especially if it's a professional product -cheaper products may contain lower quality ingredients and are often much harsher but should still do the job of cleaning your hair.</p>
<p>To keep it simple a colour protecting shampoo will be sulfate free, a shampoo for fine hair may be silicone free while one for coarser hair may not be, shampoo for curly hair may be designed so that it won't lather as much, and one for damaged hair will contain more protein than a shampoo that isn't for damaged hair.</p>
<p>Designing a &quot;one size fits all&quot; product is very difficult since ingredients will contradict each other and using something good for one hair type could be terrible for another. For example, for damaged hair to really get the benefits of a shampoo there would have to be extra protein, and extra protein isn't good for healthy hair and can actually make it brittle since it's too much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked for an industrial soap making company, and yes, each of our soaps were designed to lift a specific range of grimes from specific surfaces. There are surfactants which help wet a surface so the soap molecules can cosy up to the grime, chelates which help the molecules disperse the grime into solution, the soap molecules which are double ended. One end sticks to a bit of some kind of dirt, the other end sticks to water. Flush and rip dat dirt outta there.
But there are many other things that affect the performance of a detergent like moderating bits, protectors and conditioners for the clean surface, perfumes and colors.</p>
<p>Heat improves activity in most chemistry so a temperature range for best results is according to the formulation.</p>
<p>Complex stuff. Your mileage may vary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think soaps all use the same detergents, just varying amounts of it. The cheap soaps have mostly fragrance &amp; sulfates, while better soaps contain less sulfates (or none at all, like lye soaps) and more moisturizers. I buy most of my soaps locally, as they are cheap and I have very sensitive skin. You can make your own soap from a kit at Michael's and make your own scent. Better quality soaps are completely worth it and they aren't ridiculously more expensive for a better soap.
Shampoo is a completely different story and doing your research is tedious. Cheap brands are mostly water &amp; bubbles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The major contributing factor is your circadian rhythm. This rhythm is basically your natural biological clock. However it does not run exactly on a 24 hr cycle, there are slight deviations naturally and other factors can contribute to altering your biological clock. </p>
<p>The next factor to take into account is which stage of the sleep cycle you are waking up from. There are typically 5 stages of sleep, stage 1/2 are &quot;active&quot; sleep cycles, your brain activity is still highly active and almost indistinguishable from a wake person. In stage 1/2, you are also more likely to respond to stimuli, such as someone calling your name. Stage 3 is regarded as &quot;inactive&quot; sleep cycle, this is the stage where your brain activity drastically drops, preparing your brain and body to enter stage 4. In stage 3, a person is much harder to wake up and waking from this stage leaves a person exhausted and generally disorientated. Stage 4 sleep is where actual rest and rejuvenation occurs. In this stage, your brain activity is picking up slightly but still in a mild manner, not too much to be called wakefullness, but enough to signal repairs in the body. Lastly is REM stage, this is where your brain is now increasing activity and causing dreams. After REM, the cycle repeats back from stage 1. </p>
<p>Basically as you sleep, you go through this 1-4+rem cycle over and over, with each cycle lasting about 90 mins. Depending on what your body needs, stage1/2 will shorten as you go through the sleep cycles and lengthen stage 4 for rest and recovery or REM sleep. If you wake from REM, you will feel refreshed and ready, that is why most people dont remember dreams or recall a dream suddenly disrupted by waking up. If you wake up during stage 3/4, you will feel tired and exhausted, your brain was trying to turn down the power after all, and signal the body to recover from things like exhaustion or injuries. </p>
<p>So thats it, a bit long for ELI5, but its a complicated question that takes many things into account, as is common when talking about neurological issues</p>
<p>Edit: forgot to talk about sleep deficit and how that also contributes alot, but im on mobile and cant continue forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is because: about an hour before we wake up, our bodies prepare us for the day by releasing certain brain chemicals, namely cortisol. One reason why it is important to get up around the same time everyday is because of this chemical timing. Our bodies become habituated to this cycle, this circadian rhythm, and if we all of a sudden shift away from that, we feel off.
Kind of explains jetlag and the off week a lot of us have after changing our clocks for daylight savings. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a long time, bluetooth audio streaming was not good enough. It would use massive amounts of power consumption in relativity to the range of operation - and would be interfered by lots of things. It wasn't until bluetooth 3 and 4 that it really got better, and added functionality for multiple device connection (ie, connecting your phone via bluetooth to the headset and at the same time your computer or another phone, or even a second pair of headphones)</p>
<p>The audio quality still isn't all there, in my opinion. At a rate of 25MB/s, one would think that it would be able to stream at lossless audio quality - but almost every bluetooth audio device i've seen implements some form of audio dithering (reducing the bitrate to make it smaller and easier on the network) before sending it out via bluetooth wireless protocol.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marble takes ages of compaction geologic formation. Basically, rock is preasurized under the earth under such conditions that it changes. The act of it compacting makes it denser, tougher, overall more resistant to damage and weathering. Rocks and minerals react under different temperatures. Typically you can note more durable minerals will take higher temperatures to melt down. Some minerals are no longer deposited from volcanoes because the Earth just doesn't run hot enough to melt them and let them enter a lava flow and be taken to the surface. Quartz is an example of an unstable mineral. If I remember right it melts at about 600 degrees Fahrenheit. The more unstable a mineral or rock is the easier it breaks down. So back to marble. It has undergone intense pressurization and heat to form. And this is more stable. This means it will not break easily if at all if you slam a metal scoop on it many times. Marble also retains cold temperatures well and heats up slowly, so you can keep cold things colder, easier on it than on say an aluminum tray. Durable, resistant to damage, holds cold temperatures well, looks pretty, and can't very easily chip away into your ice cream. Nobody wants marble flakes mix-ins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Because it is a little bit higher than the recommended dose, and certainly more than added fluoride content in city water supplies, our local health unit has recommended that children in our community do not use toothpaste with fluoride, to prevent fluorosis. It is likely that fluoride free toothpaste is intended for communities like ours.</p>

<p>Some people have an intolerance to fluoride that can present itself in mouth ulcers. Not uncommon, it seems to run in my family and I'm aware of a couple of friends that have the same issues. Not a big deal, doesn't cause any major harm, just uncomfortable. </p>
<p>Because some people need it, the product pops up in the market. People see it and either assume it has health benefits or has read something somewhere that says it's bad for you. So the market for it increases and major brands pick it up to increase sales. </p>
<p>Simple as that really. If you can use fluoride toothpaste then you probably should. I hear it's better for you. But if you have frequent mouth ulcers then try brushing with fluoride-free toothpaste and see if it makes a difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The social reason: Some people think the government makes us consume fluoride in toothpaste and water to make the general population easier to manipulate and control. The argument behind this idea varies but what I've seen most is that Hitler added fluoride to German water right before the war supposedly to control the population. Therefore fluoride bad because Hitler's used it. </p>

		<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sir_Aleister" target="_blank">Sir_Aleister</a>
		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons I see. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The same station are used for long-distance/international train and regional/suburban train.  You do not want to deal with security checkpoints in your daily commute. You could imagine putting checkpoints only on long-distance train, but then why not the regional/suburban trains ? </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A train can in a few minutes go to a <em>safe</em> position. Simply hit the breaks, usually the driving system implies a <em>dead man switch</em> and if the driver stop to hold it train will automatically send alarm to the regulation and stop.   Even high-speed-trains pass trough backup station where they can stop if anything goes wrong (it's always easier to have an ambulance and the police coming to a station than having them walking 500m trough a muddy field. )</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don't have to deal with the difference of pressure, a bomb exploding in a train will cause serious damages an dozen of deads for sure but it won't fully destroy the train and most of the passenger will leave the train on their feet. The same in a plane and even a small blast will destroy the plane due to the difference of pressure (as punching a balloon with a niddle) killing everybody on-board. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, in the commercial battle rail vs air. The fact that you can arrive at the station 5 minutes before your train, be on the platform 2 minutes later and catch your train on time is a serious asset that train companies will try to keep. </p>
</li>
<li>(At least in Europe, I saw this in France/Germany/Belgium). For international train it's not that uncommon to see the border police/custom patrolling the train, checking passengers ids and having their dog smelling the bags (especially in the train from Asterdam to Paris). In a train with 500 persons on board it's easy to fit 2 policemen and their dog inside. They don't even need a seat. </li>
</ul>
<p>That said, after the failed attack in a Train between Brussels and Paris, I started to see metal detector and luggage-scanner for train too.  I already told reddit the day I thought they where getting crazy on terrorism security until I saw the head of the European and his bodygards leaving the same train. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the big reasons is hijacking. If you hijack a plane you can go anywhere in the world you want as long as you have enough fuel onboard. With a train you can not choose your destinations. You go where the rails go. Planes are also really fast compared to trains.</p>
<p>One other reason to hijack a plane is to use it as ammunition. A train obviously can not be used in such way. You can go at full speed and try to derail the train but that's it. You can't drive it into certain building. But you can fly a plane everywhere or AT anything.</p>
<p>Other thing to remember is that train is much harder to hijack and control. A train can be really really long and have many passenger wagons. All it takes is one person to pull the emergency brake and the train stops. After that the doors open and everybody can run off. At most you are looking at a hostage situation in the middle of the forest. Pretty pointless hijacking unless hostage situation is the exact thing you want. For political reasons this could be an option.</p>
<p>So trains are simply far less useful for any kind of reason whereas planes are excellent for the exact same reasons. A train at most has to deal with bomb threats which in reality is not really good option for the bomber. If you want to inflict mass damages train is not good target. As such it is hard to justify spending tons of money on train security when there is no point even for anyone to make any kind of attack using a train as a target or tool for causing damage. </p>
<p>Planes also are very expensive and even if you don't lose the plane the downtime is super expensive if a hostage situation occurs for example. If you lose the plane and the passengers then it is a massive pr issue for you as a corporation. If a bomb attack happens in train you don't lose the whole train. Not only is the train and the wagons really robust but any kind of damage is limited only to the wagon where the bomb went off and the train wagons that derailed. Train tracks themselves can be fixed relatively quickly unless we are talking about really really big bombs.</p>
<p>tl:dr. Trains are just really poor targets. Planes on the other hand is the best kind of target you can imagine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you stall an engine by overloading it you stop the rotation of the crank, stopping the pistons from moving up and down and stopping the sequence of events that leads to more combustion cycles. Even in modern e.f.i. Engines there is sensors tell the injectors when to fire.

They will try to pull right to the very last, and as the RPM drops the governor opens up, injecting the maximum amount of fuel. However, when even a full charge of diesel doesn't develop enough power to accelerate the load, the motor starts slowing down.</p>
<p>As long as the crank keeps turning fast enough to compress and ignite the diesel, it will fire and keep turning over. If we are talking about an old air breathing diesel, this can be a very low speed. Black smoke will puff from the exhaust in distinct clouds as each cylinder fires, with a &quot;poof poof poof&quot; sound reminiscent of an old steam train. As the motor slows, it falls further out of the powerband and develops less and less torque.</p>
<p>At a certain point, the motor is going too slow, and the heat of compression is not enough to ignite the diesel anymore. This is when it comes to a sudden stop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an overloaded engine, the explosion still occur normally. The explosion cause the mixture to heat up, which cause an increase in pressure. This force the piston down. When the engine is overloaded, that pressure just can't push enought on the piston. Then the gas start to cool and the pressure drop, thru press less against the piston. All that energy that would have been used to push on the piston had nowhere to go, part of it will go in the cylinder walls, which will be cooled by the cooling system, air on small engine, liquid on bigger ones. This excess of heat can also cause the engine to overheat. The extra pressure also cause lots of stress on the engine.</p>
<p>Normally the explosion take time to spread inside the mixture, which spread the power stroke over a wider motion range of the piston, helping to reduce the force applied, while giving out more of the usable energy. By overloading the engine, the power stroke ends up in a more limited portion of the stroke and you also lose efficiency, thru less power out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Carbon can serve as the &quot;backbone&quot; for constructing an effectively infinite variety of complex chemically active molecules. And because of that variety it presents the possibility for a nearly infinite variety of carbon based molecules with different chemical properties.</p>
<p>To take some examples from biology: you can have sugars which are basically cyclo-esters (a carbon chain that is connected back to itself but with an oxygen atom in the chain) with hydroxyl groups attached to every carbon atom in the chain (a sort of &quot;super&quot; alcohol). Sugars are polar molecules, they dissolve easily in water. They're remarkably good for storing energy because you can basically just split it in half into two pyruvate molecules and get free energy. But if you link a bunch of sugars together you can produce cellulose, which has very different properties from sugar. If you modify the sugars slightly by adding an amide group and form those into a polymer you can create chitin (the material of the exoskeletons of crustaceans, insects, etc.) which has very different properties compared to both glucose and wood, though it is closely chemically related.</p>
<p>Alkanes are long chains of carbon atoms each linked to two other carbon atoms and (usually) two hydrogen atoms. Fats are made out of long alkane chains bonded to a carboxyllic acid group and then sometimes attached to something else (like glycerin or a phosphate group in the case of phospholipids). An ordinary fat is extremely non-polar, so it doesn't dissolve in water, phospholipids have a polar end and a non-polar tail so they form into bilayers serving as cell membranes, for example. Proteins are made out of strings of carbon based molecules that start out as amino-acids (a carboxyl group with an amine group on the next carbon over) which enables the formation of amide bonds. The backbone of a protein's peptide chain is a series of [NH] [CH-R] [CO] [NH] [CH-R] [CO] (and so on), with different R groups corresponding to different amino-acids. Without the N or O atoms the peptide chain wouldn't be feasible, but without carbon it would not work at all, and the R groups are also carbon based. That basic structure makes it possible to create a huge array of micro-polymers (proteins) that can have an enormous array of different physical and chemical properties ranging from something as &quot;simple&quot; as a structural protein of hair to something as complex as a component of an electron transport chain designed to serve as a component in the machinery of photosynthesis.</p>
<p>In short, the variety of molecules that can be created with carbon based chemistry and the enormous span of different properties those molecules can have is what makes that chemistry so deep and interesting. It's particularly suited to use in the field of nanoscopic molecular machinery, which serves as the foundation for all life as we know it, but even that is only a fraction of what's possible with organic chemistry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of stuff!</p>
<p>Most people mentioned the 4 bonds, and at least one mentioned that its the smallest element that can make 4. But consider that it's also the smallest element to make more than 2 bonds, and its also the smallest element to make more than 1 covalent bond.</p>
<p>Why is &quot;multiple bonds&quot; an important concept? </p>
<p>Because we exist and move about in 3 geometric dimensions! Imagine you have one atom of Hydrogen, what relative space does it occupy? A point. Now that Hydrogen covalently bonds to satisfy its outer shell requirements and makes a Hydrogen molecule. What relative space does it occupy? A line. Oxygen will bond with two hydrogens, the angle provided by these bonds will allow for a plane (2 dimensions). But, A single molecule containing Carbon can make enough bonds to occupy all three dimensions in space.</p>
<p>Why is being the smallest element important?</p>
<p>Because everything that is; has resulted from an initial state of free floating protons, electrons, and neutrons (shortly after the big bang). </p>
<p>The easiest element and Isotope to synthesize is Hydrogen: A free proton needs to capture a free electron to create an electron shell orbital. This is highly likely due to the attractive force of different charges in electromagnetism. After that the next easiest isotope to create is deuterium. A Hydrogen nucleus (proton) absorbs a neutron (which is not affected by electromagnetism). After that its Tritium: Deuterium absorbs a Neutron. </p>
<p>Then the next most likely thing to happen is that Tritium absorbs another neutron. When that happens, one of the neutrons changes its &quot;spin&quot; and becomes a Proton. A Beta particle is emitted (with negative charge) and a charged helium atom is produced (This method of Helium synthesis is far more likely to happen than a Proton nucleus absorbing another proton due to electromagnetism repulsion factors). The charged helium will then rapidly acquire another electron to form a neutral Helium atom.</p>
<p>This method of synthesis will continue on down the line, making the smaller elements much more likely to be synthesized than their larger counterparts. That means..... There is way more Carbon than say Silicon which makes it more LIKELY to be used in a system.</p>
<p>Carbon also has an equal number of &quot;extra&quot; electrons from the next lower electron shell (S1) as it does &quot;missing&quot; electrons from its next higher full electron shell (S2, P2). This means that not only is it incredibly electroneutral, but it can be altered equally to the left and right by bonding it with a more electronegative (which will steal electron density) or electropositive (which will donate electron density) functional group.</p>
<p>This means carbons can function as neutral, partially positive, AND partially negative. That means it can make LOTS of different bonds with lots of different types of elements and functional groups. It ALSO means that it can bond well to itself while still leaving room for other bonds to be made. For instance an N2 gas bond will have a triple bond, but won't readily bond again (or react which is why it is considered largely inert). That makes it not so great in creating longer chains. O2 gas, and F2 gas are much the same in this respect. But carbon will use it's partially positive nature to form a third or 4th bond with a partially negative atom (like a nitrogen, oxygen, or hydrogen).</p>
<p>Those Carbon-Nitrogen, Carbon-Oxygen, and Carbon-Hydrogen Bonds are literally what make nitrogenous bases, monosaccharides, and amino acids possible. Further, they facilitate those monomer units to polymerize into more &quot;living units&quot; (DNA, Proteins, Polysaccharides, ect.).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon is the smallest element that makes four bonds. </p>
<p>Larger elements hold onto their electrons less because of their size, and this makes them more metallic. Once you start acting metally you  get kinda pigeonholed into making quite metal-like bonds which are far less vared and far less able to be fine tuned and specialised than covalent bonding networks like non-metals can do. If you can covalently bond you can form a variety of patterns in the bonding network that make different substances - different types of lipids, inorganic crap, sugars and stuff if you throw oxygen in... you know. Variety. Different properties.</p>
<p>But metallic bonding is so blurry and non-speciifc you lose that ability to differentiate materials a bit. They're all pretty samey the more metallic you get. So carbon being the least metallic and most common is the best one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Carbon, in its native state, has six electrons that are contained in 2 orbital types: s and p. The s orbital is closest to the nucleus and has two electrons that the atom really likes to hold on to. The p orbital, or more specifically orbitals, can exist in three different orientations along perpendicular axis. The electrons in these orbitals aren't held as tightly as those in the s orbital and are able to more freely bond with other atoms that have available electrons in the correct orbital orientation. It is also the p orbitals that are responsible for double and triple bonds in alkenes and alkynes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Warfarin and other drugs are metabolized (broken down) into active or inactive compounds by enzymes in your liver. Grapefruit and other foods contain substances that can inhibit the activity of these enzymes, stopping the metabolism of these drugs. It can either lead to dangerously high levels of the drugs remaining in your system, or in the case of drugs that need to be broken down before they're active, dangerously low levels as the pro-drug you've taken isn't getting metabolized properly.
Also, it can result in other enzymes acting on drugs that aren't usually active or sufficiently active, resulting in the wrong kind of metabolite forming, which can be harmful as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical Student.   </p>
<p>Many drugs are metabolized by a certain enzyme called CYP P450 (or other enzymes that are also within the CYP family). Warfarin is one of these drugs. CYP P450 is basically what is breaking down warfarin in your body.  </p>
<p>So, anything that changes how CYP P450 does its job of breaking down warfarin will impact how warfarin works. Different drugs and other things (grapefruit juice, St. John's wort) either make CYP work better or inhibit CYP.   </p>
<p>If CYP is made to work better, for instance by St John's wort (commonly used for over the counter mild depression), then CYP will be breaking down warfarin super fast. The warfarin can be broken down so fast that it does not reach the level needed to actually thin the persons blood. To say again, by inducing CYP to breakdown warfarin better, warfarin cannot reach therapeutic levels.   </p>
<p>Another example is the CYP inhibitor cimetidine, which is commonly found in over the counter stomach medication (it's an antacid). Cimetidine is a CYP inhibitor, meaning CYP is not breaking down warfarin as well as usually. So, since warfarin is not being broken down, it causes warfarin to reach possibly toxic levels. Patients are at increased risk of bleeding.   </p>
<p>Overall, warfarin is not that great of drug, partially because it is dependent on CYP for breakdown and for a variety of other reasons. It also requires constant monitoring because it can be difficult to maintain within therapeutic range. Look up the list of things warfarin interacts with, and you'll be surprised that it's the most commonly prescribed drug thinner in the U.S.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grapefruits contain furanocoumarins, which mess with a particular enzyme that decomposes a lot of drugs.  On the one hand, that means if you eat a grapefruit, the drug can stick around in your system, and next time you take a pill you've actually got a double dose.  On the other hand, some drugs are actually precursors of the active chemical, so no enzyme = no active drug.</p>
<p>The cranberry interaction is contested, and I'm not aware of any study that's shown how it actually interferes with drugs.</p>
<p>And of course, vitamin K is the antidote to Warfarin, so you'd want to keep your dietary levels of that steady.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question has been answered pretty well, but I thought I'd chime in... I've been on warfarin for almost 5 years. I have a genetic clotting disorder; about 1/3 of my extended family has the same thing. Which is all awful!</p>
<p>But I think others in the thread have made warfarin sound worse than it is. I barely even think about it anymore. Every day I have the same amount of vitamin K by measuring out some broccoli on a food scale. This is second nature to me now and takes no extra time. (It's also helpful for counting calories w/ other foods.) I know (roughly) the translation of that amount of broccoli to other common vitamin K greens like lettuce, and I know the foods to completely avoid (kale is ridiculously high in K).</p>
<p>Blood draws are also not an issue. I have a home testing machine that involves just pricking your finger. You barely feel it and you get the results near-instantaneously. My levels have been A-OK for the last 5 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Occasionally they may bleed which leaves an open communication between the blood stream and the colon but they don't often get infected. Why? Think of it as a small weak fish (bacteria) trying to swim upstream against a fast current.  It doesn't get anywhere right? That's the pressure behind the vein. Now imagine the same stream with a bunch predator fish swimming around eating the small fish.  This is the immune system in and around the rectum.  So we have a two protection systems against infection.  </p>
<p>The most common reason hemorrhoids become infected is when the blood supply to the hemorrhoid ceases (strangulated or thrombosed). So now there is a dam, river comes to a standstill and the predator fish can't get in so the little fish (bacteria) can go wherever he likes including right into the now dead tissue of the hemorrhoid and wreak havoc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Imagine that there is an old-fashioned war, on a battlefield, with troops rushing towards each other and going at it with hammer, tongs, tooth &amp; claw.
The two sides would be the bacteria that are trying to multiply fast enough to bring troops to the front line, and their opponents are your neutrophil leucocytes, or white blood cells, that are getting to the front from the war factory of your bone marrow and making an amphibious landing via your bloodstream.
Both sides are dying in droves. Their dead bodies are what makes up pus, which is actually often sterile, oddly enough.
In the rectum/anus, the bacteria are fighting from a very small beachhead, uphill, and are vastly outnumbered. It's like the body has a tsunami of troops.
While rectal abscesses and infections do occur, mostly it is because there is a compromise in the ability of the body to deliver troops to the front line, or the dead bodies accumulate in a pocket, like and abscess, so you can't clear the dead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
