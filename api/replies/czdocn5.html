			<p>Thanks, I'm not sure if people understand it but I can explain it in better detil if they want.</p>		</li>

			<p>It is kind of a difficult concept to explain and if I had a good way to explain it, I'd go for it.  Maybe provide an example like the melting rates of a solid chunk of ice vs crushed ice.</p>		</li>

			<p>The way I usually do it is this: <br><br>If I have a 1x1x1cm cube I have a surface area of 6cm² and a volume of 1cm³... Thus a SA/V ratio of 6.<br><br>If I double that cubes dimensions the ratio drops:<br><br> A 2x2x2 cm cube has a SA of 24cm² (2x2x6sides) and a volume of 8cm³ (2x2x2) SA/V ratio of 3.<br><br>This ratio drops the bigger you get. Meaning that less (relatively speaking) of a larger animal's body is exposed to the cold than a smaller one.<br><br> Penguins utilize this as a group strategy (huddling) instead of normally being a physiological one.</p>		</li>

			<p>The key concepts you need to incorporate are:<br><br><em> Heat transfers across the surface area<br></em> Heat stores throughout a volume (and in a biological system, heat is actually generated throughout the volume).<br>* As a body gets larger, volume increases faster than surface area.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Most familiar with bullet 3 which is what I was alluding to. These penguin huddles are absolutely massive with thousands of penguins and produce a SA/V ratio far below any large animal could. I assume heat transfer of the coat is already optimized and not much different than other animals.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Groups are kind of a special case, in that the huddles essentially grow in a plane geometry where SA/V ratio for the group remain constant with growth.  Deer also form herds.  They also take advantage of microclimates, especially when they bed down under trees, unlike penguins.<br><br>Edit:  not to say that penguins don't take advantage of microclimates, just that they don't tend to bed down under trees.</p>		</li>

			<p>I think the SA/V still shrinks just not as fast. Try running the numbers again but keeping height constant. 1x1x1 = SA/V of 6<br>Vs<br>2x2x1= SA/V of 4. <br><br>EDIT: this is still 3d not plane geometry</p>		</li>

			<p>Sure, it goes up very quickly at first, then quickly flattens out as the huddle begins to resemble a plane</p>		</li>

			<p>Youre right, diminishing returns as we scale. 100x100x1= SA/V of 2.04<br>1000x1000x1 = SA/V = 2.004</p>		</li>

			<p>The title mentions deer, and if many people are like me they picture white tailed deer when deer are mentioned. White tailed deer are human sized so that's not a good explanation of how they stay warm compared to humans.</p>		</li>
