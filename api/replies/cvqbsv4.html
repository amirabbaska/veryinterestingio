			<p>I was hoping someone who said this.  Anyone who has worked with ultra-high vacuum systems knows that OP's assumption is false.  </p>		</li>

			<p>It's not really false, they probably won't be giving off a detectable amounts of metal vapor.</p>		</li>

			<p>As I pointed out elsewhere, if you do the math, copper at room temperature has a vapor pressure of about 6E-53 atmospheres. In other words, it doesn't evaporate until it gets hot. So saying it &quot;has a vapor pressure&quot; at room temperature, while technically accurate, is probably going to give people a bad intuition for what actually happens. At that pressure, a single atom leaving is an exceedingly rare event!</p>		</li>

			<p>How would one go about calculating the probability of an atom leaving the solid, given the vapor pressure (and knowing atmospheric pressure)? I don't even know which equation to start to look at.</p>		</li>

			<p>Don't you mean lowest vapor pressure?</p>		</li>

			<p>Did you perhaps mean lowest vapor pressure? From Wikipedia for tungsten:<br><br>Of all metals in pure form, tungsten has the highest melting point (3422 째C, 6192 째F), <strong>lowest vapor pressure</strong> (at temperatures above 1650 째C, 3000 째F) and the highest tensile strength.</p>		</li>
