			<p>Does this explain the boundary with the jar though? There are smaller 'columns' around the rim that seems like they would be too small/wrongly placed to be a convective cell. </p>		</li>

			<p>Well at the solid boundary, in the fluid state, the circulating coconut oil will be bound by the &quot;no-slip condition&quot;, which means that the velocity of the fluid at the wall equals the velocity of the wall, which in this case would be zero.  That will interfere with the circulation everywhere near the wall.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Right. But in the picture, we see cells interfacing directly with the wall (look at the top of the first image), which I wouldn't expect if circulation was the mechanism. </p>		</li>

			<p>There is no way OP's shelf reached high enough temperatures to form convective cells in oils solid at room temp.  See other posts in the thread on the Rayleigh number of coconut oil.</p>		</li>

			<p>I disagree. I think if there's even a 0.004 K difference there could be formation of a convective cell. <br><br>Source data: <br><a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11746-004-0913-8#page-1" target="_blank">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11746-004-0913-8#page-1</a><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_diffusivity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_diffusivity</a><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion#Thermal_expansion_coefficients_for_various_materials" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_expansion#Thermal_expansion_coefficients_for_various_materials</a><br><br>The Rayleigh number of interest is calculated as Ra = (g <em> beta </em> deltaT <em> L^3 )/(nu </em> alpha), where there is convection if Ra is greater than critical Rayleigh number Ra_crit = ~1100.<br><br>For a first pass estimate I did some rounding and used approximate values for similar materials where I couldn't find values for coconut oil. <br><br>g = gravity = 10 m/s2<br><br>beta = thermal expansion coefficient.

			<p>So what's the Rayleigh number of the jar of coconut oil? Don't just say it's convection-driven, show under reasonable assumptions that the Rayleigh number is at or above the critical Rayleigh number for reasonable conditions.</p>		</li>
