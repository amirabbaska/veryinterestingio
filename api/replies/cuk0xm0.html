			<p>&gt;These are unsavoury people and  the local organizers want to know they are not inviting crime into their town, so they contract with group that can insure the security of the event. The group makes money off the town, and the vendors. It is very lucrative.<br><br>I currently live in Japan, this is the answer right here. The cops aren't really &quot;cops&quot; like Americans think of them. The cops here can't even pull you over unless they already have their lights on to signify &quot;on duty&quot;, and even then it's usually not within the ability of the police to enforce the law here. You can blow past a police station going 180km and they won't even call it in, mostly because they use vehicles suited to the environment (small, thin cars with low HP and tiny wheels), and are generally unsuited for enforcing anything that requires retaliatory/violent response. <br><br>And this is where the Yakuza come in. The Yakuza primarily play the &quot;guard dog&quot; / &quot;peace enforcement&quot; role here, as they aren't too afraid to carry the weapons/use the violent action that the police are prohibited from using. They also have an extremely well laid network, so if a guy messes around and robs a store owner, the moment one of the Yakuza contacts (ex: a store/bar owner reporting to them for good favour) sees them pop up they're screwed. <br><br>That said, the Yakuza are NOT the &quot;good guys&quot;. Prostitution, crooked gambling, loan sharking, drug hubs, and sex trafficking (including minors) are some of their biggest sources of income. They just help the community when it suits them, which is often. </p>		</li>
