			<p>They have rules of conduct which are meant to be obeyed but I guess that depends on which yakuza group is in question.<br>Also thing with yakuza is about making money and petty crimes don't exactly bring you cash but it does bring you trouble, white collar crimes also bring trouble but you gain a hell a lot more money before that.<br><br>There is a document on yakuza where some mid-level boss tries to scale the ladder (his plan failed in at end of documentary I think and he lost a considerable amount of face) while training in new recruits and you can actually leave if you want (the boss actually considered being a member yakuza just another job with strict rules of conduct and respect for traditions) but if you wont keep your mouth shut afterwards they will hunt you down.<br><br>Anyway an interesting document about yakuza and well about Japanese society as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>That doesn't offset the child pornography they make and the human trafficking they do. Or the extortion, raping, killing, etc.  <br><br>They're scum. </p>		</li>
