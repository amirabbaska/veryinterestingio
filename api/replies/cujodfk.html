			<p>HAHAHAHAHAHA you're not serious are you ? I love Spain, My family lives there but corruption is rife. Ignoring the huge gangs of Roma and Africans and the crime they're involved in, you have one of the most overtly corrupt political systems in the world. Spains politicians put Italy to shame, it's endemic, everyone is on the take, everyone is connected, trying to get anything done without bribes or family members within the system is practically impossible. You have organised crime in Spain, the only difference is you call it Government ( and don't even get me started on the extortion racketeers known as the police )  </p>		</li>

			<p>In Australia we removed the organised underworld and end up with a bunch of low-lives competing for power. No respect, no rules, no boundaries. Organised crime generally has some ethics and don't mess with the general public unless they are messed with. They don't want to attract attention to themselves.</p>		</li>

			<p>On the other hand, the quantity of money, people sucked in and criminal culture and tradition created there can be much higher than cit could be without organizations.<br><br>Besides, I think the if criminal organizations spawn up in some countries and don't in some others it's more about how is the country's culture. Spain is one of the most corrupt countries in Europe but our culture of general pride and State wouldn't allow a national mafia to grow.</p>		</li>

			<p>It seems that criminals from other cultures, the U.K in particular are fond of spain, in fact even some of our criminals have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Skase" target="_blank">fled</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Trimbole" target="_blank">spain</a></p>		</li>

			<p>As a somewhat unrelated side note, I remember reading that the Triads never flourished in China the way the Yakuza did in Japan, because the government was in on certain illegal activities which left no room for the Triads.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm sure there is an organized underworld you just don't know about it. There are drugs in Spain and there is a good chance they came in through some illegal means, and the people doing the importing are not going to be disorganized petty criminals. They are organized. And that is just drugs. There are undoubtedly other illegal goods/people being brought in by organized criminals. </p>		</li>

			<p>if there is any market for contraband- guns, drugs, porn, anything- then there is a market for an underworld. Where there is a demand, people figure out how to supply it. It's just stupid to think otherwise.</p>		</li>
