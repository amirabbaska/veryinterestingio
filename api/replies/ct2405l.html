			<p>Basically plutonium is too reactive and the gun-type is too slow.  You can't make a bomb like that without having it spontaneously explode, and even when you detonate it the yield will be substandard because of predetonation.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;A test explosion and subsequent calculations done by the United States Department of Energy found that assuming nothing is done to clean up the affected area and everyone stays in the affected area for one year, the radiation exposure would be &quot;fairly high&quot;, but not fatal.&quot;<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirty_bomb" target="_blank">From the Dirty Bomb Wiki Page.</a><br><br>I never knew this!

			<p>The critical thing with all assembly methods is keeping the fissile material together for enough &quot;generations&quot; to produce a nuclear yield before the whole assembly blows itself apart. (for a sense of scale, consider that los alamos scientists measured this using a custom unit called a &quot;shake&quot;, equal to about 10ns). When the scientists at Los Alamos were looking at the properties of enriched plutonium, they found that it began to react much more quickly than U-235. Therefore, the &quot;gun&quot; assembly method would require a much higher &quot;muzzle&quot; velocity to prevent predetonation and harmless scattering of most of the fissile material. Because the gun would have to be physically longer than could be delivered practically by bomber, the plutonium gun design was abandoned. </p>		</li>

			<p>The gun type bomb was almost absolutely guaranteed to work.  It's pretty much a foolproof design, so much so that it wasn't even tested before dropping it on Hiroshima.  The implosion bomb, however, is much harder to build.  It required a lot of difficult mathematical modeling of the implosion and some very precisely made and timed explosives to pull off.</p>		</li>

			<p>To elaborate a little more, you have a tube. At each end is a piece of uranium. At one end you have some high explosives. When the high explosives detonate, it &quot;shoots&quot; the piece on that side, at high speed, toward the other end of the tube, where it combines with the other piece of uranium to form a critical mass.</p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/[deleted]" target="_blank">[deleted]</a>
			<p>In terms of TNT, how much explosive do you need to be able to cause critical mass on the collision of two pieces of uranium?<br>Does the tube also gradually narrow down to increase the pressure at the other end during impact?</p>		</li>

		<li class="reply">
			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iknownuffink" target="_blank">iknownuffink</a>
			<p>The collision doesn't really cause the critical mass because of the impact or pressures involved, it mostly just puts the two pieces together. They would be a critical mass even if they were gently pushed together.<br><br>However, the explosive method of delivery is needed because it can be so reactive that it blows up before it even gets all the way there just by being close enough, which would result in a fizzle. it would explode, but not nearly as catastrophically.</p>		</li>

			<p>The Geometry/shape matters.<br><br>If you take what would be a critical mass if it was shaped into a sphere, but instead make it a hollow ring, then it <em>isn't</em> a critical mass anymore.<br><br>and you can put things between pieces that block neutrons and space it out, to prevent them from reacting with each other.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, having a critical mass can lead to intense bursts of radiation (as happened and led to the deaths of at least two scientists working on the Manhattan project who were experimenting with critical masses) on up to a nuclear detonation if it's pure enough of the right isotope.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_K._Daghlian,_Jr" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_K._Daghlian,_Jr</a>.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Slotin" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Slotin</a></p>		</li>

			<p>another tangent off of this:<br><br>Plutonium Implosion design bombs, <em>do</em> work via pressure.<br><br>You take a subcritical piece of plutonium at the center of the bomb. You surround it with high explosives, and get them to detonate simultaneously (if it doesn't happen at the same time within extremely small tolerances it won't work).<br><br>The reason you do this, is that they fibbed to you in high school physics, where they say that liquids and solids don't compress. They do, it just takes a lot of force to do it.<br><br>So you more or less uniformly compress this piece of plutonium with implosive force, and it shrinks. It becomes more dense. Dense enough to make a critical mass, and <strong><em>Boom</em></strong></p>		</li>

			<p>They wanted to test the devices as weapons.  <br><br>They knew that the atomic bomb was a huge future superweapon, but they still didn't really understand how well it would work.  <br><br>The first nuclear test was with an implosion-type plutonium device.  A similar device was housed in Fat Man.  The implosion-type device was far more intricate, and so they decided that if they were only gonna have one test, this is the one they would do.<br><br>Little Boy was comparatively simple.  It was essentially a cannon that fired a uranium slug into another piece of uranium in order to make the uranium reach a critical mass.  This is as opposed to the implosion-type device, which needed to be detonated so that the uranium collapsed into the exact needed density at the exact right moment.</p>		</li>

			<p>There were also the so called &quot;Thin Man&quot; gun devices, which were built (with the exception of the fissile components).  These were supposed to be Plutonium, but as someone else posted the predetonation problem prevented this.  Switching to Uranium was possible, but made the bomb so long that it was not easily carried by aircraft and had really bad aerodynamics - apparently it was damn near impossible to drop mockups anywhere near a target (near even in nuke terms) and the things almost caused a few crashes.</p>		</li>

			<p>From my understanding, it's not that Plutonium is easier to enrich.<br>Plutonium is a man made element that is synthesised from Uranium 238. <br><br>It's easier to make the Plutonium from U238 than it is to enrich U235 from U238.</p>		</li>

			<p>You make Plutonium by bombarding ^(238)U with neutrons. Then you separate it out from the uranium. Since it's a different chemical, it's pretty easy to do that step. I'm not sure whether or not it counts as &quot;enriching&quot;.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, a long long time ago, there would be more of a great many radioactive isotopes. The radioactive isotopes we still have the most of are the ones like U-238, that have very long half lives, and so they have not had time to decay as much as the isotopes with shorter half lives.<br><br>In the grand scheme of things, even U-235 has a long half life. A lot of radioactive isotopes have half lives measures in years, or decades, and quite a few are less than a second.<br><br>The primary factor of U-235's usefulness as a fission bomb material, is that when it absorbs a neutron it (usually) becomes <em>incredibly</em> unstable and decays/splits more or less immediately, releasing energy and shooting off two more neutrons with which to make a chain reaction.</p>		</li>
