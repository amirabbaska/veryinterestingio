			<p>Interesting, I always thought you'd taste the chlorine. Why?<br><br>I once tried a drop of 0,1M HCl on the tip of my tongue. Tasted salty.</p>		</li>

			<p>Honestly I'm not sure why it would taste salty.  I had always assumed that Cl- by itself does not have a taste, though I can't find a source to back that up (or refute it).<br><br>0.1M HCl should taste sour, because it is quite acidic (pH = 1.0!)</p>		</li>

			<p>And here's another fun trick! Put hydrochloric acid in water. You won't be able to taste the chlorine because your taste buds will be burned away! </p>		</li>

			<p>well, if it's high enough concentration yes.  somebody before you was saying that they were tasting 0.1M HCl... which has a pH of 1.  Probably not smart.</p>		</li>

			<p>I thought that was the reaction of the basic baking soda with acids in your mouth producing a salt.  Especially since once you have neutralized the acids, you can no longer produce the salty taste with more baking soda.</p>		</li>

			<p>I heard that your gustatory receptors register &quot;salty&quot; due to the movement of sodium ions through sodium channels.  which would make it the sodium.</p>		</li>

			<p>correct.  they also respond to other cations, such as K+ and Ca++</p>		</li>

			<p>If bicarbonate (CO3--) reacts with an acid, it will produce carbonic acid (H2CO3), which eventually will turn into carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate_buffering_system" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicarbonate_buffering_system</a>).  This is why a solution of vinegar (or any acid) and baking soda will vigorously bubble and foam (due to CO2 release).<br><br>You can indeed produce a stronger salty taste with more baking soda, because you are increasing the concentration of Na+.  Go try it.</p>		</li>

			<p>Is it just a coincidence that ammonium chloride tastes salty too?</p>		</li>

			<p>Does it?  If it really does taste salty, then that would suggest to me that the ammonium (NH4+) cation is able to pass through cation channel 'sensors' on the tongue, just like Na+, K+, Ca2+, etc.</p>		</li>

			<p>So that suggests that the salty sensation is possibly just caused by small cations.</p>		</li>
