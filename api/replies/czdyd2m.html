			<p>Just noticed your username...I'd been wondering about deer having feathers. Thank you for the info...I work with geese every day, sometimes up (down) to 20^o below. Seeing ice on their feathers is worrisome, but I guess it's possible (and beneficial) because their heat is kept inside, not melting the ice. </p>		</li>
