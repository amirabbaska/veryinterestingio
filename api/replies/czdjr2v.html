			<p>But take the penguin example, heres my issue...Antarctica frequently gets to -30f in the winter with some wicked storms. I've never worn a penguin suit before, but I'm fairly sure it wouldn't matter how much fat I built up or how many of my friends also wearing penguin suits I huddled together with - I would 100% die within a couple days of being outside in a -30f antarctic storm in nothing but a penguin suit. What makes them able to survive? </p>		</li>

			<p>Well there are physiological mechanisms that keep animals warm - when their core body temp gets low key mechanisms kick in which try to prevent further cooling. For animals and humans, the <a href="http://dwb.unl.edu/teacher/nsf/c01/c01links/www.science.mcmaster.ca/biology/4s03/thermoregulation.html" target="_blank">hypothalamus</a> is the body's thermostat. You aren't going to get a single answer because different species have different adaptions to surviving in the cold. There isn't a single way to solve this problem, and the hypothalamus will respond in different ways for different species.<br><br>When cold sensors in your skin are activated your hypothalamus responds by directly or indirectly causing:<br><br>1. Norepinephrine release from sympathetic fibers constricts skin vessels.<br>2. Brown fat (found in infants and some animals) oxidation increases causing thermogenesis.<br>3. Piloerection, occurs which traps air close to skin.<br>4. Epinephrine secretion from adrenal medulla increases thermogenesis. <br>5. A Shivering Center in the hypothalamus is also activated which activates the Brainstem Motor Centers to initiate involuntary contraction of skeletal muscles causing shivering, which generates heat. <br><br><strong>Animal Examples</strong><br><br>Some animals can withstand greater variation in core body temp compared to humans (For example, Camels can survive with a core body temp higher than 41c). Other species will have better behavioural adaptations that kick in when that core body temp drops. (e.g. Humans tend to shiver, other animals will begin to burn brown fat). <br><br>Some animals (e.g. chickadee birds) purposely lower their core body temperature at night so as to not waste extra energy trying to keep warm. Their bodies are physiologically adapted to be able to withstand this drop. Humans cannot withstand even small fluctuations of our core temperature.<br><br>Still other animals have what is essentially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifreeze_protein#Fish_AFPs" target="_blank">&quot;anti-freeze&quot;</a> circulating in their blood so as to prevent their tissues from freezing. <br><br><strong>Humans &amp; Wearing Animal Skins or Hides</strong><br><br>It isn't just enough that we wear the skin of an animal to keep warm. When we wear their skin we don't suddenly also acquire all those other adaptations that they have to the cold. It isn't just their fur or fat, they have many other adaptions that are highly regulated by their hypothalamus. Unfortunately, we are stuck with our hypothalamus and our physiological responses. Wearing the skin of another animal does not make us suddenly have brown fat to burn, or suddenly allow us tolerate lower core temperatures. Moreover, a skin or pelt is a poor substitution for the actual hide when attached to the animal. Skin is a living tissue, with blood and nerve endings which all help regulate heat loss. When we wear the skin of an animal it does have an insulating effect but it does not have those added benefits of being able to sense and regulate the cold in the way that it did while it was alive and attached to that animal. <br><br>I hope this information helps.<br><br><strong>More Resources</strong><br><br>You might want to read up more on <a href="http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199830060/obo-9780199830060-0007.xml" target="_blank">thermoregulation in animals</a> or the <a href="http://www.gfmer.ch/Presentations_En/Pdf/Thermoregulation.pdf" target="_blank">adaptive thermoregulation of different animals</a>.

			<p>&gt; Brown fat (found in infants and some animals) oxidation increases causing thermogenesis.<br><br>From Wikipdia:<br><br>&gt; Further, recent studies using positron emission tomography scanning of adult humans have shown that it is still present in adults in the upper chest and neck (especially paravertebrally). The remaining deposits become more visible (increasing tracer uptake, that is, more metabolically active) with cold exposure, and less visible if an adrenergic beta blocker is given before the scan.<br><br>See also <a href="http://www.joslin.org/diabetes-research/turning-up-the-heat-on-brown-fat.html" target="_blank">http://www.joslin.org/diabetes-research/turning-up-the-heat-on-brown-fat.html</a> which has a nifty graphic near the bottom of where that fat is typically stored.<br><br>I remember seeing an article recently about Eskimos, or people who spend most of their time in an rather cold environment, having much more brown fat.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, I am aware of some new studies that examine the use of brown fat in adult humans. Its pretty interesting stuff. However, I still think its safe to say that some animals use this as their primary mechanism - or to a much greater extent than adult humans do. </p>		</li>

			<p>Followup question: How do birds prevent their feet from getting frostbite? Crows can fly around and walk around in the snow at -40*F without issue, and penguins can stand on ice. Why?</p>		</li>

			<p>The counter-current exchange prevents <a href="http://blogs.britannica.com/2011/01/penguin-feet-avoiding-frostbite-in-the-antarctic/" target="_blank">frostbite from taking hold</a>...or in simpler words prevents the feet from falling off.<br><br>&quot;In addition, the blood vessels running to and from the feet of penguins are organized to facilitate countercurrent heat exchange. Arteries carrying warm blood toward the feet run alongside veins carrying cool blood up from the feet. Some of the heat from the blood in the arteries is transferred to the blood in the veins. Thus, cool blood moving toward the heart is warmed, which is important for maintaining core body temperature. Warm blood moving toward the feet is cooled, which helps penguins keep their feet at temperatures just above freezing. This strategy minimizes the amount of energy needed for keeping their feet warm while also preventing frostbite.&quot; <br><br>The same principle applies for <a href="https://student.societyforscience.org/article/no-frostbite-dogs" target="_blank">dogs</a> - they also have a counter-current heat exchange in their paws which prevents frostbite. <br><br>So it has two purposes, the main to keep core body T up it <em>also</em> helps prevent frostbite in the limbs. This is done by keeping the limbs at a slightly higher temperature than the surrounding media (i.e. just above freezing). Counter-current exchange is used to KEEP blood pumping without cooling the core temperature. It does not reduce blood flow. Counter-current exchange does not allow the tissues of the extremities to reach freezing temperatures. It allows, for example, the feet of a gull to reach temperatures between 0 and 5 degrees while conserving energy and keeping the core warm. Frostbite will not occur unless the tissues reach freezing temperatures and loose blood supply. The important part here is that the cells aren't going to just die because of the cold, they are dying because of the lack of oxygen and nutrient flow via the blood. Thats when frostbite settles in. Even if the tissues are cold, so long as blood is flowing to those tissues frostbite should be prevented. This is because the tissues and cells continue to receive oxygen and nutrients.  In order to counteract this the counter-current heat exchange system has a two-fold advantage: it keeps core temperature warm, and it allows the extremities to remain oxygenated by keeping the blood vessels dilated (or open).<br><br>Animals that cannot take advantage of counter current exchange, like humans, will constrict bloodflow to keep the core warm during times of extreme cold, which is why we get frostbite. If we could use counter-current exchange, we wouldn't have to constrict bloodflow nearly as much to keep our core warm, allowing the tissues of the extremities to stay healthy. Our cells begin to die because of the lack of blood flow.<br><br><a href="http://beyondpenguins.ehe.osu.edu/issue/arctic-and-anarctic-birds/how-do-birds-stay-warm" target="_blank">Another source</a></p>		</li>

			<p>In the giant huddles every penguin gets a chance to be in the center. Sometimes a few penguins will die just because of just how warm it gets in these penguin huddles. Sometimes a few penguins die on the outside of these huddles because of how cold it gets outside the huddle. Either way everyone gets a turn and a few penguins dead is better than all of them.<br><br> You also need to remember that humans are adapted to African climates. The only reason we survive elsewhere is our ability to create tools and clothing and also our ability to teach others and learn from others so that knowledge will get passed on.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sounds ridiculous, but then I was in Norway a month ago: I was <strong>really</strong> not in excessive cold-weather gear.

This wasn't in Antarctica-level temperatures, but it was still pretty damn cold - we were walking through fairly deep snow to a ski slope.<br><br>And that's me, a regular guy, in fairly regular clothes - not an animal who's specifically evolved to combat the cold and stay warm, and I have the ability to shed layers (a penguin doesn't)</p>		</li>

I don't know how to tell what makes one better than another, sadly. I didn't buy this coat; my dad did, and it cost more than a thousand dollars in 1998. One notable difference between my coat and every other one I've seen is that it is heavy as fuck and very thick (probably 1.5&quot; if you're not squeezing the fur), and it's not lamb's wool (which is curly; mine is straight and not especially soft).<br><br>Hope that helps you find what you're looking for.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, as a flagger, I find that I can overheat with poor quality clothing, when I move around doing extremely light work. As soon as I stand still, I can't put on enough clothing to keep warm.<br><br>Oddly enough, as a background performer for film, I found the opposite also true. You have to really stand absolutely still to avoid losing heat. When it was cold out, many of my fellow performers started doing light exercises while standing but because they didn't generate enough heat, I could see that they were actually getting even colder. I, on the other hand, was beginning to warm up to a comfortable temperature. If the exercise is too light, then they are effectively fanning their limbs and torsos.<br><br>It's almost as if there is an uncanny valley and and uncanny hill at cold temperatures.<br><br>LPT: when trying to conserve heat, cross your arms on your torso, and curl your fingers up. You want your arms as flat as possible to ensure that as little surface as possible is exposed. This adds insulation to your torso, and reduces heat loss in your arms. I'm planning on inventing a super muff, which can cover the hands up to the elbows, because it makes such a difference.<br><br>LPT: when trying to conserve heat, keep the inner back of your legs together.

It would also be suspended from some kind of structure from the inside, so that the weight of the arms doesn't tighten the fabric and insulation on the outside.<br><br>I might need to illustrate it.

			<p>Yea.  Overheating is the real danger in the cold.  Because when you overheat, you sweat.  And when you sweat you get wet.  And after you're done overheating you stay wet, and that water evaporating of you robs you of heat and makes your clothing much less efficient. Then you freeze.<br><br>&quot;If you sweat, you die.&quot; May sound like an exaggeration but its really not if you're stuck outside for several days with no change of clothing.</p>		</li>

			<p>A polar bear's fur is not white, but clear. Any time it is in sunlight, the light can pass through the fur and be absorbed by the skin. The fur insulates against the transfer of kinetic heat, but allows the incoming radiant heat.<br><br>Often in nature you will find similar mechanisms used for seemingly opposite reasons. Another would be plants with waxy surfaces to slow respiratory moisture loss in arid climates, and plants with waxy surfaces to slow moisture uptake in very wet climates.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>This is just supposition based on my own non-expert understanding but I assume that any increase in the risk of overheating would be limited by the fact that humans and other animals can adjust their temperature (sweating or panting, changing behavior to limit activity or find cool areas, etc.). Add in that high melanin content produces a meaningful reduction in the health problems that come from sun exposure and overheating ends up being a small cost attached to a big benefit.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're right. Basically a lot of evaporation occurs along the equator but all of this moisture is lost as precipitation, within 15 degrees north or south of the equator (or some line that moves with the seasons... ...I forgot the actual term, I learned it in high school geography.)

			<p>I don't know much about penguins but I do know about deer (which you used as an example in your question). In a city like Thunder Bay where there are many deer, it frequently gets to be -35 to -50 in the winters. The deer survive by huddling together under coniferous trees (think pines) with low-hanging branches that sweep the ground at its tips, usually keeping wind away from them. As the top comment in this thread explains, their circulatory system and many other factors also help, but as far as huddling in absurd weather goes, they seem to do okay.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, because fat alone isn't usually enough to ward off the cold. As I said, animals will have a number of adaptations that work together to protect the animal from hypothermia, frostbite etc. Humans also have a number of strategies. Unfortunately for us, we accumulate a lot of white fat...which isn't that great for heat production. Other animals have significantly more brown fat, and they burn this in order to produce sufficient body heat to survive. Fat isn't just an insulator - it can also be used as a fuel.</p>		</li>

			<p>This may be a bit too late, and probably a dumb question, but when you say:<br><br>&gt;* They might expend less energy moving or foraging, instead directing that energy towards heat production<br><br>Does that mean that their body automatically does that, like the way we can't regulate our heartbeat, or is it more like breathing, where we can somewhat regulate it, but it also just works on its own without us thinking about it? <br><br>Thanks for the explanation, very interesting!</p>		</li>

			<p>The animal would not think to stop moving, it just would. Part of the hypothalamuses job is to control body temperature through physiological mechanisms that can effect behaviour. In short there are some behaviours which are more or less under control of the individual. Shivering is non-voluntary, but huddling to a certain extent is more voluntary. That is, the animal could decide to run if it encountered a different stimulus (e.g. a predator). But generally speaking animals don't make cognitive decisions like &quot;ok, I'm cold so I'm going to huddle in with my buddies&quot;. </p>		</li>

			<p>In addition to having more fat, certain animals have higher levels of brown fat tissue. We humans have low levels of this type of fat in adulthood. It's main purpose, instead of being used for energy, is the generation of heat. Thus, more energy will go toward keeping the animal warm. </p>		</li>

			<p>No, they don't. But certain environmental changes will begin to trigger different behaviours that help the animal prepare for the winter season. Different species will rely more or less upon different triggers. Some may be triggered by changing day-length or temperature. </p>		</li>

			<p>Blood vessels going out to the feet wrap around blood vessels coming back to the body from the feet. So, warm blood goes down the leg, but the blood vessel is all wrapped up in cold blood coming up the leg. The warm blood from the body warms up the cold blood from the foot, and the cold blood from the foot cools down the warm blood from the body.<br><br>The end result is that the blood in the feet is always cool in cold weather, whether it's travelling from the body or going to. Feet in a lot of animals have different fat and other things to the rest of the body, just so that the feet can be really cold and still work. The feet don't actually freeze, because there's a constant flow of cool, but not freezing blood going through them. They are a lot colder than the rest of the body though.<br><br>The body, meanwhile, stays warm. It would get really cold to pump warm blood into the feet, losing heat to the ground, but because the body's warmth is only ever warming up cool blood, and not the freezing ground, the body is able to cope. It never actually gets cold, even though the feet, so very close by, might get really chilly (but not frozen). The core organs never get anywhere near anything but properly warm blood.</p>		</li>

			<p>It makes sense to explain it with blood vessels because blood always has to make a return trip to the core. <br><br>The goal is for the bird to keep its feet warm enough to not freeze. So it runs hot core-blood in the opposite direction of cold feet-blood in blood vessels very close to each other. This lets heat exchange happen rapidly resulting in warm blood traveling in each direction. Blood warm enough going out to keep the feet thawed, and blood warm enough going in that it can be reheated easily. <br><br>Warm climate ungulates (i.e. Gazelles) have a mess of blood vessels in their brain called a carotid rete that does the opposite; it cools the brain. They take cooler nose-blood and run it by hot brain-blood resulting in cool enough blood going in as to not fry their brains, and in the opposite, warm brain-blood going out to their faces to cool further. <br><br>Edit: fixed some stuff.</p>		</li>

			<p>I mean, I don't know the actual physics for counter- or co-current exchange very well, but to me it makes sense that the blood always HAS to make the return trip.  If it was co-current, you'd have all of the blood going to the feet.  Then it would all be cold.  Then the bird would be sending lots of just cold blood to their core, which would cost more energy to reheat, and make their cores colder.<br><br>Maybe for some engineering applications, co-current would make sense if you had a seemingly endless reservoir of hot &quot;blood&quot; and you didn't have to recycle it as quickly.</p>		</li>

			<p>The counter-current exchange prevents <a href="http://blogs.britannica.com/2011/01/penguin-feet-avoiding-frostbite-in-the-antarctic/" target="_blank">frostbite from taking hold</a>...or in simpler words prevents the feet from falling off.<br><br>&quot;In addition, the blood vessels running to and from the feet of penguins are organized to facilitate countercurrent heat exchange. Arteries carrying warm blood toward the feet run alongside veins carrying cool blood up from the feet. Some of the heat from the blood in the arteries is transferred to the blood in the veins. Thus, cool blood moving toward the heart is warmed, which is important for maintaining core body temperature. Warm blood moving toward the feet is cooled, which helps penguins keep their feet at temperatures just above freezing. This strategy minimizes the amount of energy needed for keeping their feet warm while also preventing frostbite.&quot; <br><br>The same principle applies for <a href="https://student.societyforscience.org/article/no-frostbite-dogs" target="_blank">dogs</a> - they also have a counter-current heat exchange in their paws which prevents frostbite. </p>		</li>

Counter-current exchange does not allow the tissues of the extremities to reach freezing temperatures.

			<p>Re-read what I wrote. I said exactly and concisely what I meant to say. Frostbite is when a bit of flesh freezes. Then when it gets warmed up again it's effectively dead. Any blood flow at all will prevent it. The way you worded your reply suggests that the heat exchange mechanism alone magically stops the feet getting cold when this isn't the case. I'm just semantically correcting you. You even say (and quote) in your reply that it is a mechanism for keeping the core warm while preventing frostbite, which also suggests that you understand what it is. I'm now thinking you don't understand English well enough. </p>		</li>

			<p>Imagine you have a 50 cold cubes and 50 warm cubes, you want to make the cold cubes as warm as possible. When the cubes touch heat is passed perfectly between them and they become &quot;averaged&quot;. So lets put some numbers into them, lets say the cold cubes are at 0 heat and the warm cubes are at 100 heat.<br><br>So the first idea is to make every cold cube touch a warm cube, and everything ends at 50 heat (which is the average), but can we do better?<br><br>Lets focus on one cube first. We are going to touch it with one warm cube, which makes both of them become 50 heat. But then we are going to touch that cold cube with another warm cube that hasn't transfered heat, so 50 heat and 100 heat gives us 75 heat. Then we repeat it and we get between 75 heat and 100 heat, so we get 87.5 heat on each cube. At the end it's going to be really close to 100 (but not quite) certainly hotter than the original 50 heat we had!<br><br>But what about the other cubes? Well lets pass them through. So the next cold cube will do the same, but all hot cubes are now &quot;colder&quot;. The first hot cube is at 50 heat, so touching the cubes will make them go to 25 heat. The second hot cube is going to be at 75 heat, so the area between 25 heat and 75 is 50 heat. The next cube is going to be at 87.5 heat, and the place in-between them is about 81.25 heat. Again we see that the temperature will end up at a number very close to 100 heat (just slightly less hot than the first cube).<br><br>We can repeat the process for all the cubes and they all will end up a lot hotter than they would have been otherwise.<br><br>No imagine that we line up all the cold cubes in one line and all the hot cubes in another. We make the first hot cube be on top of the last cold cube and we let them touch. Then we start moving the lines in opposite directions. What will happen is that the first cold cube will touch all the hot cubes in order, and then the next cold cube will touch them immediately afterwards, and so forth. It's basically what happened above!<br><br>Now with fluids, such as blood, it's not so different. Instead of cubes we have &quot;slices&quot; of the fluid. We have a &quot;cold&quot; vein and a &quot;hot&quot; artery and we make them touch (or be as close as possible) and flow in opposite directions. Just like above this will heat up the cold blood a lot.</p>		</li>

			<p>In a heat exchanger 2 pipes are close together with flow in opposite directions. On one side hot fluid comes in, on the other side cold fluid is coming in. The heat moves from the hot side to the cool side so that you end up with the hot water becoming cold and the cold water becoming hot without the fluids mixing. Birds have this with the blood flow to their feet. The result is hot blood flowing out and cooling in the legs while the return blood is heated in the legs before returning, heated, to the core of the body. The feet remain cold, but not frozen, while the core loses as little heat as possible. <br><br>without this you would be flowing hot blood to the feet, having it cool in the feet, losing heat to the environment, and returning cold blood to the core and cooling the core. The bird would rapidly freeze to death. </p>		</li>

It is still not fully understood how large ungulates cope with this twofold challenge. We found that red deer, similar to many other northern ungulates, show large seasonal fluctuations of metabolic rate, as indicated by heart rate, with a 60% reduction at the winter nadir compared with the summer peak. A previously unknown mechanism of energy conservation, i.e., nocturnal hypometabolism associated with peripheral cooling, contributed significantly to lower energy expenditure during winter. Predominantly during late winter night and early morning hours, subcutaneous temperature could decrease substantially. Importantly, during these episodes of peripheral cooling, heart rate was not maintained at a constant level, as to be expected from classical models of thermoregulation in the thermoneutral zone, but continuously decreased with subcutaneous temperature, both during locomotor activity and at rest. This indicates that the circadian minimum of basal metabolic rate and of the set-point of body temperature regulation varied and dropped to particularly low levels during late winter. Our results suggest, together with accumulating evidence from other species, that reducing endogenous heat production is not restricted to hibernators and daily heterotherms but is a common and well-regulated physiological response of endothermic organisms to energetically challenging situations. Whether the temperature of all tissues is affected, or the body shell only, may simply be a result of the duration and degree of hypometabolism and its interaction with body size-dependent heat loss.&quot; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12969877" target="_blank">source</a><br><br>More on <strong>white-tailed deer</strong>: &quot;All deer occupying a deer wintering area (DWA) will experience a negative energy balance or weight loss because winter forage of deer is of moderate-low quality from a nutritional standpoint. Forage availability and intake are of most importance from the standpoint of energy balance, however, nutritional value and intake rate tend to decline throughout winter as deer remove the current annual growth (CAG) of most browse, and increasing snow depth reduces access to forage. Because intake rate is directly related to digestibility of the diet, providing high forage diversity and availability in DWAs helps maintain high intake rate.<br>2. <strong>The seasonal fat cycle in adult does is their primary physiological adaptation to withstand extended periods of limited forage availability in winter. Body fat accounts for 35-50% and 10-25% of the daily energy expenditure (DEE) of adult does and fawns, respectively,</strong> during a 90-100 day period of confinement in a DWA. Because the reciprocal proportions are met by forage consumption, reduced forage intake increases the contribution of fat to the DEE. Therefore, on a relative scale, survival of adult does is most influenced by length of winter, whereas survival of fawns is most dependent upon constant forage intake.<br>3. The average DEE of deer is considered low and similar to their maintenance energy requirements (1.6-1.8 x FMR) indicating that energy conservation is their principal survival strategy. Measurements of DEE and energy balance models indicate that deer mortality should be expected when severe winter conditions extend beyond 90-100 days. Fawns experience earlier and higher mortality than adult deer because, on a relative basis, they have higher DEE and less body fat and access to forage due to their age and size. Because fat reserves and body condition are best maintained through high metabolizable energy intake (MEI), maximizing browse availability and enhancing mobility to improve access to browse should be promoted in DWA management.<br>4. Winter mortality of deer is both density-dependent due to forage competition caused by high population density in a confined area with limited resources, and density- independent from predation by coyotes. However, both sources of mortality are largely ￼dictated by winter severity, principally snow depth that affects forage availability and mobility of deer, and their abundance, distribution, and relative vulnerability to predation. Coyotes predate all sex/age classes of deer, but fawns are most vulnerable, and predation is greatest when forage competition and malnutrition occur in late winter. Thus, the probability of additive mortality from predation is influenced by winter conditions that exacerbate all mortality factors, indicating the value in managing DWAs for high browse availability and mobility of deer.&quot; <a href="http://maineforest.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Northern-Maine-deer-ecology.pdf" target="_blank">Source</a><br><br><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Deer have a number of adaptive strategies to help deal with the cold. They use both physiological and behavioural mechanims. They minimize activities, they increase food intake <em>and</em> they burn adipose-fat tissue. If spring is delayed or if stores of body fat are inadequate, death by starvation is likely.</p>		</li>

			<p>I heard by skiing in the forest you can wake up animals, like rabbits for exemple.  If you scare them they will run anyway.  Could sound funny like that. But actually they spent so much energy running in the snow and getting cold outside their home for hours,  that you might actually have killed it because it won't last until the spring.

			<p>Depends on the animal. Some animals will tolerate disturbances, others won't. Many animals will wake up periodically from hibernation, but too many disturbances and they could be risking their lives by using their fat reserves too quickly. Likewise, if animals that entered daily torpor were disturbed they could risk running out of reserves for the night-next day - especially if it is difficult to find food the next day. Every animal will have some resiliency built in, but its just not advisable to disturb wild animals too often (regardless of the season). The stress and energy costs can be draining, especially if these events occur regularly.</p>		</li>
