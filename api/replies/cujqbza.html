			<p>It applies to everyone. Even if you just have a tiny rose on your ankle. No tattoos means no tattoos.</p>		</li>

			<p>Anthony Bourdain is rich and famous, and not a criminal (anymore, at least).  He had to wear a robe to cover his tattoos.  Still a sign of the criminal underclass in Japan, but that's slowly changing.  A few Japanese kids get them, but it's like having tattoos in 1950s America: only sailors and criminals have them.  Give 'em 20 years, that will loosen up.</p>		</li>
