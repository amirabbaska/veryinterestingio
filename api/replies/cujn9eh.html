			<p>They 'help out' by threatening businesses and fucking over the public.<br><br>For example, my mother's friend has been receiving death threats from them ever since he exposed their scam of dumping dangerous hospital waste in the countryside and giving kickbacks to local politicians.<br><br>&quot;&quot;I long for the return of beautiful Japan, a nation of natural beauty,&quot; Nicol declared in a 1997 speech in which he also described Japan as a country &quot;polluted with money.&quot; Part of that pollution comes in the form of graft and corruption; accordingly, the most recent target of Nicol-san's outrage has been the yakuza, or Japanese mob. Three years ago, Nicol received a tip that a notorious front for a criminal syndicate was dumping medical waste and toxic chemicals not far from his home in Nagano Prefecture. He and some of his friends spent about $8,000 to get chemical tests done, discovered that dioxin was leaching from the site at dangerous levels, and then waged a public campaign of media interviews and sit-ins before health officials eventually backed down and ordered the removal of the waste last summer.<br><br>&quot;I was the guy who usually stood in front of the cameras and said that the organization dumping the waste was run by the yakuza, working in collusion with government agencies,&quot; Nicol told me when I visited the site with him in December. The cleanup was still in progress. An idle backhoe stood sentry near a pit the size of a small house, its dirt walls flecked with blue, yellow, and white plastic. &quot;We found catheters, plasma bags, syringes, and bottles of old medicine,&quot; Nicol added. &quot;If this happened in the U.S. or Canada, people would be in jail now. We're not making a fuss just to make them remove the stuff. We're trying to get the country to change its ways.&quot; He says that some of the local yakuza have threatened environmentalists at public meetings, but he's considering hitting back. &quot;I'm the only guy in town who can afford to hire a lawyer to fight a court case for ten years, and I will,&quot; he declared. He promised he's going to &quot;sue the bastards&quot; just as soon as he finishes his next novel.&quot;<br><br>Source; <a href="http://www.outsideonline.com/1842996/hes-big-hes-bad-hesjapanese" target="_blank">http://www.outsideonline.com/1842996/hes-big-hes-bad-hesjapanese</a><br><br>The stuff you hear about them doing 'for the community' is just bullshit propaganda to make themselves look better. </p>		</li>

			<p>Yes Yakuza are fucking evil. But government can't do shit. Government trying to get rid of Yakuza will damage them more than it will help them. There are many stories of people that quit at the Fukushima Powerplant who knew it wasn't being properly operated in terms of safety and that tried to report it getting death threats from the Yakuza which of course were originally from the companies running it. They fuck over local systems by forcing businesses to pay for their &quot;protection&quot; which basically just means pay us or we will get thugs to sabotage you. But because the Yakuza is such a big thing and so embedded with big companies, local systems, and even government. For someone to take them down they will be pressured against it by death threats and even you will be told not to because it is a waste. If Japan wanted to get rid of them they probably could stop some stuff. But considering how much government relies on Yakuza to do dirty work I doubt they are going to do so. Not only that but even if you know lets say the Yakuza boss is doing illegal stuff, imagine all the work to get him arrested.<br><br>A lot of what I said was kinda showing the silver lining of Yakuza (and sugarcoated). In the end Yakuza are unethical. But trust me. Every country has connections and needs with unethical organized crime systems to help do the work they don't want to be associated with.</p>		</li>

			<p><br><br>&quot;After World War II when the American troops occupied Japan the American saw the yakuza as the biggest threat against their forces. They began to watch the yakuza's activities but at the same time rationed out food, creating a black market that made the gangs rich and powerful. It was during this occupations that a new sort of yakuza began to grow: the gurentai (street hustler).&quot; -Jeffery Hays, factsanddetails.com. <br>Yakusa were used by the U.S. occupiers bust up leftist unions and political meetings in post-war Japan at a time when Americans were locked in a cold war with communism.

			<p>Depends somewhat on your definition of &quot;large&quot;. For a long time, most of the government looked the other way to various large mafia families, but that time is gone.<br><br>Most of the &quot;large criminal organizations&quot; in the US end up being seemingly-legitimate corporations that are operating in a legal gray area rather than being outright illegal (the major banks that were central to the 2008 mortgage/housing collapse, for example).

It's not like there's a top yakuza boss somewhere controlling it all.

Even if they might be more organized than most, doesn't mean they can control everything that happens at the ground level.

			<p>It's not that they get a pass. Convicting gang leaders is really, really hard, because you need to prove that they directly ordered a crime that was serious enough to matter. Generally speaking, leaders of established gangs try to avoid doing that where they can be overheard. I'm also not sure they 'clamp down' on serious crime at the behest of the feds...more likely they do it to avoid attracting the kind of attention that could lead to a serious campaign to take them down.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't know about the sixties in Tijuana, but nowadays there are parts of Mexico (Sinaloa, northern west coast) that are pretty loyal to cartels, although it depends on each cartel practices. Zetas and the Golfo cartel are infamous for kidnapping people and central american inmigrants, while the Sinaloa and the Guadalajara cartel tend to only use violence against rival cartels. Some cartels even fight other cartels, if they attack civilians. Like someone said above, the narco culture is perceived as an exit to poverty. People glorify narcos and try to become one (there is a narco saint, Malverde). Some narcos build hospitals, and schools, where the government hasn't built any. It's just a huge PR campaign to recruit soldiers. <br>And about the Italian Mafia, there have been plenty of judges murdered by them (Falcone, Saetta, Borsellino). And I don't really know anything about Yakuzas or Russians. <br>The point is that it isn't black and white, depending on which family, cartel, yakuza, or russian family, you'll find that they protect civilians or kill them. </p>		</li>

But they are saints compared to the Mexican criminal gangs...  take this, but for one example, to show the difference... <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_San_Fernando_massacre" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2011_San_Fernando_massacre</a>.<br><br>Regarding the Italian mafia in Tijuana, Alessio was described by federal agents as a member of organized crime in the sixties.   Jerry brown actually got a little heat over recommending him to get a horse racing license or something like that, much later in the seventies when alessio was no longer associated with organized crime.  <br><br>As an anecdote,       my dad grew up on the border and when in the navy was in Tijuana often.   and he has many tales of Tijuana, always emphasizing what a great place it was when the mob ran it.  They really catered to the navy at that time.  <br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, of course. Like I said, the San Fernando massacre was a Zetas incident. You won't find these kind of events by other cartels. What I'm trying to say is that even by Cartel standards Zetas are much worse than the others (not trying to defend cartels). You're generalizing each cartel as the same, though there are differences, like there are differences in mafias, yakuzas, etc. Zetas are probably much like the Medellin cartel during the war between Escobar and the Colombian Government. For example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avianca_Flight_203" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avianca_Flight_203</a> <br>Most of the organized crime does not behave this way, say Mexico, Colombia, Italy, the US. I think the debate loses integrity when we generalize that all organized crime from an area is the sam, although all of the are scumbags.<br><br>Yeah, what you're referring to is the Caliente race track. Caliente is a gambling company in Tijuana, that has ties with the so called &quot;Atlacomulco Cartel&quot;. Although not a real Cartel is where most of the corrupt PRI Mexican Presidents came from, you should look into that if you like Alessio, is really interesting. And, yeah, Alessio is known as a great guy in Tijuana and really shady entrepreneur, but not to the point of the Italian Families.<br><br>And I completely agree that Alessio was good to Tijuana, but to my knowledge wasn't mafia that's why I said I didn't know anything about mafia in TJ. And, after the cocaine went to TJ, the city pretty much went to hell.    </p>		</li>

			<p>100 years is a tiny portion of the time the UK has been around, so it's not a long time. Whereas in 100 miles you can cover a huge portion of the entire country distance wise, so it's considered a long distance. The opposite is true for America.<br>Obviously, the unit of measurements are exactly the same but the frame of references are wildly different.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;it's driving only for like 3 hours.<br><br>There's your issue. <br><br>See, driving from New York to the tip of Florida takes about 14 hours to travel 1,100 miles. <br><br>Driving from the northern tip of Norway to the southern tip takes like 8-10 hours to travel 300 miles. <br><br>The difference is the lack of good highways for travel.

			<p>While that might be true to a certain extent, it's not really where the saying is from. Throughout most of Europe the highway system will be perfectly fine. It more has to do with the fact that if I go 100 miles in Europe I'm probably going to cross a border or traverse half a country, while in the U.S. it's a semi-normal trip.</p>		</li>

And its kind of known for Yakuza. I've met many of them and there is little to no crime here. Compared to america where the area the gangs are are the highest spikes in crime. I'm not sure if its &quot;Japanese honor&quot; or just because they are &quot;smarter&quot; but they know how to get authorities not to really have incentive to go after them hardcore. (i'm guessing the latter considering the despicable things they do). </p>		</li>

			<p>Actually, the Yakuza quite often protects from external threats as well. And they rarely do all too much damage to businesses. This varies by Gumi of course, but there is a concept called Ninjo that the yakuza love to talk up. Basically, Ninjo means something along the lines of protecting the people. It's why the Yakuza don't tend to allow thieves in their territory - it directly preys on innocent people. Many Yaks don't do a great job of actually keeping to Ninjo, but they like to brag about it a lot, and that keeps them from going too crazy. Even a street level thug who takes a hammer to a guy who won't pay protection is going to reflect badly on his superiors, and in the Yakuza that means you are losing another knuckle. Even if it's mostly for show, it's a show that brings loyalty and money in, so they put some degree of effort to not screwing with the illusion directly. <br><br>So yeah, you are paying to be protected from the Yakuza, but if some other punk starts screwing with a store that is protected by the Yakuza, the Yakuza are pretty well obligated to act. Ninjo says that they must protect their people, and if they don't act they look like they are too weak or incompetent to do what they said they would do. Neither is going to make the guys upstairs happy, so somebody is going to end up falling down a few flights of kicks and punches to the face. </p>		</li>

			<p>Ninjo does not mean anything like that. You might be thinking of giri which is the sense of social obligation to the benefit of Japanese society in which protecting your fellow business owners would fall under. It also explains why Yakuza are generally respected as a necessary part of society. Ninjo is the complete opposite of giri which is self interest above the interests of society. An example is falling in love with someone outside of your social class in feudal Japanese times and going for it even though it would be taboo. Hikkikomori are a good modern example as following their ninjo above their giri.</p>		</li>

			<p>The yakuza is similar to the Italian mafia.   The yakuza and the mafia do not kill or threaten the general public.   In fact they usually get support from the lowest classes.  In Tijuana, when the Italian mafia ran it in the sixties, it was generally safe as the mafia didn't tolerate American tourists being harmed .... Bad for business.  When they left, the Mexicans took over and it became dangerous.  <br><br>Mexican and Russian organized gangs are unusual in that their gangs get no support from the people and they kill police officers and government officials.     This is generally not true of the yakuza and the Italian mafia.</p>		</li>

			<p>I respectfully disagree, I binged watched the entire series a month or two ago and I enjoyed it quite a bit. I liked a few of the actors more than their American counterparts. Henry was way cooler than Hank, I liked Cielo more than Skyler, and preferred Maria to Marie. Even the ones that were very different were entertaining, in particular Jose Miguel (Jesse), Mario (Mike), and Saul Bueno. The guy that played Walt did a noble job, but the actor that played Gustavo never came close to Gus Fring. He wasn't bad, he just didn't do anything to elevate the role. Tuco and Hector didn't come close to the originals, and every time Walt Jr. was on the screen I wanted to punch him in the face.  <br>  <br>But still, I look it as an homage to the original, and if I spoke Spanish I think it would be amazing to have an adaptation in my native language. I think the key is to try not to male a direct comparison, but enjoy the differences and getting a different take on an incredible story. I would recommend that any BB fan at least give it a shot and decide for themselves.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not super unusual to refilm a successful movie or show for different audiences in order to adjust how the drama, comedy, or subtle nuances work according to different cultures.  I particularly think subs and dubs would do it, but for whatever reasons, it's not always done. <br><br>Let us keep in mind the following remakes across different countries: The Ring, The Grudge, Old Boy, Power Rangers, and the million versions of Ugly Betty. <br><br>Edit: let me add, it's rare for the remake to havr have the amazing amazingness of the original.

			<p>While I generally agree, you have to admit that due to grammatical/structural changes oftentimes a lot of intonation/emphasis in the actors' speech (and nuances of the native language) are lost on the audience when subtitles are used. Plus it's easy to lose out on a lot of visual design &amp; staging/directing/acting when you're constantly staring at the bottom of the screen. Makes me think of Pan's Labyrinth; I basically know the dialogue by heart at this point but I remember my first time watching it feeling frustrated having to choose between understanding the dialogue or appreciating the visuals. I personally enjoy multiple viewings but some people don't have the time/motivation and don't like the distraction.<br><br>(Also, reading speed != intelligence)</p>		</li>

			<p>That's fair. Far more people prefer English. They can always add a few foreign sentences to create an air of mystery/danger surrounding a specific character or the setting itself. For me, the aesthetic authenticity provided by the original language is worth whatever visual loss is incurred. I don't, however, watch nearly enough film to have a worthwhile critical opinion and entirely understand why english is substituted so frequently. I did not find myself struggling to pick up on the setting or other visual clues in Narco's, thoroughly spoiled by pause, rewind and excellent acting. In the end I did not feel like the tone was lost in translation. Being able to watch without reading was awesome; also rare. </p>		</li>

			<p>I agree, he went logically sideways. There is a difference in the code of conduct for these groups and it is probably environmental. The Italian mafia and most organized mafia like groups generally began as crime famalies with opposition views toward those in power. This then allied them with the poor, who are generally oppressed by those in power. Over time of course, these opposition groups sometimes end up in power or even used by or allied to their old enemies, who are now in power. Since power is where the money is, over time, even crime famalies and organizations gravitate to and are used by government (Power) organizations. Certain crime organizations are less centralized and are more brutal, but they generally operate in countries where the opposition is also brutal and deadly, in other words, this is an environmental adjustment by the criminals. If a criminal organization like the Italian mafia moves into an environment (like New York &amp; Chicago during Prohibition) ripe for their style of doing business, voila, great fortunes are made. The Mexican cartels will need to change tactics if pot is legalized, this will hurt their their income stream badly (66% down), and they will either topple, shrink, or evolve. I predict evolve and by that I mean they will get less violent. The yakuza, Italian mob, Euro mob, all operate with far fewer deaths than MS13, 18, the Mexicans and of course the South American gangs, all of which are more or less significantly more violent because of where they are (what the home government's rules of force and oppression are). Hoffa used mob muscle early in his unionizing because the police were corrupt, they ONLY protected the truck line owners and their property. When the unions got national power through the ballot box, they split from the mob (with the exception of the Teamsters) and rely much more on lawyers, laws and court rulings today than they do street muscle, EVEN the Teamsters, although that took a lot of government intervention.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, a lot of low income people in Mexico (and sometimes even high income people) praise the drug-lords like if they were some kind of heroes. This is kind of understandable when you have most people hating the high levels of corruption in government. Drug-lords are kind of &quot;beating the system&quot; from the perspective of these people, so they look upwards on cartels. Also, joining to a cartel sometimes is the best chance for a lot of young poor people to don't die from starving or to get out of poverty, so they kind of have a paternalistic sentiment towards some cartels.</p>		</li>

I believe Pablo Escobar used the phrase &quot;silver or lead&quot; (in Spanish of course) to explain what the deal was.

There were actual in person meetings between mafia and Italian politicians that the government tried to cover up.<br><br>It's not that bad anymore, but it's always been a problem in Italy that people felt like they couldn't rely on the police/govt, so they relied on the mafia instead (like you said, mafia is popular with the lowest classes and when you look at what the system was like, you can see why). Then the mafia got big enough that they made deals with the government, all the while fucking the whole country over.

			<p>Russia is also hard to understand, until you realize that the mafia <em>is</em> the government/business.  I mean, those Russian cop videos, yeah you are a criminal and get arrested, you're getting an ass-whooping on the spot.  A few kicks to the face/back of the neck, tied up on the sidewalk and getting stomped on a little bit...<br><br>I guess those guys didn't pay the right guys?<br><br>Also, how do Stop a Douchebag guys get away with it?  I know there's at least one Russian Bearded Giant among them, but how the hell do they just not get raided in their apartments etc?</p>		</li>

			<p>When I used to live in Boston the Italian mafia operated in the North End... Safe as hell, I could go walking at any time and my wife walked home at 2AM on many occasions by herself. As soon as the government cracked down the area isn't so safe anymore. Still mostly safe but a lot more crime is happening, and I can no longer walk around there at night.</p>		</li>

			<p>the protection is from &quot;accidents&quot; not other criminals.   if you dont pay your store will have an accident and burn down if you rebuild and still dont pay 3 cars full of guys will come to your store and you will have an &quot;accident&quot; where their baseball bats meet your ribs and legs.  Its not like they are a security service they are extortionists.</p>		</li>

The only &quot;negative influence&quot; they are protecting the people from is themselves. For all other minor things serious countries count on the police and the juridical system, not the mafia. It's extortion and racketeering, plain and simple.</p>		</li>

			<p>Thanks for that!<br><br>It's hard for Americans to understand.  Japan seems so basically decent, and frankly, tight-knit, it's hard to understand how Yakuza can operate with tattoos all over and acting like thugs.  Honestly I don't see why the Japanese don't get together and smash them with gardening tools and katanas.  I know that is essentially ignorant/racist, but it's hard to see in a country where people kill themselves for not passing a test or failing at a job project, or staying in the office 16 hours a day, or sleeping there, how they could tolerate a mafia.

			<p>Well considering that crime has fallen dramatically since the 1970s/1980s/early 90s when crime peaked, it's worked pretty well. Also the mafia was massive to the point where they were involved in federal politics (the mafia getting involved in the elections in Chicago to help JFK win in 1960). If you look at what they did to Southern Italy and what they continue to do it's pretty clear that it's not acceptable to &quot;tolerate&quot; organized crime if you want to live in a decent society without extreme corruption. </p>		</li>

			<p>easy answer. organized crime is infinitely worse. most of our street gang issues would go away with legalization and regulation of narcotics and the sex industry. as well as better access to education, living wage jobs and rehabilitation programs in impoverished neighborhoods. regardless, our violent crime rates have continued to drop dramatically, decade after decade, in no small part to the eradication of the mob and organized racqueteering. All you have to do is look at mexico to see how bad organized crime can get when you sit on your thumbs and do nothing.</p>		</li>

			<p>I know that's the popular image but it's not really true.  The Mob was/is extensively involved with the drug business.  During the 70's the American Italian mob partnered with the Sicilian mob to import massive quantities of heroin into the United States.  (See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza_Connection_Trial" target="_blank">Pizza Connection Case</a>).  <br><br>To be fair, there were mob bosses who officially didn't allow their underlings to traffic drugs.  But many of their underlings did anyway because of the huge amount of money they could make.  The bosses turned a blind eye to it as long as the underlings kicked a percentage upstairs and didn't get out of hand.  Paul Castellano of the Gambino family was a prime example of this.  He knew John Gotti, one of his top captains, was dealing drugs but he didn't do anything until John became a threat to him.  Then it was too late - Gotti acted first and took him out.<br><br>The reason the cartels took over the wholesale drug business is quite simply a matter of economics.  The Mob had a lock on heroin importation through their European cousins - heroin would be produced in Afghanistan, get smuggled through Turkey, the Sicilians would handle transport across the Mediterranean and the Atlantic and into the hands of their American cousins.  Sicilians had the geographical advantage here.  But later heroin production moved to the Golden Triangle in Asia, a region that the Sicilians do not control.  Also, starting in the 80's cocaine (and cracked) replaced heroin in popularity and that stuff grows in South America, allowing the Colombian cartels to become major players in the criminal underworld.<br><br>And now, the balance of power is moving to Mexican cartels.  My understanding is that the Colombian cartels fractured under intense American paramilitary pressure, and the survivors decided that it is safer to sell wholesale to the Mexicans and let them deal with importation and distribution inside the United States.  </p>		</li>

			<p>The U.S. basically sent the military against the Colombian cartels.  And put massive pressure on the Colombian government to crack down on cartel leaders like Pablo Escobar.  This worked in the sense that Escobar was killed and the big cartels broken up.  But smaller cartels continue to exist and cocaine production actually went up in Colombia and nearby countries.<br><br>The same thing is happening in Mexico now.  U.S. provides intelligence and monetary support to the Mexican government, which is then put under enormous pressure to break the cartels and arrest people like Chapo Guzman.</p>		</li>

			<p>Koreans aren't looked on as &quot;we Japanese&quot;; a lot, maybe most, trace their family back to the colonial days and WW2 when Koreans were used like virtual slaves and nasty jobs like prison guards. Even today, there is still a certain amount of prejudice against Koreans. Any Koreans in a Yakusa organization are probably going to be <em>very</em> low ranking guys used for dangerous stuff like smuggling women, drugs, and guns.  </p>		</li>

			<p>Would you like my sources? I wrote an extended essay (3,800+ word) paper on this in highschool and I still have all my drafts and my version of my final copy that I dug up in response to your question.<br><br>It's too long for me to retype out and I dont have it saved digitally anywhere. I'll type out the introduction which is only about a page. Then list my sources. Hope this helps :]<br><br>I apologize ahead of time for formatting. I rarely comment.<br><br><strong>Introduction</strong><br>Charles 'Lucky' Luciano was a legendary underworld figure. He, along with a number of other prominent Mafia leaders, rose to supreme power within the mob world in the United States. Translated as &quot;This Thing of Ours,&quot; 'La Cosa Nostra' was a loose organization of mobster families that came together under Lucianos' leadership prior to World War I and expanded to twenty-six families nationwide with the organizations' heart in New York. Represented within the Commission were the regional crime families: New York City, Buffalo, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles and Kansas City. The expansion of these families and their 'turf' was instrumental in advancing the objectives of La Cosa Nostra and in establishing an organized crime syndicate across the United States. Because of its expansion, La Cosa Nostra was able to hold several key footholds within a city's infrastructure without needing to branch out excessively in only one location to cover various stages of either racketeering, bootlegging or drug trafficking. These operations made Luciano well known among the people, newspaper and, most importantly, the government. [I think I left out a transition sentence here in this draft] The German U-boat harassment along the coast and the sabotage of the French-liner <em>Normandie</em> led the United States Naval Intelligence to believer that there were Nazi sympathizers operating in or near New York's docks. What American Intelligence failed to realize, after many failed attempts of infiltration, was that it was the New York Italian Mafia that ran everything in and out of the docks. Although Luciano was imprisoned at the time, his nickname soon paid off. The government came to him asking for his cooperation in securing the U.S. home front. With the incentive of significantly less jail time, Lucky soon agreed to lend his services. The success of the Mafia's collaboration was explicitly due to the mob's having access to a variety of sources, informants, fronts, transportation and, most importantly, <em>methods</em> the government lacked. <br><br>Sources that I used throughout the rest of the paper. <br><br>Campbell, Rodney. <em>The Luciano Project: The Secret Wartime Collaboration of the Mafia and the U.S. Navy.</em> New York: McGraw-Hill,1977.<br><br>Feder, Sid and Joachim Joesten. <em>The Luciano Story.</em> New York and Washington D.C.: Da Capo Press, 1994.<br><br>Gosch, Richard Hammer Martin A.. <em>The Last Testament of Lucky Luciano</em>. New York: Little Brown &amp; Co, 1975. (this one was a biography and very useful from what I remember)<br><br>Maas, Peter. <em>The Valachi Papers.</em>. New York: Bantam Books, 1972 (I may be remembering wrong but I think these were a combination of court room hearings and confessions from former mafia members?)<br><br>Newark, Tim. *Mafia Allies: The True Story of America's Secret Alliance with the Mob in World War II. 1st ed. ew York: Zenith Press, 2007. (this author was the most fascinating because he was mentioned in a History Channel documentary of conspiracy theories - which is how I chose my Extended Essay topic)<br><br>Let me know if you have any questions? Lol I've never done this before.<br><br>I should clarify that my abstract (which comes before my introduction) gives a more accurate scope of the investigation and purpose of the essay with respect to the prompt. The following is the first part of my abstract/ questions I investigate and answer by the end of the paper.<br><br>Was there a connection between the Mafia and its leader, Lucky Lucano, and the U.S. Office of Strategic Services during World War II as a result of the need to secure U.S. ports? Furthermore, to what extent was the noteworthy relationship between the U.S. OSS and La Cosa Nostra beneficial to the allied war effort in Sicily? </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;I'd rather equate it to 20th century mafia in USA.<br><br>First half or second half?<br><br>&gt;There was Italian mafia.

The Italian mafia <strong>did</strong> deal with drugs in the second half of the 20th century, especially hard drugs like heroin. The others probably filled that niche after a lot of them got arrested. Do you really think the Sicilian organizations did all of that by themselves and without the support and permission of their American counterparts?</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, there are countless examples in the US. The current situation in Chicago - with gangs so fractured and small that several gangs might have leadership present in a single high school, and members of a single neighborhood might have several warring gangs they have to choose from - comes largely from law enforcement having taken out the more monolothic gangs. </p>		</li>

			<p>I think the paradox is that when you allow this Pax Mafiosa and look-the-other-way mentality to continue, you're actually just allowing corruption to engrain itself systemically and erode the stability of your country and sovereignty of the government. You're not saving lives and property from gang violence, you're <em>deferring</em> it for later and the longer you defer the more damage is quietly being done. This is what happened with Mexico. The violence there isn't a product of uprooting the cartel presence, it's a direct product of allowing it to run quietly for so long. Japan is going down an extremely dangerous path by turning a blind eye to organized crime. Sometimes you have to bear the pain of sucking the poison out to prevent further infection, which is a sad and unfortunate state of affairs when it means unfairly affecting the lives of innocents.</p>		</li>

			<p>Same case for the Triads in Hong Kong. There's a tacit understanding between authorities and organized crime that as long as they don't mess with civilians, tourists or cause a fuss (other than drugs, gambling, prostitution and handling smuggling and stolen goods)  or hash out rivalries in public they won't get actively persecuted by police. This understanding goes back many decades and &quot;everyone&quot; seem very content with it.</p>		</li>

			<p>My Japanese teacher years ago was a female and not a member of but was involved with Yakuza members (it's a lot easier to get out if you are an older female).  She said especially in recent years, there is an unspoken agreement between the police and the Yakuza, in that &quot;the Yakuza keeps out the drugs and guns.  In turn, the police turn a blind eye to semi-gambling and prostitution&quot;.  The Yakuza is semi-legitimate now especially with pachinko parlors, etc.  They make a lot more money doing that and have no threat of arrest.  They used to have much more power but have slowly but surely losing power and influence.  </p>		</li>
