			<p>My man's brother got him started on this, but I find nothing is funnier than when someone is really trying to focus on their obnoxious breathing, and here I come giggling until I can barely stand anymore.  It started this back and forth non stop laughter war that neither of us really wanted to win after our stomachs started hurting.  I guess after practicing for only a few days, his brother was able to feel a rush of warmth go through his body.  I don't know what his progress is like, a month or two later...</p>		</li>
