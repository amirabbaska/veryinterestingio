			<p>The feet and legs still have fat on them. I remember when I did a clinical in an ER, this girl came in with a nasty gash that cut through the entire dermis and into the fat layer on her shin. She was very thin preteen and you don't normally think of fat being on your shin, but it was there. Add in an animal's fur (they get a longer, fluffier coat in winter) and their naturally higher core body temperature, it's easier for them to not get as cold. </p>		</li>
