			<p>The legend goes that there was a Scottish giant, who challenged the Irish Hero Fionn Mac Cumhaill to a fight, Fionn builds the Causeway so they can fight on equal grounds, but runs away when he sees the size of the giant. As is typical in Irish legends Fionn then outsmarts the giant by dressing up as a baby and pretending to be his own son. When the giant sees the baby he infers that Fionn must be even more enormous than himself to have such a huge child and fees back to Scotland, destroying the causeway as he goes.</p>		</li>

			<p>Probably related to the fact that when initially starting a research project this is what you have to do. Want money to study something? Better write up a detailed proposal discussing what we do and don't know even though you've never studied this before. This has been perhaps the most mind-boggling part of being a scientist for me so far (I'm a grad student): you go from no knowledge to teaching it in next to no time and it's really easy to feel like a fraud.</p>		</li>

			<p>I used to work in the lab of a company that produced fats and oils. In the processes of analyzing these materials there would often be small amounts left in beakers which would often set up (solidify), if their freezing point was at room temperature or below. These fats were much purer than you would see in a natural material, often a single compound.  As they froze, different materials would produce different patterns, some of them quite beautiful. I remember one that produced a pattern of small concentric circles. Someone should do a study of all the different patterns.</p>		</li>

			<p>How odd. I just happen to be vacationing in Northern Ireland (highly recommend it), and it just happen to visit Giant's Causeway today (highly recommend it). <br><br>Question: I'm from Washington State. Our east half of the state has columnar basalts as well. The columns in Washington are typically about 3 ft in diameter. The columns at Giant's Causeway are about half that diameter. I assume this is either the result of different geochemistry or different rates of cooling. Do you know which is the cause? </p>		</li>

			<p>Appealing explanation. The CLT doesn't apply here though.<br><br>It's true that aggregate statistics will converge to a normal distribution. So if you sum up the distances between neighboring cells (to get an aggregate), and repeat the experiment many times (to see how that aggregate is distributed), you will see a normal distribution.<br><br>But within a single experiment, the distance between a single pair of neighboring cells isn't a sum of many random things. (though you could say that it is something like the minimum of many random things.)<br><br>We can see through simulations that Voroni diagrams of randomly placed points look far from regular hexagonal. <a href="http://math.jccc.net:8180/webMathematica/JSP/mmartin/vorplotrand.jsp" target="_blank">http://math.jccc.net:8180/webMathematica/JSP/mmartin/vorplotrand.jsp</a></p>		</li>

			<p>It does apply to the average. And you can make very good predictions about the average distance between centers using the CLT. The thing is that when we look at the coconut oil and notice that the contractions look evenly spaced, we're not observing the average distance between points, but the spread of distances around the average. Somehow that spread is very small. The individual data points are all pretty close to their average.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;normally distributed (everyone close to an average, with just some deviants).<br><br>Agree with the comment that the CLT isn't appropriate here... Also the normal distribution is not characterized by &quot;everyone close to an average, with just a few deviants&quot;, unless we use a strange definition of &quot;close&quot;. Sure, in a normal distribution 68.26% of items will be within +/- 1 standard deviation of average, but that standard deviation could be enormous (even infinite)-- depending on what we are discussing -- distributions of planets in solar systems, for example.  Saying that all planets are close to the average distance away doesn't work.  Similarly, incomes in the US are normal (if we take the log of all of the values), but not everyone's income is &quot;close&quot; to average, even on a log scale, when one takes into account what these numbers mean.</p>		</li>

			<p>Because a lot of liquid foodstuffs are  emulsions and heating-cooling has a tendency to separate components of emulsions: the watery parts sink and the oily part moves up and, that prevents the needed stability to create the structured cooling seen here. <br>Even without the liquid being an emulsion, you do need a certain purity of the liquid: a different blend of fats will have some hardening at different temperatures and not being able to create the regular shapes seen here. Add in sugar, salt, and other compounds and you'll find it near impossible to get that shape as your liquids cool.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; When a material contracts due to temperature differences, it can create significant stress, as exemplified with this hot Pyrex measuring cup being quickly cooled with cold water, and shattering[3] because of the stress induced quickly cooling.<br><br>You missed a very important component here. The stress is induced by a difference in temperature across the material. So like in your pyrex demonstration, the cold water is causing the hot pyrex surface to contract, but the internal temperature of the pyrex is still hot and not contracting. The stress arises from this miss-match in temperature and thus the density of the material. Internal hot glass wants to be large, surface wants to be small ... ipso facto the thing shatters.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm sure it's not related to heat, but some of the geometric reasons are the same. <br><br>If you want to fill a flat vertical surface with precious honey, you could just cover it evenly - but it would drip so you need support. So you create little wax containers to prevent that - presumably at the largest possible size where the honey doesn't leak out. You would want to use a shape that tesselates or else you would waste space between them. Of all the tessellating shapes, hexagons have the lowest perimeter/area ratio, so they use the least material to cover the same surface.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm curious if these patterns form when reforming back into a solid, per the whole sheet contraction example you've shown.<br><br>The silt/clay sediment on lake beds form this same polygonal configuration upon drying.  The upper surface drys at a faster rate than the deeper portions so the cracks are wider at the top as the soil dehydrates.  I've witnessed these cracks running well over 3 meters deep during a drought. <br><br>As an aside, walking across those &quot;pillars&quot; was the stuff of nightmares.  Each one would fail deep underground where it was still damp as I stepped upon them. They would sag and lean into the neighboring pillar if I paused on them even for a brief moment. When they did, the gap on one side large enough to fall into. I self-rescued by staying in motion and hopping from pillar to pillar in a wide arc back to more stable pillars. </p>		</li>

			<p>Great answer. I am not so admirable, so I won't go into much depth, but I would like to add to your point that the direction of cooling dictates the direction of columnar jointing. <br><br>Typically, the direction of the thermal gradient (the vector normal to the isothermal contours) remains  constant over time with cooling, giving straight columns.  However, there are times where that is not the case! In that case, the 'columns' are curved, and reveal some rather explicit information about the cooling history of that geologic formation! It literally shows you path of the isothermal contour which marked the temperature at which the tensile stress overcame the tensile strength of the rock. Incredible.<br><br>example:<br><a href="http://40.media.tumblr.com/e91f7183446180e4ec89e891dd42baa6/tumblr_mt70egzlEb1su9pcao1_1280.jpg" target="_blank">http://40.media.tumblr.com/e91f7183446180e4ec89e891dd42baa6/tumblr_mt70egzlEb1su9pcao1_1280.jpg</a><br><br>[edit] another excellent example: <a href="https://tau0.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/devils_tower_hdr_01.jpg" target="_blank">https://tau0.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/devils_tower_hdr_01.jpg</a><br>One of the really neat aspect of seeing this kind of thing is it says something about where sources of heat might have been, forcing the curvature of the isotherms. e.g. magma bodies intruding into the crust.</p>		</li>

			<p>Because coconut oil is not one substance, but is a mixture of 6 main components plus some &quot;other stuff&quot;.  When a mixture either boils or freezes, different parts of the mixture will boil/freeze at different temperatures. Saturated fatty acids will solidify at higher temperatures than the unsaturated.  Typical coconut oil is around 90% saturated, leaving the 10% or so that you'd have to cool down further to solidify.

			<p>This hexagonal packing is not due to convection. The temperature of the oil in the entire jar changes ~adiabatically with the ambient temperature. At no point is there a vertical temperature gradient inside of the jar that is high enough to drive convective instabilities such as Rayleigh-Bénard. In addition, the hypothesis that the temperature difference between shelf and jar drive the convection is impossible. That would require a heat flux similar to the amount required to boil a unit volume of water. Thankfully, I've never worried about my shelves boiling things on accident. </p>		</li>

			<p>No, the columnar jointing is formed differently - through freezing and contraction at the edge of a body of magma. The magma is emplaced, with a flow that doesn't influence this jointing feature, then cools and solidifies - but not all at once. The edge in contact with the colder rock solidifies first, and contracts a bit, like the drying mud. Those roughly  hexagonal cracks form, but initially very short ones. Then the magma further from the cold rock solidifies, contracts, and the hexagonal cracks propagate in that direction: perpendicular to the surface of cooling (the contact between magma and cold rock). So it comes down to cooling patterns rather than flow. No idea if this is related to how the coconut situation in the OP though, besides geometry.</p>		</li>

			<p>Basalt does flow but it isn't in geometric patterns and as it cools it is mostly just hanging out - generally speaking, it's an amorphous pile of goo (also chunks of solid pieces of itself and other stuff that it has picked up) at the time of emplacement and once a flow stops flowing it's already thickening and the odds are stacking against any mobilization in the parts of the column that end up being the most jointed (the top and bottom). <a href="https://exploringthearth.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/columnar_jointing.png" target="_blank">Here is a diagram.</a><br><br>The columns form as the flow cools and it does so from the outside inward. Area-wise, the top and bottom of the flow are the biggest and so those planes (yes, i know, they're not really planes) will cool at the quickest rates. As they cool, their volume decreases, and so the basalt needs to crack (form joints) in order to compensate for the space. Since rates of cooling are quickest on the tops and bottoms, the cracks propagate from the top and bottom toward the middle of the flow. You can see evidence of this in the way that basalt columns are emplaced with 3 distinct zones (top an bottom are well jointed and the inside is less-so because it's insulated - <a href="https://exploringthearth.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/columnar_jointing.png" target="_blank">Here's that diagram again.</a>). <br><br>With that said, there IS fluid migration during cooling in some lava flows.

			<p>Very hot indeed.  However, lava is not very comparable to simple organic fluids.  For one, the temperature different between the lava next to the air and the lava next to the ground was MUCH greater.  Like, a crap-ton.  A heat wave here on the surface changes the temperature by maybe 10 or 15C.  Lava, however, is a lot hotter than the air, and so the surface lava looses heat quickly, driving convection.  The oils are like 10C hotter, and just sort-of sit on top of the slightly less dense oils under them.  Slightly as in around 0.05 g/cm^3 less dense.  </p>		</li>

			<p>As you increase the number of sides of regular polygons, they become a better approximation of a circle. Hexagons are the polygon with the highest number of sides that can tile a plane.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is only speculation, but the Rayleigh Benard convection could play a role in local stress concentrations atop the solidifying fatty acids. That coupled with the discussion above, but not alone, could help explain the honeycomb structure.</p>		</li>

			<p>When I was in Thailand, I went to an alternative medicine place that literally sold snake oil among other things (long story, we knew it was nonsense).  One of the demonstrations they gave was to mix [their brand of] honey in water and observe that it formed these honeycomb structures.  They told us that this was how you can tell that it was &quot;pure&quot; honey.  Were they just feeding us a line of BS?</p>		</li>

			<p>Not a specialist in geology (yet), just a lazy student. The breaking into 3 shards is simply the most efficient stress relief, I don't know the math behind it. But if you look at mud cracks they will also show this phenomenon, and basalt like you mentioned. This is also observed in larger scale stress relief like the breaking of plates above hotspots. If you look at the way the plates break at hotshots it's always a 3 way break. (But usually one piece breaks out first leaving the other crack inactive). The Pentagon structure is simply the result of the angles of the cracks. Edit: no doubt this can be found on the Internet but it's 3 am and I sleep<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Great read, I wish this sub allowed tipping.<br><br>The only thing I'd add is that whole-sheet contraction is less likely because of local stresses induced by the heat flow (layers of different density), and that it's just not possible for larger sheets because the stress increases with the distance to the center of contraction. I found that thought helpful.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;It should be noted that hexagonal packing in 2D is the most efficient, hence it tends to be a natural default.<br><br>I had to pause for a second wondering why this is the case. For instance, why not squares? <em>Humans</em> tend to pack things in boxes, analogously squares, even when doing 2D packing.<br><br>First, we should note that there are only three tilings of regular convex polynomials (i.e. &quot;basic shapes&quot;) and we can rule out other shapes without much thought, in the general case.<br><br>So that leaves us with triangles, squares, and hexagons, and some unknown metric of &quot;efficient&quot;. A pretty good metric, most can argue, is to maximize the area for a given perimeter. We want to pack as much as we can using as little material as possible.<br><br>Well, it's not hard to show that for n-gons of a fixes perimeter, the area grows with n (showing us that a circle is the &quot;most efficient&quot; standalone shape), so the more sides, the better.<br><br>Of our three shapes, hexagons have the most sides. Thus they are the most efficient.</p>		</li>

			<p>Maybe I'm missing something, but after reading through your post and links, I'm still confused as to why material cools at equidistant distances. What causes that? I'd think it would cool fastest closest to wherever the heat sink is. Second, why does this create hexagons and not, say, squares? Is it just a nature of the geometry of where a set of equidistant points are set, relative to each other?</p>		</li>

			<p>very interesting, I thought surely this was caused by some crystaline structure in the oil, because it was heated and cooled at extremely slow rates - conditions that are usually optimal for growing different metal crystals like bismuth, tin, and &quot;solder hairs&quot; from certain lead alloys. Why do you suppose it contracted to a hexagonal shape instead of solid? Is the surface tension against the inside of the container too great to allow a uniform release from the container?<br><br>Awesome answer!</p>		</li>

			<p>That is fantastic to know. Coconut oil melts all 76 f so Mine tends to either crystallize or honeycomb and I've noticed it tends to be related to how fast it melts and cools. I wonder if that has to do with various densities and fatty acids and the way they melt and solidify. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; the centres of contraction (when localized) will be equally-spaced, resulting in a Voronoi diagram [...] - if the centres are all equally spaced, the Voronoi diagram will be packed hexagons [...]<br><br>I'll disagree with the implied causality :<br><br><em> centres of contraction does not need to be equally-spaced to result in a Voronoi diagram.
