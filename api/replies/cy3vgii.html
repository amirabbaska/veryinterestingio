			<p>Well, to be fair, due to length contraction, from the POV of the person on the ship, they kind of <em>are</em> travelling faster than light, although only under a <em>very</em> naive notion of velocity - in other words, because lengths are contracted, you can cover more distance than you would be able to otherwise just because of your velocity. If you are travelling fast enough, you could make it to the center of the Milky Way Galaxy within your life time (let's say 20 years), but everyone else would still see it as you taking a really, <em>really</em> long time such that even though you could return back to Earth in your  60s (assuming you left in your 20s), everyone would be long, <em>long</em> dead.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's because of the way velocities scale. At low velocities that are only small percentages of the speed of light, velocities behave like that. That is what is called the Newtonian Limit, because it's the realm wherein physics behaves classically as Newton described it. But as you continue to go up in speed, this no longer holds.<br><br>Before I mentioned that as you go up in speed you have to start scaling by a multiplicative factor (gamma, which is itself dependent on the velocity you are travelling at). At low velocities this gamma is very small and thus reduces to, essentially, the normal velocity. This means that 20 + 20 = 40. However, as you get closer and closer to c, gamma changes drastically and scales much more meaningfully, so that 0.9c + 0.9c =/= 1.8c, but something in the realm of 0.99blah*c - in short, because of this, the only way to get to c is to input infinite energy. And since you require infinite energy to just get to c, it's ridiculous to talk about anything above c.</p>		</li>

			<p>No. First of all, they couldn't be travelling at c, so let's just say they are travelling <em>near</em> c. Each person would see themselves as being &quot;stationary&quot; (in an inertial frame), with the other ship moving away from them at a given velocity less than c. The velocity addition formulas would give you the relative velocities from the POV of either ship.<br><br>You can find them using <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/relativ/einvel2.html" target="_blank">these equations</a>.<br><br>Both ships, however, would also experience length contraction along the axis travel. Meaning that if the ships were travelling in opposite directions along the same line, they would see the distance between them as being shorter than an outside observer would.<br><br>To travel faster than c would violate the postulates of Special Relativity, and thus would not be possible (well, technically it <em>would</em> be possible, but that would mean that SR is internally inconsistent and thus wrong, and all evidence we have points to this postulate being right and SR being right).<br><br>So one has to keep in mind that the universe does not work linearly. Velocities do not work linearly like you are used to unless you are moving relatively slow. As you increase in velocity, however, you have to start scaling them by a multiplicative factor (the gamma you see in Lorentzian transformations). This seems to be an intrinsic property of space, and honestly, it seems kind of magical until you have some understanding of General Relativity, where it becomes clear that that's really just a result of how space behaves and the metric (which, in short, tells you how a space behaves) used in Special Relativity.</p>		</li>

			<p>That's the whole point of an inertial frame. In an inertial frame, there is no real difference between being at rest and travelling at a constant velocity, so any internal observer can only really assume that they are at rest. Because the laws of physics behave exactly the same in inertial frames as they would otherwise, it's an easy simplification to make.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're mixing reference frames, dividing the traveler's time by the observer's distance to get a &quot;faster than light&quot; velocity. You're not technically wrong, but be careful you don't confuse people who might interpret your statement as &quot;something can appear to travel faster than light from the right reference frame&quot; (which is wrong; ignoring the expansion of space for now).</p>		</li>

			<p>As I said, you're not really travelling faster than light. This is why I commented on how this only holds under a very naive interpretation of velocity (distance/time as if we were in some universal frame - both of which are kind of false, especially at relativistic velocities). <br><br>For a traveler with knowledge of the distance between two points, it <em>seems</em> that way from the POV of the person travelling because you are covering what would, for an outside observer, be much more distance than one would think possible. Of course, from the frame of the person on the ship, this is not what is happening as what's actually happening is length contraction making your path shorter. And, of course, to the outside world, your journey is actually taking thousands/millions/billions of years due to the effects of time dialation.</p>		</li>

			<p>Basically, everything is always going the same speed, which is c. However, there are two axes of movement that they travel through, time and space. If you have mass, you're mostly moving through time, and aren't going very fast though space. Light has no mass, and so it's moving entirely through space and not at all through time (from it's own perspective), which is why it appears to be traveling at exactly c. When you move faster and faster, moving closer and closer to c, you need to change from moving mostly through time to going mostly through space. If you could move at the speed of light, then you wouldn't be moving at all in time. You wouldn't be able to accelerate further in space, because that would require moving backwards in time - currently believed to be impossible.</p>		</li>

			<p>The don't cause the blue glow of nuclear reactors but they can do something similar.  ICECUBE is neutrino detector buried in the Antarctic ice.  It's a series a detector nodes and it's huge,  like kms deep and across.  Neutrinos are very hard to detect themselves as they don't interact with &quot;normal&quot; stuff. ICECUBE detects the radiation given of when a high energy neutrino passes through the ice at a speed faster than light through that medium.  When one passes through the detectors can &quot;see&quot; and we can determine the energy and direction of the particle based on the &quot;sonic boom&quot; it creates of radiation.  And they detect some very high energy particles.  Energies that would make the LHC at CERN embarrassed.</p>		</li>
