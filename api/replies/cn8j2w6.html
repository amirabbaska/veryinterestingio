			<p>While there is some breading, Apples have been cloned alot. Thats the only reason everyone in the US can get a granny-smith. If you plant the seeds from one apple, the resulting trees will be different.<br>  <br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny_Smith" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granny_Smith</a><br><br>&gt; However, apples are genetic hybrids that produce new genetic variations in their seedlings. Because the Granny Smith is a chance (and rare) mutation, the seeds of the apple when grown tend to produce a tart green apple with a much less appealing taste. To preserve the exact genetic variation cutting and grafting are required. Thus, like the Navel orange and the Cavendish banana, all the Granny Smith apples grown today are cuttings from the original Smith tree in Sydney. <br>  <br>So 100% apples are far better than wild ones. But, they're simply clones of what could be naturally produced in the wild.</p>		</li>

			<p>yes.  I talked to a grower at the Santa Monica farmer's market and their produce was distinctively more flavorful (not necessarily sweeter, but it just tasted more like the fruit itself if that makes sense).  They said that they grew their orchard in a distressed manner, meaning that they watered it very little but that the land had a decent water table and this forced the trees to get their water from deep down in the earth.  The fruit are smaller and fewer but of more intense quality.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's actually the opposite:    <br><br> Animals eat fruit and defecate tree seeds contained within. They are more likely to choose sweeter fruit, so fruits are generally sweet.

			<p>Yup. Plants can collect so much fruit or grain that they fall over. In rice and wheat, that's referred to as &quot;lodging.&quot; There are many causes to lodging, and hybridizing has improved the ability of these crops to withstand wind by increasing stiffness, but ultimately high-producing cultivars are still more susceptible to lodging.<br><br>The same thing could also be true of a fruit tree, just to give an example. If you were to have a particularly bountiful year and a given apple tree were to be laden with fruit and it collapsed during a wind storm, would it be attributed to the mass of the fruit? The wind storm? Insufficient pruning?<br><br>So, while not directly attributable to physiological effects of carbohydrate storage, accumulating too much fruit or grain could ultimately cause the plant to fail, i.e.: collapse, die, or otherwise drop its fruit or grain so that it could not reproduce.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm interested in a response to this. Would a fruit bearing plant that had a large starch reserve produce a sweeter or more bitter fruit?

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/blacksheep998" target="_blank">blacksheep998</a>
			<p>Mostly unrelated.<br><br>Sweetness of a fruit is usually related to how much of the carbohydrates in the fruit are sugars vs how much are starches.<br><br>Plants build up starch reserves in fruit as an incentive for animals to eat it and, hopefully, transport the seeds some distance away. But if an animal eats the fruit before the seeds are ready then it's a waste.<br><br>So plants keep the carbohydrates in fruit locked up as starches until the seeds are mature. Then they release enzymes to break the starches down into sugars and the fruit becomes sweet. This breakdown of starches also helps to soften the fruit and make it easier to eat.<br><br>Often there are unpalatable chemicals like tannins in the fruit as well, which also break down when the fruit becomes ripe.<br><br>Exactly how much starch breaks down into sugar and how much of the unpalatable chemicals leave is dependent on genetics. The varieties of fruit we cultivate have been selected to maximize these traits. Wild fruits have tons of variation, and even plants of the same species growing under identical conditions can have very different tasting fruit.</p>		</li>

			<p>So in this sense, a perennial plant that had a larger starch store would have a better chance of surviving drought/winter and potentially have a more kickstarted spring season the following year? </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WRCousCous" target="_blank">WRCousCous</a>
			<p>Just about. Perennial and annual plants of the same type (i.e., perennial bunch-grasses (<em>Pseudoroegneria spicata</em>) vs. winter annual grasses (<em>Bromus tectorum</em>) have different reproductive/survival strategies: perennial's invest a greater amount of resources into somatic tissues (roots, stem, leaves) than annual counterparts; annuals invest a greater amount of resources into making seeds. Perennials often also have more seed dormancy than annual competitors.<br><br>For example, bluebunch wheatgrass may produce 10 seeds per plant per year, but may live for 5-6 years. It's total lifetime reproductive output might be similar to cheatgrass, but cheatgrass may produce 50 seeds per generation in the same environmental conditions.<br><br>Winter annuals germinate in the fall, go dormant (usually) over the winter, and then really take off in the spring (your 'kickstarting' notion). Perennials often go dormant during late summer, 'wake up' with rain and cooler temperatures in the fall, and also get going fast in the spring. So, generally, the survival value of storing energy in the somatic tissues of the plant are more about long-term reproductive strategy than overwintering. Many perennial grasses in the American West are, on the other hand, <em>very</em> drought resistant for some of the reasons you mention (stored energy, ability to go dormant, and also highly dormant seeds).<br><br>More on annual vs. perennial plants can be found <a href="http://www.livescience.com/33266-whats-the-difference-between-annual-and-perennial-flowers.html" target="_blank">at this link</a>, although it is more interested in flowers for landscaping than ecology or biological principles :)</p>		</li>

			<p>It would be able to produce a LARGER fruit, or MORE fruit, but the composition of the fruit would be largely unaltered. The plant isn't just going to throw extra sugar in a fruit when that fruit's composition has been fine tuned by evolution, and an extra sweet fruit would not spread seeds as effectively. We &quot;civilized&quot; humans may have a sweet tooth but animals do not, they are after nutrients of which sugar is only one and the complex organic molecules from fruit are more important. </p>		</li>

			<p>Ok, so when plants are deprived of nutrients/energy they make lower quality fruit.

			<p>Yes, when mutant plants can't move their carbon it builds up in the tissue and causes the tissue to become chlorotic (sort of dead, and without chlorophyl.) I know someone who works with maize mutants called &quot;Tie Dye&quot; that are deficient in moving carbon. The chlorotic sectors become very stressed and also produce anthocyanin, a purple pigment. These plants look pretty cool, but tend to have issues with producing good ears and tassels because they have trouble feeding those tissues. Generally these mutants are sterile when homozygous (two copies of the messed up gene, no copies of a working gene.)<br><br>Here's something about it.<br><br><a href="http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/142/4/1511.full" target="_blank">http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/142/4/1511.full</a></p>		</li>

			<p>There may be a more closely analogous example for plants getting fat than their storage of carbohydrates like starch. As you pointed out, plants and humans both store carbohydrates, we use glycogen while plants use a starch is a great example of this. <br><br>Plants also store fat, the same as we store fat in adipose tissue. Indeed, plants store lipids for many of the same reasons that we do, including the energy density, insulating properties, and duration of stability. Also, much like humans, there are reasons why carbohydrates would stop being stored and fats would begin being stored instead; specific metabolic requirements and indications of a requirement for long-term storage (in humans, long periods of inactivity with abundant calories).<br><br>For an example of a plant getting fat, we can look at <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.22807/abstract;jsessionid=7D86E4C15CF27D363D4A362A609F1F33.f04t02?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;amp;userIsAuthenticated=false" target="_blank">starch inhibited mutants</a>:<br><br>&gt;We discovered that a dramatic increase in neutral lipid content and the neutral lipid/total lipid ratio occurred among the mutants under high light and nitrogen starvation<br><br>Specific conditions can induce particular varieties of plants to overproduce lipid <em>in relation to stored starch</em>. We could compare this to a person with an over abundance of adipose because they do not regularly use and cycle glycogen stores. When the organism senses that carbohydrate storage is or will be inefficient, biological pathways are opened to facilitate long-term storage of high energy molecules. Indeed, we might remark that this plant 'has become fat' after a period of time, in the same way we would as humans, because:<br><br>&gt;However, some growth impairment was observed in the low starch and starchless mutants, possibly due to altered energy partitioning in PSII, with more excitation energy dissipated as heat and less to photochemical conversion.<br><br>The high-lipid storage individuals express physical deformations, as well as growth deficiencies. The plant suffers from an imbalance in the lipid/carbohydrate storage balance, several mechanisms are proposed for why this damage occurs.<br><br><strong>tl;dr</strong>: plants store fat as well, but I may have taken this question too literally.<br><br></p>		</li>

			<p>That has to do with the energy density of the molecule stored. fat/oil gives ~9 cal per gram and carbs give ~4 cal per gram. So for a seed to start off with as much energy as it possibly can, with a limited amount of space, its much better to start off with a fat within the seed, rather than a carb. As for an analogy . . . maybe filling your car up with low octane vs. high octane gas, where the high octane will give much better performance, while at a higher cost, and the low octane will give less performance, at a cheaper and easier cost.</p>		</li>

The body processes our food into energy through <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cellular+respiration+proteins&amp;amp;espv=2&amp;amp;biw=1600&amp;amp;bih=785&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;imgil=SX6zoViJGgu5XM%253A%253BssgOh_shEbNX3M%253Bhttp%25253A%25252F%25252Fprezi.com%25252F_xv9fukftjmj%25252Fbig-idea-2%25252F&amp;amp;source=iu&amp;amp;pf=m&amp;amp;fir=SX6zoViJGgu5XM%253A%252CssgOh_shEbNX3M%252C_&amp;amp;usg=__ypGm_g8gkURyH3mA90flel_h7PM%3D&amp;amp;ved=0CEsQyjc&amp;amp;ei=O8yhVJPsOMShNuCagogJ#facrc=_&amp;amp;imgdii=_&amp;amp;imgrc=faEoLB9gXDgX1M%253A%3BhVxiR9v02WXkiM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fbio1151.nicerweb.com%252FLocked%252Fmedia%252Fch09%252F09_20Catabolism-L.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fbio1151.nicerweb.com%252FLocked%252Fmedia%252Fch09%252Fcatabolic.html%3B416%3B600" target="_blank">the same pathway, whether fat, protein, or carbohydrate!</a> They each just enter this cycle at different points.<br><br>Essentially, cellular respiration is used to derive energy from all three macronutrients. Fats and proteins are all broken down into intermediates of cellular respiration, and then enter the cycle directly to eventually lead to energy.<br><br>Gaining (or losing weight) is just a function of thermodynamics. If I expend less energy than I put in, that extra energy has to be conserved. Our bodies primarily conserve energy by creating and storing fat in adipose tissue. Likewise, if I expend more energy than I consume, that extra energy has to come from somewhere because energy must be conserve. Then, our body will break down our stores of fat and provide energy to fill the difference. When it comes to losing or gaining weight, it is important to account for what we call Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), which is how much energy our body expends on keeping us alive. Homeostatic processes (maintaining fluid balance, temperature, brain activity, everything) are biochemical processes which require energy - lots of it.<br><br>For example, my BMR is about 2000 kcal/day (8368000 Joules, equal to about <strong><em>twice the energy of 1kg of TNT exploding, and around the ballpark of the kinetic energy of an armor-piercing tank round</em></strong> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_%28energy%29" target="_blank">source, interesting to read!</a>)). If I eat 3000 calories, 2000 will be used by my body to stay alive. The other 1000 will be stored as fat. If I went swimming and burned 500 calories, only 500 calories will be stored as fat.</p>		</li>

			<p>The 4,000 would be stored. It takes a while for food to digest, up to three days. In that time, most bioavailable calories will be metabolized and turned into energy or stored.<br><br>In fact, most of your poop is water; the rest is roughly equal parts dead bacteria, indigestible matter (cellulose and the like), and miscellaneous amounts of live bacteria and mucus and other things.<br><br>The inverse is not true however; if you fast for a LONG period of time, your body becomes more efficient at using what energy it has stored, and your BMR goes down (although by a small amount only, until you run out of fat reserves).<br><br><br>Basically, the more calories you eat, the more that are stored. The fewer calories you eat, the more your energy reserves (in order: currently digesting food, glycogen, fat) are burned until they are consumed, at which point the body aggressively conserves energy.</p>		</li>

			<p>potatoes are not fruits/seeds and do not nurture any offspring. Rather than that the appendages of the plant that connect to the potato are extensions of the plant stem. The starch stored in a potato really is primarily for the plant itself in the same way body fat is only for you, but plant biology also allows separated potatoes grow into full new plants (that are genetically the same). The actual fruits of potatoes with the true seeds kind of look like tomatoes (and are not consumable because of toxicity, hence why you never see it in any fruits section).<br><br>Other examples are carrots (which are starch deposits around the roots of the actual plant) and onions.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm surprised I haven't seen someone say this yet, but plants can reduce their rate of photosynthesis in response to having too much sugar/starch. Essentially,  they can stop eating. <br><br>As others have pointed out, this regulation of photosynthesis can be disrupted and plants can be bred to store energy in ways that would hurt them in the wild. But plants generally don't make an excess of sugar/starch that is unhealthy to themselves. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11457898" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11457898</a><br><br>I'd also like to mention that plants can be grown in solutions of sugar and still look like normal plants. They could absorb all the sugar they want, but they don't get &quot;obese&quot;. For the curious, you can kill a plant by giving it so much sugar that the sugar draws water out of the plant. </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/johnlennin" target="_blank">johnlennin</a>
			<p>They can also turn down photosynthesis when there is too much light. So they are not being &quot;forcefed&quot; by a strong sun. In fact, for most plants, the intensity of the sun in the morning is the most they ever need. Too much light going through the photosynthetic system is actually very damaging, kind of like a sunburn, so they have to shut everything down and disperse all that energy into heat rather than into more dangerous forms like high energy electrons, etc. </p>		</li>

			<p>More properly, complex organisms store energy as polymers because it reduces the molar concentration of solutes in the cell, and consequently osmotic pressure, which would otherwise cause the cell to burst.<br><br>In other words: entropy wants the concentrationd of molecules to be the same inside as outside the cell. Since large polar molecules like sugars can't cross through the membrane surrounding the cell, water comes into the cell, which swells from the increasing volume of fluids and bursts. Plants don't suffer from this problem in the same way that animals do, because they have a cell wall, which does a really good job of resisting osmotic pressure. Plants can therefore have much higher sugar concentrations in their &quot;bodily fluids&quot; than animals: sap is noticeably sweet, blood isn't.</p>		</li>

			<p>It isn't necessarily a problem of how many molecules we can store, but rather a problem of efficiency. Glycogen is concentrated in muscle and liver cells. The tighter that sugar (energy) can be packed into these cells, the more energy we can store without an increase in size. Increased size on a macroscopic scale will require more nutrients and subsequently more &quot;effort&quot; on the part of the body to maintain that size, and as a consequence of evolution, nature is &quot;lazy&quot; and aims to maximize efficiency.<br><br>Additionally, the breakdown of glucose to energy is catalyzed by enzymes in the process of cellular respiration. Glycogen is basically a single giant molecule (though it consists of smaller molecules bonded covalently), and an enzyme will not be able to metabolize it because enzymes are very specific as to what they can accept as a substrate. Essentially, storing glucose as glycogen allows for another point of regulation as you stated. Indeed, enzymes are the site of all regulation in the body. We can regulate how much energy is resolved from sugar not only by how quickly we metabolize sugar, but also by how much sugar we free for metabolism.<br><br>Essentially, having another &quot;step&quot; in the metabolic pathway allows the body to have more control over our blood sugar levels, because enzymes which catalyze parts of each step are the point of regulation.</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; If I expend less energy than I put in, that extra energy has to be conserved.<br><br>This seems like a funny way of putting it since (IIUC) the causality is sort of backwards? Let me clarify some details though, since maybe I don't understand.<br><br>Intuitively I'd think that, opposed to something like &quot;well, we have this extra energy since we didn't expend it, so we'll have to store it&quot; it'd <em>already</em> be stored in some way and spent as-needed (and it's just that thermo lets you deduce that since it wasn't spent it <em>must</em> be stored somewhere). And maybe that is one way of looking at it, since it comes in as food after all -- but since all the food is digested (even if the energy is just stored) there's probably more to it.<br><br>I'm having trouble articulating what I'm wondering here. Can you indicate if any of the following hypotheses are correct:<br><br>1. The organism basically pre-allocates the incoming calories to different processes (homeostatic, external motion, etc, but also storing energy in fat) and each of those processes receives energy as food is digested. If the demands on the organism change (it suddenly starts expending more energy) it could even need to &quot;un-store&quot; that energy pretty quickly because that need wasn't anticipated? At any rate, some of those calories were always set aside for storage, it's not something we solve for after seeing how much (little) we expend; or,<br><br>2. Even though the food is all digested into energy, that energy is immediately stored in some sort of intermediate vessel (something something ATP?), so in a way it's <em>all</em> stored, but any that isn't used within that intermediate window gets converted for more long-term storage; or,<br><br>3. It's all converted to energy that's <em>not</em> stored, that energy is spent a bit at a time, and what's left at the end gets stored. I have a pretty limited understanding of thermo (or really physical science in general) but AFAIK I don't actually think it's possible to spend energy over time without storing it somewhere (although I guess it could be stored in some non-matter form like KE? I was also going to say PE, but do I recall that I don't mean chemical PE because that's what 'storing as matter' would be anyways?)<br><br>Or maybe something else entirely if you can see what I'm getting at :)</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes, sort of, the mother dies in the fall, but next year, if left in the ground, each potato will sprout and become a new plant.
