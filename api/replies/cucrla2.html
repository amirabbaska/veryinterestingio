			<p>It is this brand from Whole Foods: <a href="http://imgur.com/4NHKvTV" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/4NHKvTV</a><br><br>The heat wave last week consisted of several days with highs over 85-90 °F and night-time lows above 75 °F. This week the temperatures dropped to highs around 75 °F and lows under 60 °F. <br><br>In this new photo you can see that the oil partially melted again after a high over 80 °F yesterday. </p>		</li>

			<p>Interesting.  I have coconut oil in a large(r) plastic tub and have never seen this despite repeated melting and cooling.  I wonder if it's related to the thermal conductivity of the glass, or the radius of the jar?  Or perhaps it's the ratio of different fats in the brand I buy (Nutiva) vs. the 365 brand?<br><br>Or I might just not have noticed it.</p>		</li>

			<p>I've had several different jars of coconut oil in my cabinet over a span of a few years. During the summer months, I've seen them melt and solidify many times. This is the first time I have ever seen any sort of pattern like this. Normally it forms a solid block. <br><br>Some conditions must have been just right to produce this!</p>		</li>

			<p>Have you used the same brand and refined expeller pressed coconut oil? It's also possible they changed their coconut oil source, even if the label remains the same, so you would have to call the number on the bottle.</p>		</li>

			<p>I don't know for sure if I've used this brand before. I know I've used Trader Joe's brand at least and haven't encountered this. </p>		</li>

			<p>I'm confused by the presence of the marmite in your cupboard and the mention of Trader Joe's in your post. </p>		</li>

			<p>The same thing happened to my jar of coconut oil and it's the same brand, coincidence? </p>		</li>

			<p>My coconut oil showed the same pattern when I last checked about a month ago. We had similar local temps but it's a different brand.</p>		</li>

			<p>Devils post pile looks like this.<br><br>And when I looked up that feature and oil columns, turns out oil experiments was one of the ways they modeled it. Might be able to look up how they did those experiments:<br><br><a href="http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/columnar-jointing" target="_blank">http://volcano.oregonstate.edu/columnar-jointing</a></p>		</li>

			<p>I and at least one other poster in the thread have seen the effect in coconut oil, so it should be reproducible. I suggest that the key variable would be rate and temperature of cooling, more than peak temperature or duration? If you do it, please post!</p>		</li>
