			<p>Am mining engineer that works at granite mine, creating size 34 stone for ballast (and plenty of other mix designs). We love making ballast stone! Easy gradation to create/ follow, and it usually comes out of our secondary sizing plant ( so we don't have to put it through our tertiary/ quarternary circuits)</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; Source: Im a civil engineer and the above information is accurate and should contain all the most relevant reasons why gravel is used instead of other options.<br><br>Wouldn't a railway engineer's opinion potentially contain all the most relevant reasons, even more than yours? Your &quot;ultimate authority&quot; kind of thinking is what gets engineers in trouble. There is always someone smarter than you.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>No, civil engineers design the railroad lines as well. Thats a subfield of civil engineering. Pretty much anything is civil engineering. Water, wastewater, all environmental stuff, mining, transportation, geology, foundations, buildings, structures, airport design, airplane design, space station design, wind turbines, excavatiing, traffic, killing bacteria, killing microorganisms, killing viruses, filtration, air pollution from factories; smell pollution, chemical and biologucal pollution of water and air, filtering large amounts of air and water and how filters work and are cleaned or replaced, and more fields are all civil engineering. The list could go on much longer if i list more of the environmental parts of civil engineering and structural design and materials such as concrete, asphalt, and rebar parts of civil engineering.<br><br><br>When the railroad installs things they have civil engineers design it and inspect it. You just dont understand how huge the field of civil engineering is.<br><br>I wasn't being cocky at all. My response is 100% factual.<br><br>Edit: I will know way more about this subject than someone who identifies as a railroad engineer because I know way more about the properties of rocks, consolidation, foundations, gravel beds, soil properties, and other engineering aspects. You can even check the thread, people who identified as railroad engineers only provided very basic info and many of them gave incorrect info.<br><br>And when it comes to this subject matter, civil engineers are the ultimate authority.  The post is even tagged as engineering. I happen to be especially knowledgeable about soil mechanics.</p>		</li>

			<p>I understand how big of a field civil engineering, but not every civil engineer is an expert in the entire field. In fact, no civil engineer is even a 'perfect expert' in their own field. If you think you're an 'perfect expert', then you're not good at what you do, and you <em>are</em> cocky, and a danger to the public. You're the kind of guy that would never seek a second opinion on something because it may tarnish your self-perception of being perfect. It's because of people like you that we have huge civil engineering failures that &quot;We didn't think that could happen&quot;.... &quot;we had an unexpected failure&quot;... sure. Whatever.<br><br>Here's my problem: You seem to be implying that railroads employ engineers that don't fully understand the scope of their work. Did it occur to you that railroads probably have all kinds of engineers in their employ? That they have electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, and even civil engineers -- civil engineers who know more about gravel and aggregate, and their role in rail beds than you? It's their business. It's what they do.<br><br>So your university claims to have the #1 road design research facility in the world. Do they have the #1 railroad design research facility in the world too? Did you graduate #1 in your class? Did you graduate #1 in the entire history of the university? Do we know everything there is to know about road engineering, and there is nothing new to be learned? Has all researched in road engineering stopped? Have you read every single paper that has ever been published on the topic, even the ones that haven't been translated to a language you understand? Check yourself. Your ego is so bloated it's disgusting.</p>		</li>
