			<p>a family in Russia fled to Siberia to avoid religious persecution. They had a son named Dmitri.<br><br>&gt;Dmitri also practiced persistence hunting to keep his family fed. It often involved hunting barefoot in the snow for days before he caught anything, and only then by wearing the animal out until it collapsed of exhaustion.<br><br><a href="http://www.outdoorhub.com/news/2013/01/31/isolated-russian-family-survives-in-siberia-for-40-years/" target="_blank">http://www.outdoorhub.com/news/2013/01/31/isolated-russian-family-survives-in-siberia-for-40-years/</a><br><br>humans today if grown in the environment can still practice persistence hunting, and sleeping in snow without dieing of exposure.</p>		</li>

			<p>The hat is the only one that would make a huge difference. I used to live in boston and wore sandals and no gloves all the time. My hands and feet would get cold but here is so little blood flow there that it didn't affect how warm I felt overall. But if I forgot my hat or my hoody so that my ears or neck were exposed then I felt like I was going to freeze to death.</p>		</li>

			<p>Impressive, but I don't think he can last 24 hours outside on a cold winter day in Michigan wearing just that without some harm.</p>		</li>

			<p>I'm in Toronto, but one of my teachers in high school only ever wore sandals. I thought maybe she changed into them in her office, but nope, she'd be out in the parking lot in the dead of winter with snow all around still in her sandals.</p>		</li>

			<p>My brother is mildly mentally disabled with some brain damage as well. From the time he was a kid, he would ALWAYS go outside in the cold (like Minnesota cold) with minimal layers. He also rides his bike everywhere, even in the winter, because he just doesn't seem to feel it like other people do. We did finally get him to bundle up, but still. I don't pretend to fully understand how his disability affects this, but I've been told it's a thing. </p>		</li>
