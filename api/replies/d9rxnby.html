			<p>But can't the spent fuel be sent through the fuel enrichment cycle again to concentrate the remaining heavier isotopes and remove fission products?</p>		</li>

			<p>You can, but do the math on how much energy you can recover from the waste versus how much energy is spent doing the refinement.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes it can. I was talking only of decay heat. <br><br>A typical light water reactor spent fuel bundle has an average enrichment total of 1.5%. Just under half is uranium 235, just over half is plutonium 239. You would need to re enrich this and remove actinides. Or use breeder reactors. </p>		</li>
