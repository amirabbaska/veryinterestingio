			<p>&gt;the trains are extremely heavy <br><br>So heavy, in fact, that we're getting close to the limit of what gravel ballast can handle. Gravel ballast has a limit of about 80,000lbs per axle before the vibrations from the trains start pulverizing the gravel into dust. We're using over 70,000lbs axle loads already. It's not a problem in the rest of the world, but we build our trains super heavy here.</p>		</li>

			<p>So the new 315k lbs/carload trains are less than 1 ton from the safe limit per axle? That is a bit worrisome to be honest.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yeah, a 315,000lb freight car with the standard 4 axles has an axle load of 78,750lbs, so cutting it pretty close. That's the reason railroads are slow to adopt heavier carloads, because it increases the cost of maintenance of way in exchange for reduced cost of transport. Railroads were slow to adopt the 286,000lbs carload as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not a new issue, and overloading the track doesn't create emergent defects in same way overloading a bridge does.<br><br>For example, the maximum load for 90lb rail or smaller is 263k. But short lines have run 286k cars on them for years now. You get more rail breaks and defects but for a 25mph shortline operation you can limp things along for quite some time without upgrading.</p>		</li>
