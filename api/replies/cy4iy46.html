			<p>Does this not have some fairly nasty implications for warp travel? In that if we ever do manage to create something that could bend spacetime to shorten a trip, it would be rendered useless by the consequence of obliterating anything we ended up near?</p>		</li>

			<p>If i understand correctly the concept of bending space time for interstellar travel involves as the name implies bending space time. The ship in fact isn't really moving. </p>		</li>

			<p>Only if we use an Alcubierre drive. Just like Alcubierre's initial proposal was too &quot;out there&quot; for the people of the time, so too will the next proposed warp drive be inconceivable to us right now. It's entirely possible that we'll figure out a different method of warp travel that doesn't have that problem.<br><br>Or we could try to capture that energy and vent it in a more safe manner. But I think Alcubierre's proposal has run into too many problems at this point. I think we're just as likely to go FTL using an as-yet-undiscovered method as we are with an Alcubierre drive.</p>		</li>

			<p>warp is not traveling faster/near light speed, but warping space fabric to move point A and point B closer........Like bending a sheet of paper you get from point A to point B faster because the linear distance was much less.  Much like attaining light speed, the power expenditure to warp space is huge and beyond any technology just yet. </p>		</li>
