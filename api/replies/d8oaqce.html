			<p>&gt; You want a foundation that will not swell or absorb water. Gravel is a non cohesive soil unlike clay which will swell and shrink depending on its water content. Gravel drains quickly and will not have the effects clay does (which many areas have clay in the soil).<br><br>As a complete sidenote, in some highway overpasses and onramps and stuff, around here they have taken to building a significant portion of the abutments out of huge blocks of polystyrene. Given the areas where I've seen this used are usually wetter/delta type ground formations, I presume this was done to reduce the weight of the abutments so that they will sink/settle at the same rate as the overpass they are leading up to.</p>		</li>
