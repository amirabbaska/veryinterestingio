			<p>That was as good an answer as it's possible to have in a less-than-book-length format.  Since I'm poor and can't Gild you, let me just leave this comment for everyone else saying I've read Richard Rhodes masterpiece &quot;The Making of the Atomic Bomb&quot; multiple times, and this is as clear and accurate an answer as you could want.</p>		</li>

			<p>While I like the shows and books that showcase the technological race for the Bomb, one of the reason I love Rhodes is that he doesn't shy away from the ethical conundrum.  He shows, for example, a gradual escalation in &quot;acceptable targets&quot; over the course of the two world wars.  Chemists in WWI were creating poisonous gas under the argument that &quot;if it ends the war faster, it will ultimately save lives.&quot;  At the beginning of WWII, the idea of directly attacking civilian populations as a legitimate tactic was unthinkable.  By the end of the war, it was inevitable.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's extremely narrow-minded to attribute that exclusively to nuclear weapons.  I think the explosive growth of democracy and increased living standards in the 20th century might possibly be having an effect.  <br><br>Even from a military standpoint, the lack of a war between superpowers has a whole lot more to do with the supremacy of the US Navy and Air Force than it does with nuclear arms. <br><br>It's also making the subjective distinction between &quot;direct&quot; war and &quot;major power.&quot;  I doubt the millions of Afghans and Vietnamese that fought and died in Cold War proxy wars or the millions that fought and died in the Iran-Iraq war cared about those sort of distinctions.   </p>		</li>

			<p>I also went on this tour about a year ago, and it is probably the best tour I will ever take in my life.<br><br>The tour guides where all retired volunteers who worked on and around the plant. The 30+ minute drive to the site was spent with a man giving a geologic rundown of the area and why it was chosen as the location of the reactor. Everything from the formation of the region, how it was carved through the ice ages, to it's current relative stability. And this man spoke, even after a lifetime of work in the field, with such passion on what many might be a mundane subject. Nearly all the guides taught with similar love for the history of the project.<br><br>When you go in, it's I credibly well preserved, and almost all of it is just roped off, not behind glass at all. You can reach out and touch nearly everything there is (though you shouldn't touch, and I didn't, but you can get up very close and examine it all you like). Gasmasks, tools, turbines, buttons and control systems, it's all open to you.<br><br>And it's so well preserved, as though it where still up and running, but all the people running it left for lunch and you're getting a tour. There's all this original signage, there was even an ash tray with a matchbook sitting on it from the 1940s.<br><br>And the reactor itself is awe-inspiring. It's rises like this massive obelisk, a 70 foot cube of solid graphite, fed cooling water by hundreds of huge high power pumps.<br><br>The B reactor is unreal, so wildly different than anything else that's ever been built. If you ever have the chance to see it and learn about it, seize the opportunity.</p>		</li>

			<p>Interestingly, the most important information that the Soviets stole via spying was <em>What didn't work</em>. It allowed the Soviet political officials in charge of the program approve or deny projects proposed by their scientists while simultaneously limited who had access to knowledge / who knew that the Soviets were stealing secrets from the allies. This allowed them to build up nuclear expertise at an accelerated rate and not be held back by simply following some blueprint without understanding the technology.<br><br>David Holloway has a good write up on it in &quot;Stalin and the Bomb&quot;</p>		</li>

The Soviets got the idea for an implosion-style plutonium weapon directly via espionage -- detailed information from Klaus Fuchs and less detailed but still corroborating information from David Greenglass. Of course, the Soviet bomb program leadership still wanted their scientists and engineers to verify that the information acquired via espionage was correct.<br><br>I literally just finished reading <em>Dark Sun</em> two days ago, so the info is still fresh in my mind :)</p>		</li>

			<p>The two reasoning aren't mutually exclusive. Holloway simply points out that the political climate of the Soviet Union prevented the free flow of ideas, as knowledge was power and if you were the only one who knew something you might be safe from a purge. Thus the Soviets couldn't say &quot;Here is the blueprints for a bomb, build this&quot; it had to be &quot;Yes, I approve of your project (that is close to what the Americans did that worked&quot; or &quot;No, I don't think this version is promising, maybe tweak it a little in this direction.&quot; This allowed them to build up the expertise to produce their own version of the Hydrogen bomb in very short order even after the U.S. had basically purged its ranks of anyone even vaguely suspected of being a commie spy. Interestingly, the Soviet Union actually beat the United States to a <em>usable</em> hydrogen bomb. The US bomb was much more powerful, but also so large that it couldn't be air dropped.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>Rockets that are designed to fail and explode maybe. To shoot a  large rocket at something accurately with a payload, you need some pretty sophisticated physics, chemistry, and materials sciences. Add humans on top, and it's an even bigger problem if it blows up on the way. Add landing somewhere like the moon and being able to take off and come back without dying, and you'll see why it's called rocket science not fireworks science.</p>		</li>

			<p>Indeed. As I mentioned, the very existence of nuclear fission had only been discovered about 8 years earlier. It's a remarkable achievement. In a way you can blame the Nazis for that. Because their policies and militarism drove many of the finest physicists out of Europe and to the US and the UK, while at the same time being such a huge threat to the world that it caused the largest economy of the world to throw blank checks at the nuclear bomb problem based off of only a hint that the Nazis might be working on it as well.</p>		</li>

			<p>The Manhattan project was one of the most important projects in history. Simply put, we needed to beat the Nazis, both by accelerating our research with the massive influx of important nuclear physicists, and the sabotage of the Nazis nuclear program with a series of black ops missions, many of which are still highly classified to this day. Then when Germany was defeated, the focus went to Japan. U.S. Military high command was almost entirely certain that an invasion of Japan was inevitable. Such an invasion would have been extremely costly to Allied forces with the lowest estimate being one million casualties. The bomb, while horrible in its own terrifying way, was a godsend to both sides. The Manhattan project was worth every penny. </p>		</li>

			<p>Fission is when an atom's nucleus (the protons and neutrons at the center) splits, hence the &quot;splitting the atom&quot; phrase.<br><br>When this happens it releases energy (mostly in the form of heat, but also can include things like gamma rays), subatomic particles, and fission fragments.<br><br>Fission Fragments are pieces of that nucleus, and they become elements of their own, determined by how many protons are in each piece (the number of neutrons is what determines the <em>Isotope</em> of an element). Many of them are themselves radioactive.<br><br>What you get from this process is often probabilistic, you don't always get the same thing, there is an element of randomness to it. And each element and isotope can give you different probabilities.<br><br>Uranium-235, the kind used in Little Boy, will release 2 to 3 neutrons when it undergoes Fission. Those neutrons would then go on to induce fission in other U-235 atoms in the bomb, and so on to make the chain reaction.<br><br>The chain reaction occurs within a tiny miniscule amount of time, but it takes advantage of the ability to double (or more than double) the amount of reactions for each &quot;generation&quot;. You start with one atom splitting, then next iteration has 2 splits, then 4, then 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,... and so on. 1024 is the 10th step, and you are up a <em>factor</em> of a thousand. 10 more steps and you are up to a Million splits in that iteration. 10 more steps gets you to a billion, then a trillion. Every 10 steps gets you three zeroes on the end of the number.<br><br>Very soon the number gets very very big. Even though one atom splitting releases a very small amount of energy, when you get a ludicrous amount of them to do it in a very small time frame (remember, all this happens in less than a second), it translates to a nuclear bomb that can destroy an entire city.</p>		</li>

			<p>First, read this:<br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fission</a><br><br>Effectively, fission is breaking apart the atomic nucleus (consisting of protons and neutrons) into smaller nuclei -- that is, &quot;fission&quot; and &quot;splitting the atom&quot; are the same thing. The energy that holds the nucleus together (<del>which comes from the so-called &quot;weak&quot; nuclear force</del>) is what's released when an atom splits, and is responsible for the huge amount of energy released.<br><br>The typical agent used for creating nuclear fission is the neutron -- if you fire a neutron at a nucleus, sometimes it'll break the nucleus apart. Uranium (and plutonium, among others) have the property that sometimes when you fire a neutron in and break apart a nucleus, besides the two smaller nuclei you also get <em>more than one</em> extra neutron out. These two or more extra neutrons can then go on to break apart more nuclei, leading to even more neutrons, leading to more fission, leading to ...a chain reaction, with ridiculous amounts of energy released in the process.<br><br>Interestingly, not every element <em>releases</em> energy via fission. The elements lighter than Iron-56 actually require you to put in <em>extra</em> energy to make them break apart. On the other hand, these lighter elements release energy when two nuclei are joined -- or &quot;fused&quot; -- in nuclear <em>fusion</em>. Fusion and fission are opposite processes, and both can be harnessed to produce incredibly destructive weapons. Fusion is the process used to create thermonuclear weapons -- hydrogen bombs.</p>		</li>

			<p>It ends because the energy released in the process blows the bomb apart. The pieces get spread too far apart to react with each other. One of the more complicated parts of nuclear weapon design is figuring out how to keep the fissile material close together for long enough to achieve decent efficiency. There's also a limited quantity of fissile material in any weapon, but most bombs don't come close to 'burning' all of it, because it gets blown apart too quickly. </p>		</li>

			<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/iknownuffink" target="_blank">iknownuffink</a>
			<p>The chain reaction is self sustaining as long as a critical mass of the <em>proper isotopes</em> exists, and there is not &quot;poison&quot; killing the reaction.<br><br>Critical mass is a function of mass and geometry, and really just means that when an atom splits and shoots off a neutron, that it is <em>likely to hit</em> another nucleus before exiting the mass. The majority of an atom is empty space remember, if you scaled an atom up (including the electron cloud) to the size of a football stadium, the nucleus would be the size of a mosquito, and the rest would be empty space.<br><br>Now the next thing, the isotopes. while you do make different nuclei during the chain reaction, these may or may not react as you would like if they are hit with a neutron. They might just absorb it and &quot;poison&quot; the reaction. For a bomb, you need it to behave like you want, and you can generally count on those decay products to be uncooperative for the specific behavior you need. So you can <em>run out of fuel</em> for the chain reaction, if you use up most of it, to the point where you no longer have a critical mass, then the chain reaction stops.<br><br>The poison thing is why you need to enrich the fuel so much for a bomb, if you have more than a certain threshold of stuff that is killing your chain reaction, it won't work right. (reactors are a different animal and different things apply, though they also have to deal with decay products poisoning the reaction)<br><br>The other thing: it's a bomb. It literally blows itself apart. The chain reaction in a nuclear weapon occurs in a <em>very</em> small amount of time (less than a second). This means that even if you have plenty of fuel leftover, it gets blasted apart so that it no longer forms a critical mass, and the chain reaction stops. (If you have a &quot;premature detonation&quot; it means it blew up before it could get going properly. and you'll have a &quot;fizzle&quot; with a reduced yield)<br></p>		</li>

			<p>That makes so much more sense! I had always thought that the reaction from a nuclear blast was still continuing when you'd see it form into a mushroom cloud and continue to grow, I didn't know that the only reaction taking place to create all that energy happens just within the however many fractions of a second the isotopes are at critical mass before detonation. That makes nuclear weapons so much more impressive...damn..</p>		</li>

			<p>When u^235 gets an extra Neutron, it turns into U^236 which is unstable and splits instantly. When you split an atom the number of protons and neutrons need to add up to the same as before. <br><br>U^236 has 92 protons (Uranium's atomic number) and 236 neutrons. It splits into Barium and Krypton, atomic numbers 56 and 36 respectively, which conserves the 92 protons from the uranium. The variants of Barium and Krypton it creates are Ba^141 and Kr^92. Note that this means the neutrons only add up to 233... The extra 3 neutrons are thrown out from the reaction along with a large amount of energy and sent on their way to split other uranium atoms. <br><br>But to answer your question, this uranium atom is now split and used up, the energy from it has been released and its job is done. Other uranium atoms continue to split and maintain the chain reaction until there is only barium and krypton left. The yield of the bomb is roughly equal to the number of uranium atoms x the amount of energy each atom releases when split.<br><br>Note that this is a simplification, there are other reactions that will happen in the extreme environment of the explosion but the splitting of uranium into barium and krypton is the primary reaction we're interested in.</p>		</li>

			<p>Uranium (and other materials) release neutrons as part of their decay process.  Think of decay as &quot;rotting&quot; and neutrons as the gasses produced by rotting.<br><br>When a neutron hits another uranium atom, it upsets that atom's balance of forces that are holding it together, and the atom breaks apart.  When it does so, it releases a bunch of neutrons (among other particles) which would then hit other uranium atoms, causing those to break, and so on.<br><br>This happens all the time naturally.  However...<br><br>Weapons-grade uranium decays faster than natural uranium, releasing more neutrons<br><br>In a weapon, there are reflectors that prevent the neutrons from escaping and force them back into the uranium mass, to collide with more atoms<br><br>The destruction of uranium atoms causes energy contained in those atoms to be released rather violently.  At a certain point, if you get enough uranium all in one spot, and use neutron reflectors to keep the neutrons bouncing around in there like a pinball game gone crazy, each atom destroyed by a wayward neutron contributes to a cascade effect where so many atoms are being blown apart at once by their neighbors that the cumulative total of energy released (not &quot;created&quot;, you cannot &quot;create&quot; energy) gets to massively dangerous levels.</p>		</li>

The implosion-type needs to compress the core evenly, which doesn't seem likely to happen in an accident.<br><br>Is this true?</p>		</li>

			<p>That is true in terms of not setting off an accidental chain reaction, but implosion type bombs were still incredibly dangerous. The high-explosive lenses were, well, extremely explosive and dangerous in-and-of themselves, and there was still the possibility of setting off an accidental chain reaction. Even if the materials didn't fission completely, or at all, you're still setting off a dirty bomb that'll spread radiological waste over a pretty big area.<br><br>The military was also really, really not a fan of the idea of safety devices on nuclear weapons, due to the fact that they could be exploited by the enemy, whoever that might be, so nuclear weapons remained pretty extremely dangerous, and poorly maintained at that, until the 1970's (iirc).<br><br>I highly recommend <em>Command and Control</em> by Eric Schlosser.

			<p>The Little Boy design actually used a fixed sub-critical mass and a greater-than-critical mass that was fired forward onto the fixed mass, creating a total mass that was twice what was needed for criticality.  The second mass was kept from actually going critical by the design of the mass (a stack of rings) and by the fact it was not surrounded by neutron reflectors (those were arranged like a &quot;coffee can&quot; around the mass in the nose).<br><br>In other words, the aft mass was slowly sizzling away when the bomb was assembled, with the neutrons escaping from the mass rather than being held in, which would have caused the whole thing to go kaboom.<br><br>In the event of a crash, if the rear mass broke free and was thrown forward, yes, it could have caused a critical event.  However as the speed of the mass would almost certainly be well below the design speed of a deliberately detonated bomb, there would almost certainly have been a &quot;small&quot; explosion which would have blown the bomb apart well before the design yield was reached.<br><br>But yes, safety concerns were one reason why you don't see gun-type bombs in the US arsenal after 1945.  Little Boy was a &quot;war exigency&quot; design (meaning: &quot;dangerous as all get-out, but we kinda need it right now, so we won't tell OSHA what we are doing...&quot;), when the war ended it was discarded in favor of the implosion design.<br><br><strong>EDIT</strong> correction to last paragraph: a couple of dozen Little Boy-design bomb casings <em>were</em> built post-war by the US Navy for use with Neptune aircraft.  However the Navy only had enough Uranium for 10 bombs, with initiators for only 6.  The bombs were totally withdrawn from service shortly thereafter.  The Fatman design was apparently incompatible with the Neptune's bomb bay.<br><br>The USAAF also looked into making more as the Hanford reactors were having serious problems in 1946-7, which was affecting the plutonium/polonium supply, however as most of the needed plans and parts were all destroyed at the end of the war it took quite a while just to re-learn how to make the bombs, by the time a half-dozen casings were completed the Hanford issue was determined to be solvable and no uranium cores were produced.</p>		</li>

			<p>Speaking of polonium, it seems I read somewhere that even though in these bombs there could be a critical mass produced by one or another method, there weren't enough neutrons being produced to set off the chain reaction. The solution was to use a mixture of beryllium and polonium to produce a sufficient concentration/flux of neutrons. I don't know how the Be/Po alloy was arranged in the two halves of the gun shot bomb or fat man. Anyone know or is this a secret.</p>		</li>

			<p>You're talking about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulated_neutron_initiator" target="_blank">&quot;urchin&quot;</a>, which generates extra neutrons at the time the bomb reaction is initiated.  It's not that there aren't enough neutrons, it's that adding a few more at the right moment made sure that the bomb went off correctly and gave higher yield.  It's not built as an &quot;alloy&quot;.  The basic idea is to use a thin gold coating to shield the beryllium from the alpha particles generated by the polonium as it decayed.  When the high explosives go off, the whole thing gets sheared and mixed together, placing the polonium in contact with the beryllium, which correspondingly starts generating neutrons because of the alpha particles.  More details at the above wikipedia page.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's more than just &quot;slamming down&quot;, but yes, that's true. However, note that it's possible to simply remove the fissile parts from the bomb during transport, making it impossible for it to accidentally go off (and this was done for the &quot;Little Boy&quot; bomb).<br><br>As for implosion-type bombs, they can be in a 100% ready to fire mode with all of their bits assembled and still be safe from accidents. Modern nuclear weapons require several implosion points to detonate simultaneously in order for there to be any appreciable nuclear reactions, if a single point where to fire it would just wreck the bomb but it wouldn't go off.</p>		</li>

			<p>It depends on whether or not the plane crash triggers the high explosives in the bomb.<br><br>My understanding is that you still require some precision for the gun-type weapons. They usually involve a cylindrical or spherical lump of fissile material, with a hole through the middle of it. When deliberately fired that hole is filled by another piece of fissile material that fits relatively tightly.<br><br>So unless the plane crashes in a way that compresses the bomb in a perfectly linear sort of fashion, you're not going to have the core assemble correctly and have a reduced yield or no yield at all.<br><br>Gun-type weapons often also contain a neutron source. Basically you have a lump of a material [I can't remember exactly right this minute, but I think certain lithium isotopes may be used?] that generates a neutron flux when it's shocked by the two pieces of fissile material slamming together. This significantly increases the number of fissions that occur in the nanoseconds before the core disassembles. So, again, if you don't assemble the core correctly you're going to have a reduced yield because the neutron source doesn't fire.<br><br>Time scales may be an issue aswell. I would assume a plane crash is going to run over a longer time scale than a high explosive detonation. Assembling the two pieces of fissile material too slowly would result in the core getting very hot and disassembling before it's gone fully critical, reducing the yield and resulting in a fizzle. Assembling too slowly may prevent the neutron source firing aswell.<br><br>All of this above assumes the high explosive doesn't detonate though. If the high explosives are triggered and there's no mechanical damage to the bomb that prevents the assembly [and there's no failsafe mechanism] then you're in all sorts of trouble. The core assembly of a gun-type weapon is a lot less complicated than an implosion-type weapon, as you suggest, and doesn't rely on precisely timing of multiple detonators to compress the core evenly. So in that sense a gun-type weapon only requires a single point of failure.<br><br>There are other issues with the gun-type weapon aswell. They're typically only assembling two pieces of fissile material, and typically have more fissile material in them in total, with each piece being closer to a critical amount before the assembly, compared to an implosion-type weapon which has less total fissile material in more pieces, with each piece being relatively further away from a critical mass. So there are risks associated with a gun-type weapon, for example, accidentally being lost in the ocean and not actually detonating, but potentially going critical regardless because submerging it in water moderates the neutrons that are naturally produced.<br><br><strong>tl;dr:</strong> gun-type weapons are intrinsically less safe than implosion-type weapons, but they don't explode all willy nilly.</p>		</li>

			<p>Gun types literally use explosive charges to propel sub-critical hemispheres at one another and achieve super-criticality.<br><br>It is unlikely that a plane crash would ignite such a bomb.  If one or both hemispheres were to break loose as they approached one another they would rapidly heat the gasses trapped in the bomb casing and this would cause the bombs casing to rupture and the components would be scattered by the energy of the super-heated gas.<br><br>This is similar to pre-ignition in an implosion style bomb but the yield is far less and there will not be enough energy released to vaporize the bomb itself.</p>		</li>

			<p>Yes its true, However the gun type probably has some type of stoppers that prevent the half from coming together by accident. I would imagine, perhaps plastic or ceramic pieces  in the barrel that get broken when the &quot;gun shoots the &quot;half&quot; down the barrel, etc. <br><br>There are many examples of gun type nuclear bombs in planes that crashed, none went off. </p>		</li>

			<p>Oh, it was not always so, exactly. Consider that the processes which create Uranium (which happened in a supernova explosion that seeded the nebula that formed our Sun) would have created different Uranium isotopes in roughly equivalent proportions. The reason why U-235 is so much rarer than U-238 today is because of their different half-lives. Over, say, 6 billion years or so you end up with about 40% as much U-238 as there was originally, due to its 4.5 billion year half-life. However, that corresponds to 8.5 half-lives of U-235, so you'll end up with around 0.27% as much U-235 as there was originally (which, when you divide by 0.4 gives you 0.7%, the abundance of U-235 today).<br><br>Which means, of course, that early on in Earth's history there was a lot more U-235 around. At around 4.5 billion years ago (the age of Earth) U-235 could have made up as much as 20% of natural Uranium, which is about the extreme lower limit of what would be possible to make a bomb with (although it would be hugely inefficient).<br><br>Of course, there wasn't life around then, let alone civilization. One interesting thing to ponder though is that on some hypothetical world that evolved technological civilization faster than our own they might have a much higher natural abundance of U-235. 700 million years ago there was twice as much natural U-235 as today, and 1400 million years ago there would have been 4x, it would have been vastly easier to build nuclear reactors using natural Uranium.</p>		</li>

			<p>It boils down to &quot;it's hard to separate isotopes&quot;, especially for heavy isotopes that differ only very slightly in mass.  For uranium, it's hard to separate the 0.72% U-235 from the others.

That was in the 1950s, with more modern technology it might be possible to squeeze more yield out of that much Uranium, but it's doubtful, it very much is a race between the bomb trying to blow itself apart and maintaining a critical assembly for just a few tens of nanoseconds longer.<br><br>The predicted yield of Little Boy was 13.4 kilotons, but there was a considerable amount of uncertainty in that estimate, revealed by the fact that the detonation height of the bomb was set at a level that was optimal for 5 kilotons.<br><br>There are a ton more details here: <a href="http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html" target="_blank">http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq8.html</a></p>		</li>

For example, the Soviets built and tested the &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot;, which was a 100 MT three stage bomb (tested at 50 MT) and that bomb was able to be dropped from a plane.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sorry, that should be 60kg. Little Boy used about 64kg of around 90% U-235 Uranium.

The important mechanism in regards to &quot;critical mass&quot; is the volume of the fissile material in relation to the average distance that a neutron travels (the &quot;mean free path&quot;). That distance is shortened as density (due to compression of solid material in the implosion) increases, so achieving superior implosion makes it possible to use less fissile material.</p>		</li>

			<p>Fusion is different in that it's more like traditional combustion, the self-perpetuating chain-reaction is one that involves primarily heat and pressure, rather than the neutron mediated chain reaction of fission, although neutrons can be important to the process. Fusion stages work in a similar way to fission bombs, they are imploded and then experience conditions of high heat and pressure. You need much more pressure and much higher temperatures (which you get from adiabatic compression) than you can achieve with just chemical explosives though, which is why a fission bomb is used to implode the fusion secondary.<br><br>It's actually a pretty straightforward process, though the devil is in the details. A nuclear bomb is sort of like a really bright x-ray light-bulb. In the atmosphere those x-rays are absorbed by the nearby gas, creating the pressure and heat of a bomb blast. If you put that light-bulb inside of a container that is reasonably opaque to x-rays (such as a very dense, &quot;high-Z&quot; metal) then you'll create a volume of intense x-ray flux for a little while, until the container is vaporized completely and blown apart. Then, if you have a capsule made out of similar material inside that container the x-rays trapped in the container will shine on the surface of the capsule. Of course, nothing can stand up to such intense energies for long, and what happens is that the ultra bright x-ray light vaporizes the outer layer of the capsule, as the vaporized material leaves the surface it expands just like any gas does, and it only has one way to go, away from the capsule. This creates a force against the surface because newly vaporized material is continuously pushing against it, this process is called ablation. It's a bit like a rocket nozzle turned inside out. And because of the energies involved this process squishes the fusion fuel capsule with tremendous force, orders of magnitude more than would be possible with conventional explosives.<br><br>The temperature and pressure inside the fusion fuel capsule go way up, but there's not just fusion fuel inside it, at the center there's a piece of fissile material such as Plutonium or Uranium. It too has been imploded, and it reaches a super-critical state. Because this implosion is vastly more effective, vastly less fissile materials needs to be used. This sets off a fission bomb right in the middle of the fusion fuel, and this provides the heat to kick the fusion reactions into high gear. Once the fusion fuel is ignited the process is self-sustaining as the feedback loop of increasing temperatures and pressures results in fusion reactions which release energy that increase the temperature and pressure (until the whole things spreads apart).<br><br>Also, much of the advantage of the two stage thermonuclear design comes from the ability to use the force of the primary to implode the secondary (which is independent of nuclear fusion) and from the massive amount of extremely high-energy neutrons created by the fusion reactions. Such high energy fast neutrons have the ability to fission natural U-238 (which won't participate in a fission chain-reaction but will increase yield immensely). What that means is that you can create a thermonuclear bomb design which achieves the vast majority of its yield from fission reactions alone, with the fusion reaction around mostly to boost the efficiency of the secondary and to increase yield from fission of the natural Uranium tamper.</p>		</li>

			<p>Mostly they use implosion, though the methods have become much more sophisticated over time.<br><br>Also, one huge change to fission weapons design after WWII was fusion boosting. Fusion reactions occur at different rates depending on conditions, and under the conditions (heat, pressure) inside a fission bomb some fusion reactions will occur. Not enough to kick off a self-sustaining fusion reaction, but enough for some interesting side-effects. Namely, neutron generation. Most of the easiest fusion reactions (like Deuterium-Deuterium or Deuterium-Tritium) produce high energy neutrons. These can be leveraged to jump-start the fission process and increase yield.<br><br>Fission reactions are an exponential process that is gated on neutron population. Similar to compound interest, if you can start off an investment with a much larger initial infusion of dollars, then the return will be proportionally larger when the investment matures. With a bomb the more you can help the neutron population in the early stage (though not before the bomb actually goes off) then the higher the yield will be because more of the fissile material will be involved in the nuclear reaction.<br><br>When a bomb goes off you have a split second where the implosion happens, driving solid Plutonium metal into a compressed sphere through explosive shockwaves. Then the bomb reaches criticality, and this happens even as the bomb is still imploding. The very first generation of neutron mediated fission chain-reactions starts occurring. And each generation occurs on a time scale of about 10 nanoseconds (a &quot;shake&quot;). Each generation roughly doubles the neutron population in the bomb and also doubles the energy being released. In a fraction of a millisecond dozens of generations have occurred and the amount of nuclear energy released by the core has increased by a factor of over a quintillion (10^18 ), enough energy to vaporize the entire bomb core. At this point the bomb is gaseous, but due to inertia and the momentum of the explosion (reinforced by a tamper material lining the outside of the core) it is still contained in one piece. The gaseous bomb is screaming hot, thousands of degrees, at this point it's a race between the fission reactions occurring and the heat of the bomb fighting against the implosion momentum then expanding outward until the fissile material is too spread out to sustain fission any longer. At this point it only takes a few hundred nanoseconds (one or two dozen shakes) for the neutron population and the number of fission reactions to grow by a factor of a million or more, increasing the amount of energy released from mere megajoules (similar to a chemical explosive) to tens of terajoules (kilotons). Fusion boosting and neutron sources means that instead of starting out with, say, one neutron in the first generation you start out with dozens, and then quickly you get many, many more from the fusion reactions.<br><br>This is how you get 100 kiloton yields out of smaller fissile cores. Also, modern boosted weapons are essentially immune to the risk of pre-detonation.</p>		</li>

It served as the backbone of the Pakistani and North Korean nuclear weapons programs and is allowing Iran to sneak into having nuclear weapons capability in plain sight.

			<p>That's somewhat misleading. In practice no bomb, even a 1st generation one, uses a bare sphere of material. The Little Boy bomb used neutron reflectors and other aids. Also, critical mass with regard to gun-type assembly is not necessarily relevant. Because there is no compression and no implosion momentum a precisely critical mass of U-235 can be nudged out of criticality by the smallest forces, so it doesn't stay critical very long, resulting in a very low yield. Little Boy used more than 2 critical masses of U-235, it achieved this because one of the components was a hollow ring of material with an air gap in the middle, preventing the assembly from being critical despite containing more than a critical mass.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's easier initially technologically, but the tradeoffs change once the systems have gotten up and running. Uranium enrichment is a fairly steady process, once it's going it just produces HEU 24/7 day after day. In contrast, while Plutonium enrichment is initially comparatively simple, there are a lot of roadblocks in the way of increasing production. Production capacity relies on reactor count, which are large construction projects, compared to Uranium enrichment where you can add additional capacity onto existing facilities.<br><br>But more importantly, there's a bit of a double catch-22 when it comes to producing Plutonium. When natural Uranium is irradiated by neutrons it breeds Plutonium. However, Plutonium subjected to neutron flux will undergo fission. This is fine for a reactor as it means you breed fuel that your reactor then naturally starts using for free. But for Uranium production it means that the act of producing Plutonium also uses it up. Additionally, sometimes Plutonium getting hit by a neutron won't fission but simply absorb it, becoming a different isotope (Pu-240, 241, etc.) The presence of Pu-240 makes building weapons much more difficult, so weapons-grade Plutonium has to have a low percentage of it. That means you have to pull out the Uranium used for breeding on a regular basis, which makes reactor operations more difficult and limits Plutonium production capacity.<br><br>In mid-1945 it was taking months to produce one bomb worth of HEU while it only took about a week to produce a bomb worth of Plutonium. But that situation inverted after the war. By the end of 1946 HEU production in raw kgs had outstripped Plutonium production, and then through the next several years HEU production began to far outpace Plutonium production.</p>		</li>

			<p>I would wager a guess that plutonium was the preferred fissile material because half of its isotopes are moderately fissile under high energy neutron flux while U235 is mostly fissile by low energy neutrons. That would mean you would need a highly enriched and refined material containing U235 aswell as some sort of light medium to slow down the neutrons to lower energies which I imagine were serious technical issues back in the day (the bomb would be massive in terms of size and cost with extremely small detonation efficiency). Plutonium on the other hand doesn't need to be isotopically enriched and the specter of the produced by the fission neutrons accomodates fission by all fissile plutonium isotopes. I'm not sure what reactors were used for plutonium production back then but spent fuel in modern uranium reactors contains only a few % of Pu-238 (which is responsible for the spontanious fission as you mentioned) of the total amount of generated plutonium.</p>		</li>

One was the existence of strongly neutron absorbing fission byproducts, specifically Xe-135 with a half-life of 9 hours. This caused bizarre control anomalies in the first reactors, as after a while the reactivity would drop precipitously then after many hours when the Xe-135 had decayed things would pick back up again. The scientists ended up correctly hypothesizing that this was due to a neutron absorbing fission byproduct and adjusted reactor operations accordingly. The other was the discover of &quot;Wigner energy&quot;, which is even more bizarre and seemingly esoteric. When bombarded by neutrons the atoms in a solid will undergo tons of little dislocations, these effectively build up energy as strain in the atomic bonds of the solid. This strain can be released suddenly, dumping heat into a part of the reactor, which can lead to dangerous instabilities. Incorrectly managing the Wigner strain energy in the graphite control rods was a primary cause of the Windscale reactor fire in 1957 in the UK (one of the worst reactor accidents before Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, and Fukushima).</p>		</li>

			<p>Yep the graph is neat, though fission occurs with all isotopes of plutonium to some degree(including Pu-238, Pu-239, Pu-241, Pu-242 even). Here's another <a href="http://www.nuclear-power.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/fissile_fertile.png?32b4fc" target="_blank">graph with a bit more info</a>. The net cross section for all those isotopes is greater than the U-235 cross section for fission. Especially considering that most neutrons you get from the fission reactions will be to the right of that graph (high energy neutrons), where plutonium fission is more likely. So depending on the production method you have some mass of plutonium with some isotope consistency which I would guess is better at uncontrolled fission (better efficiency) than the same mass of U-235 in similar geometry. It's also worth mentioning that plutonium fission has slightly higher energy per fission that U-235 which would lead to higher (than U-235) temperatures inside the 'fuel' which in turn would cause the resonances of the fission cross section to broaden and increase the overall cross section for fission (more than U-235 would due to the slightly higher energy/temperature). Might be wrong about that last one since I know nothing about nuclear bombs though</p>		</li>

			<p>Nice. Also, another factor is neutron production, with Plutonium fissions generally producing more than Uranium fissions.</p>		</li>

			<p>I heard Sam Harris in a podcast recently in which he said that what we need is a modern Manhattan project, where every resource and option is pursued, to solve the energy crisis and dependence on oil.  Man I so agree with him. When our greatest minds come together we leap forward.</p>		</li>

			<p>This is an excellent answer, it is hard to imagine how vast the Manhattan project was in industrial terms. Alex Wellerstein has an excellent blog on many nuclear related topics, and this post <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/11/01/many-people-worked-manhattan-project/" target="_blank">How many people worked on the Manhattan Project?</a> and this post <a href="http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/2013/05/17/the-price-of-the-manhattan-project/" target="_blank">The price of the Manhattan Project</a> help lend a sense of scale to the topic. </p>		</li>

			<p>&gt; it turns out that what seemed to be the most promising one initially (centrifugation) was actually not very feasible with the technology of the time (and would not be until around the 1960s or so)<br><br>What made it feasible later on?</p>		</li>

			<p>More precise machining technology, stronger materials. U-235 and U-239 are less than 1% different by mass, so you need a lot of Gs to separate them from each other, which means spinning a a centrifuge very, very, very fast. If you don't, the efficiency for each stage is too low, and you need far too many centrifuges.<br><br>As it stands, they have centrifuges now that spin at 100k rpms or so, and it still takes several hundred stages of refinement to get the concentrations to weapons grade. <br><br>Edit: This is my laymans understanding of the problem, and I welcome being shown wrong. </p>		</li>
