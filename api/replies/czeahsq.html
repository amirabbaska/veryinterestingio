			<p>He didn't summit Everest. He only ascended 3,100ft. Not that that isn't greatly impressive by any means, but I doubt even he could summit in just shorts.<br><br>What I found interesting and even more impressive is that he also reportedly ran a full marathon in the Namib Desert without any water. Learning how to increase the amount of heat you produce is one thing, but is he really able to <em>reduce</em> his body heat as well? That's just nuts.</p>		</li>

			<p>All I know is that he climbed everest. Whether it was 3100 feet or summit is moot at that point. The dude did it in shirts. <br><br>The thing in the desert was interesting to me as well. This guy has found something so primal that he's surpassed the typical human. </p>		</li>
