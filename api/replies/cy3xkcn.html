			<p>Would it destroy your destination as you arrived? I know what kind of energy would be needed to really make Alcubierre possible. Probably would destroy a whole star system, maybe more.<br><br>That being said, Alcubierre isn't much like the Warp Drive on Star Trek. Alcubierre doesn't accelerate a ship through space, it moves spacetime itself.</p>		</li>

			<p>Didn't people recently reevaluate the energy needed, and it is much, much smaller/lesser than Alcubierre originally predicted?<br></p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't really matter how little you need -finding more than 0 negative mass to make the drive work is almost certainly impossible.<br><br>The Alcubierre drive was designed to highlight loopholes in our understanding of physics, so that we can fix them. It is predicted that an eventual theory of quantum gravity will show that negative mass and the Alcubierre drive are impossible.<br><br>Similarly, I'd bet my house that what we get out of the EM drive is a better understanding of microwave ablation of copper.</p>		</li>

			<p>Well, the Alcubierre Drive doesn't necessarily need negative mass. Any type of negative energy density would do, as you are just trying to create a positive pressure (or is it negative? I always get my terms confused when it comes to negative vs positive pressures from energy contributions, bah) to &quot;stretch&quot; the space out. This is, in essence, what the cosmological constant does. As well as whatever drove inflation.<br><br>So, it's a bit of a jump to say it highlights a loophole in our current understanding of physics. In fact, it uses a rather well known facet of GR and the deformation of geometric spaces. Whether or not this stuff can actually be used engineered, however, is an entirely different question.</p>		</li>

			<p>Sort of! They discovered that if they quickly oscillated the leading edge of the bubble it sort of cuts through space like those turkey carvers.</p>		</li>

			<p>It doesn't matter how much negative energy you need because there is no indication that it exists</p>		</li>

			<p>Ok, this will be the nerdiest thing I've ever said, because it will be nerdy in both the actual universe, and a fictional one.<br><br>Star Trek warp drives operate by creating a warp bubble which allows them to travel FTL, while still existing in normal relativistic space. Technically it does this via some magic subspace gimmickry, but they still move through regular space, not around it. The warp bubble is what moves, the ship goes along for the ride. I'm not the first to draw this comparison.<br><br>As for how much damage an actual Alcubierre drive would do (if it has that side effect of collecting radiation), it would depend on how much distance you traveled, and where you did it. If you cruised through a solar system, you'd be concentrating a whole lot of solar radiation into one burst. Think several hours of sunlight released in a femtosecond. There's a lot of radiation in interstellar space too, in the form of background radiation or regular starlight.<br><br>It's pretty reasonable to expect that burst to sterilize a star system, which makes all that &quot;prime directive&quot; and first contact stuff a bit of a non issue. Depending on which direction that radiation is released in (probably omnidirectional), odds are you wouldn't survive turning off the drive.<br></p>		</li>

			<p>So what about in Stargate, where they do actually travel through subspace in their ships?</p>		</li>

			<p>From my understanding, hyperdrives allow a ship to travel faster than light by opening a portal to a sub-dimension where certain laws of physics do not apply.<br><br>Whether the creation/destruction of this portal releases any radiation is beyond me.</p>		</li>

			<p>They have ships too, and they travel through subspace. And there are episodes in Atlantis I believe where it's explained pretty well too.</p>		</li>

			<p>&quot;Through subspace&quot; isn't an explanation, it's hand-waving. Which I kind of appreciate from science fiction, because attempts to explain the &quot;impossible&quot; technology are usually completely incompatible with reality, which ruins the immersion for me.<br><br>I like Star Trek, but they do way too much technobabble which makes them seem less believable instead of more.</p>		</li>

			<p>Even a black hole can't break that particular law, unless we've dramatically misunderstood both black holes and physics in general. Unless you mean traveling faster than light, as opposed to moving. In that case, maybe black holes are also wormholes.</p>		</li>

			<p>No, I mean you'd collapse into a black hole; a black hole would be the phonic boom.<br><br>Even if you could circumvent the infinite energy requirements to actually move at <em>c</em> (as opposed to cheating with warp or moving in a medium) and thereby avoid your energy source from turning into a black hole; you would consist of infinite energy at that speed. Infinite energy density is just as effective at forming singularities as infinite mass density.</p>		</li>

			<p>You wouldn't even need anywhere near infinite energy to cause that problem, just enough to overcome your Schwarzschild radius. Though I honestly have no idea whether kinetic energy would work the same, since in the frame of reference of the ship, it doesn't gain additional mass from its own momentum relative to the rest of the universe.<br><br>BTW, there's a special name for black holes produced from energy: Kugelblitz. Probably my favorite science word ever. You may have already known that.</p>		</li>
