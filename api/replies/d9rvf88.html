			<p>Also, there is a massive push by the public to abandon all nuclear central, so building the non-existant central is not a priority... Even if you can be 100% sure that no explosion or leak can occur, people will think it is a new chernobil that is comming...</p>		</li>

			<p>&gt;There are five ways in which using breeder technology for reactors is a challenge; firstly, the capital costs are extremely high, at least 25% more than water cooled reactors amounting to $1,000 per kilowatt of power generation; secondly, safety issues are a concern, these reactors use a sodium coolant to make it efficient, but even a minor leak could rupture the tubes and lead to a major sodium-water fire; thirdly, plutonium breeder reactors produce more plutonium than they consume adding to proliferation problems; fourthly, breeder reactors need recycled plutonium, which can also be used for making nuclear weapons; fifthly, breeder reactors are useful to produce weapons grade plutonium directly, as done by France. <br><br>-<a href="http://www.ipcs.org/seminar/nuclear/modular-nuclear-reactors-and-breeder-technology-842.html" target="_blank">http://www.ipcs.org/seminar/nuclear/modular-nuclear-reactors-and-breeder-technology-842.html</a></p>		</li>

			<p>They are so expensive right now that this energy isn't cheep, though the fuel is much cheaper. There is only one energy breeder reactor right now in Russia. The problem is this: breeder reactor needs fast neutrons to work. Water slows neutrons too much, so you must go with other coolant. <br><br>Option one is Sodium. That sodium that goes on fire when contacts water. And you still must have sodium-water heat exchanger to produce steam for the turbine. You have burning hell in case of leak. This stuff is expensive, dangerous and hard to get working. Can you believe, they actually tried sodium reactors on subs! I wouldn't like to be intimate with hundreds tons of Sodium while deep underwater.<br><br>Option two is lead. Lead freezes at 327 degrees. We just came to technical possibility to get things working with this condition. This reactor shall be super-safe. If there is a leak, lead just freezes. Lead can transport enough heat to cool reactor in case of power breakdown just from natural convection. Russians are building prototype BREST-300.<br><br>Third option is lead-bismuth mix. It is very expensive, but easier to build because of the freezing point at 123 degrees. It is less safe and some of the bismuth becomes polonium in reactor. Polonium is nasty stuff. Very radioactive and micro grams will kill you just because of the toxicity. Russians actually ran lead-bismuth reactors at nuclear subs. How good those  were remains classified. Rumors are they had a lot of problems at start, but issues were eventually dealt with. Chinese claim they design low-power lead-bismuth reactor right now (project CLEAR/CLEAR-I).<br><br>Fourth option is gas cooling. I don't know in detail, but there were stations running in UK and Germany and other countries, they had engineering problems, they refused the idea. Those have to operate at 1000+ degrees coolant temperature, that's the main issue. Still, China plans building those.<br><br>Now, apart from all those engineering problems there is one bigger problem - breeder reactors are called breeders because they produce fuel themselves. Simplifying things much, it works like this: you have mix of cheap/waste uranium-238 and plutonium in the core. The reaction turns U-238 into more plutonium and plutonium decays to produce energy. The reaction also produces excessive neutrons. Those neutrons are used to convert more U-238 into Plutonium in a special breeding section (blanket). After some time you take this plutonium out, mix it with cheap/waste U-238 and put it in the core. It produces fuel for itself! But... You have available plutonium in the cycle. Like weapon-grade. You don't want to sell those reactors to Saudi Arabia. You have materials for nuclear weapons in commercial use now. There are new concept designs with nitride  fuel, that lets breeding right in the core, so all plutonium burns where it breeds, but that is a point of long and very  expensive research.<br><br>I am amateur nuclear enthusiast, so corrections and additions are welcome. Notice all those reactors, that I discuss, run on fresh new U-238, which is cheap. Extracting U-238 from nuclear waste and reusing it is the topic which makes similar wall of text. Anyways closed nuclear cycle is no closer now, than thermonuclear energy.</p>		</li>

			<p>This makes it sound like Russia and China are actually way ahead in these fields. Is that correct?<br><br>I wish they'd get the gas cooled ones working, because that'd bring us a step closer to practical fusion power. One of the (many) big problems there is how to handle the (exhaust) plasma/gases that are millions of degrees.</p>		</li>

			<p>It's not forbidden. <br><br>What happened was that carter put a ban in place which was repealed by Reagan. But at that point all the nuclear companies lost a ton of money trying to build reprocessing they said &quot;screw that&quot;. <br><br>Years later they looked into restarting reprocessing efforts, and now the NRC regulations became so nutty that it drove the costs up for the first license so high that it didn't make economic sense. It's legal, and the NRC recently started looking into what it would take to license, but even now there's no push for it because new uranium is still much cheaper and we have no national nuclear policy. </p>		</li>

			<p>It's part of a viable solution, but not a complete one.<br><br>Nuclear power really doesn't like to change it's load (needs on the order of hours to days and still not happy about it), so it's good to supply the base load of power. But without something than can change on the order of minutes or seconds to meet power demand (like natural gas, and a lesser extent coal), it's just not viable.<br><br>That said, an alternative solution would be if power storage worked on a large scale which would be useful in smoothing out the power demand curves to exactly what nuclear wants.</p>		</li>

			<p>Also, this is what <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinorwig_Power_Station" target="_blank">pumped storage</a> is for. Dinorwig was literally built to provide off-peak load when Britain was planning to build a lot of nuclear (which was then abandoned, but Dinorwig continues to provide Short Term Reserve). <br><br>So you can wind them down, or put the electric to good use during &quot;off&quot; hours, whether you're using it to pump hydroelectric, produce hydrogen or charge batteries.<br><br>Indeed, if/as electric cars become more prevalent overnight demand is likely to rise whilst those cars are being charged, reducing (though certainly not eliminating) the differential between daytime and overnight demand.</p>		</li>

			<p>Pumped storage is all good and dandy, but still loses energy due to inefficiency.

You lost efficiency, but it was probably better than spinning up a coal-fired turbine to cover the half-time surge of kettles going on. To an extent this is still applicable. You know you're going to get a surge from 5-10pm, might as well store overnight excess (even if there are losses) than burning more fossils to cover the peak.<br><br>&gt; As for electric car charging - there should really be a standard for the grid to communicate to cars to come online to begin charging - something like split-tariff, but individual household or small neighbourhood control to stagger the load. otherwise the load of all the cars coming online to charge at 7 will just create another peak, and taper off through the night, giving another lull period at 3am or something.<br><br>This is certainly true, and I think we're moving that way. The UK is pushing towards smart-metering for domestic electric, so smart-grids are an extension on that. In the UK the National Grid have already struck deals with large customers such as national hotel chains where they can basically turn their air-con off for an hour (Demand-Side Balancing). Doesn't seem like a big thing, but when you do that on a network of 1000 hotels you can start to manipulate MW worth of demand. From there it's a complex but no-brain route to scheduling/staggering blocks of demand - such as electric car charging.</p>		</li>

			<p>That ability to turn natural gas generators on and off very rapidly has played a big part in them becoming popular in the US. Super-cheap LNG released by fracking and a cleaner-than-coal story just seals the deal.<br><br>But, personally, I think we need to invest more in nuclear. It was horribly disappointing to see Germany walk away from nuclear in favor as massively sparse generation technologies.</p>		</li>

			<p>235U*<br><br>238 is the fertile isotope, 235 is the fissile isotope used. Typical enrichment is from 0.7% 235U in nature to ~4% for PWR/BWRs.<br><br>Normally fuel utilisation/burnup is limited by fission products/fertile plutonium generation - burnup of 30% would be very good. Plenty of fuel left over once you can separate out all the crap (still a higher % U235 than natural anyway)<br><br>Economics is the reason why we don't do it. Typically fuel is only about 5% of the total lifetime cost of a nuclear power plant. The cost is dominated by capital expenditures and operations/maintenance might only be ~10-15% of the cost. <br><br>In France/UK, we separate out the crap from the uranium/plutonium and that is what is true &quot;nuclear waste&quot;, as can't burn the crap. <br><br>The plutonium and uranium mix can be further burned in newer reactors as &quot;MOX&quot; (Mixed OXide fuel) after being reprocessed with more uranium. <br><br>Again, making MOX and reprocessing fuel costs money...and when we have so much cheap natural uranium already, there's no incentive to do it. <br><br></p>		</li>
