		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>In water, the speed of light is about 75% that of the speed of light in a vaccum. If we get a particle to go faster than this in water(which we can), then a phenomenon known as Cherenkov radiation occurs. This is effectively a &quot;photonic&quot; boom, and it emits a bluish-white light containing a wide, nearly flat continuous spectrum of emitted photons. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Yes. When light travels through a medium with a refractive index greater than 1; it travels a a speed less than c. But a charged particle like an electron may be able to move quicker than light through this medium. This is the basis of Cherenkov radiation which is a similar equivalent of a 'light boom'.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Since we're talking ridiculous physics once the speed of light is broken anyway, I'm going to pull some stuff out of my ass for a slightly different answer than I've seen so far ITT. <br><br>Light definitely Doppler shifts, meaning long wavelengths 'stack' into short ones or vice versa when emitted by a moving object. If relativistic frequency conversion holds post-light speed (who the Hell knows if it would?) then as long as you're travelling only a <em>bit</em> faster than light, you'll be stacking super-high energy photons around yourself. At this point, if the photons interact with the matter of your spaceship or whatever, or with each other in the appropriate momentum directions, you can get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter_creation" target="_blank">matter creation</a>. The created matter and antimatter could quickly recombine and release gamma rays in all directions, or if you give them enough energy they could fly apart and go on to exist and long-lived matter and antimatter particles. <br><br>This means that instead of a light cone, you could be flying along in a Hellstorm of matter-antimatter annihilation, gamma rays and high energy baryonic matter. That's only if you're travelling a <em>bit</em> faster than light though. <br><br>If you're going way faster than light then you might return to what you would more classically expect a light cone to look like. But probably not, because you're in hyperspace and everything is nonsense at this point anyway. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
