		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Noone here mentioned the Geotechnical strength of the gravel used for railroad tracks and why it is incredibly stable.<br><br>Gravel at rock quarries is sold in sizes and mixes. Mixes include different quantities of different sizes of rock which display different qualities, such as stability, strength, filtration, and drainage.<br><br>Certain mixes are incredibly stable. With certain mixes you can fill a bucket with rocks and hold in place about 25% of the surface rocks with a flat plate or something and then tip the bucket upside down and none of the rocks will fall out.<br><br>A mix like above is very easy to achieve and rock quarries are able to easily create these mixes in large quantities. In many cases it might not require any mixing at all. The natural creation of the gravel from rock may provide the correct size and shape ratios to meet the requirements for this strength. <br><br>Soil and rock mechanics (Geotechnical Engineering) is one sub-field of civil engineering.<br><br>Another one that wasnt mentioned is post construction compaction. Gravel and the ground beneath the gravel dissipates the load over a larger area at about a 2:1 ratio of spread to depth. The gravel won't be compacted and the ground won't be compacted any further because the weight is dissipated. <br><br>There are many many reasons for using gravel mentioned by others such as moisture/water flow problems such as erosion, freeze/thaw, expansion and compaction from wet and dry conditions. Different soils have different properties depending on differences in chemical content that would have to be tested for quality control which would not be good enough. If a train derails it could easily cause a disaster. <br><br>Why not other materials? Price and environmental damage from those materials. <br><br>Certain types of dirt such as Montmorillonite Clay can cause huge amounts of expansion/contraction to occur while wet or dry and have enough strength to move huge buildings up and down several inches to a foot or two. That would be a disaster for a train and it would be hard to prevent and test for those types of clays, organic soils, and such from being used by mistake. Gravel several orders of magnitude more safe than compacted dirt. <br><br>There are even more reasons than this why Gravel is vastly superior to existing ground or other materials.<br><br>Source: Im a civil engineer and the above information is accurate and should contain all the most relevant reasons why gravel is used instead of other options.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Hi, I work in the signaling department for KCS, and I'm currently getting trained on designing crossing locations for the road.  <br><br>The first day of training we discussed the ballast (rock) and why it is used.  The manual we are learning from briefly discusses ballast as &quot;stone chips that are packed underneath and around the ties (wooden planks) to hold them steady and keep them in place&quot;.  It also provides a way to keep water away and vegetation away.  <br><br>But most importantly, at least for my department, there is an electrical current running along most tracks to form a circuit to provide an indication that a train is coming to the crossing.  To briefly explain how these work, we use a bungalow that house a GCP 3000 or 4000, or if it's recent enough an XP4, a frequency of current is selected that runs along the track to a shunt.  This shunt ends the circuit and whenever anything comes between the two on the track it begins to shunt the circuit.  This is detected in the bungalow and the computer calculates an estimation of how long he train will take to get there.  <br><br>This In turn starts the flashers and bells, if there is a gate arm, it will descend after a 3 second delay to allow traffic to clear from the crossing and then block the crossing from automotive traffic.  <br><br>So why rocks? Well with all of this incredibly important electrical work on the lines, it is incredibly important that we protect this circuit from shorting on its own (there are fail-safes that can eventually figure out what it's sensing is not a train) and causing a false crossing activation.  It was already there to keep ties in place, and it doubles up effectiveness for insulation on the track circuits themselves.  <br><br>Tl;dr rocks are used as ballast to keep the ties in place, which keep the rails in place.  They also help provide insulation from outside things to keep the track circuit in working order.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Nobody has mentioned freeze/thaw cycles yet. For starters, frozen pools of water can put immense forces on the supporting subgrade, causing small deformations over time that would lead to tracks no longer being straight. Secondly, since trains are so heavy, gravel is used to distribute the weight of the train over a larger surface area of dirt. Think about it. If you applied a 20 ton load to a railroad tie that was sitting in dirt or mud, it could be pushed deeper into the mud. You can't have that. But if there's 2 feet of gravel under the railroad tie, the force will be applied to a greater surface area of dirt and will be less likely to deform. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Railroad ballast is also not just any old &quot;gravel&quot;.  There are detailed specifications regarding the number of &quot;fracture faces&quot; as a proportion of the overall mix.  If for instance a small rock goes through the crusher and is broken in half, each resulting half has a single fracture face.  As I recall, the specs on a job I worked on years ago called for at least 30% of the rock component of the gravel have three or more fracture faces.  This is to help the gravel &quot;lock in&quot; like puzzle pieces and better withstand the various stresses placed on the grade by the tie system.<br><br>Source - I worked on a rock crusher a couple of decades ago...</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>For starters, gravel is much more stable than you would think. It is used widely in many construction applications. The reason gravel is used so often is that it does a really good job of draining water away from the structure that is built on it. Instead of building train tracks straight into the dirt, a layer of gravel is used so rainwater seeps through instead of pooling around the train tracks. This slows down the rusting of the tracks. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>So I didn't get through all the comments to see if someone mentioned this but I will give my 2 cents on it. <br><br>I am a civil engineer but do not work on railroad track design. However, I would assume certain principles to be applied to this. <br><br>When designing a foundation for road design which is basically what railroad tracks are you need a sturdy foundation.  <br><br>1) What makes a good foundation is a soil with strong enough property to support the weight of the trains (which is much larger than roads). Many roads will have deep base foundation (under either asphalt or concrete) consisting mainly of gravel. Gravel is a good source in the U.S. because it is available and cost effect while having good strength properties. <br><br>2) You want a foundation that will not swell or absorb water. Gravel is a non cohesive soil unlike clay which will swell and shrink depending on its water content. Gravel drains quickly and will not have the effects clay does (which many areas have clay in the soil). <br><br>3) The gravel is probably stacked high because of the weight it must support and also for the same reason that you want your house foundation to be higher than the soil... to allow good drainage and prevent water to collect. <br><br>4) Gravel also will not compact like other soils will due to weight loads and vibration or moisture content<br><br>5) The last factor I can think of is the longevity of the material is very good. Asphalt's life span depends on compaction which would be very quick with the high loads of trains and concrete has issue with what's called freeze thaw cycle and not too mention the costs of crude oil or steel required for either method. <br><br>6) Time is much easier to lay out gravel then most other methods. <br><br>So gravel is actually quite a good option considering these factors for a material to build railroads on. Especially when considering the different climates throughout the country. Remember engineering isn't about what you can do, it's about what you can do with time and cost. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Most of the structural/drainage/vegetation things have been answered here, and decently well too.<br><br>But nobody has told you why it is called ballast. The term doesn't come from the rail industry, but from the marine industry. <br><br>So ships are designed to carry a certain load. They have to have that cargo weight or they will sit too high in the water and can even become unstable in rough seas. <br><br>So often, they would leave carrying a cargo, but would have nothing to bring back on the return trip. So what they would do is literally fill the ship with rocks which was called ballast. <br><br>When they would get back to the US they would simply dump the ballast into a big pile so they could load up on cargo again.  It was the material from these ballast piles that was used as the base material for some of the earliest railroad tracks, which is why a term as seemingly out of place as 'ballast' is still used in the rail industry today. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>If the rails were simply attached to the ties which were laid directly on the soil the whole track system would quickly sink into the earth. The track system needs to have a foundation to support it and hold it in place.  Gravel is cheap, heavy, easily transportable, pourable and resistant to being displaced. No mixing, forming or curing of the foundation is needed. The gravel does sink into the earth over time and the track system does settle and shift  but since it is not affixed to the foundation it can be easily lifted and moved back into position without disassembling it. More gravel can be poured in the process and ties replaced. Gravel allows for flexibility in the track system to compensate for heavy loads and extreme vibration.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
