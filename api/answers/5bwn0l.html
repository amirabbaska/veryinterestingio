		<p>&gt;It still produces heat so can't it be used in a BWR reactor again?<br><br>Well do you mean to extract energy from the <em>decay heat</em> or by further fission reactions?<br><br>In principle the waste from a BWR is mostly uranium with a proportion of ^(238)U larger than natural. The decay heat will produce a little bit of energy. But even better, you can use this remaining uranium in a breeder reactor.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<p>You can recover reusable material from nuclear waste in most reactors - the Sellafield plant in Britain has a Thermal Oxide Reprocessing Plant that has a 97% recovery rate. It achieves this by operating a PUREX (Plutonium and Uranium Recovery by EXtraction) system to separate plutonium and uranium from unusable waste.   <br><br>There are other recovery methods too, like TRUEX and UREX, for pulling different sorts of materials out of the waste, but PUREX has the most significant return.  <br>Unfortunately, the THORP in Sellafield is closing due to obsolescence, but there are other reprocessing plants in the world.<br><br><a href="http://www.sellafieldsites.com/solution/spent-fuel-management/thorp-reprocessing/" target="_blank">Here's</a> the main website for Sellafield's THORP, if you're interested.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<p>CANDU reactors can reuse material. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU_reactor" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CANDU_reactor</a><br><br>CANDU reactors can actually use the waste of BWR as fuel.<br><br>CANDU reactors also have a lot of other great benefits with probably the most useful being &quot;live refueling&quot;. Many designs require batch refueling resulting in downtime of the reactor. CANDU reactors can refuel while running.<br><br>CANDU reactor designs were created in the 1950s and 1960s. We've had viable solid technology in this space for decades but thanks to stupid legislation and licensing deals . . . The USA doesn't have a single CANDU.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<p>Answer:</p>
		<p>If you are talking about decay heat, typically within 3-5 minutes after the scram, you have insufficient decay heat to drive the generator and power the plant's own busses. <br><br>Decay heat is not sufficient to continue power generation at any meaningful level. You can run small auxiliary feed turbines or battery chargers, and that's about it, and after a few days you may not have enough decay steam to even drive those systems. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<p>Answer:</p>
		<p>It depends on kind of waste. Russia has working breeder reactor, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN-800_reactor" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN-800_reactor</a> that you can say does exactly this. Using waste of traditional reactors to produce energy. And much smaller amount of waste, that really should be stored somewhere ( at least until we don't know how to reprocess that)</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<p>Answer:</p>
		<p>Breeder reactors can only use certain types of spent nuclear <em>fuel</em>. Nuclear <em>waste</em> isn't just spent fuel though, it's heavily irradiated machine parts, cooling fluids and what-not, all of which must be regularly replaced and disposed of as well.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<p>Answer:</p>
		<p>It is a very valuable potential fuel in fact, which is why proposed schemes for disposing of nuclear waste deep underground, in oceanic trenches, and other such places where it cannot be recovered from are insanity IMO. <br><br>Also, using depleted uranium for ammunition is extremely stupid for the same reason -- why pulverize all that U-238 into the environment....<br><br>Anyway, others in the thread have already pointed out the problems:<br><br>1. There are technical issues that haven't been fully worked out and need to be in order to make breeder reactors widespread. But this is a technical problem and one that has solutions. <br>2. The bigger problem is political and has to do with the proliferation of weapon-grade plutonium production. <br><br>However, 2) is not really a technical problem and in the kind of sane rational world in which breeders would be widespread, it would not really be a problem.

		<p>Answer:</p>
		<p>Having been taught by a prof working on it, yes and no. Reactors are not the sort of machine you want to throw any old crap into - this is why, not even getting to efficiency, waste isn't thrown back into the reactors.<br><br>However, if one could separate the actinides and lanthanides, you could plausibly throw the radioactive parts back in and safely dispose of everything that isn't.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<p>Answer:</p>
		<p>Late to the party, but about fast reactors, Russa has a BN-600 running for some years now, they just started commercial operation of a BN-800 and have two BN-1200 in project.  <br>France, Japan and US abandoned their fast reactor programs on cost and safety concerns.  <br>On using the decay heat, here is a <a href="http://josephmiller.typepad.com/.a/6a014e86f76033970d014e870c069a970d-pi" target="_blank">chart</a> of how much heat is produced by one ton of used fuel. So basically, for about 10 years after discharge, you can expect several kW per ton (and the more you got energy from the fuel in the reactor, the more energy it will give after discharge). So a single 4 ton assembly out of the reactor (which contains few hundreds of them) could be roughly equivalent to a <a href="http://www.small-windturbine.com/Horizontal-Wind-Turbine-Generators-ECO-10000W-ECO-10KW.htm" target="_blank">wind turbine</a> spining 24/7 for ten years. The punch line: we are actually spending money/energy/pollution to cool stuff that produce heat for free.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<p>Answer:</p>
		<p>Yes. What we call nuclear waste is not waste. It is only depleted fuel. But there remains enough material to make electricity. The depleted fuel would be used in a Fast Breeder Reactor. <br><br>France uses these kinds of plants. How ever the issue with that is that the waste material can be used from making nuclear bombs. Which is why the US doesn't recycle it as it is part of a non proliferation treaty.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<p>Answer:</p>
		<p>Nuclear waste is primarily U-238 as well as other byproducts that have too much mass to react with slow neutrons compared to U-235. A fast breeder reactor doesnt use a neutron moderator (device used to slow down neutron speeds to prevent chain reactions from getting out of hand) so the neutrons will be able to move fast enough to react with U-238. These types of reactors are self-sustaining and produce no nuclear waste. <br><br>The downside to this is a few things...<br><br>Nuclear proliferation is one of the big two reasons: one of the largest forms of energy from an FBR is plutonium 239 which can be converted from fuel grade to weapon grade plutonium relatively easily. Since so much Pu-239 is produced, nuclear proliferation is a massive issue and theres a nuclear proliferation agreement between all the major and minor powers in the world. China, Russia, India, Korea and a few other countries have already started building FBRs again and ignoring the nuclear proliferation agreement, but the US is the last major power upholding that. The issue is we want to be a &quot;role model&quot;country and not encourage production of Pu-239 from FBRs.<br><br>The second issue is cost. FBR's will cost a lot more to construct since more dense metals have to be used to contain the reaction and the coolant. Among all the little details, the coolant is the largest issue. Almost all LWRs (light water reactors) use a neutron moderator which is a fancy word for water, and they use water as the coolant as well. An FBR cant use water since its a neutron moderator therefore they must use various liquid metals such as liquid sodium, or new methods like gasses. <br><br>The current generation of nuclear reactors are primarily LWRs due to their cost and safety, but the next gen of nuclear reactors are going to be mainly fast reactors allowing them to recycle nuclear waste. <br><br>If you want to learn more about FBRs in the US then I suggest reading about EBR-II (experimental breeder reactor 2). Its an interesting story on a successful FBR in the US. <br><br>If you want to read more about other FBRs, then Russia has had the most success with them in recent years, and China is coming close in second. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<p>Answer:</p>
		<p>Yes, quite easily. France and europe have been using breeder reactors to recycle fuel back into useable fuel rods for decades. The only reason the US doesn't do it is because they banned them out of fear 40 years ago.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
