		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The images intrigued me, so I've looked into your query. It went a bit beyond chemistry, but science often does that, with phenomena crossing over between fields.<br><br>First, it's important to note that this is not a crystalline solid, but rather an amorphous solid that you have: it's not a crystal structure / habit that's directing the structure that you have here! As coconut oil is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coconut_oil#Composition_and_comparison" target="_blank">composed of a mixture of different fatty acids</a>, it's highly unlikely that you would obtain a single crystal from it -- although sometimes single components may selectively crystallize: <em>e.g.</em> you can observe one component of olive oil precipitate when cooled.<br><br>So we have a different process directing the structure here. It should be noted that hexagonal packing in 2D is the most efficient, hence it tends to be a natural default. But first let's look at why it's not just a continuous solid...<br><br><br>Typically (although water is not typical!) when a liquid solidifies, its density increases. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauric_acid" target="_blank">Lauric acid</a>, the main component in coconut oil has a density of 1.007 g/cm^3 at 24 C, while at 50 C, it's density is 0.8679 g/cm^3 . That means as the liquid cools and solidifies, it is also contracting. When a material contracts due to temperature differences, it can create significant stress, as exemplified with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPetc9bpu5s" target="_blank">this hot Pyrex measuring cup being quickly cooled with cold water, and shattering</a> because of the stress induced quickly cooling.<br><br>If we envision a surface contracting in 2D, there are two possible modes of contraction: either the whole sheet/surface can contract (essentially scaling down to a smaller version -- rare/unlikely), or the contraction can be localized (occurring at multiple points). Here's a <a href="http://www.gly.uga.edu/railsback/1121ColumnarJointing.jpeg" target="_blank">figure illustrating whole-sheet contraction vs localized contraction</a>. On average, the centres of contraction (when localized) will be <a href="http://www.nvcc.edu/home/cbentley/shenandoah/columnar_jointing.jpg" target="_blank">equally-spaced</a>, resulting in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram" target="_blank">Voronoi diagram</a> which breaks the surface into polygons - if the centres are all equally spaced, the Voronoi diagram will be packed hexagons, such as in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/ESQqQTf.gif" target="_blank">these breath figure patterns</a> (source doi: <a href="http://www.doi.org/10.1021/la035915g" target="_blank">10.1021/la035915g</a>). <br><br>The columnar shape is formed because there is a distinct direction of heat flow, with the material cooling from top to bottom, as shown in <a href="http://www.engr.usask.ca/~reeves/prog/geoe118/images/joint4.gif" target="_blank">this figure</a>. The result is that the joints (edges of the pologons; fissures; cracks) propagate downward as the (cooler) temperature front progresses toward the bottom of the jar. From the image posted, it appears that the joints are filled with higher-melting fatty acids. <br><br>The result of this process of <em>cooling, contraction, and joint formation</em> can actually be observed in nature in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basalt#Columnar_basalt" target="_blank">columnar basalt</a> (also referred to as &quot;columnar jointing&quot; of basalt). Examples such as <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/31/Drury_-_View_of_the_Giant%27s_Causeway.jpg" target="_blank">Giant's Causeway</a> in Ireland or <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/46/Devils_Tower_CROP.jpg" target="_blank">Devil's Tower</a> in Wyoming. You can read up a bit about columnar basalt in <a href="http://blogs.agu.org/georneys/2012/11/18/geology-word-of-the-week-c-is-for-columnar-jointing/" target="_blank">this post</a> by the American Geophysical Union, or <a href="http://www.wired.com/2010/10/columns-not-just-for-basalt-anymore/" target="_blank">this good roundup from 2010</a> in Wired. Given the connection to columnar basalt, I think that we should actually get a specialist in geology to comment here...<br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The same formation happens with cooling magma forming hexagonal pillars.  The ease is because each hexagon is a localized area where convection is happening (coconut oil gets hot, rises, cools, then falls) and each hexagonal column is doing that independently.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I hope this is relevant enough to comment. I took pictures at my Job (I work as an overnight grocery stocker). It was a curious sight to see for me and always enjoy stocking the coconut oil as the ones that have been shelved for a few days will turn solid white yet the fresh jars I put on the shelves will begin to solidify very very slowly in a seemingly solid lump, Quite different from OP's.<br><br>On the left is a jar that has been on the shelves for a few days and on the right is a jar that was just shelved at the time.<br><br><a href="http://imgur.com/U8l66A8" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/U8l66A8</a></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I'm going to disagree with most of the other responses and point you towards the phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh%E2%80%93B%C3%A9nard_convection" target="_blank">Bénard cells</a>. Essentially, small temperature differences in the coconut oil lead to small density differences which self-organize into falling and rising regions. As you heat and cool the jar, you can develop temperature differences between the interior regions and the surface... it doesn't heat and cool uniformly, the temperature has to propagate.<br><br>If the surface were cracked I would point more towards contraction on cooling, and that would be my first pass explanation as to why the boundary regions between the hexagons have a lower surface height than the middle of the hexagons. But at the size scales you're looking at in the coconut oil jar, thermal contraction without convection isn't enough to explain the formation of the hexagon columns. Likewise, the size scale is too large to be explained by surface tension and the Marangoni effect.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Its called a dissipative structure. Wiki: A dissipative structure is a dissipative system that has a dynamical régime that is in some sense in a reproducible steady state. This reproducible steady state may be reached by natural evolution of the system, by artifice, or by a combination of these two.<br><br><br><br>In other words, the systems will always adopt a state where it dissipates energy in the most efficient manner. In this case it happens to be hexagons.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>From what I can recall the change in solid structure after melting and solidifying again has to do with how the coconut oil was produced. Cold pressed oil will have a more uniform solid structure. <br><br>Then in the process of melting some of the fats denaturize or some similar process occurs that changes the structure of some of the fats. From what I remember, this is why many believe cold pressed oil is healthier for you. Don't have any sources, on mobile, will dive deeper later.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>This is similar to crystal nucleation. There is a tiny impurity floating in the oil, and when the oil cools, it solidifies there first. Then that solid chunk grows until it runs into another one growing in the opposite direction. It is true that this fat is not a crystal, however it does have some long-range order to it. Meaning that the long chains of fats are lining up with each other as they cool--they sort of settle into an ordered arrangement. You will notice that the size of the pillars changes at the edge where it's against the glass. There would have been more nucleation sites ln the surface of the glass, and a much faster cooling rate. I agree with Murphy's lab that the columnnar shape is due to top-down cooling.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
