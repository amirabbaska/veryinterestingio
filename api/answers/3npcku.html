		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>You're probably smelling molecules that are oxidized. Many compounds can react with oxygen in the presence of a metal. That metal acts as a catalyst to facilitate the reaction, and you can smell the oxidized byproduct. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Others here have done a great job explaining what you're actually smelling, but I would like to temper your assumption that solids, even metals, don't have some tiny probability of losing constituent particles from their matrix. They do indeed. The reason incandescent light bulb filaments are made of tungsten is that, out of all the elements, it has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressures_of_the_elements_\(data_page)" target="_blank">highest vapor pressure</a> of all elements. Of course, this regards its performance at the high temperature of the filament, so the other explanations here are what accounts for the perception of metallic smells under normal conditions.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>&quot;Overall “skin–iron odor” mechanism: The metallic odor from iron contacting skin is surprisingly a type of human body odor. Sweaty skin corrodes iron metal to form reactive Fe2+ ions that are oxidized within seconds to Fe3+ ions while simultaneously reducing and decomposing existing skin lipidperoxides to odorous carbonyl hydrocarbons that are perceived as a metallic odor. This fast reaction creates the sensory illusion that it is the “metal in itself” that we smell right after touching it. Similar mechanisms underlie the skin– metal odors of iron, copper, and brass used as every-day objects.&quot;</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The crystal structure of most metals is such that one or more of the electrons in the metal atoms electron shells are released free into the crystal lattice. These electrons are sometimes referred to as the &quot;electron gas&quot;. Their mobility in the crystal lattice are the reasons metals are good conductors of both electricity and heat. The free movement of these electrons means they are also on the surface of the metallic object where they are easily taken up by other molecules and drive reactions. The &quot;metallic smell&quot; of some metals is the production of trace quantities of O3 (Ozone) from atmospheric oxygen. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">
