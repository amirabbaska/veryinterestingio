		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You basically can't infer anything that specific from a single event. That's the whole essence of the difference between weather and climate; at any single moment the weather in one place doesn't tell you a whole lot that is useful about the weather somewhere else. Only over time can you identify any kind of pattern.</p>
<p>If you are asking about the recent cold-snap in North America? Yes, it was definitely the case that cold and warm were just distributed differently. Several articles recently had great world-map visuals of that, like <a href="https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-12-29/yes-its-freezing-climate-change-still-real" target="_blank">this one</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To echo what others are saying: Yes, although it's been colder than usual in the Eastern US, it's been even hotter in Alaska, the Western US and Siberia. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/vwv0vnv.png" target="_blank">Here's a map</a> of today's temperature anomalies, which shows how much deviation from usual temperatures there's been for various places around the planet. Overall, the planet is +0.5Â° C warmer than usual.</p>
<p>Some more background, though: It's no coincidence that the Eastern US is cold while the Western US &amp; Alaska are hot. This is likely part of a build-up to another North American dipole, also known as the Ridiculously Resilient Ridge - you can read more about it <a href="http://weatherwest.com/archives/5982" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The summary is that a warm body of water sets up off the coast of British Columbia / south of Alaska. This creates <a href="https://i.imgur.com/5kVV9xg.jpg" target="_blank">an upper level ridge</a> of high pressure, and the jetstream comes in from the west and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Xye7fZM.jpg" target="_blank">has to steer around</a> the high, creating a standing wave. The result is that Alaska gets much warmer weather than usual on the jetstream's upswing, while the Eastern US gets much colder polar air from the jetstream's downswing. The fact that the jetstream misses California in the process means less moisture is coming in, which has been causing the drought there, leading to forest fires, etc.</p>
<p>Exactly why this standing wave has been set up in a recent years - and why it's so resilient - has been a open question that we don't fully understand yet. Maybe it's related to climate change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen the data yet, but usually associated with the temp dropping in the continental US is a warming at the poles.  Basically the heat energy of the sun creates temperature differentials which gets converted to wind which sends cold arctic air down to the country.  That artic air gets replaced by relatively warm air off the pacific, which tends to warm the polar regions.</p>
<p>At the end of the year, I would be unsurprised to see global average temperatures still rising despite the weather anomaly.</p>
<p>The more energy in the system, the more erratically you should see the nonlinear weather system acting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The specific cold spell that we're going through right now is caused by a shift in the polar vortex.  The polar vortex is a body of cold air that usually stays over the polar region.  </p>
<p>You can check the temperature in Northern Greenland when this happens, and it'll be higher than the temperature for much of the United States.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the way the earth rotates and is angled towards the sun, when it is winter in northern hemisphere it is summer in southern hemisphere and at this point the earth is closer to the sun then when it is summer for the northern hemisphere. So basically the weather is more extreme in southern hemisphere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
