		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is extremely broad. Your question will most likely be interpreted as:</p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;How do Astronomers get spectra of specific objects when there are other objects nearby?&quot; </p>
<p>The answer to that is, we just block out the other light. Here's an example of an SDSS plate that takes a bunch of spectra from one &quot;Image&quot;. Keep in mind SDSS is a specific survey, but plates are relatively common in the Astronomy world. I'm just using SDSS plates as an example. There's a few other methods, but this one is the most obvious and a very commonly used one. </p>
<p><a href="http://blog.sdss.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/platez.png" target="_blank">SDSS plate visualization</a></p>
<p><a href="http://shine.wp.st-andrews.ac.uk/files/2015/09/plate6612_small.jpg" target="_blank">Actual sdss plate</a></p>
<p>Basically SDSS people know exactly where each object is, and hook up a bunch of fiber optic cables to the back of each hole in the plate. Then you can take 100 spectra in one image because you're only getting the light from one object in each cable. This is just a large scale use of this method. </p>
<p>Also keep in mind that spectra for different objects are vastly different. </p>
<p><a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/Starlog/imgsta/otype.gif" target="_blank">spectra of O-type star</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.martin-nicholson.info/sloan/m3.jpg" target="_blank">spectra of M-type star</a></p>
<p><a href="https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Charlton/Figures/figure1.jpeg" target="_blank">spectra of super-massive-distant quasar object</a></p>
<p>So it's pretty hard to mistake what exactly you're looking at if you've got spectra. If you have a field of stars they're usually separated enough to isolate their light, and their spectra are unique enough to clearly distinguish them. Galaxies are equally unique, as are any other of the objects in the sky. If you have a spectra of a galaxy it's pretty clear when a star shows up in it because of the giant peak of light, usually at specific wavelengths for specific elements that are emitting in that spectra. </p>
<hr />
<p>&quot;When taking images of objects in space, how do you tell that you have the right object?&quot; </p>
<p>Scales are pretty vastly different. [This isn't a spectra, just a color filter. The Stars in this image are all the bright points of light with little crosses. There are a lot of methods to pretty easily filter out unwanted light from stars in the way.] (<a href="http://www.astrophoto.net/images/uncalibrated_frame.jpg" target="_blank">http://www.astrophoto.net/images/uncalibrated_frame.jpg</a>) If you're trying to take images or spectra of galaxies, you'll notice at one point your data is super bright and screwed up. You can either ignore it or filter it out. To filter it out you can take a lot of images from all the unwanted stuff, images of the wanted stuff, subtract the two, and you're left with the wanted stuff. </p>
<p>edit:
When you have a star field and you're attempting to take images through a filter, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7osvex/how_do_scientists_make_sure_that_the_light_they/dscdtb8/" target="_blank">look at this post</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a fair bit of noise associated with any astronomical observation. There will be a base level of random photons being received from the sky that have to be subtracted at any given point before you can measure the source you are interested in. These could be scattered in the atmosphere or simply be from other faraway sources in the line of sight. </p>
<p>However perhaps the real answer to the question is that all things being equal light travels in a straight line, so we know that nearly all the light we receive must have come from the very direction we are pointing the telescope. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only reasons you'd be getting light from any other body into your telescope are that you're looking at the wrong object or the atmosphere/clouds/dust is causing light from the wrong source to reach you.
The way to avoid that is to build your telescope as high as possible or send a telescope to space.
In a vacuum, light always travels in a straight line, so you get light from whatever your telescope is pointing at. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallax" target="_blank">parallax</a>.  Hold up your thumb as far as you can, close one eye, then point your thumb directly at something thin and close like the edge of a door or a the stand of a lamp.  Then close that eye and open the other.  The object will seem to move.  This is because the two eyes are in different places, so they make a different angle with your thumb.  Try it with a cloud and mountain and it won't move, it is so far away the difference between the position of your eyes isn't enough to make it move.  So the change in apparent position when you move is less the farther away an object is.</p>
<p>The same is true for the Earth.  Over the course of a year, the Earth moves a great deal around the sun.  If the object was close, its position would seem to change relative to other objects over the course of a year.  If it is far, it wouldn't.  The amount it moves is proportional to how far away it is.  Historically, stars were too far away to have a parallax, but very sensitive modern instruments can measure the minute parallaxes available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really comes down to simply pointing the telescope correctly and using a very small field of view. That way you're only collecting light from the tiny part of the sky your star is in. How big the part of the sky you're observing is, is dependent on the telescope setup. </p>
<p>But, there will always be some background light in observations. If you have a good idea of what you're expecting to observe you can filer out things that are different, but background light is a huge limiting factor. Generally speaking the workaround is just not observing dim objects that are too close to bright ones, and build telescopes in places where the sky is very dark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
