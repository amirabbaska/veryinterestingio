		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a hugely debated question in the philosophy of mind. I think it's fair to say that the answer is far from clear. It may be the case that intentional states cannot be realized in physical systems. Trying to give a physicalist account of intentional states is an active research program in the philosophy of mind.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This strains the limits of ELI5 for the best possible reason. I like to believe that it’s true that if you can’t explain what you know to a 5yo (given obvious caveats) then you don’t really ‘know’ said thing. Since we really don’t know this it’s nearly impossible to ELI5. </p>
<p>Additionally, I’d like to take this opportunity to take a swipe at those who believe the coming ‘singularity’ means we will be able to port our consciousness onto a digital framework. We are so far from understanding, let alone modeling a bees cognition to imagine us doing the same for a human, seamlessly is truly delusional. A century from now? Maybe but I’d bet against. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, there are a bunch of things that work together when you decide to do something.</p>
<p>You need to learn about all of these parts and how they work together.</p>
<p>The first part you need to learn about is the thalamus. The thalamus is the part that first gets vision from your eyes, sound from your ears, smell from your nose, taste from your tongue and feelings of touch from all over your body. It also gets messages about your balance and whether or not you're moving from a little organ in your ear.</p>
<p>The thalamus organizes these senses and sends them to other parts of the brain, on the edges, called lobes, but it doesn't send all of them! It has little switches that either turn on or off based on how much power the senses have. For example, when we see movement it usually turns on more switches than the other stuff that we see which stands still. Because the brain can only send so many messages at a time, only the stuff that turns on a lot of switches will be sent out. It's sort of the same for smell and the other senses. Something that smells really good will turn on a lot of switches. That's why, for example, even though your nose is on all day, you don't notice it until someone starts cooking dinner. The switches are turning on, but way more switches are being turned on by stuff you are seeing or feeling.</p>
<p>Now we understand the first part played by the thalamus.</p>
<p>After it sends out the powerful sensations to the lobes, the lobes go into action.</p>
<p>The lobes also have a bunch of switches, but their switches organize in a different way. They turn on if the sensations have certain qualities. For example, when you see an object that is moving, there are some switches that turn on if the thing has edges and other switches that turn on if the thing has a face. These switches are different than the switches in the thalamus, because even if they are off they don't stop the signal. For example, you don't stop seeing a baseball even though baseballs don't have faces, you just know that it's not an animal. All the different lobes for the different senses do this if the thalamus sends them sensations. When they figure out the qualities of the stuff that is sensed, they then send the senses to parts of another part of the brain: the hippocampus (hippocampus is greek for seahorse because it's a part of the brain that is shaped like a little seahorse!).</p>
<p>The hippocampus also has a bunch of switches. These switches make up what we call memory. Here, in the hippocampus, the senses that have been chosen for their power in the thalamus and organized by their qualities in the lobes are checked by memory. If the pattern of on and off switches that they came from matches patterns of on and off switches in the hippocampus, we call it remembering! If they don't match patterns that we know, the hippocampus takes those patterns of on and off switches and leaves them alone for the future. If it keeps getting the pattern of something it doesn't remember, the pattern becomes a part of it. Now, when it gets the pattern, it will remember it.</p>
<p>This is how a lot of memories work, though not all of them. You remember things like how to ride a bike in a different way. We're not going to talk about that today, because I have a lot of chores to do besides explaining all of this. For now, only one type of memory will have to be enough.</p>
<p>Now, you want to now about how we decide to remember, and we will get to that, but first you need to understand that we remember stuff whether we want to or not. When we decide to remember, we still do the same thing, but we decide what we focus our senses on. If we want to remember some new words, we might look at the new words on paper and read them over and over. This makes the new pattern in the hippocampus, but have you ever noticed that it's hard to learn when there is a bunch of noisy people around? That's because the thalamus is still sending senses based on what the power of what our eyes, ears, nose, tongue and skin sense. If there is too much sound or bad smells, the stuff that we want to remember won't make it to the hippocampus. The other stuff will.</p>
<p>This still hasn't answered your question, though. In order to answer your question we have to learn about another part of the brain: the prefrontal lobes.</p>
<p>The prefrontal lobes have two main parts: a left and right side. The left side arranges words it has in patterns from the hippocampus in ways that that the hippocampus also has stored in patterns. For example, we know that a sentence in English needs a subject and verb. This is a pattern, and it's also stored in the form of a pattern. I know, this is getting really complicated, but hang in there. These words and the patterns about how we can arrange them help the left prefrontal cortex consider stuff. How do they do that? Well, this is sort of a tricky thing: the patterns of patterns are connected to other patterns, called associations, so that your memory of the word dog and your memories of dogs usually show themselves to the prefrontal cortex at the same time. Your memories of experiences with dogs, though, might show up in the right side of the prefrontal cortex. </p>
<p>The two sides are doing different things, but they talk to each other about what they are doing so that they stay coordinated. If, for example, you were ever scared by a dog, the right side might make sure that the left side doesn't make word patterns that say all dogs are nice. In this way, the two sides work together to make stories up about what could happen, what is happening, and what has happened. If these stories are strong enough, they can go into the hippocampus as patterns of patterns too. </p>
<p>Sometimes these two sides of the brain work in a different way. Sometimes the right side makes up images, smells, tastes, feelings and sounds, and the left side tries to make up sentences to describe it. We call this imagination. Sometimes we imagine something that we want but that hasn't happened, and the left part of the brain figures out a pattern that explains how to make it happen. For example, if I imagine a casserole, the left and right side might work together by trying to remember the list of words that has all the ingredients and the memory of whether or not I have them.</p>
<p>Now you are starting to understand how all the switches work, but we haven't talked about the switches in the prefrontal cortex. That's because we don't really understand how all of those work together. Maybe the thalamus just sends us the powerful sensations, and then the rest of the parts figure out what to do according to what we remember. For example, if we get hunger senses, the hippocampus might just send patterns about hunger to the prefrontal cortex, which will then check the hippocampus for memories about what to do when you're hungry. When it does this, it might also have other things that it is working on, so it might focus on those instead. The truth is that this part of how the brain works is even more complicated! The switches turn on and off, but they aren't exactly like the switches in either the hippocampus, the other lobes, or the thalamus. </p>
<p>They are similar in that they have switches that turn on and off, but they turn on and off based on sending messages back and forth with different parts of the brain constantly, including other switches that are also in the prefrontal cortex. I can't really explain that part very well yet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Computational mind theory would say that it works similar to how data is stored on a computer, but instead of transistors the bioelctrical networks in the brain store information. </p>
<p>Asking this question brings a cascade of questions from the nature of conscious thought  all the way to the deterministic/non deterministic nature of the universe. Perhaps the two concepts are inextricably linked, but that's another good question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
