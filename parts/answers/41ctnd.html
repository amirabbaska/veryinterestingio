		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In%C5%8D_Tadataka" target="_blank">japanese cartographer</a> who had trained to always have the same step length, no matter of the ground he was walking on. From around 1800 until his death in 1818 he walked tens of thousands of kilometers and created a complete (well, almost, he died shortly before all the work was done) and very accurate map of japan that was in use for over 100 years. Pretty awesome stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You ever see construction workers with those surveying tools? Usually a pair of workers, one pointing a telescope-type thing at another worker holding a post? They're using the same techniques used to make most maps.</p>
<p>You start with some known location, typically the top of a hill that's visible and distinct from a lot of places. From there, you can directly measure the distance and bearing to a different, similar place. Now, with two known places, you can go to a third location with your telescope (or theodolite) and determine the position of your new location based on the angle between the two known locations.</p>
<p>You keep doing this, building up a database of more and more well-identified locations, which makes it easier to identify even more new locations, and you can plot out the geography very accurately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They used <em>triangulation</em>, or measuring triangle shapes. You start by picking two places, and measuring, with a measuring chain, rod or a trundle wheel, the distance between them. Then you choose a third point that you can see from both places, and measure all the angles. Then using mathematics, you can calculate the location of that third point. Then you keep on measuring angles from your known points to find the location of further points.</p>
<p>Eventually you have mapped out triangles all over your country, you know the shape of the triangles and the location of every point, and you can draw an accurate map of your country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic compass, geometry compass, good rulers, and a sextant. To a lesser extent, the telescope.</p>
<p>The invention of time keeping devices that could keep time on board a ship were a huge boon!</p>
<p>Latitude is easy, the sun and north star allow very precise determination--to within a few hundred feet if you have sufficiently graduated instruments. Longitude is very difficult, but prior to the invention of good time keeping devices cartographers in more advanced nautical centers would use ships logs in aggregate to average sailing speeds and times recorded between ports to work out the &quot;best fit&quot; distance and make increasingly good guesses. Knowing the exact latitude helped them work out with a pretty good level of accuracy the likely longitude--by using geometry (that whole Pythagorean theorem and related postulates).</p>
<p>Using a telescope the moon's of Jupiter were used to &quot;time&quot; to within a few minutes the local vs. home port time; occultations of stars by planets, eclipses, transits of the sun, etc were also used to refine the estimates of longitude between distant ports as those events were either known ahead of time, or could be referred back to if records were kept in both locations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP is asking about the improvements in world maps starting in the 16th century.   Back then a ship at sea had a very hard time keeping track of longitude while it was being blown around.  What helped significantly was setting up observatories on various land points so astronomers could study the stars over a couple weeks and determine that fixed point very precisely.  That required some infrastructure and a solid promise that somebody would come and pick them up at some point).  Then clocks could be sent overland to other points to determine new points.  But taking the clock out on the water really messed it up.   The whole episode with Harrison and the marine chronometer was so a ship could detect where it was periodically (and help transfer accurate time between land points separated by water although I haven't found any sources on that). However it could only update the location when observations were taken,ie wasn't cloudy) .  There had been severe shipwrecks up to that point where the ships hit rocks that had a known location, but the ship didn't know where it was.  But even after the marine clock, there were still some bad shipwrecks, because longitude couldn't be determined in real time:</p>
