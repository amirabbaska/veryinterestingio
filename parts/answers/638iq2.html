		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eating sub optimally does not mean a swift certain death. It means a slightly lower quality of life (think of how you feel from a week of eating fast food vs a week of eating healthy), deteriorating more quickly (your brain may slow down faster as you age), a slightly higher risk of developing disease, etc.</p>
<p>Good nutrition is just maximizing your optimal health, not something as polarizing as going from dying of every disease at 20 vs living forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We as a species have always retained a pretty high diversity of foods in our diet.  If anything, we would likely not have evolved if it weren't for the ability of our hominid ancestors, specifically H. erectus, to cook and process food.  There is a theory in evolutionary anthropology about the relative balance of the gut and the brain, sometimes referred to as the gray ceiling.  The idea being that both the digestive tract and the brain are biologically &quot;expensive&quot; organs requiring lots calories to do their jobs.  When H. erectus developed cooking anywhere from 750kya to 1mya, hominids suddenly gained the ability to get much more out of their foods, nutritionally speaking.  Cooking and food processing made digestion easier, allowing for the greater extraction of nutrients, and allowing for the gradual increase in size and neural convolution of the hominid brain.  If anything we have required dietary variation for our development as a species and to maintain the calories to support our complex brains.</p>
<p>By about 250kya, H. Sapiens appeared on the world stage, and by 20kya, we had developed agriculture.  There has been lots written on the downsides of agriculture, especially as it pertains to overall health of localized human populations (the prevalence of dental caries in Native American populations really sticks out in my brain), but let's not lose sight of the forest for the trees: except in certain instances of localized population collapse due to crop failure, agriculture has been a huge net positive for human as a species.  Agriculture has crucially provided us the ability to have a readily available source of high calorie foods and as such has supported the development of both cities and civilization as we understand them today.  Even though the relative diversity of foods may have declined as groups developed crop specialization, humans have always required multiple food sources for proper nutrition and survival.  While there is clearly a plethora of literature available evaluating the role of famine in causing local population collapse, the idea that humans as a species would subsist solely off of a single food source is a bit of a misconception.  The Native American groups of the Southwest subsisted on more than just maize.  Unless there were extreme circumstances affecting a localized population, such as a natural disaster or crop collapse, humans have always sought out food diversity by supplementing major crops with other vegetables, adding protein to their diet through animal meat and/or milk, and by trading with other groups for other types of food.  This has been the ultimate key to our species' success.</p>
<p>tl;dr--While agricultural development created a sort of dietary bottleneck, it has never been so extreme as to cause a species-wide population collapse.  In actuality, the ready availability of calorie dense food brought about by the development of agriculture far outweighed any nutritional deficits on a species wide scale and ultimately led to rapid population growth.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>History, being the part of the human past that has been written down, is not that long. When you consider that the human digestive system has been evolving for millions of years, a few thousand is relatively small. In fact, the diet you are likely most familiar with is very uncommon throughout Homo sapiens' past. </p>
<p>In prehistory, the human diet was much more widely varied than it is today. Hunter/gatherers had to range far and wide to get the foods they needed to survive. It wasn't until a period known to archaeologists as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neolithic" target="_blank">neolithic(new stone age) period</a> that humans began to narrow their food sources with agriculture(5-10k years ago) and a more sedentary life. The period is named this way because we find stone tools used for processing large quantities of grains associated with the time period. The most common of these are known as <a href="https://www.nps.gov/meve/learn/education/artifactgallery_manometate.htm" target="_blank">manos and metates</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that the body evolved to need a well balanced diet- we humans can survive on pretty unbalanced food just fine.</p>
<p>What a well balanced diet is is that we have discovered that certain food combinations optimize the nutrients that out body gets.</p>
<p>Think of your body like a car, food is fuel, you can put pretty much any gasoline in your car as fuel.  But, you know, some gasoline works better in your car than others, some leaves buildups that make the car run worse, some contain additives that help keep the engine cleaner, and there are different octane levels that, while they can all technically burn in your car, often there is one specific one that is best suited to being used.</p>
<p>TL;DR: your body can get by on a lot of things, and the well balanced diet is less a requirement of your body than the result of a lot of trial and error trying to figure out what is most optimal to eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of issues with the question/premise.</p>
<p>A &quot;well-balanced diet&quot; is largely a nutrition science idea, and even the best nutrition science is still rather limited. There are a huge number of things about food that we don't know - it's actually a pretty complex subject. </p>
<p>So, what determines a &quot;well-balanced&quot; diet? If we're talking what makes people feel the best (energy, good sleep, etc.) and have the best medical markers of health (low blood pressure, low cholesterol, healthy weight, good lung capacity, good heart rate, etc) it's still likely to vary. Part of it is likely biology. We're just now learning more about how different cultures actually may extract different amounts of nutrients from the same food. (Asians vs. Caucasians eating seaweed for example, or being able to process soy products better.)</p>
<p>But even just, what works for your body? Some people swear by low carb, for example. I have no energy and am super cranky if I try low carb. </p>
<p>Lastly, &quot;well-balanced diet&quot; is not remotely necessary for survival. Arguably, a lot of people on a &quot;western&quot; diet don't eat &quot;well-balanced&quot; in any of the typical accepted versions of the term. Too much sugar, too much over-processed food, etc. But it's not necessary to eat a well-balanced diet simply to <em>survive.</em> You can survive in a lethargic state, in a tired state, with high blood pressure or cholesterol, etc. In fact, a lot of us <em>are</em> surviving in that state. It's not desirable, IMO, but it's happening.</p>
<p>The rise of &quot;western&quot; diseases like diabetes, hypertension, heart attacks.. a lot of these are diet-based, but it's not because we're trying to &quot;diversify&quot; or have a &quot;well-balanced&quot; diet. It's more likely (from what evidence we do have) the result of the <em>type</em> of diet we're consuming. The extra processed junk, the massive amounts of sugar, things like that.</p>
<p>Humans by and large can survive on a wide range of diets, and even be pretty healthy on a lot of them. The idea of a &quot;well-balanced&quot; diet is science trying to figure out what it hasn't yet been able to solve. </p>
<p>Check out Michael Pollan's work on nutrition, like In Defense of Food. It's pretty fascinating stuff, tracking the rise of government food pyramids and the removal of &quot;imitation&quot; labeling, the anti-fat craze that was not medically backed, and a whole lot of looking at other cultures throughout history, and what they ate.</p>
<p>It's really interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
