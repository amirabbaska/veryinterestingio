		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We <em>do</em> know the exact value of pi. It's... pi. You are most likely conflating &quot;knowing an exact value&quot; with &quot;having a terminating or repeating decimal representation&quot;. A number that lacks the latter is no less exact than any other number. Also, we may compute the decimal representation of pi for an arbitrarily large number of decimal places if we really wanted. There's rarely any point though.</p>
<p>(Finally, note that we may show that in planar Euclidean geometry, the ratio of circumference to radius is the same for all circles. So we may <em>define</em> 2*pi to be that number such that C/r = 2*pi. So whether you were able to calculate a decimal representation of pi or not, we know that C = 2*pi*r because we have defined it to be that.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As /u/Midtek said below we actually do know pi exactly.  Ironically, even though we can't write it (as such), we know it with infinite precision.  Contrast that against the number of significant figures you require to be confident in, say, the amount of active ingredient in your prescription medication.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been explained, but the problem is you're only thinking in one direction in the equasion.
for example:
We know what Pi is because if the diameter of a circle is 1, the circumference is Pi. We can calculate it, represent it, we just use the symbol to translate it into one thing rather than having write forever. It is as much the equation as the number.</p>
<p>1+1 as much 2 as 2 as it simply equals 2. They are both correct representations. </p>
<p>In the simplest terms, we invented the number 2, to represent two 1's. We invented the word for Pi to sit at a specific point between 3 and 4 because we know its a constant point in all circles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one is really explaining this very well imo.</p>
<p>It's simple.  Let's say you have a number pi.  You can't turn it into a decimal.  Fine... So you don't.  Instead, you just measure things in pi's.  Something can be 2 pi's long or 10 pi's long.  Maybe it's half a pi.  Maybe it's a million pi's.  You can measure anything in pi's.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a circle with a radius of 5.  Well the area is pi times the radius squared.  So it's 25 pi's.  <strong>That is the exact area</strong>.  If we put it into a decimal it won't be exact.  But as long as we are measuring in pi's , it's completely exact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider the square root of 2.  Despite its irrationality, we know that multiplying it by itself always yields the exact value 2.  It is irrational by itself, but it may provide part of a perfectly rational solution.</p>
<p>Pi is similar, just the method of obtaining rational numbers from it tends to be a bit more involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
