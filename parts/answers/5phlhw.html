		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're an American, it's important to recognize that what Americans call <em>liberal</em> much of the rest of the world calls moderate.  Reddit is an international platform, and a large number of people on Reddit would accurately describe themselves as being moderate, not liberal, but from an American perspective, they are liberal.</p>
<p>It's also worth pointing out the polarization of American politics has created a shift in perspective, where the right is getting more and more right, again making moderates <em>appear</em> to be more liberal than they are.  That also leads to more closed-group echo chambers like r/The_Donald: the conservatives concentrate themselves into smaller areas and become more vocal while moderates and liberals spread out more.</p>
<p>Finally, it's worth noting that in addition to polarization, there are topics which have become very politicized which aren't political issues.  The best example of this would be global climate change.  It isn't &quot;liberal&quot; to believe in global climate change, it's common sense, but the issue has been made political so that [many] conservatives <em>don't</em> believe it to be true as part of their party line.  Not believing in climate change is a <em>fairly</em> American conservative idea, although by no means unique to American politics.  Likewise, denying evolution is a fairly American thing.  What is perceived as &quot;liberal&quot; bias in social media may just be the overwhelming consensus of the rest of the world accepting those things as factually correct - something the right is more or less unwilling to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US at least there is a pretty strong correlation between liberal/urban and conservative/rural populations. Since internet access is widespread in cities and generally really bad in rural areas, this is going to affect internet demographics. </p>
<p>I also wouldn't be surprised if age played a part in it too. A lot of legislation that had no chance of being passed 20 years ago (see: gay marriage) is or has been passed more recently. One could argue that overall the younger demographic is more liberal and much more internet-savvy than the older demographic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disclaimer: Answer is part speculation, but mostly educated guesses backed by facts with cited sources.</p>
<p>A lot of small things that add up.  First off, remember that Reddit  obviously is not the only online social media site.  Facebook <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/fake-news-outperformed-real-news-on-facebook-before-us-election-report-2016-11" target="_blank">trafficked</a> a large amount of fake news, and regardless of how you categorize this argument, many people on Facebook reposted these stories, and many Americans, both conservative and liberal, are prone to <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/12/15/many-americans-believe-fake-news-is-sowing-confusion/" target="_blank">believe</a> very erroneous news stories.  Based on these statistics <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/11/11/social-media-update-2016/" target="_blank">here</a>, you could sort of draw a correlation between more Facebook users and more liberal-minded users, but that's a bit dubious, and this is one of the few times I'm dubious of this survey.  Facebook <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2016/10/25/the-political-environment-on-social-media/" target="_blank">clearly</a> figured out an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/us/politics/facebook-ads-politics.html" target="_blank">algorithm</a> to identify users' political ideology, but AFAIK hasn't shared its results, and hasn't shared its accuracy.  </p>
<p>So where does this leave Reddit?  Well, a <a href="http://www.journalism.org/2016/02/25/reddit-news-users-more-likely-to-be-male-young-and-digital-in-their-news-preferences/" target="_blank">recent</a> poll
indicated that more were liberal than conservative users, but the differences were not overwhelming, although there were far more men than women.  Many users self identified as &quot;moderate&quot;, which partly answers the question.  If slightly more users are liberal, or have liberal than conservative leanings, and a larger number are &quot;moderate&quot;, then in reactionary or controversial stories <em>where moderate users will typically remain distant or neutral</em>, more conservative users may find themselves in a minority, and their stories gaining less attention.  Now, this will not happen all the time or with every story, but as I noted, partly answers the question.</p>
<p>Another reason that partly answers the question is the current political climate has hyper-polarized political views [no citation necessary], and a user with what was once a moderate conservative (or liberal) viewpoint will consistently find himself or herself forced to align with increasingly right (or left) positions to find allies, or simply abandon that position completely.  This occurrence is not only on Reddit, but in general.  This is significant here, because conservative/liberal views are increasingly being identified with more radicalized positions.  Examples would be Republicans at least implicitly supporting Trump's stance and attitudes toward women, or Democrats supporting Hillary Clinton's (from Bernie Sanders) College Affordability Plan.  Individuals will react to this in a variety of ways, further increasing the complexity and difficulty in answering this question.  Conservatives who are emphatically in favor of women's rights may feel nervous about posting and defending Republican positions, or they may double down and defend the position and candidate even harder.  Liberals may point to real or perceived offenses from conservative counterparts in their posts, thereby driving a deeper wedge between liberals and conservatives and strengthening unity among liberals.</p>
<p>Continuing with the previous reason, Trump <a href="http://graphics.wsj.com/clinton-trump-twitter/" target="_blank">communicates</a> with his supporters via email and Twitter, which in itself would not preclude supporters from being active on Reddit, but at the same time not necessarily encourage more active involvement in Reddit instead of Twitter. </p>
<p>Inertia also plays a factor.  Users who, by chance or any other reason, happened to start using Reddit initially, will tend to keep using Reddit, and will tend to gravitate toward and prefer similar-minded topics in their news and discussions.</p>
<p>TL;DR Many small reasons</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, overall voting patterns and opinion polls on topics suggest more liberal viewpoint voters -- Hillary got 3 million more votes in the election, polls show strong majorities in favor of ACA, gay marriage, etc.</p>
<p>Secondly, young voters tend to be more liberal/left-leaning, while more conservative voters are older. The typical 70 year old retiree in Florida isn't spending his day on Reddit or Snapchat, and if he's on Facebook it 99% to see photos of his grandkids rather than debate politics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
