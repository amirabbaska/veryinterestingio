		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're misinterpreting the graphic. The energy leaving is less than incident. 77+22.9+239.9 = 339.8, which is less than the incident, 340.4. The other sources, thermals and latent heat, don't leave the atmosphere. That's accounted for the emitted by atmosphere number, rolled into total outgoing infrared radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just considering the rates at the surface, you have emission from the surface, thermals and latent heat going out, and absorbed by surface + back radiation coming in. The net is 0.6 absorbed by the surface. Maybe you missed some of these contributions in your sums?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems like you're overlooking the back radiation in the graphic, which is the energy that is coming in from the atmosphere towards the surface.  398.2 W/m\^2 is emitted by the surface.  Out of that number, 340.3 W/m\^2 is reflected back by the atmosphere (greenhouse gases, clouds, etc).  The total amount absorbed by the surface (163.3 + 340.3) should be approximately the same as the total amount emitted by the surface (398.2 + 18.4 + 86.4) as various forms of energy.  Basically there are three layers in the graphic, the surface, the atmosphere, and space, and various arrows of the amount of energy going between them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The amount of energy emitted by the surface and back radiation is greater than the incoming radiation because a photon / energy packet will bounce back and forth a few times between the surface and atmosphere before escaping to space (with a little bit being absorbed and raising the temperature of the surface).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The interior of the Earth is hotter than its surface, due to radioactive decay and primordial heat that hasn't dissipated yet, and that heat gradually transfers to the surface and radiates out to space. We can harness this as geothermal power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your graph has 3 layers: space, atmosphere and ground. So your ground balance is made up out of absorbed solar rays, emission, back radiation, thermals (wind) and evaporation (cloud forming), and interacts with the atmosphere layer. So for example solar energy creates clouds which in effect throws energy into the atmosphere (because rain will have to fall again, releasing it's heat partially in the form of infrared radiation).</p>
<p>You can apply your law of conservation of energy to each of these 3 layers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
