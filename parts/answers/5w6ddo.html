		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to other comments on weather modelling and data, it depends on where the raw data comes from.</p>
<p>In Australia, the government weather bureau is not used by most popular weather apps - e.g. Apple weather, Yahoo weather and Android's default weather app. They use a service called Weather Underground, which crowd-sources its raw data from a network of personal weather stations. </p>
<p>For this reason, the most popular weather apps for this region always differ from official sources. </p>
<p>I don't have data on which is more accurate. One may assume the official government source with their vast resources and local knowledge, but if the last 15 years of internet-powered business disruption is to go by, the crowd-sourced data may in-fact out perform the established services. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Did you have to enter a zipcode for each app, or does it pretend to know where you are based on your ISP? My little podunk ISP bought space off one of the big boys in another state. Some websites know I'm in southern AZ, other websites think I'm somewhere in the midwest because that is where the parent ISP is located. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Weather is chaotic. The calculations are extremely complex, even minute changes in starting conditions create wildly different results. A scientist called Edward Lorenz discovered this in 1972 by entering 0.506 instead of 0.56127 for one of his computational calculations predicting weather. This slight change entirely changed the results and led to his famous paper &quot;Predictability: Does the Flap of a Butterfly's Wings in Brazil Set Off a Tornado in Texas?&quot;.</p>
<p>Things like rolling fluid convection which is where hot air on the surface of air is replaced with cold air from the atmosphere is impossible to graph. Any attempt to do so displayed what's now known as a &quot;strange attractor&quot;. This cannot be predicted, it moves randomly, never overlaps or retraces it's path. </p>
<p>For perfect prediction the initial conditions of wind speed, air pressure, rolling fluid convection etc. needs to be recorded as accurately as possible. The issue is that the number of decimal points are close to infinity for values like this as are the number of variables. And methods of measurement aren't perfect and aren't fully encompassing resulting in the chaotic nature of attempted precision.</p>
<p>This discovery is a big linchpin of Chaos Theory; a perspective shift of science which saw a move from determinism. It's pretty interesting, I recommend everyone to look into it.</p>
<p>edit: Obviously in this case somebody screwed up, I was just trying to highlight why different stations have different predictions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello there, Pilot here. </p>
<p>There are many highly reliable weather sources available. If you are using an app on your phone which I am assuming you are, unless you know specifically where their weather reporting station is then the information may not be reliable. </p>
<p>If you are in the US and are genuinely concerned about the weather, perhaps you ride a motorcycle or want go for a run I suggest you check out these links..
(Some require registration and some require conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit.)</p>
<p>1800wxbrief.com
(Gives forecast, cloud coverage, current weather, cold and warm fronts and much more.)</p>
<p>LiveATC air radio
(App on iTunes, allows you to find airports near you with the most current weather conditions updated hourly- winds, temperature, weather and pressure.)</p>
<p>These above are good and reliable weather sources. With a little bit of research into what the chart symbols and terminology mean you'll know more about the weather than the reporters on the 5 o'clock news. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><del>I would not conclude that weather prediction is faulty because two weather reporting apps differ. In reality same day and next day prediction is accurate to about 1 degree.</del></p>
<p><del>There's really only one source for forecasts, and that is your national weather service. Everyone else is just relaying data from them.</del></p>
<p><del>It's likely that the apps are either refreshing at different times, or they are querying your location differently. Eg one may query using your postal code, and another by your coordinates.</del></p>
<p>Nevermind, this is probably wrong. I did however find this blog post, which indicates that precipitation forecasts are decently accurate.</p>
