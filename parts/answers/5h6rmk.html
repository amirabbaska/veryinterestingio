		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the decay type.</p>
<ul>
<li>Alpha decays give the remaining nuclei a large kinetic energy - typically in the range of tens of keV. Way too much for chemical bonds to matter, so the atom gets ejected. Same for proton and neutron emission.</li>
<li>Gamma decays typically give the atom less than 1 eV, not enough to break chemical bonds, and the isotope doesn't change either, so the molecule has a good chance to stay intact.</li>
<li>That leaves beta decays (like Carbon-14) as interesting case. A typical recoil energy is a few eV, but with a large range (and no threshold - the recoil can be zero, as it is a three-body decay). It can be sufficient to break bonds, but it does not have to be. If the molecule doesn't break directly, you replace C with N+ for example. What happens afterwards? I don't know, I'll let chemists answer that.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read something recently where they need to engineer pressure release valves in radioactive waste storage containers.  Many of the heavier elements have long term alpha decay, which essentially means it's off-gassing helium.  Eventually, helium would build up and our grandchildren have to deal with atomic waste balloons popping in abandoned mineshafts around the world.  Pretty sure it was a Nova doc on Plutonium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
