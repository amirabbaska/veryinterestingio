		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the obvious triviality of re-uploading deleted content, they often alter the stream. Some will mirror the image right/left, others zoom in, stretch or draw a black border to change resolution. Even audio can be changed.</p>
<p>YouTube's algorithm needs a comparison file to check against. Even the simplest alterations can cripple its functionality entirely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My guess would be it's so much easier to live stream. With videos say 100 episodes of South park they have to make an account upload them ect everytime they get taken down. A stream all they do is restart the stream no uploading way less work </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
