		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So <em>your</em> question is about estate tax avoidance.  A well planned estate will begin moving assets out as quickly as possible (well before death) and often during a persons lifetime and by targeting assets they think have the best <em>growth</em> in the future.  This is a super quick and dirty answer, keep in mind there are tons of technical details underpinning these.  </p>
<p>Basic estate planning:</p>
<p>1) Each year the annual exclusion for gifts is 14K (indexed for inflation).  A taxpayer can give 14K to as many people as they want.  So husband and wife <em>together</em> can give 28K to each child, grandchild and great-grandchild.  Doesnt sound like much but it can add up over time.  </p>
<p>2) Also excluded on top of annual gift tax exclusion is gifts for education so long as the payment is made directly to the school.  Grandchild got into a big name school, often grandpa and grandma (assuming they are the ones with the estate) will gladly write that check. </p>
<p>3) Also excluded on top of annual gift tax exclusion is gifts of medical.  Rare, but if that grandchild has some expensive medical need, grandma and grandpa write that check to the provider.</p>
<p>4) when all that is done each taxpayer has ~$5.4M of lifetime exemption. So grandma and grandpa combined have ~10.8M to pass down stream before they are subject to gift/estate tax.</p>
<p>Okay, but what about 100M+, /u/w33tad1d, these numbers you tossed out don't come close to that.</p>
<p>Advanced estate planning (all the sexy stuff....), transactions and more transactions</p>
<p>1) Grantor Retained Annuity Trust (GRAT), you can design the GRAT to that the donor puts assets into the GRAT and takes back an annuity plus interest.  Properly designed you will have a calculated gift of zero (thank you Waltons for that great tax case).  Now, if the assets grow over the period <em>faster</em> than the required interest rate, the excess goes downstream to kids.  If it doesn't, then you get back everything and only lost out on professional fees.  Typically you want a SHORT timeline.  This is basically an &quot;option.&quot;  What do you put in the GRAT, something you think is going to blow up in a short timeline.  Got that family business or per-IPO stock, toss it in a GRAT.</p>
<p>2) Installment Sales to Intentionally Defective Grantor Trusts.  You gift ~10% of the value of assets you want  to sell.  You sell assets to a Grantor Trust in exchange for the down payment (that gift of 10%) and a note for the rest.  Interest only with a balloon at the end.  Ideally the assets generate cash flow and they will pay off the note during the term.  You want a LONG timeline.  What a deal I sell a thing to a trust for my kids, it pays for itself and my kids get to keep it.  The downside, if it doesnt work out, i gave a gift of that 10% and i lose out on that amount of lifetime exemption.</p>
<p>3) Value of assets.  Any transaction I have to value the assets.  Stock and bonds are easy to value.  What about that closely held family business.  What is it worth?  Well, we need to find out so we have a guy to value it.  I dont move the whole thing, I move a minority interest, say 20%.  Oh, yea its not worth as much in my kids hands since they only own 20% and mom and dad owns the other 80%.  Kids cant control the entity.  Worse yet, the agreement for the entity says that they cant sell it without majority agreement.  See I got this <em>terrible</em> thing, i cant sell it and i cant make decisions.  Ewww, when we value it we will take a discount for lack of marketability and lack of control.  whats that look like, say 30%.  Nice, when I sell it to my kids its worth 30% less.  ;-)  You can even do this with a Family Limited Partnership if you hold stocks and bonds.  Drop them into an FLP and now you have an entity you can &quot;value,&quot; kids get 40% of the FLP, lack of marketability and lack of control, so now that FLP interest is worth less.    </p>
<p>4) Grantor Trusts.  These a particular type of trust, in which the income is taxed to the grantor.  So Dad gives $1M to a grantor trust for his daughter.  Say it makes 5%, that means Dad gets taxed on income of $50K, which would be ~20K of tax.  So?  Dad just constructively gifted the trust $20K to pay the tax all without it ever hitting his lifetime exclusion.</p>
<p>Really there is no magic bullet.  Its about planning for what the family holds and combining transactions to maximize what you gift through the life time exclusion of ~$5.4M.  You could give cash of that amount or you can hire a good estate planner and you could use some sexy advanced techniques to push <strong>much</strong> more down to your descendants.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: Superior answer here. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5he94v/eli5how_do_millionaires_and_billionaires_avoid/dazp9wj/?st=iwi7ucv0&sh=cf8e40e7" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5he94v/eli5how_do_millionaires_and_billionaires_avoid/dazp9wj/?st=iwi7ucv0&sh=cf8e40e7</a></p>
<p>I mistakenly said some strategies designed to simplify the probate process were also intended to avoid the estate tax. They are not.  I think the gist of my comment remains true but the other user has a more informed post than mine.  </p>
<p>Hi OP, most of the answers here have not been terribly helpful but instead tried to educate you on some assumed incorrect assumptions. </p>
<p>The most important thing to know is that the estate tax is only able to get to money or things of value that pass through your estate. So, you want to start removing assets from your estate as soon as you start getting rich.  In many ways, non-wealthy take advantage of this as well.  When you set up a checking account you can designate a POD.  This amount is immediately transferred to your designated beneficiary <del>and does not count as part of the estate.</del>  This can be done (and should be done) for all retirement accounts such as IRAs, 401k's and so on.  This applies to a ton of the liquid wealth of the wealthy. </p>
<p>EDIT: POD is part of the estate.  I was incorrect.  Please see this comment, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5he94v/eli5how_do_millionaires_and_billionaires_avoid/dazouhd/?st=iwi77m9t&sh=f9ebaac4" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/5he94v/eli5how_do_millionaires_and_billionaires_avoid/dazouhd/?st=iwi77m9t&sh=f9ebaac4</a>, POD simplifies probate, but does not effect the size of the estate.  </p>
<p>Second there are more sophisticated techniques to minimize assets and/or remove them from the estate.  A very common way is to establish a family limited partnership.  You transfer the assets in to the FLP early on and as they gain wealth the wealth is transferred to the beneficiaries in several ways, including distributions or ownership in new acquisitions.  A FLP is not an estate asset, but the ownership interest in the FLP can be.  So through smart planning you reduce it so your ownership in the FLP decreases over your life until you only own a nominal amount at death.  FLP's have some controversy, but on the whole they work. Also extremely common is trusts, whether revocable or irrevocable.  You deed your property into a trust for the benefit of your heirs.  The gains to your heirs are only taxed when removed and we can start a whole new thread on that topic.  </p>
<p>Another way is to hide your money.  Take it overseas and out of the reach of the government.  You can do this with offshore accounts.  Or you can use clever (or illegal) accounting to hide the true ownership of assets. </p>
<p>You can also make a charitable donations at death.  This is very common because rich people want to see their legacy continued.  But, this can also be abused by making the charity your charity and abusing it so that it is essentially a piggy bank that can accept tax exempt donations and then be distributed to friends and family as salary, can make donations itself to other charities (owned and controlled by friends and family, of course) and so.  For examples of charity abuse look no further than our two candidates for President in 2016.  Consider this before blindly honoring the Buffett and Gates &quot;donations.&quot; Charities are abused by the wealthy and an area in need of reform, but don't expect it.  </p>
<p>In sum, there are dozens of ways to skin that cat.  I have given you the three most common, remove assets from the estate, hide the money or donate it.  There are many more and many people make millions of dollars and save billions of dollars creating clever solutions to this question.  But overall the general idea is to reduce taxable assets in your estate as that is what is taxed. So as a wealthy person you want to die with no more than 5 million in your &quot;estate.&quot;  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, the estate tax isn't 100%. It's not like the government takes everything. The rates are pretty comparable to normal income tax right now- it maxes out at about 40%, so the majority of the estate will still go to the kids.</p>
<p>Second, there is no tax on the first $5 million of the estate, so right away you can give your kids a few million that will not disappear. </p>
<p>Third, once you have enough money, you can just make more money from growth on that money rather than having to work. It doesn't matter that much if your kids can only inherit $100 million instead of $200 million, because if they get 5% returns on their investments, they can still spend $2 million a year and still have $200 million in the bank by the time they die and pass that money on to their kids. Sure, that's not &quot;trashing Ferraris for fun&quot; amounts of money, but it is &quot;partying instead of having a real job&quot; money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have mentioned a significant amount of estate tax techniques but Life Insurance is an huge one that millionaires and billionaires use  to mitigate or all together cover their estate tax. its essentially an low cost investment that will pay out income tax free and estate tax free if owned correctly (in a trust - more specifically an ILIT). Its an incredibly versatile asset. for example, a lot of hedge fund managers have recently been using a product called PPLI or Private Placement Life Insurance as a tax wrapper (estate and income tax). This product will put a portion of the premiums (a little more complicated than that but to simplify it) paid in into any hedge fund the insured chooses (except one they have control over) effectively shielding huge potential gains from estate tax and income tax when it pays out. It really doesn't take much to completely avoid estate tax if you choose to get creative with it.</p>
<p>There's also creative ways to avoid paying income tax on premiums paid into the trust through a split dollar arrangement where you &quot;loan&quot; premiums into the trust and then pay the note/interest on that loan which is calculated in one of two ways, economic benefit or AFR, both of which can be hundreds of dollars on an 300k premium. These techniques are pretty outragous</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about the US, but in Canada most people with lots of money who intend for their family to inherit start something called a &quot;family trust&quot; and put all their assets as they acquire them, including bank accounts and property holdings, in the name of the trust. </p>
<p>Then, when they kick, operation of the trust continues with the next in line, all assets and incomes go into there and the family shares the wealth.</p>
<p>there are all sorts of other tricks as well that they use for their personal assets that aren't in the trust for whatever reason, but this is the easiest and most effective. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
