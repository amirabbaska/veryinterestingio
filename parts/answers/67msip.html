		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I can answer this!</p>
<p>Our mood is affected by specific chemicals in the brain: serotonin, dopamine, glutamate, and norepinephrine (and many others, but these are the main ones).</p>
<p>For this explanation, it isn't important to understand what these chemicals do exactly. The only important thing to know is that these chemicals are responsible for <em>many</em> more of our brain's functions than simply our mood.</p>
<p>If you've ever lived in a house with old or poorly installed wiring, you may have noticed that when a large appliance starts up (like a washing machine or refrigerator), the lights in other parts of the house will dim. </p>
<p>This is a good analogy for what's happening in the brain.</p>
<p>How much of each of these chemicals we have (and how they interact), depends on many factors. I won't list them all, that would be impossible. But here are some major ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Current diet (could be excellent or terrible)</li>
<li>Time of day</li>
<li>Current physical fitness (could also be excellent or terrible)</li>
<li>External stressors (like loud noise or sitting in an uncomfortable chair)</li>
<li>Internal stressors (like exercise and/or illness)</li>
<li>Mental stressors (like worries and/or happiness)</li>
</ul>
<p>When the body is trying to use these chemicals to adapt to changing conditions, sometimes it has to allocate brain chemicals in a way that negatively affect our mood. It can &quot;dim&quot; us, just like those dimming lightbulbs, and we don't know why because we can't feel those other things the brain is using those chemicals for.</p>
<p>Notice that I included both what we would consider &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; influences on our current state of being. </p>
<p>The real bitch of mood disorders caused by chemical imbalance is that the negative mood can <em>sometimes be brought on by being otherwise good to yourself</em>.</p>
<p>If you are experiencing such feelings here are some suggestions, because I've been through it, and I wish someone had told me what I'm about to tell you.</p>
<p>First a disclaimer: <em>I'm not a doctor, this is not medical advice, and if possible you should try to find a therapist that works well with you if your mood is impacting your life in a bad way.</em> I also know that sometimes it's impossible to see a therapist/doctor because of financial (or many other) situations, so here are some techniques that work for me. <em>They may not work for you,</em> but they will at least give you a place to start, and hopefully begin to feel that your mood is something you can control or at least influence instead of the other way around.</p>
<p>Whether you're able to start looking for a therapist right away or not, hopefully you can use these as stop-gap measures until you can find a professional that works well with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Take a single deep breath, and remember it's just a ride.</strong> I usually go to existential places when I get sad. It helps me to remember that while it may be a shitty ride, it's still just a ride, and however bad I feel, if I can make it through the next minute/hour/day, it's likely to change for the better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Drink a big glass of water.</strong> Dehydration can wreck my mood even if everything else is going great for me. I take a drink, sit still for a bit, and see if I feel better.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>A bad mood does not equal a bad person.</strong> I was raised to believe that I'm a bad person, and always will be.  Even if you weren't raised to be religious, many cultures attribute a moral value to how useful or good we are able to be. A sad mood can wreck my ability to do anything for a while, but <em>that does not make me a bad or ineffective person,</em> it just means I'm a good person who has some hard shit to get through.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cry.</strong> I don't usually have time to feel sad about things the way I'd like to or need to. Sometimes many small events in my life build up to the point where I just need to sob about them for a while. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Eat something.</strong> Something healthy if at all possible. A popular saying is &quot;food is the original anti-depressant,&quot; and it's true. I try to seek out something healthy to eat, but if there's nothing else around and I need to eat some junk food to make it through the day (a serious problem in Western cultures, but especially the States), that's okay. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>If I can't eat healthy, or if I simply over-eat, try eating &quot;one less.&quot;</strong> A friend once told me that &quot;willpower is a muscle. I have to start small and go easy on myself while I practice.&quot; That little comment changed my life. Sadness and obesity go hand-in-hand, like Strong Sad from Homestar Runner prancing along with another Strong Sad (god I hope this isn't a terrible reference). So, when I began my journey of trying to manage my weight, I began by eating and/or drinking one less serving of whatever I was having in a meal: If I usually would drink three sodas, I'd only drink two. If I would usually eat five slices of pizza, I'd only eat four. In that way I very slowly trained myself to simply eat less. Now, this doesn't mean that the food I was eating was necessarily healthier. <em>But.</em> It meant that mentally I had developed a habit that made it <em>much easier</em> to make positive food choices for myself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take probiotics.</strong> Gut health <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/gut-week-gut-brain-axis-can-fixing-my-stomach-fix-me/" target="_blank">can improve mood.</a> Probiotics help, and they're in <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=probiotic+gummies&amp;oq=probiotic+gumm&amp;aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l4.3398j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" target="_blank">gummy form now.</a> If I can't afford probiotics, eating yogurt is a great way to get helpful bacteria into my belly. As I continue to improve my eating my mood <em>does improve</em>. </p>
</li>
<li><strong>Gut problems might be caused by common allergens.</strong> I'm not trying to be gross, but it's a very addressable problem that many people just don't talk about: I'll put myself out there and state that I had a <em>lot</em> of problems with gas/bloating/diarrhea for years. It turns out I had a food allergy, and eliminating that food from my diet improved my belly feels dramatically. 8 kinds of food account for 90% of food allergies. I tried removing them one at a time, and if I didn't feel an improvement, I was free to add that one back into my diet:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Milk (mostly in children)</li>
<li>Eggs.</li>
<li>Peanuts.</li>
<li>Tree nuts, like walnuts, almonds, pine nuts, brazil nuts, and pecans.</li>
<li>Soy.</li>
<li>Wheat and other grains with gluten, including barley, rye, and oats.</li>
<li>Fish (mostly in adults)</li>
<li>Shellfish (mostly in adults)</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean/pick up &quot;just one more than before.&quot;</strong> In the same vein as &quot;eat one less,&quot; I gradually exercise my willpower muscle by doing <em>just one more thing</em> than I did before. If yesterday I did nothing, I put one sock in the hamper. If I put away one sock yesterday, I try two today. And so on. If I then collapse back into bed, I know that I made an improvement. It may seem stupid, but here's what <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/120532-when-asked-how-do-you-write-i-invariably-answer-one" target="_blank">Stephen King said:</a> &quot;It sounds too simple to be true, but consider the Great Wall of China, if you will: one stone at a time, man. That's all. One stone at a time... I've read you can see that motherfucker from space without a telescope.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take a shower.</strong> Feeling clean helps my mood a lot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Take a walk.</strong> Gretel Ehrlich said &quot;walking is also ambulation of the mind.&quot; If I walk at all, I’ve taken a step (several, actually) to improve my condition, and to be healthier. Double bonus. If I walk for 30 minutes, I have successfully exercised for the day. Triple bonus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Manage stress in whatever way works.</strong> I've tried yoga, volunteering, calcium antacids, rubbing my head, stretching, breathing deeply, screaming, punching a bag, lifting weights, helping a friend out, journaling, listening to soothing music, and a bajillion others. I try anything I can think of, and keep the ones that work.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Take a dry erase marker, and write a positive thing about myself.</strong> This one frankly sounded stupid when I first heard it, but I got so desperate I gave it a try. And it works. I wrote things like &quot;I love me,&quot; &quot;I am a good person who wants to do good things,&quot; &quot;I am great at <strong><strong>__</strong></strong>,&quot; &quot;I'm a beautiful person,&quot; and many others on my mirror. I'd say them to myself 10 times every time I looked into the mirror. At some point, those sayings became my internal monologue, and I started to feel better about myself.</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm not trying to preach, and what I posted might not work for you. But I sincerely hope it does. If you are feeling sad and need someone to talk to, please PM me. I always want to help someone who's going through what I've been through. </p>
<p>If you are feeling like you don't want to exist (which one of my friends wryly referred to as being &quot;casually suicidal&quot;) the suggestions above might help, but also might not be quite enough to get you to feeling balanced and level. If you need someone(s) to talk to, try /r/depression and/or /r/suicidewatch </p>
<p>I really hope this helps. Love you all.</p>
<p>EDIT: Formatting.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Added a section about &quot;one less.&quot; Again, hope this helps. &lt;3</p>
<p>EDIT 3, THE GILDED BUGALOO: ...I really don't know what to say. Thank you all so very much for your words of gratitude and encouragement. All I've ever wanted to do was help people, and today it seems like I did. I'm intensely grateful for you all. Thanks for being here, thanks for being alive. You matter. Even if you don't hear it ever as much as you should, you matter, you're worthwhile.</p>
<p>I can't say it any better than this: &quot;But what I hope most of all is that you understand what I mean when I tell you that, even though I do not know you, and even though I may never meet you, laugh with you, cry with you, or kiss you, <em>I love you.</em> With all my heart, <strong>I love you.</strong>&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mood can be altered by any number of factors ranging from environmental to physiological. Chances are, when mood is altered, it's not actually for &quot;no real reason&quot;. Even mild things that you're not consciously aware of will cause your mood to shift either positively or negatively. Hungry but still have to wait an hour for lunch? Now you're grumpy. Weird dream last night? Now the rest of your morning feels off. Something as simple as a television show or song with a certain atmosphere will cause someone's mood to shift. The possibilities are kind of endless. </p>
<p>One thing you have to remember is that mood and overall mental health are controlled by a very complex set of physiological factors. Your nervous system, hormones, and even the bacteria in your gut all work together to create a balance of both &quot;good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; emotion. So, at any one time, fluctuations in these areas can cause you to experience fluctuations to your emotional state, even if there's no obvious external reason for you to feel differently. </p>
<p>I'm not a neuroscientist or psychologist, so I'd love to see someone provide a more in depth answer in this area. However, I will say that emotions like anger or happiness or disgust (etc etc) all play a very large role in our decision making and motivational processes. This means that we NEED emotion to properly function and make decisions. This includes sadness as well. So, you might even be able to argue that episodes of sadness (even for no real reason), are inevitably needed to keep us functioning. </p>
<p>EDIT: When I say that we need emotions in our motivational or decision making processes, I'm referring to something in psychology called &quot;the somatic marker hypothesis&quot;. The hypothesis states that emotional &quot;markers&quot;, such as the sweating and rapid heart beat associated with anxiety, help us to make decisions where cognition alone might fail us. The parts of the brain associated with the somatic marker hypothesis are the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the amygdala. When damage to these areas occur (such as in traumatic brain injury) it has been found that individuals are more likely to make risky decisions on gambling tasks. Why? Because they aren't experiencing the same emotional reaction to betting or losing, meaning they are less likely to &quot;learn from their mistakes&quot; because they don't experience or process disappointment or regret in the same way. There are lots of studies done on this using something called the Iowa Gambling Task. That's just one example of how emotions impact decision making. Feelings of fear and regret play a huge role in mitigating risk behaviour alone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>BA in Developmental Psychology here, so I'm sure an expert may be able to explain it in more depth but here's what I remember from college.</p>
<p>&quot;Happiness&quot; is a feeling derived from a combination of neurotransmitters in the brain: serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, and sometimes oxytocin.</p>
<p>People may know that dopamine is the big one people talk about, where for example in game design designers know how to structure a level and the rewards you get so that you're getting a little &quot;dopamine hit&quot; that keeps you playing.</p>
<p>So, as you're going through a day, say a really good day where you wake up with your loved one, have an awesome breakfast, you rock your job that day, or maybe it's a day off, regardless it's an awesome day, or for some folks maybe even just an average day. Your brain is producing dopamine, and receiving it. Neurotransmitters travel from axons in your brain, to dendrites, where I like to think of axons as a driveway, and a dendrite is where you park at the end of it (there's actually a little gap between the two physically but I digress). So you create dopamine, receive it within a dendrite and after a while it gets spent. After a while of being pretty happy, you'll have exhausted the dendrites ability to receive dopamine (as it gets &quot;spent&quot; it creates gunk that gets in the way...this is where an expert could define his better).</p>
<p>So naturally, after receiving dopamine for so long you simply won't be able to for a little while, which is where sleep comes in but that's a whole other topic.</p>
<p>A good example is drug use, where cocaine will spike up your dopamine levels for a while and exhaust your dendrites faster, so you get a big happy for a while, then crash. </p>
<p>As people have said already it's partially environmental and partially physiological because all sorts of factors can change your brain chemistry. Naturally your brain goes through ebbs and flows of various neurotransmitters and sometimes, you're happy, and sometimes you're just down.</p>
<p>I hope that was a decent explanation!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vipassana (insight) mediation has been helping me  answer this question and understand it in the context of my own life recently. </p>
<p>I've found that part of the answer is because our mental constructs of our &quot;self&quot; and the world around us often set us up for unnecessary suffering. There are many common tendencies identified in Vipassana, from what I've learned it seems to boil down to our inherent desire for things to be different than how they are, that insistent feeling of &quot;not enough&quot;. We humans often place our happiness and contentment in the future rather than in the present, &quot;When I accomplish A, then I will be happy&quot;.  </p>
<p>Many of our societies are structured to reinforce this too, once we graduate awful high-school then we get to go to college and THAT will awesome. Then we're in college and when it sucks we think &quot;oh but when I'm out of school and have a job and get married then I'll REALLY be able to live my life&quot;. Then adult life is feeling like it's not quite enough and we think &quot;Well when I retire and buy that boat THEN! I'll truly be free and happy&quot;. Then you retire and maybe buy the boat but somethings inside you is still grasping for... What?...Then you die. Vipassana has helped me learn how to release this grasp, albeit one struggling finger at a time. </p>
<p>Another inherent trait of the mind that I find leaves me with  unexplainable sads is when my mind has been constantly flooded with thoughts and carried away by them. We sometimes end up so carried away that we're drowning, trying to parce out and solve too many problems at once. Our minds go into overdrive and get burnt out and we feel helpless and sad. </p>
<p>Learning to give the chaotic monkey mind a break through meditation (calm, nonjudgental, ardent observation of thoughts and sensations perceived by the mind and body) creates space and cultivates awareness of the thoughts and sensations that float by or carry us away. By doing this we gain insight into the habits of mind and learn what tends to lead us to suffering and discontent. It's often said meditation helps show you how to sit at the train station and decide whether or not you want to get on the train of thought that's passing by. This rest can also give the deeper subconscious processes a chance to take a crack at sorting out the &quot;problems&quot; that seem to be drowning us. It's like when you're doing the dishes and AH HA! the answer to the problem you were struggling with all day just appears in your mind, seemingly out of no where. </p>
<p>The trick (in vipassana) is to dissolve these constructs and our identification with them, cultivate ardent awareness of our minds and subjective perspectives, and ultimately see reality as if each second is the first and last second in the universe. </p>
<p>If any of this resonates with you, Mindfulness in Plain English by Bhante Gunaratana is a great starting point and reference especially if you don't have a teacher. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mental Health counselor here:
The first comment was pretty right on. However, I'll add some things:
First, we evolved to live in groups, so we had to have a mechanism to make that happen. Emotion is that mechanism. The word Emotion comes from the Latin &quot;Emovere&quot; which means 'to move.' It moves us to make changes in our lives to accommodate other people. Second, because evolution tends to co-opt existing structures for new means, our emotions ride on the same nervous system as pain and pleasure. So when your feelings are hurt, <em>they really do hurt.</em> Finally, any 'negative' emotions stand out in our memory more than 'positive' ones, because it is useful for our survival to avoid hazards. Negative emotions typically have a danger or loss attached to them some way, a warning for us to behave differently, instructions on how to stay safe within the tribe.</p>
<p>So when you are 'suddenly' feeling sad, what is probably happening is that some change has happened in your environment (internal or external). Your brain, that lovely organ that tries to make sense of it all, takes that stimulus and drops it into your habitual thinking patterns. For example, if low blood sugar is the issue, your brain will know it does not have the glucose it needs. It interprets the output as &quot;something is wrong.&quot; Your habitual thought patterns take over from there. </p>
<p>Please don't ask for references; I'm on the west coast and it is still early. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
