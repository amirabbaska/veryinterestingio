		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know. If we knew the mechanism, we wouldn't need to screw around with ketamine, we could just find or produce a molecule with similar properties. </p>
<p>Ketamine is a compound in a class called NMDA receptor antagonists - it blocks the activity of a complex protein called an NMDA receptor. These receptors allow electrical activity to pass between the brain and the spinal cord. </p>
<p>The effect of NMDA receptor antagonists is, in general, anesthetic. Ketamine produces what is known as &quot;dissociative anesthesia&quot;. This means that in addition to reducing or eliminating the sensation of pain, it also &quot;dissociates&quot; the patient from their environment - the patient no longer feels connected to the world around them. </p>
<p>Speculation has it that this dissociative effect gives the brain a chance to unwind itself when depression sets in. Depression tends to be a self-reinforcing condition. The more depressed you are, the more depressed you are likely to be in the future. Because Ketamine disconnects the cognitive areas of the mind from the rest of the brain, it may short circuit this cycle.</p>
<p>But, again, we simply don't know for sure. Ketamine and other hallucinogens have been historically difficult to conduct research on, owing to the stigma associated with them. Early research indicates that Ketamine could be a very powerful antidepressant. More importantly, it seems to cut short a patient's suicidal thoughts. Plus it has a very rapid effect onset - SSRIs take weeks to get to therapeutic levels. So research is probably going to pick up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the effects of Ketamine is very similar to SSRIs (a widely used type of antidepressant).</p>
<p>A specific type of protein gets bunched up/stuck in a way that decreases its availability and effectiveness, in &quot;lipid rafts&quot;. SSRIs are known to free those proteins from that state, making them more available for use. </p>
<p>Ketamine has the exact same effect on the same proteins in the same state, but it works faster/better than SSRIs.</p>

<p>I do not know if that's the only effect of either medication. I do not believe it is. However, it's <em>one</em> function of antidepressants, and ketamine does the exact same thing (better)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ketamine is an &quot;NMDA antagonist&quot;.  The NMDA receptor is a type of signal receiver on nerve cells.  When the receptor is open, the neuron can receive certain signals from other neurons.  When the receptor is closed, it cannot.  NMDA antagonists, like ketamine, force the receptor to remain closed.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with depression?  We have no idea.  We don't know how any anti-depressants actually cure depression.  SSRIs, SNRIs, tricyclics, etc., they're all a mystery.  We know <em>that</em> they work, to some degree or another, but not why.</p>
<p>Brain science is still very much in its infancy.  Most of the brain's workings are still a mystery to us - it's only in the last 5 years that we've discovered why we need to sleep!  So at the moment, knowing <em>that</em> a drug has a certain effect on the brain is the best we can do.  Maybe in another 20 years we'll understand the <em>why</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m bipolar and have BPD. I had a collapsed lung being a skinny white guy; apparently that’s common. They put me under with Ketamine to insert a chest tube to suck out the air in my chest cavity. After that, I’ve been unable to tell the difference between dreams and reality. I know that sounds weird, but yeah, it sucks. Especially when you wake up terrified of a spaghetti monster only to realize it wasn’t real, even though it definitely feels that way. I never had this happen before this point. Even if it was a nightmare, I knew once I woke up that it was fake. I guess it’s the same way now, in a way, but there is certainly some other barrier that’s been broken down. I don’t blame it in so much as wish my first experience hadn’t been medical. Might’ve changed some things, but it felt like I was stuck in my mind for an entire week. I was only out for 2 1/2 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a neurophysiologist in surgery, not an anesthesia provider, but 12 years experience in the operating room running potentials on the nervous system.  Ketamine is something I study because it is the only drug ever in the history of medicine that increases nervous system potentials.  I have given lectures to my peers on Ketamine, and I know enough about it to say I have no idea how to describe it.     If you are in the medical field with knowledge of neurophysiology and anesthesia, look for Todd Sloan, MD in your journals database:  if your are just curious but not that curious... my answer is “ketamine is one hell of an anesthesia agent  that is used in combination with several other anesthesia agents that gives neurophysiologist very good readings on evoked potentials in surgery”. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
