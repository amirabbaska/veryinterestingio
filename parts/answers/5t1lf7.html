		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Poor people are unlikely to be able to afford more effective forms of birth control, especially if they are un- or underinsured. I'm fortunate to have a good-paying job with health insurance that covers HBC and my IUD, which cost $1200. Someone who works a job that pays poorly is unlikely to have these benefits, and is <em>definitely</em> not likely to be able to pay out of pocket.</p>
<p>2) Many poorer communities do not have proper sex education - hell, many schools regardless of socioeconomic status don't. It's difficult to prevent pregnancy if you don't understand how the body works to begin with. That, and many poor communities tend towards more religious/conservative values, which don't often encourage birth control and sex education. It's unlikely that a person who grew up knowing nothing is going to be able offer this crucial knowledge to their offspring. I can only imagine what it'd be like to hear the same bullshit I heard in high school, but with parents who they themselves do not know enough about the subject to correct me.</p>
<p>3) Abortions are not only hella expensive, but very difficult to get in most states - and, you guessed it, even more so in poor communities. I can put in for time off work for a doctor's appointment and use sick time without worrying about being fired. I can call off work if I'm sick without fearing that I'll lose my job. Many poor people, however, may work jobs that do not provide sick time, and there's a very real fear that it would ultimately boil down to wondering if they could truly afford to lose their job over this. An abortion isn't just an in and out visit, in many places.</p>
<p>4) Conservative/religious values that dictate gender roles; for some people, women are inherently meant to be mothers, and bearing children is the greatest, single most important thing a woman can do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a number of factors.</p>
<p>1) Below a certain threshold, even small amounts of money matter.  If I have plenty of money, having a stash of condoms (or if female, taking birth control just in case) is relatively easy to do.  If putting that money towards birth control means I may have to skip a meal, then I may be more likely to risk pregnancy.</p>
<p>2) There tends to be educational gaps, and I've actually known people who honestly didn't understand what causes pregnancy, so them not taking steps to prevent pregnancy makes more sense.</p>
<p>3) Anecdotal, but possibly related.  I've been broke before, and it tends to go hand-in-hand with a &quot;meh, fuck it&quot; attitude, at least for me and a lot of the people I know.  At some point you just expect life to hand you shit, and there's only so much shit-ade you can make, so you stop taking basic measures to prevent bad things</p>
<p>4) Abortions cost money, which ties back into #1.</p>
<p>5) As someone else pointed out &quot;when you're poor, there's not much else to do.&quot;</p>
<p>There's probably a lot more contributing factors, but I suspect the above will account for the majority of the cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My experience is purely anecdotal, so take it at face value:</p>
<p>I worked for HUD during the late 80s-90s in one of the poorest areas of the nation.  13-year old pregnant girls were brought in by the mothers to apply for housing.  Consider their circumstances, though:  as young, black, under-educated females without transportation or any job opportunities, who already lived in public housing with mothers who survived on welfare and cash gifts from &quot;friends&quot;, a pregnancy/child meant a relative fortune in benefits:  housing rights, Aid to Dependent Children payments, medical care, food stamps (of a sort), etc.  Imagine going from being a poor black teen girl in a depressed rural area, with absolutely NO HOPE of anything better, and then the question is not WHY have children, but WHY NOT?  As a normal human being with normal desires for intimacy, love, and family, this situation, no matter how abhorrent to someone in different circumstances, becomes the norm.</p>
<p>Edit:  should add that the area this took place in also had the highest per capita number of churches, and ZERO sex ed, and limited contraceptive availability, even if the girls had been educated about how to prevent pregnancy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In college we had this sociology class where the professor talked about this. One of the answers that made sense was &quot;Poor people tend to have more children because they think that having more children will mean more people will be supporting them or their whole family in times of need. Whether it be during their old age or during times of illness and etc&quot;</p>
<p>This is an opinion and I believe it is relevant to this topic so I brought it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
