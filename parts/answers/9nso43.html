		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you take a picture of a single photon?  Isn’t a “picture” generated by sensing photons that hit a sensor? A camera should only be able to “see” light that comes through the shutter. If there is only one photon, the sensor would only ever get a single hit, and only if the photon was aimed at it. What am I missing?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is special about this camera is its shutter. First of all the shutter speeds can be set to extremely short times. This is done using fast spinning rotating shutters. However no camera can capture enough light during the short shutter time to make any meaningful image from. So instead they use multiple exposures to bring up the brightness. This does require the action that is being captured to be repeated in sync with the shutter. What you are seeing is not a single light pulse but rather billions of light pulses which have been synchronized with the camera shutter so that it looks like a single light pulse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They combined an existing technology &quot;streak cameras&quot; with a beam splitter and a second camera to get a slower and cleaner picture.</p>
<p>So what is a streak camera? Well firstly understand that,
Movies are really series of photographs, each taken a small amount of time apart.</p>
<p>The problem with light is that once you have taken the first picture, the light has moved on so fast it is no longer in the frame of the camera.</p>
<p>The solution is to fire a second piece of light identical to the first, and take its picture a tiny fraction of a second later on the path the first bit of light took.</p>
<p>Repeat and repeat, then combine all the pictures to make a movie that looks like 1 piece of light, but each frame is an image of a different piece of light, which is doing exactly the same thing all the others were.</p>
<p>Now the trick these guys did is taking the same light from the experiment and split it off into both the streak camera and a new fangled static camera. The combination of the 2 images got them a highly detailed movie</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Nope. Nowhere in the article does it say &quot;faster than light&quot; .</p>

<p>They built a camera that records a single photon of light. </p>

<p>Nope. Nowhere in the article does it say &quot;single photon&quot;.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does this work? Why couldn't they do it before? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It sounds like the main new thing is that they have two very different cameras filming the scene, one that is super fast but has very bad resolution, and one that has better resolution but is slower, and post-process the data from both to get a video that has both a ridiculous number of frames per second and a useful resolution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems that there are quite some explanations of the older, multi exposure technique. This article is on a new technique however, which uses only a single exposure. I tried my best to figure out what they where doing by reading the article, the paper, and looking at the graphics in both. I'm only a masters student in physics, and I don't have much specialisation in Optics, so I might be wrong.</p>
<p>With that disclaimer out of the way... </p>
<p>They use a normal CCD camera, much like the one in your smart phone, to get the &quot;static background image&quot; of the scene they are studying.
This image will provide them with the spatial information of what they are looking at, even though it is far to slow to truly capture the movement of the light.</p>
<p>To capture the movement of the laser pulse, they use a second camera, as so called streak camera.
This camera, based on the graphic in the article, uses a phosphor screen to convert the light from the laser pulse into electrons, which are then accelerated and deflected by a varying electric field. This serves, in a way, to exaggerate the motion of the light pulse (the light pulse enters through a small slit, so as the pulse moves in the scene, it hits a different part of the phosphorus screen, and that change in where the electrons are freed from the screen by the photons, is than exaggerated by &quot;shaking the electrons further out&quot; in the electric field).
This then leads to the electrons creating a streak on another CCD camera at the end of the streak camera, and is probably where the name comes from.</p>
<p>The streaked image sacrifices the spatial information for temporal information (it doesn't so as nicely where, but instead better shows when), whereas the normal CCD still has all that spatial information. Due to the way it is done, however, you can't just add one and two together to get the full image. Rather, they use complex optimisation techniques, in which they use some very complex mathematics and a computer to find out which reconstruction (i.e. the imaging of the scene) best fits the data they captured using the two CCD cameras.</p>
<p>Now I might very well be wrong, but I think at least that this is the essence of the new technique. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
