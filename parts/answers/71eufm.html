		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Non-circulating legal tender (NCLT) coins are never intended to circulate as cash money but they include a denomination as a fail-safe of sorts so that should the world economy collapse and silver becomes worth less than $5.00 per ounce (for example) then at least this item's value is backed by a treasury for $20.00. </p>
<p>Circulating coins used to be made of actual silver and gold but these were phased out because the value of the silver and gold outpaced their face value and it was easier to make more durable coins out of copper-nickel and steel cores. Canadian &quot;junk silver&quot; coins up to 1966/67/68 (depending on the denomination) are all currently worth 7 to 11 times their face value. </p>
<p>In reality, most of the NCLT $20 silver coins don't even include an ounce of silver and so they are essentially jewellery disks. If you like the art/design then buy it but don't expect to hand it off to your great grandkids to make a fortune. They won't. It is a crappy investment in almost all cases. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>a lot of the coins you see on TV aren't legal currency, they are just chunks of metal they are leading you to believe are somehow official (I'm looking at you, Franklin Mint)</li>
<li>sometimes the Treasury issues commemorative coins, not unlike stamps, and since only the mint can issue real currency, that makes them more distinctive and valuable...they are only released in limited numbers, and are not supposed to supplement the money in circulation</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I don't see here is a situation that happened a few years back with the overstock of $1 coins by the US Mint.  They wanted to get them into circulation as they saw them as a better long term investment than the dollar bill so they offered them to people with free shipping and they could use a credit card (1 for 1 exchange rate).  So people were purchasing as many as they could on their credit cards and then turning around and depositing them immediately to pay off their credit card - this gave them &quot;free&quot; airline miles and cash back opportunity.  One guy even reportedly bought about $2.4 million worth.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, if you're referring to collector coins you see on TV, just because they're being sold by a &quot;mint&quot;, doesn't mean they are selling actual money. Watch the small print, most of them say &quot;not affiliated with the US Treasury.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Legal tender evokes a certain emotional response in collectors that just isn't present in things like medals. Anyone can make a medal out of silver, and there are even those that can make them with the same quality as a national mint. But they don't have the same cachet and power as actual money. Medals made by national mints are somewhat valued, don't get me wrong, but actual legally authorized money has a specific mythic quality to it.</p>
<p>One effect of this is that mint errors are so valued. It's silly if you think about it; a double-struck coin is just a mistake - a misshapen, probably ugly artifact. But people collect them because they're unique objects made by an official government entity.</p>
<p>For practical purposes, commemorative silver coins aren't much use as money, because it would be silly to spend them for a fraction of what you paid for them. But since the mint is authorized by the government to imbue them with a cash value, they do so, and collectors love it.</p>
<p>The short answer, then, is because people will pay that much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
