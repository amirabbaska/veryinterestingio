		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually two different reasons. Steel tastes different because metal ions alter the pH of the water slightly. Plastic cups change the taste because when the plastic cups are formed, there are still left over monomers and short oligomers which are in the plastic matrix but not really connected to it. These chemicals slowly leach out. The traditional 'plastic' taste came from formaldehyde that leached out of old bakerlite cups; nowadays <del>barely any</del>significantly fewer chemicals leach out and those that do have <del>almost no effect</del>dramatically less effect than <strong>formaldehyde</strong> the poisonous carcinogen on human biology, so for the most part any 'plastic' taste (ie the taste that came from leached formaldehyde back when bakelite was commonly used) is in your head.</p>
<p>The reason drinks stored in different containers taste different is separate altogether. Permeation of both UV light and carbon dioxide will slowly alter the pH of a drink. Ceramic has extremely low levels of both, clear glass has low levels of CO2 but high levels of UV, aluminum and steel have low levels of UV but moderate levels of CO2, and plastic containers have high levels of both UV and CO2 permeation. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ice cream testers use gold-plated spoons for this reason. They allow to taste the ice-cream to a higher extent, and detect any off aftertastes.</p>
<p>I remember seeing a documentary where someone compared tasting cream with a tin spoon, an aluminium spoon and a gold spoon. The one with gold tasted way more creamier. Cool stuff.</p>
<p>*edit: Christ, I know it isn't an explanation! Fine, stuff tastes different depending on the cup/cutlery's material because the material can react with the food, such as by leaching into it. For instance, glass reacts less than aluminium cans with many of the liquids we drink, so they usually tastes nicer out of a glass (even though nowadays cans are often coated to make them react less). Gold being an extremely inert metal, is great at not-reacting with foods, making things like cream taste far better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Might be buried in another reply, but don't forget the role of smell, especially with plastic cups. A huge chunk of what we describe as flavor is actually scent. (Scientists haven't agreed on a % that is due to scent, but we all know it from the bland taste of food when you have a stuffed up nose).</p>
<p>So one good experiment for the leeching theory would be to let water sit in one container but then pour it into another type and immediately drink it. For example, have water sit in a plastic cup for five minutes, pour it into a steel one, and drink it to see if it tastes plasticky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's a matter of material migration from the container to the food. All containers are tested and certified as to their variability to contain various types of food without contaminating them, either on a level physical level (pieces of plastic) or chemical level (plastic tenant toxins). </p>
<p>I would put my money on that the human tongue and nose catch onto small differences in the containers' smell and textile sensation and add that to the flavor impression on the brain.</p>
<p>FYI, apart from reusing well-washed glass bottles, never reuse other containers for medium to longterm food storage. For example, olive oil (even the most virgin kind) will cause a plastic water-bottle's walls to slowly dissolve releasing plastics into the oil, thus making it toxic and carcinogenic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
