		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While people often think of the gigantic, brutal head to head hits when they think of CTE, a huge part of the risk is just the every-play blocking and the fact that if you go from moving fast to a dead stop, your brain can smack against your skull. Because of the increased padding and increased rest time (time between plays and not playing both offense/defense), there is far more emphasis on explosiveness, strength, and speed relative to endurance in American football. You're not going to get a 4-5 300+ pound guys in rugby because they just can't keep up all game, but their 40 times are absolutely incredible for their size. So you've got everyone hitting everyone on every play, and they can put more force behind each hit because they're better rested. Additionally, the combination of helmets and the 10-yard first down rules means that the rugby wrap-up style tackling might not always be the most effective if they fall forward another 2-3 yards</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is less research in rugby (both Union and League) but head trauma is very much a hot topic. Head Injury Assessments are now frequent in-game (and commentators are quick to pick up on ones they think have been missed). But in the end CTE is hard to research because it can only be diagnosed post-mortem.  BTW, Jeff Astle, a 1960s English football (soccer) player was diagnosed post-mortem - he was famed for scoring  headed goals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different studies have shown that the padding in Football adds to the violence and danger of the sport. There are tackle football leagues starting up now that do not allow padding. The tackling technique features more body-to-body contact than helmet-to-helmet or helmet-to-body contact.</p>
<p>Rugby fits into this. While there are some massive hits in a game of pro-rugby, players generally go for the legs or the body and everyone &quot;protects&quot; their heads.</p>
<p>Someone also pointed out that there is more &quot;rest periods&quot; in football between plays, where rugby is non-stop with the exception of stoppages and resets after points are scored. Generally, the speeds and &quot;power&quot; in rugby are reduced compared to football.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's starting to become a big deal in Rugby League. A number of former players are coming out saying they have brain damage and a former player commited Suicide that may have been related to all the head knocks he took over his career. We've had rule changes to combat concussions and despite some initial resistance to that everyone has learned to live with it.</p>
<p>Having played both union and league, when i watch nfl the thing you notice most, after the stop-start nature of the game, is the lack of technique in tackling. Gridirons players just seem to throw themselves at a ball carrier and hope for the best. In league if you just knock the bloke to the ground the tackle isn't complete, the ball carrier has the right to get up and keep running. We are coached technique from a young age. 'Head to the side, shoulder contact first, wrap the arms' and 'they can't run without legs'. As you get older you get taught more. In both rugbys play doesn't stop after the tackle, it immediately continues, so when you are tackling you are also keeping in mine that you have to slow down the opponents oppurtunity to immediately continue on with play. This is vitally important in Rugby League. So when you make a tackle you not only have to stop the ball carriers momentum, you also have to stop the ball carriers abilty to offload the ball, and then you have to try and slow down the opponents ability to continue on with the next play, usually by trying to get the ball player on to his back so your teammates have an extra second or 2 to get the defensive line set for the next play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because rugby is a less violent sport.</p>
<p>Blocking is not allowed, and without forward passes, there are fewer situations where players collide running at full speed.  Also, without as many stops in the action, players have to pace themselves, going all out like NFL players do would quickly exhaust them without a rest.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, without padding, rugby players are less likely to launch themselves into each other with reckless abandon.  Those that do will be out of the game with broken bones long before CTE is an issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
