		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your mouth has receptors called TRPM8 that usually respond when there is low temperature in your mouth which tells your body &quot;Hey its cold!&quot;. It does this by opening an ion channel and letting charged molecules flow through which creates an electric signal that goes your brain.</p>
<p>Menthol or mint oil in mint gum can bind to these receptors, causing them to activate. This tells your brain &quot;Hey its cold!&quot; in your mouth when it really isn't.</p>
<p>A similar mechanism exists for chillies, which is why they're &quot;Hot&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It usually has nothing to do with the mint, most sugar free gum uses sugar alcohol (super sweet low calorie sweetener) to sweeten it. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_alcohol" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sugar_alcohol</a></p>
<p>“In addition to their sweetness, some sugar alcohols can produce a noticeable cooling sensation in the mouth when highly concentrated, for instance in sugar-free hard candy or chewing gum. This happens, for example, with the crystalline phase of sorbitol, erythritol, xylitol, mannitol, lactitol and maltitol. The cooling sensation is due to the dissolution of the sugar alcohol being an endothermic (heat-absorbing) reaction, one with a strong heat of solution.[11]”</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
