		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. MD Anesthesiologist here. Gases are present in your blood and any other liquids in your body, such as synovial (joint) fluid. Being present does not mean that it is a bubble though. The amount of gas that can be dissolved in a liquid depends on the pressure, temperature, and type of liquid. Like the CO2 in a bottle of soda, bubbles form when the pressure drops as you open the cap. When you crack your knuckle, you are stretching the joint space and creating a vacuum, and the bubble audibly &quot;snaps&quot; out of solution. That's why you can't crack the same knuckle right away, you have to wait a while for the bubble to re-dissolve. When you surface from a dive, you are essentially applying a vacuum to your whole body as you move from higher pressure to lower pressure, and you really don't want that gas to form bubbles in your blood vessels where they will block flow and cause strokes, heart attacks, and excruciating pain in muscles and joints. Hurts to bend joints, which is why they call it &quot;The Bends&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What we worry about when diving is nitrogen in our blood boiling if we rise too quickly since it's under pressure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since most joints are synovial joints (elbow, knuckle, knee etc...) they contain a lubricant known as synovial fluid. Synovial fluid has a mixture of gases like nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. When you crack a joint you release these gases, which forms a bubble.. giving you the sound of cracking joints. </p>
<p>When individuals go diving, increased pressure from lower depths allows more gaseous nitrogen to be dissolved into the blood (according to Henry's law). The dangerous part is when divers ascend really quick from lower depths. Since there is lower pressure closer to the water surface less nitrogen will be able to be dissolved in the blood, so it comes out of the blood by forming N2 (gaseous nitrogen) bubbles (very painful). So what they do to counteract this is ascend very slowly to allow the body to naturally exhale the excess N2 in the blood.</p>
<p><em>So yes, they are technically the same gas!</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't any gas in your joints.  There are dissolved gasses in the fluid surrounding a joint.</p>
<p>When you crack your knuckle, you apply pressure to that fluid, which causes it to heat up a bit.  At some point, there's a sudden drop in the pressure, causing the fluid to boil for a split-second.  This forms a small bubble, which then collapses.  The fluid collapsing onto itself creates the &quot;pop&quot; or &quot;crack&quot;.</p>
<p>You're basically causing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavitation" target="_blank">Cavitation</a> in the joint.</p>
<p>As for diving, the dissolved gasses in the blood and joints can come out of solution (expand, forming bubbles) if you ascend too quickly.  Bubbles in the blood can cause a pulmonary embolism, which is often fatal.  Bubbles in the joints cause a great deal of pain, causing the diver to assume a fetal position (or other positions) in an attempt to alleviate the pain.  This is where the phrase &quot;The Bends&quot; comes from:  a diver bending over in pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a gas is already present at the surface before a dive... it will compress at depth, but eventually expand back on return.  So no change.  Same applies if you hold your breath and dive... you can go as deep as you want and still return as quickly as you want... because you haven't added any gases.  Problem occurs when you add gas at depth and then attempt to surface with new gases which will now expand, such as diving with tanks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
