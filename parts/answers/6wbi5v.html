		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of a genetic mutation that causes a specific area of the scalps follicles to be sensitive to DHT - a preprogrammed pattern. It takes a long time for the follicles to respond to the onset of it but eventually it gets ya. </p>
<p>I am bald on top and it actually initially started with me when I was 17 at the very edges of my forehead! So minor it was back then, but 18 rolled by and it wasn't too bad, then 19 it got slightly worse, creating the more defined M shape (no spam at the back first, thankfully), then 20 it progressed quite a lot on the tops of the left and right of the forehead and by 21 it got so bad at the left and right of my forehead that I started shaving my head completely. Realistically I could have just had short hair but meh. Through 21 to 28 it thinned out on top completely so I now have the definitive horseshoe shape if I don't cut my hair, but I shave my head completely anyway. If I run my hand across my head through the middle there is still a quite a few bristles but no where near enough to grow it - I am fortunate my hair is a mousy blonde colour so it doesn't show as much. Fortunately I don't look too bad bald/shaved and kind of suit it. Some people are very unfortunate and do not.</p>
<p>So yeah, testosterone encourages hair growth, but a messed up genetic mutation is why a predetermined pattern of weakened hair, sensitive to DHT is why we lose it. Like all of these things, just like other genetic inheritance of, say, diseases, the onset is unknown but expresses itself within a certain time frame  - this is why some of us get hair loss at varying times, some very late, some super early (like me). For example; my Dad is bald and his Mother, who he heavily takes after, her father was bald. I take heavily after my Dad but he had decent hair till his mid 20s, I didn't. It was a lot more pronounced on my forehead earlier on than on my Father. My Grandfather, who I don't take after much, is bald but that didn't affect him till his 50s. So the genes are all there. My Brother however takes heavily after my Mother, whose father isn't bald nor is my Mother's father (as far as I am aware). So while my Brother is whining about his receding hairline at the corners, left and right of his forehead, and has been moaning about it for years, his hair receding is so minor it seems to me, ridiculous. My brother is 9 months younger than me and he has almost all of his hair. He is at the stage I was at 19/20! (We are currently both 28, but I will be 29 in February).</p>
<p>Blah, rambles. My apologies. A lot of shit will happen if you cherish your locks... Or not. Look at your family history and try not to worry too much. There are ways of slowing hair loss, even if it is genetic Male Pattern Baldness (MPB). However do not go spending fortunes on trying to cure the inevitable. There are cost effective solutions that can slow the process but it isn't a guarantee for everyone. Or, you may be lucky and it may not progress heavily till you are older. </p>
<p>You may experience a roller-coaster of emotions or you may be more chilled about hair loss like I was. There will be moments in your life where you get pangs and thoughts or wishes of having hair or doing something about (transplants, research, etc) but the best way to be is to be accepting of yourself and not trying to please everyone else. My brother once told me that the new people you meet will not find you ugly or weird looking because they have only ever seen you with your head shaved... So yeah that helped me when I had my doubts about going out. </p>
<p>If you are worried and it appears to be progressive, instead of clinging on to hair like it is all there is to life, experiment with shorter hair styles gradually over the years until eventually cutting it to 0.5mm with a trimmer - this means it is a less drastic or shocking change to people you are around rather than going from longish hair to slap head, because stark differences, whether it be hair or anything else is always going to draw attention. You don't have to go cue-ball style. In fact, I never even started using a razor on my head until a couple of months ago! You really don't need to use a razor. Short and tidy 0.5mm hair will show a faint outline of where your hairline is, but because it's very short it looks good, not old man style. Embrace le bald when the time comes, it is not as bad as you think. </p>
<p>All the best dude. Remember, don't worry! (งツ)ว</p>

<li>
<p>95% of balding is due to Androgenic Alopecia, a hereditary gene. You can get them from either your Mother or Father, not just the maternal side as one myth is reported. The other 5% is often due to underlying health issues like Thyroid problems, Stress induced hairloss (Telogen Effluvium) or other conditions called Alopecia Areata, Alopecia Totalis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Classic MPB (Male Pattern Baldness) comes normally in two forms. One is the ‘’classic’’ type where you see a recession of the hairline at the temples into a deep ‘M’ shape followed by a bald spot at the crown (around where your cowlick can be). The bald spot often gets bigger and bigger until it joins at the hairline. These are examples of more extreme baldness where the spot meets the hairline and is normally classified under the Norwood hairloss scale as types V, VI &amp; VII. The other type of male hairloss due to genetics called diffuse hairloss. There is not often a recession of the hairline at the temples but instead the whole top goes out over time. Reports have said this is generally a more aggressive form of hairloss but the severity of the hairloss is generally more down to the individual and their genetics. </p>

<p>Hairloss in women comes under the Ludwig scale and ‘’generally’’ follows a different pattern to men where the centre parting of hair gets wider and wider.</p>
</li>

<p>Hairloss is down to your genetic sensitivity to your own hormones. Everyone, man and women but men in higher quantities have a hormone in your body called DHT (Dihydro-testosterone). It is a far more potent form of Testosterone and gives men their male characteristics such as deep voice, body hair and formation of male genitalia. It is produced in the Prostate, Testicles, Adrenal Glands &amp; Hair Follicles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People say that it is high levels of DHT that cause baldness or high levels of Testosterone but this is incorrect. It’s actually how sensitive you are to your own hormones and how many receptor you have in your existing hair follicles. You could have incredibly low DHT levels but a lot of receptor sites in your hair follicles thus becoming bald or incredibly high DHT levels but if you have very little DHT receptors in your hair follicles then you likely won’t go very bald or at all. Also a myth exists that men who go bald have more testosterone, this is also not true. It's all down to the individual.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>People believe there are other causations and reasons for balding but the DHT theory in combination with chronic but low level inflammation in the scalp (which is why your scalp can itch) is generally the most widely accepted. There is other things regarding KROX-20, WNT pathways, PGD2 and Lactate production but I won’t get into them. They are still being debated and until we have more evidence people generally just tackle DHT as the primary culprit. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the moment the only two FDA approved treatments for hairloss is Minoxidil (Rogaine, Regaine, Kirkland etc) and Propecia/Finasteride. However, both are life long commitments and can come with side effects. Minoxidil is a vasodilator meaning it increases blood supply to the area it is applied. Some people manage to maintain, a lucky few grow some hair back and an unlucky few actually lose hair. Other reported side effects are dark circles under the eyes, shortness of breath, heart palpitations and even aging of skin due to it (allegedly) inhibiting collagen production in the skin. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Propecia/Finasteride first patented by Merck for BPH (Enlarged Prostate) until they discovered it could stop or slow down balding and now produced also elsewhere by other companies is an oral medication that stops the conversion of Testosterone into DHT by blocking the mechanism 5-AR. Some people report good results and maintain or even regrow some hair however in recent years a lot of reports side effects (primarily of a sexual manner) but also of a psychological manner have surfaced. Merck claimed 1-2% of men got these side effects but other studies say it is far, far higher. These side effects can include testicle ache, weak or useless erections, watery semen, loss of libido and depression. Merck claims all side effects should stop once the drug is stopped but some individuals report side effects lasting months or years after cessation. There is a longer list but I will not get into them. I had side effects for 16 months. I was on it for 3 weeks. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finasteride/Propecia is often prescribed by a Doctor. It generally comes in a 1mg pill which is to be taken daily but some people take 0.25mg every day or up to 1.25mg every day by splitting the 5mg pills into quarters. 5mg is generally used for enlarged prostate. Propecia/Finasteride stops the conversion of Testosterone to DHT by up to 70%. Whilst people are still not completely 100% the reason a lot of men (but some don’t) get side effects is because they are decreasing their primary male hormone by a large quantity. This medication should not be used by women and ideally not men who have not finished developing (18-21). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are other things that can stop or prevent hairloss but they are likely not very effective. There is a lot of fake and phony products on the market that exist purely to take money from them. Please please do your research before purchasing hairloss products. Forums are easy to find and so is the information. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is also HT (Hair Transplants) but they can be expensive, ineffective or give a very un-natural look plus there is alot of dodgy HT doctors out there so DO YOUR RESEARCH should you choose to go down this route. Also alot of Doctors recommend you take Propecia/Finasteride after a HT but if you had side effects or don't want to take medication the rest of your life HT can be only a temporary fix before you lose more hair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upcoming treatments:
Science is advancing at an incredible rate but a lot of people complain that we are yet to have a safe cure for balding. I will not go into great detail but there is currently many companies who are working on alternate treatments. There is big $$$ to be made. If you are reading this and are particularly depressed about going bald here are some companies or upcoming drugs you could look into;</p>
</li>
<li>Replicel/Sheseido</li>
<li>Tsuji Hair Cloning</li>
<li>Brotzu Hair Lotion (FIDIA)</li>
<li>JAK Inhibitors</li>
<li>Follica</li>
<li>Follicum</li>
<li>Rivertown Therapeutics</li>
<li>
<p>Allergan (Setipiprant)
-Fevipiprant (for asthma but some evidence theorises it could be very effective for balding)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why does curing hairloss even matter?
A lot of people say we should be curing things like Cancer, HIV, MS, Dementia and Diabetes instead of hairloss but currently we are trying to cure all that are listed and hairloss. Just like women deserve a safer alternative to the pill (messing with hormones is not safe alot of the time, the balance is very delicate) men and women also deserve safer alternatives to hairloss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people go bald and it’s not a big deal, they own it and look great and honestly I say absolute power to you. However, many young men and women (typically who go bald faster as it begins earlier) find balding very destructive to their self-esteem and confidence. We live in a world now where vanity is becoming more and more prominent. Not only that but losing hair, particularly at a young age can destroy ones confidence. Especially when you are in the process of discovering who you are. On top of that there is also a stigma against men wearing wigs but not against women and if men are discovered they will often be ridiculed or called ‘’shallow’’ or ‘’vain’’. </p>
</li>
<li>I hope this post has cleared up some information. If anyone notices corrections please feel free to comment and I’ll adjust the post accordingly. I tried not to be biased too much but as a young individual losing their hair fast and young it’s a hard burden to carry, particularly when conventional treatments did me more damage than good. </li>

<p>Oh and inb4;</p>

<p>‘’Just shave it and hit the gym’’ – Some of don’t want to be ripped. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Some girls/guys love bald guys’’ – Great but some of us don’t love being bald guys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any comments regarding Jason Statham, Vin Diesel, The Rock or Patrick Stewart. These men are the exception but we are bored of seeing their names in every hairloss thread. Myself and many others don't aspire to be this men. We merely aspire to be comfortable in our skin.</p>

<li>&quot;Get over it, it’s only hair’’. Ok, let me remove your favourite feature of your body and then get over it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that hair all over the body has different responses to testosterone (especially when it gets converted to DHT that causes hair follicles to fall out). Beard hair tends to grow more with more testosterone but hair on the crown (front hairline to the the “bald spot” area on the back of he head) tends to fall out due to DHT. Facial hair and hair around the side and back of the head is more resistant to DHT and therefore doesn’t usually fall out (leading to the old man hair we usually think of, i.e. bald on top and front but hair on the side and back of head). This is why hair transplants tend to pull hair roots from the back of the head since they are more resistant to DHT.</p>
<p>I started seeing my hairline recede when I was 24 and I started using minoxidil (Rogaine) and it helped me keep most of my hair. The sooner you start treatment the better the results, but you have to keep using for the rest of your life or it will start to fall out. Minoxidil and propecia (proscar) are the only FDA approved drugs to treat hair loss. Everything else out there has yet to be medically proven to work.</p>
<p>Fun fact, hair lost isn’t actually “dead” but is just in a really long resting phase. Your hair is constantly going from growing, falling out, resting then growing phases. Eventually your hair just rest permanently then you have balding in that area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Testosterone gets converted in the body to something called DHT (dihydrotestosterone) which is useful for many important things in the body.</p>
<p>People have different types of hair folicles and The ones on our head are actually different to the ones on our body, they have a much longer growth cycle and are sensitive to DHT. DHT binds to the hair follicles on the head which makes them weaker and with every growth cycle, the hair will grow thinner and thinner until it can no longer penetrate through the skin anymore. </p>
<p>Hair loss medications use a form of DHT blocker (finasteride, Azelaic acid, etc) combined with other stuff to free the weakened hair follicles from DHT and allow them to regain some or all of their strength.  </p>
<p>body builders, athletes and other steroid users who inject testosterone also end up increasing their DHT levels because there is more test to convert. This is why hair loss is a common side effect of anabolic steroids. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Men go bald <em>because of</em>, not in spite of, testosterone.</p>
<p>DHT is a similar hormone to testosterone.*</p>
<p>How much free-circulating testosterone, and how much free-circulating DHT you have in your blood determine a lot of things.</p>
<p>Male hormones are often spoken of in terms of how anabolic and androgenic they are. Anabolic basically means binding to receptors in muscles and making 'em grow. Androgenic basically means binding to receptors in other tissues and making 'em do other man stuff.</p>
<p>DHT is somewhat anabolic, and much more androgenic than testosterone. When it binds to hairs, it makes them convert from baby-soft, lighter, finer hair type, to old-man, darker, thicker type. DHT is also mostly responsible for the progress of male pattern baldness, thickening and darkening of facial hair, chest hair, and pubes.</p>
<p>Here's a source talking about how male pattern baldness may be related to some sort of disorder with DHT: <a href="http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/68082.php" target="_blank">http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/68082.php</a></p>
<p>EDIT: DHT is <em>not</em> &quot;basically 2 testosterones hooked together&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
