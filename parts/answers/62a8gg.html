		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although Tyrannosaurs (and other large therapods) had small arms, fossil evidence shows that they were well-muscled and quite strong. This isn't really consistent with the idea that the arms were useless or vestigial.</p>
<p>To my knowledge, the <del>two</del> three main theories as to what T-rex's arms were used for were either A: for holding struggling prey before it was killed by the jaws, B: for helping to rise from a prone position, or C: something to do with mating.</p>
<p>For my money I'd say B sounds the most likely but I'm not a paleontologist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Saw a documentary once that stated that part of a T-Rex's mating ritual was for the males to &quot;tickle&quot; their partners during intercourse. Honestly, though, the closest we'll ever get to knowing this stuff is pure speculation, unless we start time travelling. But as far as I know, it was for mating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because this happened pre human history, we may never know for sure, and can only make educated speculation based on fossil evidence.</p>
<p>Maybe it used the arms to grab injured or dead prey that it killed, maybe it was a giant scavenger that stole other hunters prey, etc.</p>
