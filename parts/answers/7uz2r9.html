<p>One of their main functions is carrying the transcribed DNA to different ribosomes in the body.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you're a little confused here. Genes transcribed from mtDNA stay within the cell they were transcribed in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is it possible for instructions to be altered causing deficiencies in the organism</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure, although changes to the coding genes in the electron transport chain are typically cell lethal and those genes are highly conserved. Same goes for rRNA genes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If so, what are they, and how high is the rate of incidence (occurrence)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Rare. As many of the possible changes to mt genes are lethal and unlikely to be passed on</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if you're confused or it's just the wording of your question but hopefully this will help. In humans, each cell has thousands of mitochondria, and each mitochondria has more than one copy of it's genome. This keeps the effect of individual mutations down. The mRNA/tRNA/rRNA in mitochondria don't leave, they're used only in the mitochondria. A number of proteins that are needed but not made in the mitochondria are encoded in the nuclear DNA and the proteins made are transported into the mitochondria, they don't go the other way.</p>
<p>As already pointed out, most mutations in mitochondrial DNA are lethal to the individual mitochondria or the cell they are in, so never affect the entire organism. Mutations in the nuclear genes occasionally occur that result in disease but not death. These tend to be mutations not in energy production but in replicating and repairing mitochondrial DNA that changes result in much higher instability in the mitochondrial DNA so the individual has a much higher load of defective mitochondria over time.</p>
<p>Mutations in actual mitochondrial genome DNA that get passed on are very rare and the rate is actually used to determine how distantly related two species are. Most are silent mutations where a DNA base pair is changed, but in the end doesn't change the finalprotein amino acid or it's function. Rates of actually function altering mutations in mitochondrial DNA are incredibly low since they are usually lethal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do not know much about mitochondrial DNA, but as a molecular plant biologist, we change DNA of all kinds of genes, cis-regulatory elements, enhancer and suppressor elements all day. Even DNA of highly conserved motifs can be changed, and most of the time no phenotypic effect is observed. A lot of redundancy exists in the genome, and multiple mutations in different genes are commonly required to see an altered phenotype (lower fitness in organism).</p>
<p>Even if a highly conserved important gene is mutated, most of the time the effects are small, however it does occur the mutation has a lethal phenotype, which I can imagine occurs in mtDNa. Meaning the offspring does not survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked a similar question about the rate of mitochondrial disease to a professor that specializes in mitochondria. He said that the incidence of mitochondrial disease is low because of the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) Mitochondria have several copies of their genome. Some mutations may be masked by other copies of the gene.</p>
<p>2)Cells contain thousands of mitochondria, so the ratio of mutated to normal mitochondria plays a role in the manifestation of a phenotype.</p>
<p>3) Mitochondria undergo mitophagy, meaning that old or damaged mitochondria get degraded and replaced with new mitochondria. </p>
<p>I also learned recently that mitochondria can undergo fusion to increase output, a mechanism that may save damaged mitochondria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be clear, mitochondria within cells contain their own circular genomes and ribosomes separate from the rest of the cell, and they pretty much replicate and operate independently.</p>
<p>Mitochondria produce ATP and is responsible for producing energy for the cell. Mitochondrial DNA can and does get mutated, and in eggs, this can be inherited from mother to children (the mitochondria of sperm cells degrade away). It's not super rare either, but mitochondrial disorders are expectedly characterized with muscle weakness due to lack of energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
