		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a very quick summary of the new science reported today, and what it means for the future of gravitational wave astronomy. </p>
<p>This event, <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/P170814/public" target="_blank">GW170814</a> is similar to the three events seen before. The black hole masses are in the 20-30 solar mass range. </p>
<p>The remarkable thing today is that this event was seen with 3 detectors. Past events had all been seen with just the two LIGO detectors, in Livingston, LA and Hanford, WA. This event was <em>also</em> seen by the European VIRGO detector. </p>
<p>So why is this important? First, it allows you to make measurements of gravitational wave polarization. Just like light, gravitational waves can be polarized. The detectors are slightly tilted with respect to each other, allowing us to resolve 'more' of the signal, essentially. </p>
<p>Additionally, the three detectors allow us to localize the event far better than before. This means we know what direction in the sky it happened. For past detections, events were <a href="http://www.ligo.org/images/faq-localization-comparison.jpg" target="_blank">localized to a ring</a>. We get this by knowing that gravitatoinal waves move at the speed of light, so if the signal arrives slightly earlier at one detector, we can localize it to a ring in space. With three detectors/detections, you can do proper triangulation. This has made the localization 20x more accurate (<a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P170814/public/main" target="_blank">see Fig 3</a>). See <a href="https://twitter.com/twitter/statuses/913090863164645376" target="_blank">a comparison of the localization of all 4 events here.</a></p>
<p>Improvements in localization will be necessary for studying new gravitational wave sources, such as neutron star mergers. Gravitational wave detectors are passive. They just sit and wait, and will detect any event that's loud enough, no matter the direction. That's fine for black hole mergers, because they're 'dark' events so you don't expect a big explosion to accompany it. In contrast, a neutron star merger would produce a wealth of electromagnetic signals. If LIGO observes a neutron star merger, and then can localize it well, it becomes possible to do electromagnetic followup observations quickly, giving us more detailed information about how the merger occurs and evolves.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Question: If 3 suns worth of energy got converted during the merger, then what happened to the information? Is it still retained by the blackhole or did it vanish with the gravitational wave?</p>
<p>I know this is a tricky question because of the black hole information paradox.</p>
<p>I asked this question in r/astronomy but I figure here it is more appropriate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
