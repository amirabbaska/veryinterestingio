		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of going on when you wash your hands.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Water is a universal solvent, meaning dissolves a lot of different substances (the most substances of any other liquid). This takes time, so the more time a substance spends under water, the more of it is dissolved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Physical agitation. The mere act of rubbing your hands together physically dislodges dirt and other substances. The more you do this (and the more firmly you do it) the more substances are dislodged.</p>
</li>
<li>Soap has two ends, one end is attracted to water, the other is not. The side that is not attracted to water grabs onto dirt and grime while the other side sticks to the water you are washing your hand with. As the water flows away, the soap goes with it, and so does the stuff the soap has grabbed.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soap is made up of fatty acids, which you can think of as tiny molecules with two ends. One end is attracted to water and the other end is attracted to fats/oils.</p>
<p>Oil and water typically don't mix very well. We constantly exude oils from our skin so whatever is on us is likely embedded in oils. What the soap does is enclose tiny bubbles of oil in a shell of soap molecules, with their oil/fat end pointed in and the water-attractive end out. This allows the little bubbles to mix into the water and be carried away, along with whatever was trapped in the oil.</p>
<p>Antibacterial soaps also have chemicals which would tend to be toxic to bacteria but they are questionably effective. Washing them away does much more than only maybe killing them.</p>
<p>Olive oil is an oil which allows skin oils to mix with it and can more easily wash away whatever is embedded in it. However it isn't as good in my view because oil is much more expensive than water and you need to use hundreds if not thousands of times more of it than soap. Plus you still end up with oily, sticky skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While taking a course in microbiology in university I did the following experiment:</p>
<p>We poured distilled water over our &quot;dirty&quot; hands onto an agar plate.</p>
<p>We then washed our hands with plain soap and water for 2 minutes.</p>
<p>We poured distilled water over our &quot;clean&quot; hands into another agar plate.</p>
<p>The plates were incubated and the next lab period we counted colonies.</p>
<p>The &quot;clean&quot; hands plate had twice as many bacterial colonies as the &quot;dirty&quot; hands plate. This was consistent for the whole class.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The function of washing your hands is largely friction based.</p>
<p>Getting all the dirt out of the grooves of your fingerprints etc is most efficiently done by just plain scrubbing. Rubbing them back and forth either on each other, on a wash cloth etc, flexes and moves the skin, and lets the water move the particles away. This removes most of the material that is making your hands dirty.</p>
<p>Soaps (and olive oil) are chemically similar to the oils and grease that are harder to clean off. They are also similar to the material that makes up our skin. That's why they stick so well, and why water beads up and runs off. Water is the opposite (highly polar)</p>
<p>For your construction friends - olive oil is going to dissolve the oil &amp; grease on their hands, because it is completely non-polar; soaps are mostly non-polar, with a couple polar points on one end; which help it act as a transitionary molecule to loosen the grease from your skin so that water can remove it. Soap is going to remove the naturally occuring oils from your skin. (which you typically replace with lotion, hair conditioner etc)</p>
<p>As far as anti-bacterial goes - most of it is bunk. anti-bacterials mostly use alcohols to kill the organisms present. between the toxicity of the alcohol, and the evaporation its going to kill the microbes. The thing is most of that isn't needed. Sure if you are in a sterile environment like an operating room, or working with people with severely compromised immune systems - you need anti-biotic soap. </p>
<p>tl;dr: washing with water works for almost everything, soap and water if you are working with oil, grease, fats (i.e. butchering); anti-bacterial in rare cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a sanitation point of view, assuming your hands are clean of grime, etc., you are mostly just using the flow of water and a little bit of agitation/friction, to loosen microbes from where they are hanging out so they can go down the drain.  Not much &quot;killing&quot; is going on, just moving.</p>
<p>This is why those supersonic air hand dryers are such a bad idea.  They are mostly just blowing the bacteria which are now concentrated at the tips of your fingers (and mobile) into the air.  Great, now they're airborne.</p>
<p>You might observer how surgeons scrub - they spend a lot of time with their hands in the flow of water, scrubbing.  Then they carefully rinse holding their hands with fingertips upright so the water is flowing down toward their elbow, and back away from the tap.  This keeps the remaining bacteria from pooling at the fingers that they are going to have inside a patient.  Then a scrub nurse hands them a sterile towel to dry with, and then gloves go on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
