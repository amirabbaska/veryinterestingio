		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recently read an article that put a damper on everyone's excitement for this system. Apparently the activity of the star was such that the solar wind from it would be much more violent than our own, and hence these planets would need very strong magnetospheres in order to be habitable.</p>
<p>Any comments on this? Is there a way to test for the existence of a magnetosphere on an exoplanet? Is the solar wind in this system really as harsh as I'd heard?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
