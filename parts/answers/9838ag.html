		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have a good heat shield and heat transported to the back of your spacecraft, you can essentially get to the point where friction is a problem. Typically these spacecrafts are in a very elliptic orbit so they are are only very close for hours at a time. Tungsten alloys or some high melting point ceramics will do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>For comparison, Parker Solar Probe will only get 6.2 million km from the Sun. Comet Lovejoy went 44 times as close. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what technology you're allowed to imagine yourself using.  Ultimately it's how much energy you can remove to keep the probe from melting.  Can we take a couple million tons of lead to melt to protect a 1mg payload?  I remember reading a story where they built an intelligent probe that used wormhole technology as a heat sink, and basically formed a separate sun next to the real one by piping heat through it.  You can stay inside indefinitely in that case...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, it's not really a proper citation but Isaac Arthur did an excellent video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ap4JhPoPQY" target="_blank">colonizing the sun</a>.  </p>
<p>TL;DW: we can probably colonize down into the upper photosphere with known materials and physics.  </p>
<p>We can deal with heat pretty effectively but gravity starts to become a big issue.  At the top of the photosphere, the gravitational attraction is about 28 times Earth standard.  By using rotating orbital rings, you can negate that gravity down to 1G.  By having nested rings, you can transfer heat from the lower rings up to shadowed radiators further up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
