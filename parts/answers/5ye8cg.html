		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cosmic rays can have visible effects on normal cameras by passing through the camera detector and depositing energy there. Here's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vFTJZjnjsk" target="_blank">short clip showing what it looks like</a> for a CCD camera, and here's a <a href="https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/questions/16753/could-this-be-a-cosmic-ray-hit-on-my-cameras-sensor-cmos-dslr" target="_blank">picture</a> from a CMOS.</p>
<p>The atmosphere shields pretty effectively against cosmic rays, so they get more frequent when you're above most of it. But you should not see much of a directional dependence on the screen, as the rays don't follow your normal camera optics, they pass straight through the camera from any direction. They often hit multiple pixels, so if you see something very bright and streak-like in your video, then that would be a good candidate. I didn't see anything like that, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting fact: on average within our galaxy, the energy stored in star light, infrared radiated from dust, cosmic rays, the galactic magnetic field and the cosmic microwave background is in rough equipartition at between 0.3--2.0 eV per cubic centimetre.</p>
<p>So if you could see cosmic rays (as perhaps you can with your camera) they would look about as bright as stars on the night sky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was in high school I had to assemble a cloud chamber as part of my Intel project on Cosmic rays. It's ridiculously simple and pretty cool to watch. It's just sealed terrarium with a block of dry ice and an alcohol drip. The tank fills with vapor and you can see the trails of any high-energy particles passing through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't say for cetain that a cosmic ray caused it, but I work with maintain CCD broadcast cameras for a TV network. The cameras that fly a lot have a lot more bad pixels than their earthbound brethren. If I turn off the defective pixel mask, I can see all the dead pixels. There has to be several hundred each for R,G,B. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
