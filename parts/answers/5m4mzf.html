		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A color changing LED isn't one LED in a package but three LEDs along with a small computer to drive them. The LED is made up of red, green and blue LEDs each of which can be controlled by a microcontroller. Since the two legs on the LED that supply the power are connected to the microcontroller and not the LED elements a current limit resistor is not required.</p>
<p>The microcontroller is able to turn each of the colors on or off, so if the red LED is turned on then the output from the color changing LED is red. When the blue LED is turned on it is blue, if both the blue and red LEDs are turned on then the color changing LED is a shade of purple (called magenta). Similarly combining red with green gives yellow and blue &amp; green gives cyan.</p>
<p>Although the color changing LED uses the six colors mentioned above, it slowly changes from one to another. This is still done using the three basic red, green &amp; blue elements. If the red LED is combined with the blue LED, but the blue LED is only driven at 50% of its normal brightness then a color half way between red and magenta is generated.</p>
<p>Whilst the red LED is left turned on, if the blue LED is slowly taken from 0% brightness to 100% brightness then the color will gradually change from red to magenta.</p>
<p>If a standard LED is turned on and off very quickly, say 100 times every second then as far as the human eye is concerned it looks like it is constantly on. If the amount of time the LED is on for is the same as the time it is off for then it will be on for 50% of the time and 50% of its full brightness.</p>
<p>This same method can be done with the three LED elements inside the color changing LED. This means it is possible to combine any amount of the red, green and blue to give the desired color. Looking once again at the change from red to magenta, if the blue LED starts mainly turned off, goes to being on and off in even amounts and then to mainly being on then the the color will change as required.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Masters Electrical Engineering. Most RGB LED have all three colors in them. You then light a specific one my applying power to the color you want. If you look at large LEDs that can do RGB, they have 4 prongs coming off. You then power the prong you want an bam! Color. One for ground, and then each color gets a prong. If you make a super small RGB LED and then combine a bunch into a massive array, you get a tv.</p>
<p>You can do it with a single light source, then apply a polarizing filter. The filter is controlled by a small current. This can produce colors as well and is the idea behind LCD displays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As most have said, they typically contain a red, green, and blue LED in one package. </p>
<p>Just wanted to point out: this is also how a TV or computer monitor works. There is a red, green, and blue pixel in a pattern over and over.</p>
<p>By controlling each color, you can basically make any color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Despite having a red and green LED, they can actually display a third colour. Light them both and you get yellow, because red and green light combined give you yellow light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
