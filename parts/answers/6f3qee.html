		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. </p>
<p>A person standing on the summit of Mt Chimborazo in Ecuador (furthest surface point from the center of the Earth, 6260 m ASL, 1.47° S.) would weigh about 0.7% less than they would at the North Pole.  </p>
<p>While I haven't done the math recently, I believe the two effects in play, gravitational and rotational, each contribute approximately equally to this result – between 0.3-0.4% each.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's do the math:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" target="_blank">Earth's equatorial radius</a> = 6,378,100 m
Earth's polar radius = 6,356,800 m</p>
<p>Rotational velocity at equator = 2<em>pi</em>(6,378,100 m)/(24 hours * 3600 seconds/hour) = 438 m/s (980 mph)</p>
<p>Centrifugal acceleration = V^2 /r = (438 m/s)^2 / (6,378,100 m) = 0.034 m/s^2</p>
<p>Which, as others have said is ~0.34% of 1G, so the rotational velocity of the equator would reduce your weight by that percentage relative to the poles. </p>
<p>Acceleration due to gravity is G*m(earth)/r^2, so the difference in gravity at the pole versus the equator is just (r(pole)/r(equator))^2, assuming Earth's mass is uniformly distributed. </p>
<p>((6,356,800 m)/(6,378,100 m))^2 = 0.9933 or a 0.67% reduction.</p>
<p>So unless I screwed up the math somewhere, the effect of the larger radius is approximately double the effect of centrifugal acceleration and the two effects together effectively reduce your weight by ~1% at the equator vs the poles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is the density lower from one side of the equator to the other, because of the centripetal/centrifugal force?</p>
<p>I learned: more mass = more &quot;gravity&quot;
If the earth has a higher radius and the density is the same - and I think it should - shouldn't the gravity be stronger at the equator since there is more mass between you and Space than at the North Pole?</p>
<p>Centrifugal force should lower the force you are being pressed against the earth, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
