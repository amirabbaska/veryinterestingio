		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm the girl from the tesseract post, so I'll give it a go. First of all, try not to think of the fourth dimension in terms of <em>time</em>. Some people make this argument, and it's very useful at times, but here we're discussing <em>spatial</em> dimensions: places you can physically move.</p>
<p>You can take a point and give it a dimension by moving away from it at a ninety degree angle. Move away from a straight line (left and right) at ninety degrees, and you invent a plane. Now you can move left and right and backwards and forwards independently. Move ninety degrees perpendicular to that plane and you can also move up and down. Now you can freely move anywhere in three dimensions. In our universe, that's your limit -- but mathematically, you don't have to stop there. We can conceptualise higher dimensions by following a pretty simple pattern:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/dd/Square_-_black_simple.svg/1200px-Square_-_black_simple.svg.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is a square, in <strong>two</strong> dimensions. Every point has <strong>two</strong> lines coming off it, at ninety degrees to each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.tts-group.co.uk/on/demandware.static/-/Sites-TTSGroupE-commerceMaster/default/dwfc86f880/images/hi-res/1000575_00_EY03166.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is (a representation of) a cube, in <strong>three</strong> dimensions. Every point has <strong>three</strong> lines coming off it, at ninety degrees to each other.</p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a2/Schlegel_wireframe_8-cell.png" target="_blank">Here</a> is (a representation of) a tesseract, in <strong>four</strong> dimensions. Every point has <strong>four</strong> lines coming off it, at ninety degrees to each other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And so on, and so forth. We can't represent these easily in lower dimensions, but mathematically they work. Every time you go perpendicular, to all of the lines in your diagram, you can add another dimension. Sides become faces, faces become cells, cells become hypercells... but the maths still works out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing you need to know is that, contrary to common use in science fiction, a dimension is not a place.  Neither is it a synonym for &quot;universe&quot;.  It's closer to a <em>direction</em>.</p>
<p>On a human scale, our world has three dimensions of space.  We have up/down, left/right, forward/back: each is at right-angles to the others, so if you measure your position in all three, then change it in one, it doesn't change in the other two.</p>
<p>Now, we're three-dimensional objects and so are our sensory organs, so we can't <em>perceive</em> a fourth dimension, but that doesn't mean one can't <em>exist</em>.  Imagine if there were a fourth direction, at right angles to all the other three.  This is difficult, because all your everyday experience is in three dimensions, but bear with me.</p>
<p>That fourth direction is also a fourth dimension.</p>
<p>You know how a rectangle only needs two dimensions, because it doesn't have any thickness?  If it had thickness, it'd be a cuboid, not a square.  Well, a tesseract is what you get if you take a cube and give it a size in this fourth dimension equal to its size in each of the other three.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't exactly do ELI5 but I'll try my best to explain. First off, this is hard to answer as stated because this question doesn't exactly make sense. There is no THE fourth dimension. What's the first dimension? The second? In order to answer this you must give some physical meaning to some phenomenon called dimension.</p>
<p>To understand what you're actually trying to get at you have to understand what a dimension actually is. In mathematics, usually we model dimensions on collections of the real numbers.</p>
<p>I'll start with an easy to visualize example: Consider an infinite sheet of flat paper with center C. We can determine the position of any point P on the piece of paper by specifying the amount of distance you have to move left or right from C and the amount of distance you have to move up or down from C  in order to get to P (where negative distance indicates going left or down). Thus each point P can be specified by exactly two numbers (x,y) and so in some sense this infinite sheet of paper is equal to the collection of all pairs of real numbers (x,y). We call the set of all such collections R^2. In mathematics, this set is the model we use for all things two dimensional.</p>
<p>In a similar fashion we can pretend our universe extends infinitely in all directions and that it also has a center C. It shouldn't be hard to see that specifying any position in the universe is the same as specifying three numbers (think length, width, and height). Thus we say the collection of all triples of numbers (x,y,z) is three dimensional. It's this space that we use to model all three dimensional things.</p>
<p>Now, consider the set R^4 of all collections of real numbers (x,y,z,w). We say this set is 4 dimensional because you have exactly four degrees of freedom x,y,z, and w. This set may represent the position of a particle in a four dimensional spacetime (with the fourth dimension being time) or something of that nature but it's what we call the standard 4-dimensional space. The point here is that the space doesn't have to have a physical meaning or anything like that. It's just a model that we use for all things that have four dimensions.</p>
<p>In this fashion, we can find standard models for n dimensions by specifying n real numbers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, people say that the fourth dimension IS time when they're really just thinking of R^4 as a physical spacetime. Four dimensional things don't have to look like R^4 though. In math, we usually take these simple models and patch them together to create things like spheres or the torus or the tesseract. This thinking leads you to the definition of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manifold" target="_blank">manifold</a> which locally look like R^n for some n. Physicists have many many models of 4-dimensional spacetimes and they're all 4-dimensional manifolds. We're still not certain which manifold actually models our whole universe though :)</p>
<p>I hope this helped you get an idea of what dimensions are. Usually we take the simple models we can visualize and try to extrapolate. I can answer any other questions you may have about this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
