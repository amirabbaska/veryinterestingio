		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When memories, sensations, and thoughts are “activated” in the brain, the brain areas responsible for these show an increase in activity and blood flow. It has been shown that (mostly) the same areas of the brain are active when you think about a sensation and when you experience the sensation itself. When you hear music, the vibrating bones in your ears in turn create a unique vibrating signature on cells deeper in the ear, and a neural signal is sent from these cells to the areas of the brain that are responsible for “decoding” this signal and turning it into music (or speech) that you can understand. When you think about the sound, but aren’t actually hearing it, you skip all of the ear steps and activate the memory-related parts of the brain as well as the same sound-related parts that were activated when you heard it. Music has been shown to be closely tied with emotion, so the related emotional areas of the brain will likely be activated when you think about the music as well. You should note that in general, when you think about a sensation, you get less overall activation than if you are experiencing it in real life. Thus, when you actually hear music, it is likely going to be more intense than just thinking about it. This is all a gross oversimplification of the process, but for ELI5 I hope it will be sufficient.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There seems to be a common trend in this subreddit with answering questions like this. What I suspect you're going to get are lots of perfectly reasonable replies about how brain areas correspond to activation from listening to music, etc. Which is not anywhere near an answer to the question you asked. </p>
<p>The answer to the question you asked is: We currently don't know. </p>
<p>You seem to be asking about conscious experience and while we have a lot of information from pairing brain areas with stimuli, we really don't have a good (or even the beginning of an) explanation as to why we're conscious. That's the long and short of it. </p>
<p>If I'm correct - you seem to be asking, &quot;Why do I have this weird conscious experience of X?&quot; Since we don't know why you're conscious in the first place, no one can honestly give you a good answer yet, I'm afraid. Until we have a systematic explanation that joins neuroscience and psychology (hardware and software, really), there's not much point even trying to take a stab at questions like yours. Mental replaying of events appears to be way off in our explanation timeline. Elaborate replies about neuroscience and memory aside, we honestly just don't know how subjective experience comes about in the brain. </p>
<p>It's an excellent question nevertheless. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side question? Side question; Why can I sometimes produce sounds in my head which sound like the actual music and sometimes it's just my voice (my internal monologue) singing, often poorly and off-key like I sing in real life.
I don't know how universal this is. It's like if I focus on the song it stops being the actual song but if I kind of soft-focus my inner monologue (kind of like how people describe looking at magic eye images, only with my inner voice) I can hear the actual song. Why is that? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll tell you easy enough, what you hear inside your head is not sound at all so technically you are not ''hearing'' you are not doing 'it' with your ears.  </p>
<p>What you are experiencing is the energy your brain works with, if you pay attention to it, you will discover it has a sort of rhythm or certain frequency that can change.  Some say the ability to pay attention to this rythm or stream of thoughts without judging it, is key to enlightenment and the way to understand yourself as what you call ''the universe'' ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
