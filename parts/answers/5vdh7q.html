		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that you have founded a new Business trying to create a new Factory to produce Widgets. You don't have the cash on hand to build that Factory, and you don't have the Credit History to borrow it all from one place. You <em>could</em> issue Stock, but that would reduce your control over the business significantly.</p>
<p>Instead, you decide that you will issue Bonds. Bonds are <em>promissory notes</em>, basically an IOU. A Bond is a  promise that you will pay whoever legally owns it back what they bought it for, plus a certain amount of interest, on or after a certain date. Bonds are <em>much smaller</em> than Loans. The big benefit to Bonds over a Loan is that Creditors get to choose how much of a risk they're taking on you. Also, if you want, you can offer to buy back Bonds early for <em>less</em> than they're going to be worth if people hold onto them.</p>
<p>Bonds don't work like Loans or like Credit, which are the two types of Debt that most Americans deal with every day. You know <em>exactly</em> what you're going to owe, and <em>exactly</em> when you're going to owe it. If someone forgets to redeem their bond, they <strong>will not</strong> continue to accumulate interest past the date it could be redeemed. Bonds &quot;growing&quot; past their Redemption Date is a Myth, and I blame Sitcoms for it. The present it as if it were compound interest, when it's really just the Bond's Terms allowing for its value at the date of redemption to be adjusted for Inflation.</p>
<p>It should be noted that some Bonds <em>do</em> expire after a reasonable period of time, for the same reason that Gift Cards expire after a reasonable period of time. It's to keep the Accounting Ledgers from accumulating <em>countless</em> entries that will never be redeemed, because the Bond has been forgotten. Government Bonds <em>usually</em> don't include an expiration date, though.</p>
<hr />
<p>The United States Government <em>looks</em> like it has an unmanageable amount of Debt. Indeed, were it a Line of Credit (Credit Card) or a Loan with a reasonable interest rate... I'd doubt that we would ever be able to pay it off. Compound Interest would <em>murder us</em>. Fortunately, our government isn't <strong>stupid</strong> enough to go with Credit or Loans when it comes to the National Debt.</p>
<p>We know when <em>every</em> Bond that has been issued will be due and how much they will be worth; and we have planned accordingly. The United States pays off <em>every</em> Bond that someone wants to Redeem. In its entire history, the United States Treasury has never failed to pay a Bond that it has issued. There aren't many Countries that can say that, and that's why US Treasury Bonds are seen as a safe investment.</p>
<p>The Debt <em>will</em> be paid off as it comes due. It has <em>always</em> been paid of exactly when it comes due. The United States is nowhere near being in a position where we can't pay off our Debts as they come due. You'll know when we get near that position, because the Head of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Secretary will appear on all the News Channels talking about the situation.</p>
<hr />
<p>Interesting Side Notes:</p>
<p><strong>We owe most of the Debt to ourselves.</strong></p>
<p>~$5.54 Trillion Dollars of our Debt is owed to Agencies within the United States Federal Government. I've checked, and there is no typo in the sentence that preceded this one. Almost <em>a third</em> of the Debt is owed to the US Federal Government.</p>
<p>~$2.463 Trillion Dollars of our Debt is owed to the United States Federal Reserve Bank.</p>
<p>The Feds alone hold ~$8 Trillion Dollars of our National Debt, if you count the Reserve Bank (which we should, since Federal Appointees make up half of its Board). That's kinda interesting, considering how Foreign Governments only hold ~$6.281 Trillion Dollars. </p>
<p>Yep, that's right. The US Federal Government owes more money <em>to itself</em> than it does to all Foreign Governments <em>combined</em>.</p>
<p>You'll notice that there's a lot of debt missing there, though. That's what the Feds owe to <em>American Citizens</em>, and the lower levels of Government (State, County, and Municipal Governments). Most of it is held in Mutual Funds, Pension Funds, and so on. So... yeah. Considering how the Social Security Fund handles its Investment Mandate by buying Treasury Bonds, it's fair to assume that the Average American's Retirement Fund is mostly made out of US Federal Debt.</p>
<p><strong>The Countries that own our Debt might surprise you.</strong></p>
<p>There are certain segments of the Media that like to talk about China &quot;coming over to collect.&quot; However, the biggest Foreign Holder of American Debt is not China, it's Japan... which doesn't have the capacity to launch an invasion across the Pacific (running a supply-line across an ocean isn't easy).</p>
<p>The most current list of Debt Holders that I could find is the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Japan</li>
<li>China</li>
<li>The United Kingdom</li>
<li><em>Ireland</em></li>
<li>The Cayman Isles</li>
</ol>
<p>Japan and The United Kingdom are both major players in International Banking. China has the second-largest Exporting Economy in the world, behind the United States by a fairly large margin thanks to the Trade Sanctions other countries have leveled against them due to their labor practices.</p>
<p>The holdings in Ireland and The Cayman Isles are probably Tax Shelters. Those countries get used for Tax Dodging <em>a lot</em>.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah... didn't mention that, did I?</p>
<p>The amount we owe to these &quot;Foreign Nations&quot; aren't just owed to their governments. We combine Debt held by their Governments with Debt held by their Citizens. As we've already established: US Treasury Bonds are a ludicrously safe investment, so they get <em>bought</em> and <em>resold</em> on the International Market. I could literally buy one from London, if I wanted to, and own it as an American Citizen.</p>
<p>Most Debt owed to Japan and the UK is actually owed to Banks and Businesses there. The Debt owed to China is split between their Government and their Corporations... which is a blurry line due to their weird Capitalism-Communism Hybrid system.</p>
<p><strong>Tl;Dr:</strong> We aren't anywhere close to defaulting on our Debt, and most of it is owed to ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: Removing a few things that were vaguely political. Also, something that was factually inaccurate but irrelevant to the point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>US government bonds are seen as a safe investment aren't they?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, they are.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is this the case?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the US is a $17,000,000,000,000 economy with strong stable government and hasn't defaulted on its sovereign debt in its entire history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It seems like this will never be paid...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are paid off everyday.  The US has been continually paying off and issuing new debt for decades (if not longer).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because even though the aggregated debt is enormous, the U.S. still has a strong likelihood of paying back the loans. For now at least.</p>
<p>You will find that although U.S. public debt is 80% of its GDP (in the most recent year sampled, using the leftmost metric on the Wikipedia chart), this is only 25th-highest among the countries that provided numbers. Here are some notable countries that have higher percentages:
• Japan (174%)
• Greece (158%)
• Zimbabwe (129%)
• Portugal (116%)
• Italy (115%)
• Ireland (110%)
• Singapore (110%)
• Belgium (91%)
• UK (90%)
• France (87%)
In theory (ignoring the governmental &amp; legal idiosyncrasies between these countries), the economies of these countries are less likely to support debt reductions than the United States economy.</p>
<p>(Note that the World Average for this metric is 64%. There are also a few countries with negative-debt, such as Norway and Saudi Arabia.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
