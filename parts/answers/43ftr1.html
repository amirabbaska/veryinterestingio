		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mao Zedong was not entirely the accomplished intellectual. Yes he studied in a school in Changsha and married the daughter of the principal. He may have read the few Marxist treatises translated into Chinese. </p>
<p>He mastered the traditional Confucian essay, but his style was very basic and his Hunanese accent was execrable. The intellectual ferment however was in Beijing and he went there and tried to get into Beijing University. But he failed and took a job on campus as a cloakroom attendant. He tried to talk to some of the great Marxist intellectuals but they rebuffed him and mocked his rough peasant manner. They refused to allow him to attend their lectures. </p>
<p>Mao never forgave them. At the Whampoa Military School in Guangzhou in the early twenties, Mao taught a course in peasant activism. Chiang Kaishek and Zhou Enlai were the senior academics. Mao had never studied in France or Moscow like Zhou and other leaders, who had the support of Lenin and Stalin. Both of whom looked down on Mao as an illiterate peasant revolutionary. </p>
<p>It wasn't until the defeat of the CCP in Shanghai and Jiangxi that Mao's bullish insistence that only a peasant army, which avoided the cities could prevail in China. Once in Yenan, where the Red Army was joined by many intellectuals, Mao carried out a thorough rectification of intellectuals (Yenan Forum 1942) which set their limits and brought them under control. </p>
<p>Again after the Founding of the People's Republc, Mao had a big battle with the overseas educated intellectuals, who backed by Stalin, urged that China build itself up after a decade of war, using so-called New Economic Policy of encouraging a class of &quot;patriotic capitalists&quot; to build up new business and expand throughout China. Mao insisted that only by following Stalin's method of complete collectivization of agriculture and nationalization of industry would China prosper, indeed become greater than the Soviet Union. </p>
<p>Hence Mao's reaction to the Hundred Flowers was visceral and the Cultural Revolution began as a literary criticism campaign against selected writers who had written critically of certain leaders, implicitly Mao. During this campaign all intellectuals were denounced as the &quot;stinking ninth category&quot; 臭老九 of anti-party, anti-revolutionary elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Cultural Revolution (I assume that is what you're referring to) was largely Mao's attempt to continue fighting &quot;reactionaries&quot; after that war was long over.</p>
<p>It wasn't crazy to think that cultural ideas propagate certain values about the world. Confucianism, reverence for authority/elders, are not value-neutral. Mao saw this as a threat.</p>
<p>The problem obviously was that the war had already been won. The Chinese Civil War ended in 1949 with the Nationalists fleeing to Formosa/Taiwan. The Nationalists hadn't left behind a compelling vision for the future, and they were comprehensively beaten militarily. The people who were left in China as &quot;enemies&quot; were... people who held little power anymore. People who were born to the wrong families. People with the wrong ideas.</p>
<p>So Mao had made his name fighting a very protracted civil war (1927-1949!) and he found himself suddenly the most powerful individual in the Chinese Communist Party. As best I can tell he never stopped feeling besieged by enemies--he devolved into paranoia which became increasingly horrifying as his personal power increased. There were no real enemies left to fight, but Mao saw shadows everywhere.</p>
<p>Mao still had massive personal popularity, however, and he inspired many of the younger generation. He called upon them to rise up. They became his Red Guards, vanguards in a battle against the last of the old guard--teachers, Kung fu instructors, people from once-wealthy families. Mao had led China to a new Communist future and he was terrified of losing it.</p>
<p>tl,dr; Mao was never able to understand the war was won, was very popular personally, and gave younger people who had missed the glorious revolution a chance to get involved, which many of them enthusiastically took</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While a lot of people are talking about the &quot;Culture Revolution,&quot; where Mao got the young people into anti-traditionalist mindset, the vast majority of the people who died came from his second five year plan.</p>
<p>Five year plans had been the Stalinist method of industrializing the economy. The first Chinese Five Year Plan was fairly successful, as far as central planned communist economic polices were concerned. Mao decided to followup the success with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Leap_Forward" target="_blank">Great Leap Forward</a>.</p>
<p>It was horrific disaster. Mao wanted to surpass the UK and the US in industrial and agricultural output. For industry, tens of millions of people were brought from the country side into cities to work in state owned factories. Material shortages were a constant struggle, and these people required a large amount of food to eat. </p>
<p>To solve some of the material shortages, Mao decided to pull farmers away from their fields to build up steel furnaces in their backyards. These poorly constructed mud furnaces had a tendency to just <em>explode</em>, and the farmers who were not killed by their own furnaces only produced essentially unusable steel.</p>
<p>Diverting labor away from agriculture and towards industry, combined with harmful irrigation projects, agriculture experimentation, and continued exportation of grain even in the face of shortages led to <em>massive</em> famine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Cultural Revolution was primarily about Mao's quest for ideological purity in the Communist Party. Anyone opposed to Communism or Maoist thought became a bourgeois element working against the interests of the people, and therefore they had to be eliminated. Mao blamed teachers and professors as &quot;revisionists&quot; corrupting the minds of students against proletariat interests. </p>
<p>There was also the fact that Mao wanted the total destruction of traditional Chinese culture because to him traditions and religions maintained social barriers, and traditional Chinese culture frowns on the youth criticizing their parents and elders. So he encouraged students to murder their teachers as a subversion of that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
