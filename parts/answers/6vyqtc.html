		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people puff out a smoke ring, the particles retain the original shape because they are traveling in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_ring" target="_blank">vortex ring</a>. The vortex ring forms as the air is blown/pushed out of the smokers mouth with a high speed relative to the surrounding air. The fast moving air around the edge gets slowed down and then is pulled along again in the wake of the faster moving air creating a ring to travel. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MsPuX5V6swo" target="_blank">This video shows a smoke ring</a>.</p>
<p>When the smoke is just leaving a lit cigarette it is mostly acting as a passive tracer(moves with the fluid) and just shows how the air is flowing given the local turbulence. Air deforms continuously so you won't see any instant breaks. You can increase the rate at which is disperses by adding more turbulence (ie turning a fan on nearby, waving your hand around)</p>
<p>Edit: I've had a lot of replies to this, but the comments aren't showing up in the thread. If you want to PM me I'll answer your question and I'll put it in an edit because someone else might have the same question.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> When you have a lit cigarette in a room with minimal air current, the smoke seems to stick to surfaces (much like water, but in a smokey way). is that related to the air currents too or is it a different physical phenomena?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong>When you have a constant current over a surface, near the surface a boundary layer develops. It develops because the fluid along the surface &quot;sticks&quot; to the wall and has what we call a no-slip boundary condition. So the region near the wall has greatly reduced flow compared to the flow far from the wall. The thickness of the layer depends on the speed of the flow (the higher the speed, the thinner the boundary layer). In the boundary layer the turbulence is also lessened.</p>
<p>Its reasonable for me to think that in a room with low air current the smoke sticks near surfaces because the air is fairly stagnant in the boundary layer. So there is reduced turbulent mixing and no flow to carry the smoke particles away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Has been a while since I took fluid mechanics but I will try to answer it best I can and hopefully someone corrects my mistakes.</p>
<p>All fluid motion (air is considered a fluid) is modeled by navier stokes equations, here is a link to those equations:
<a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/airplane/nseqs.html" target="_blank">https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/K-12/airplane/nseqs.html</a>
To my understanding, fluid motion has momentum and this is conserved in laminar flow(smooth) This will cause a regular dissipation because the cigarate smoke will have a different density then air. It will hold its shape and slowly widen in 3 dimensions based on area and pressure and time. this is not instantaneous because dissipation takes times which is also represented in the equations as a time derivative. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because of the Reynolds number of the fluid (air) as it is heated up (near the tip of the cigarette). At this point the Reynolds number is low so the flow of the smoke is laminar (straight line up from the tip/cherry of the cigarette).  As the air rises and moves away from the heat source, the Reynolds number increases and the flow turns from laminar to turbulent.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia; &quot;Smoke rising from a cigarette is mostly turbulent flow. However, for the first few centimeters the flow is laminar. The smoke plume becomes turbulent as its Reynolds number increases, due to its flow velocity and characteristic length increasing.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mechanical engineering PhD student here with a focus in thermo-fluids. What you're seeing is basically the transition from smooth flow (laminar) to turbulent flow. When flow is transitioning, swirling shapes (von Karman vortices/large eddies) will begin to form and will shed/oscillate back and forth.</p>
<p>Basically the length scale of the smoke plume eventually gets large enough that the momentum of the particles dominates the viscosity of the fluid and starts behaving in a chaotic manner. Turbulence is characterized by chaotic motion. Reynolds number is the main parameter that governs turbulence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the difference between laminar and turbulent flow. Basically a function of the Reynolds number, which is just the ratio between inertial and viscous forces. Reynolds number = (velocity of fluid * linear length) / viscosity. Smoke coming off of the cigarette in a still room will initially be very hot and the density will be low. This warm smoke will want to rise, and as the velocity of the fluid increases, the Reynolds number increases, which means that the inertia in the smoke column becomes more dominant over the surrounding air viscosity. At this point the flow transitions from slow and steady laminar to more turbulent, where inertial forces dominate since there is an increase in energy in the system. When a system has more energy, it's entropy increases, and you get more mixing, vortices, and dissipation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
