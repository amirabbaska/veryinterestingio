		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heart ‘drop’ typically happens when you experience a stressful event, like forgetting something important or receiving bad news. This activates a part of the nervous system responsible for the fight or flight response. This causes the blood vessels to become wider, leading to a drop in blood pressure. The heart needs to compensate and pump harder in order to bring the blood pressure back up which gives the feeling of the ‘drop’. </p>
<p>One will tend to notice a chill that comes along with it, as a consequence of this widening of blood vessels (vasodilation) is a short increase in the rate of heat loss. </p>
<p>Edit: source, med student</p>
<p>Edit2: med student who needs to review some stuff. It doesn't cause a drop in blood pressure, but there is still a stronger heart beat in response to the fight or flight response. Sorry for misleading anyone or causing any confusion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When something startles you, your body gets itself ready for a physically demanding task. To do that, in addition to a bunch of other stuff, it makes your blood vessels bigger. The increased space means that the pressure drops. That &quot;drop&quot; feeling is your heart getting startled by the sudden drop in pressure and making one big squeeze to compensate for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 'heart drop' feeling you experience is the sensation your body experiences when it begins to pump adrenaline into your system.  </p>
<p>A stressful or surprising event will trigger your body to respond by pumping adrenaline into your system, and that 'heart drop' you feel is the adrenaline system being kicked in, it's almost instant like a light switch.</p>
<p>Adrenaline is the bodies way of increasing your response and reaction time to whatever situation has triggered your body to produce it.  Adrenaline will literally feel like it's slowing down time because it increases your reaction time so much.  (The more actions you can take while on adrenaline feels like time has multiplied.)  When people are in accidents or fights and they talk about how time came to a stand still?  Yeah, that's adrenaline.  Great stuff!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
