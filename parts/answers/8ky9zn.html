		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soap has chemicals in it that act as surfactants, which are substances that reduce surface tension of a liquid. </p>
<p>In other words, lower surface tension means that the molecules in the liquid don’t attract each other as strongly. Since they don’t attract very strongly, bubbles become more stable. This is because the surface of a bubble is always in tension, like a rubber band that’s stretched out. Surfactants reduce surface tension, which, in our rubber band analogy, is like stretching a much weaker rubber band. This means the bubbles will be less likely to burst open. </p>
<p>As a point of interest, surfactants are also used in things like cooking sprays. This is because oil that’s made to have a low surface tension will spread more easily across your pan instead of bead up like oil normally tends to. </p>
<p>Edit: I didn’t answer the agitation part of your question. The agitation is mostly just to introduce air into the liquid so bubbles can form. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soap has 3 properties that make it work: 1) it hates water that’s why it’s so agitated, that’s not a joke (hydrophobic)
2) it loves sticking to everything else (surfactant)
3) it’s usually denser than water once it sticks to something so all the food falls to the bottom of your sink instead of creating a stew </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
