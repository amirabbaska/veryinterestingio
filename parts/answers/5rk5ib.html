		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So Christian music is developed around the ease of singing along- the real money is in licensing songs to be sung by churches during worship, so they have to have some key traits: </p>
<p>A range that can be sung by most people, which means mid-range male voice. Women can harmonize up, but it's harder to fit a vocal range under the singer instead of above. </p>
<p>The tempo and cadence of the singing, likewise, must be accessible for the average singer. </p>
<p>After that; it's a question of style (rock also tends to use common, easy keys and simple drum rhythms).</p>
<p>So the answer is U2 discovered how to get people to sing along to music really effectively and the formula is being used elsewhere that your ear recognizes as U2. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most Christian rock sounds nothing like U2 but if we are talking about Worship music then that sounds about right. </p>
<p>Reason 1: Big sound. The big delays and reverbs make it sound huge without having the whole Gospel Choir. U2 pioneered this sound for the mainstream. When you are doing the whole hands in the air thing having a huge sound really puts you in the emotional state for it all.</p>
<p>Reason 2. Worship music seems to follow mainstream by quite a number of years. Hillsong Young and Free for example is far from the U2 approach and has much more of an electronic sound. </p>
<p>Reason 3. Vocal lines all need to be easy enough to join in with after at most one listen. This isn't unique to U2 but it is a feature of popular music. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Edge's sound is heavily modified with delay and reverb pedals. His extreme use of them set U2 apart from other bands. U2 has a very mainstream  clean sound in order to make them relevant and approachable.
Churches have very large rooms surrounded in stone. This caused a lot of natural reverb, so composers who wrote songs with long sustained notes had success with church music because it did not create unwanted dissonance, but instead the reverberations resonated with the notes currently being played. eventually this became the aesthetic associated with churches.
Heavily distorted guitar sounds angry, while cleaner guitar sounds much more calm. Christian Rock combined the reverb aesthetic with popular music, preferring influences that use clean tones for a calm but positive energy.
TLDR U2 was more interested in heavily altering the guitar through effects pedals but provided a similar energy to past successes  in order to appeal to a wide audience. Christian Rock artists used a similar aesthetic because it is similar to both traditional church music and popular music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if contemporary Christian rock is a different genre of music than Christian rock or just Christian rock released more recently. In any case, avenged sevenfold is a Christian rock band that sounds nothing like u2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>U2's breakthrough album The Joshua Tree was hugely popular, and contained religious undertones. Just like in other genres, once a popular song or album is released, everyone flocked to the styles in it. It's like when bro country started becoming popular, all of a sudden these artists like Luke Bryan and FGL appeared out of nowhere. Everyone in pop music is trying to ride the gravy train - take styles from something original and reuse them to get popularity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
