		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't really compare the two.</p>
<p>In one circumstance, the brain coordinates the bodily effort required to manipulate a known object in familiar conditionsâ€”a task for which it <del>was purposely</del> evolved. In the other, you're abstracting an event into physical concepts, using the &quot;foreign language&quot; of mathematics. And even though it can be conceived perfectly in the mind in a moment, it still takes time to write it on paper.</p>
<p>What's more, no person alive could produce these results on command without years of training and practice. The mechanics of throwing a football had to be learned, just as the underlying physics had to be learned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is very powerful and good at doing that kind of parallel rough estimation - in a single instant it keeps your balance, comprehends what you'e searing &amp; hearing, makes a decision about the best way to throw the ball, etc.  Your brain is much slower at doing precise serial computations, where it has to do each step precisely before it can move on to the next step (math calculations). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no reason to believe that our brains are calculating the trajectory from a formula as we do on paper. It's much more likely that the brain is just extrapolating from its memories of other times you have thrown an object or seen an object be thrown.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read a very interesting article recently about how we know where to stand to <em>catch</em> a cricket ball or baseball. This isn't the same article, but it covers the same ground:
<a href="http://www.livescience.com/3445-baseball-players-catch-fly-balls.html" target="_blank">http://www.livescience.com/3445-baseball-players-catch-fly-balls.html</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Physicist Seville Chapman proposed a model to explain how players manage the path of a fly ball so that  they arrive to intercept it at just the right time. His theory, called Optical Acceleration Cancellation (OAC), used the acceleration of the ball through the vision field as a guide for player movement.</p>
<p>As a fielder watches the ball rise, he moves either forward or backwards so that the ball moves at a constant speed through his field of vision. If he moves too far forward, the ball will rise faster and may eventually fly over his head. If he takes too many steps back, the ball will appear to rise slower and will drop in front of him. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly what you were asking about, but it does show what kind of mechanisms are at work, which we are quite unaware of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, your brain is not necessarily crunching numbers while you're throwing. Just adjusting muscle recruitment and motor function as necessary.
The actual on-paper physics are indeed complicated. Your body just makes it seem like it should be a no-brainer!</p>
<p>EDIT: That is to say, your brain is not inherently aware of the math behind the motion. We invented the math to articulate what forces are at play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
