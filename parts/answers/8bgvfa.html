		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer - there are more total species in hotter environments than cold ones.</p>
<p>There are a variety of mechanisms that lead to evolution of venom in almost all groups of animals.  However, the end goal of venom production is generally as a means for capturing prey, defending against predation, or competition with other members of the same species. It's a general trend in ecology that there are more species in the tropics than there are in temperate or polar regions, however, the reason for this trend has been debated for centuries.  Some possible explanations for this trend are: 1) tropical ecosystems are more stable and allow for new species to flourish in stable, specific niches, 2) tropical regions are more productive, allowing for more energy in the system, 3) warmer temperatures speed up all processes of life, including evolution.  While it's true that there are more species in the tropics, and thus more total venomous species, it is not true that the proportion of venomous animals in the tropics is higher.  While there are always exceptions to any rule in biology, in general, the proportion of venomous species in the tropics is not higher than in colder climates.  We humans just tend to fixate on venomous species (probably for a good reason).  So if you're learning about the fauna of Australia, for instance, then you'll learn about the venomous species at a higher rate than the non-venomous ones. It's warmer there than in Siberia, so you hear about more venomous species in Australia than Siberia, but that would be true for any group of animals as diversity is higher in the tropics.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cold places have less life density. The cold is the toughest enemy. Also, there are far fewer resources to spend on things like defenses and venom. Jungles are a nightmare of creatures and diseases because they're where life grows fast and furious. In the cold it's amazing if a creature can survive at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Venom production is metabolically costly, and is typically found within ectotherms. Ectotherms are often found in temperate or hot environments in order to remain metabolically active, where as endotherms are able to live in colder regions of the world. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is also worth considering that we humans tend to only view an animal as venomous if their venom affects us. Garter Snakes and Western Hognose Snakes, for example, have neurotoxic venom. Their venom isn't potent enough to do much to people and even if it was, their rear-fanged delivery system would require them to have started eating one of our fingers or toes in order to have an effect. These two species could be considered northern depending on how you divide ranges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are alot of good answers in this thread and there are alot of answers to this question. I'd say think about what types of animals are venomous, it's  mainly small animals that have to take down larger prey and venom  is fast acting and doesn't require much for physical energy (tho it does take metabolic energy like others have said). Venom is great for small animals because it doesn't require strength, size, or alot of energy. Animals in cold regions have to be large to deal with that cold and with size comes strength as well as being able to store more energy and so they can fight using brute force as their mechanism rather than having to be sneaky. Thank you for asking this question btw, I love this stuff and liked reading others answers :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
