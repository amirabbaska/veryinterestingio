Thus have asia been very populous in history, being able to feed people and all. </p>
<p>With the industrial age came massive population increase which affect already large populations too, thus you get modern asia's mega cities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great answers here. Maybe I can add another point: historical development. If you take Germany for example and put it into contrast to the UK, France or Russia. While France, UK and Russia have been empires for hundreds of years with a centralised political system, Germany had scattered regionalism with hundreds of sovereign states. This is the reason why Germany has no AAA city such as UK with London, France with Paris or Russia with Moscow. </p>
<p>A very similar approach can be applied to Asian countries. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This same situation happens in Latin America, with São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Ciudad de México and Rio being larger than any European city. The reason is very well known : developed economies tend to create jobs and education oportunities across the whole country, while 3rd world countries having less resources are still concentrating the best infrastructure (electricity, good roads, plenty of clean water, hi-speed  Internet, etc) and good educational institutions in their larger cities. Entrepreneurs also seek these advantages to their businesses, so a lot of country people migrates to big cities because there are far more jobs there. It's an old and very studied phenomenum, called &quot;êxodo rural&quot; (rural exodus) em Portuguese, for example. These countries struggle to fight it, since it's not good for a nation. </p>
<p>TL;DR because Europe is more developed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all depends how you count.  While the political boundaries of London and Paris are around 8 million, the metropolitan areas are around 13 million.</p>
<p>Apart from that, affluence plays a role.  People in more developed can afford a better quality of life, which means more space and better services.  They have the resources to spread out and travel to where the work that people in less developed countries do not.</p>
<p>Historically, it has been about food.  Rice produces more calories per acre than most pre-industrial crops, but also requires more manpower.  This both allows and requires more people to live closely together, and has lead to cultures with greater tolerance of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
