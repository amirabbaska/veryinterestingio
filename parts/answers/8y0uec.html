<blockquote>
<p>...caves can be petri dishes for bacteria and viruses.  &quot;The big worry that you get with caves is the presence of bats,&quot; said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore. &quot;We know that bats can transmit many different infectious diseases, including things like rabies.&quot;....&quot;Certain fungi can really thrive in bat droppings,&quot; Adalja said, and inhaling these fungal spores can lead to lung infections, including cryptococcosis or histoplasmosis, which is also known as &quot;caver's disease.&quot; </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bacteria and physical health reasons have been stated but there are psychological benefits as well.</p>
<p>Long term isolation may not help (or may even hurt) the victims, but a monitored quarantine with limited family interactions would actually be beneficial immediately after such trauma </p>
<p>These kids now have social identity. They will be known as the Cave Boys, media will want to get interviews and quotes and stories.<br />
Placing them in quarantine gives them a chance to settle back into the world and not be bombarded with attention and reminders of their trauma, giving them better chance to heal mentally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physical conditions and all, but I'd like to expand on an aspect that a Thai would definitely be able to answer: Media.</p>
<p>Our local media is extremely unprofessional and ravenous. When there is a disaster, they expect drama and death. In this case, they even asked the families about how the cave is haunted, what would you do if the kids were found dead, and so on.</p>
<p>These pieces of s*** will do anything just to get an exclusive, and the sponsors don't care. Most viewers who eventually contribute to the Nielsen rating and therefore sponsorship don't care. I hate to say something like this, but many Thais just can't grow enough social awareness and ethics in their heads to get over wanting a down-to-the-skin-pore level of news exclusive.</p>
<p>They even flown a drone (arrested and drone seized, note that it's a pro level DJI with camera attachment so the pilot might have been fired or heavily punished by the company by now) and would try to zoom with long telephoto (correct term? we just use &quot;tele&quot;) lenses to capture anything from beyond the fenced areas.</p>
<p>One EMS in Thailand posted once that back last or few years ago, after the bombing in Bangkok, the media flooded all over the place and would actually try to grab the stretchers or block the emergency personnel to have a word with an injured. I'm not sure if this was exaggerated, but there's that.</p>
<p>I know this is borderline anecdotal, but I believe that this deserves to be told. Our long history of media messing with everything has led to the privacy umbrellas, immediate seizure of drones, and establishing wide no media zones. I feel sorry to the foreign news who are merely following the rules. I know exclusives and in depth interviews get you a lot of money, but the risk is just unbearable with Thai companies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it may be that the Thai authorities seem quite concerned (and rightly so) about the boys mental condition as well as their physical.</p>
<p>These kids just went through a horrible ordeal and keeping them under observation and away from the inevitable media shit-storm and/or the vultures wanting to make money off them is a good idea. They need to process the thing first by themselves before they are strong enough to deal with the public. </p>
<p>The &quot;medical&quot; quarantine does not have to be for physical pathogens only but also for mental health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mainly its because of bats. There are some pretty nasty diseases where bats have been found to be the deep reservoir of the diseases between outbreaks. This includes SARS and equine encephelitis. Personally, I think a lot of it has been political. They didn't allow the families of the first boys to see their parents until they were all out. One suspects this had to do with avoiding the perception that first group were selected for political influence of their families over the ones that were left behind (initially). The quarantine is part of the same thought process on the other end. By keeping the last boys away from their parents, it allows them to further justify not having let the first ones see their parents either. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
