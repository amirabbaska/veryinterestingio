		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL/DR; Less  education means more children. More religion means more children. Less access to health care means more children. Earlier age of marriage means more children. Poor people have less education, more religion, less access to health care, and an earlier age of marriage.</p>
<p>Also, minorities and immigrants from less developed countries tend to <em>want</em> larger families because of their culture. These groups also tend to be poor.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EDUCATION: Less education = more children</strong></p>
<p>Poor people tend to be less educated - they perform poorly in school, are more likely to be expelled or drop out, and struggle to afford higher education. There are many theories about why education relates to family size:</p>
<p>1) Women with less education are less likely to be able to support themselves independently. Because they rely upon a husband, they tend to think of their contributions to family as more important to contributing to economy. Ergo, more children.</p>
<p>2) Women with more education will have a career, not just a job. They prefer to work rather than parent, and will focus on vocational success. Children and families make financial success more difficult. By focusing on a career, the woman neglects settling down to have children until later in her life.</p>
<p>3) People who are more educated tend to have better impulse control. They are more likely to plan out when they want to have a family based upon their finances. They are less likely to have unprotected sex, or to use drugs and substances that might result in accidental pregnancies (hooking up while drunk, for instance). They are also more aware of the various birth-control options available and will seek them out.</p>
<p>4) Poorly educated people might not know about all the contraception options that exist, how to use them properly, or where they might obtain birth-control pills or spermicides etc. Most individuals learn about contraception in school - so where do drop outs learn about it? They might not have access to Google...</p>
<p><strong>RELIGIOSITY: More religion means larger families</strong></p>
<p>Poor individuals are more likely to be religious that wealthy individuals. Also, less educated individuals are more likely to be dogmatically religious that people with a 4-year degree. This can have several outcomes:</p>
<p>1) Contraceptives are purposefully ignored. Catholics, for instance, view the use of birth control or condoms as a sin. Many denominations view abortions or &quot;the morning after pill&quot; as murder.</p>
<p>2) Some religious denominations actively encourage women to be caring mothers with lots of children. You see this more with fringe groups, like the (small) snake-handling group within Pentecostalism or the (small) polygamist group within Mormonism.</p>
<p>3) Religion encourages an early age of marriage. The younger a woman is when married, the more children she will have over her lifetime. Also, married couples are more likely to have unprotected sex than couples that are cohabiting or having pre-marital sex.</p>
<p><strong>INCOME: Less money means more children</strong></p>
<p>This is pretty obvious when you think about it. Contraception costs money. Condoms, birth control, spermicide, morning-after pill, and abortions are all expensive - particularly if you add up the cost-per-month and look at years at a time. Most birth-control pills require prescriptions, which means doctor visits, which are super expensive if you don't have insurance. Even though condoms can be bought for a dollar a piece, that's expensive if you are living on welfare (and I don't think food-stamps cover contraception).</p>
<p><del>Hysterectomies</del> Tubal ligation and vasectomies are also a rather common contraceptive used by middle and upper class individuals. Usually after they have had a child or two and think their family is big enough - so no surprise children later in life.</p>
<p>Also, people with more money tend to thing in economic terms. Children are expensive, and people with money budget for this; they will wait to have children until they can afford them, and will prefer small families because it is easier to pay for karate for 2 boys than for 5. This thought process isn't seen in poor families.</p>
<p><strong>RACE: Minorities and Immigrants are over-represented among the poor. Immigrants from developing countries are more likely to <em>want</em> larger families.</strong></p>
<p>Developing countries don't have large families <em>only</em> because of lack of birth control, they have large families because it is <em>culturally acceptable and preferable</em> to have large families. If you take a couple from Sub-Saharan Africa, teach them all about condoms and birth control, and put them in America and give them access to contraception they are still more likely to have a large family because <em>they will want to have many children</em>. Culturally speaking, more children means the parents are better people.</p>
<p>This idea carries over into the children of immigrants, as well as the grandchildren. The family size declines with each generation, and by the 4th generation the birth rate looks more like the rates of the host culture.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My input as a middle european:</p>
<p>Point one, as mentioned: Age of &quot;more educated parents&quot;</p>
<p>When you study until your mid twenties, find a job and start a career, it is not uncommon to have your first child after your 30th birthday. </p>
<p>Since you know the cost of education, and you want to provide your children a good education, you will most likely limit yourself to a max of 2 children. (Little example, if both husband and wife have a university degree they will in all likelyhood have a family net income of 4000-5000€/month. Cost for rent, two cars, additional private insurances and so on will amount to about  2000-2500€ monthly and if you have a credit running you have  about 1500€ left for &quot;living&quot;.</p>
<p>Now if you want yoour child to study there will be monthly monetary need per child of about 1000€.</p>
<p>One is ok, two is feasible, 3 will definitely strain your budget in a very inconvenient way.</p>
<p>So an educated family of 2 will, by the age of 35 , have produced 2 offspring.</p>
<p>Now if you take the stereotypical &quot; Hartz4 family&quot; in germany:</p>
<p>Both paternts are unemployed, each of them receiving 700€ per month from the state, their accomodation is paid by the state, in many cases the first child comes at age of 16 for the woman.
They have never worked, their basic needs are met by the state and as long as she continues to pop out children every 2-3 years the state won't bother her about a job.
As soon as the oldest children reach the age of 15 they start to repeat the cycle since they have never seen their parents work, they &quot;know&quot; that the state will take care of them, and as long as they continue that way they won't have a problem.</p>
<p>So by the time that the arents are 35 they will most likely have 3-5 children plus 2-4 grandchildren.</p>
<p>Or as another user posted: Idiocracy.</p>
<p>I once saw a documentation about  a german city of 500.000 inhabitants where nearly 50 % of al inhabitants either  were retired or unemployed ( children below 15 excluded)....</p>
<p>Plus: If you are unemployed you spend waaayyyyyy more time with your partner, and have way more time to make em babies.</p>
<p>I get up every day at 5 Am, return at 6 PM then some sport, some TV and at 10 PM i want to fall into my bad and sleep like a stone.</p>
<p>When you have all day at home you are bound to get bored, and you use your time( experience from 1 month &quot;sitting at home during two jobs&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there are a lot of factors at play. One of which may be that both of those things are expensive. Many people who pursue an education will put off childbearing until after graduation and even so far until they are less in debt and have a steady income. This leaves less time to have children before infertility sets in - especially in women. Contrary to this, having children early can pose an obstacle to pursuing higher education both in cost and the time it takes to get an education. It's very difficult to raise children and maintain full or even part-time status at a university. Being younger when having a first child also leaves the parents more time (speaking strictly regarding fertility) to produce additional children.</p>
<p>Also, I think you underestimate how very poor sex education in first world countries, namely America and Canada, truly is. Young people exit high school with a dismal grasp on human reproduction, healthy sexual relations and what, if any, contraception is right for them as individuals and when with a partner. Also, options aside from the pill are expensive if you don't have medical coverage/insurance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way I saw it in my small hometown, where all my girlfriends were getting pregnant and dropping out during high school or at least they were getting married immediately after high school:   When you're not very bright, you know you won't get praise or recognition for things that smart people do, like going to school or getting a good job.  So you look for things you <em>can</em> do well, things that bring attention and praise.  For girls, you start getting those things right away when you get engaged and/or pregnant.  People start making a fuss over you.  You feel important.  But it wears off about the time the baby is a toddler so you have to get knocked up again to get it again.  For these girls, really, what else is there they can do to feel special?  It's sad.</p>
<p>Then there's also messages from every direction about what a girl/woman can expect to achieve in life.  That's changed a lot since I was young, I think (I hope), but those messages were all about marriage and family, not about education and career achievement.  To escape those messages and get more positive role models and more positive advice, you had to enter the world of higher education.  So, to get more educated, you had to be educated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pure <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost" target="_blank">opportunity cost</a>. Education is time consuming. So is child rearing. Those who have children don't have time to study. Those who wish to complete their education have to forego having children. People will go on in this thread about how having children is stupid and religious people are stupid and poor people are poor because they are stupid... but these value judgments are unnecessary, misleading, and... stupid.</p>
<p>This, by the way, is why people in industrialized countries tend not merely to have fewer children, but to have <em>far</em> fewer children. For those who have even a small amount of disposable income, there are a lot of options as to what to do with your time that people in rural settings simply do not have.  Those options go <em>way</em> down the moment you have a kid, as any teenage mother having to give up teenage shenanigans to care for her child can tell you.</p>
<p>Malthus and those who carry his ideas (whether or not they actually know his name) believed it was the cost in food, water, and shelter that was the primary factor. Such people fear that if people aren't allowed to starve to death today we'll only have more people starving to death tomorrow. But he was wrong. It is the cost in <em>time</em> that has proven to be the primary factor. Food could be <em>free</em>, and that would have only a marginal impact on population growth. What really controls population growth is how much people have to sacrifice in terms of free time. The poor simply don't have anything better to do with their time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
