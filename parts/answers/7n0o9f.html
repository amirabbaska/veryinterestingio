		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Should old acquaintance be forgot,</p>
<p>and never brought to mind?</p>
<p>Should old acquaintance be forgot,</p>
<p>and old lang syne?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Should we forget our old friends? </p>
<p>Should we forget the times we had?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>CHORUS:</p>
<p>For auld lang syne, my dear,</p>
<p>for auld lang syne,</p>
<p>we'll take a cup of kindness yet,</p>
<p>for auld lang syne.</p>
<p>And surely you'll buy your pint cup!</p>
<p>and surely I'll buy mine!</p>
<p>And we'll take a cup o' kindness yet,</p>
<p>for auld lang syne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's toast to the good old times, my dear</p>
<p>To the good old times</p>
<p>We'll drink to the gold old times.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We two have run about the slopes,</p>
<p>and picked the daisies fine;</p>
<p>But we've wandered many a weary foot,</p>
<p>since auld lang syne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We've been together a long time,</p>
<p>We've traveled and lazed about</p>
<p>We've been friends a good old time</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We two have paddled in the stream,</p>
<p>from morning sun till dine;</p>
<p>But seas between us broad have roared</p>
<p>since auld lang syne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although we've been friends a long time,</p>
<p>Sometimes we've been apart,</p>
<p>But that's just fine</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And there's a hand my trusty friend!</p>
<p>And give me a hand o' thine!</p>
<p>And we'll take a right good-will draught,</p>
<p>for auld lang syne.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let's hold hands,</p>
<p>Let's have a drink together,</p>
<p>To all the good times</p>
<p>This is a simplification of the traditional English translation. I hope it helps. If you need, I can do Burn's original Scots as well, but the lyrics are more-or-less the same meaning. <em>We've been apart, my friend, but now that we're together let's have a toast to all the good times.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It makes a bit more sense if you read the words in a Scots accent. Literally, it's &quot;old long since&quot;, or, as others have put it, the good old days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Auld Lang Syne is &quot;Good Old Times&quot; or &quot;Times Long Past&quot; in Scots, a language spoken in lowland Scotland that is a kind of a hybrid of Old and Middle English with remnants of Gaelic. It has morphed over the years to even include some modern English words and spellings. </p>
<p>It is a song talking about old friends, and the memories you have with them. u/Kotama does a good breakdown of the song verse by verse. It is basically about toasting to old memories and continued friendship.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This podcast may help. It really breaks it down and the rest of the series does the same. <a href="http://historyofenglishpodcast.com/2016/04/10/episode-77-rival-relatives-and-the-land-of-scots-2/" target="_blank">http://historyofenglishpodcast.com/2016/04/10/episode-77-rival-relatives-and-the-land-of-scots-2/</a></p>
<p>But tl;dr. Old and middle English are complex AF.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
