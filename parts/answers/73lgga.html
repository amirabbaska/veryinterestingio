		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We didn't &quot;solve it&quot; as much as &quot;address it&quot; one piece of software at a time, by whatever organization owned/operated the affected system. Critical systems were mostly likely prioritized, and I'm sure a lot of systems were just left broken, to be dealt with as needed.  (That's what my company did.)</p>
<p>The Big Scary Y2K stuff that people were worried about had at least some potential to happen, but, thankfully, nothing dramatic happened.  </p>
<p>To some degree, being scared about it led people to deal with it, which can look like The Boy Who Cried Wolf.  It is kind of the definition of a thankless job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked on Y2K.  Hell, anyone in IT at the time worked on Y2K.</p>
<p>In reality, it was a lot of work to find and fix any programs that used a date in a 6 digit format (MMDDYY) and change it to an 8 digit format (MMDDYYYY).</p>
<p>One issue was that software is not always well documented and lots of code doesn't get touched after it's initially written.  That made it hard to find all the dates in millions and millions of lines of code.</p>
<p>Another issue was that there were many companies using legacy software, i.e. software that had been purchased/created 20 years previous and no one had looked at it or touched it in a long time.  Most of the time, companies just replaced that software with something newer and supported, but there were companies who would not replace the software because it was so customized to their exact needs.  Those companies hired programmers to review every line of code and find any dates.</p>
<p>Y2K also resulted in better programming discipline.  Instead of embedding constants (dates) into code, more and more shops insisted on using variables declared at the top of the program and then assigning values to those variables as the first step of the program, which made the code easy to maintain.</p>
<p>In my case, I worked for a subsidiary of GE Capital.  My boss made the entire IT department work on New Year's Eve in case we'd missed anything in our software.  We didn't.  He was a dick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We solved it by giving us more room to write the date and the solution was not complete.</p>
<p>There are many different ways to write down the date. In the early day of computing space to write things down was expensive so lazy programmers and those who didn't expect their creations to still be around in 2000 simply just wrote down the last 2 digits of the year.</p>
<p>Humans have used this space saving format informally for quite some time. Like you sometimes say that something happened in '74 or in the '80s and it is assumed that it is clear from context that you meant <strong>19</strong>74 and the <strong>19</strong>80s.</p>
<p>With humans one could expect, that when they got a date like '00 that they would understand from context that this now meant 2000 rather 1900.</p>
<p>Computer weren't smart enough to make that guess. They were programmed to assume that the first two digits were always 19 and they went with that.</p>
<p>At some point people realized that the programs written in decades past were still around and that computers that used this method would still be around by the years 2000 and that this might cause them to act as if they were a hundred years in the past and cause all sorts of bugs.</p>
<p>The media liked to paint pictures of airplanes falling out of the sky but professionals were concerned with much more mundane issues.</p>
<p>A world wide effort to find and fix the problem in systems that had it was undertaken.</p>
<p>For the most part this was a huge success. The general public which had been promised Armageddon by the media was quite miffed that the problem had been fixed without causing he fall of human civilization and declared that the warnings must have been wrong rather than that engineers had worked hard to see that it didn't come to pass.</p>
<p>So the Y2K problem was mostly averted. Here and there some systems that had been overlooked created some funny error messages but nothing big happened.</p>
<p>However keeping accurate date/time records in computers is a very, very complicated issues (mostly because the way we tell time as humans is much, much less regular than the average person thinks) and there are a number of problems similar to the Y2K problem that  will become an issue at some point. </p>
<p>UNIX based system tell time by counting how many seconds have passed since the beginning of January 1st 1970 UTC (called the unix epoch) and then they take this number of seconds and use a complicated system involving looking up timezone and adding anything from leap days to the occasional leap second to figure out what time and date that is in the local time.</p>
<p>Currently we are at 1506870661 seconds since the Unix Epoch. The space the computers store that number of seconds in has room for up to 2147483647 seconds, this corresponds to a date in mid January 2038.</p>
<p>When that time is reached computers will try to add another second to that number, not have enough room and end up creating a date with -2147483648 which is as far in the past of 1970 as 1938 is in its future.</p>
<p>This will obviously result in problems for anyone trying to make use of these dates. Already some computersystems that work with stuff more than 20 years in the future, may encounter the problem.</p>
<p>Everyone hopes that all the old system that still use this way of telling time will no longer be in use 20 years from now or will have been upgraded with patches.</p>
<p><em>fun fact</em>: Don't try to set you phone a electronic toy to any date before 1970 or after 2037 to avoid risking breaking it. Nobody expect these things to last that long so they are not currently able to handle such dates.</p>
<p>There are a number of similar problem from many different systems that handle dates and almost all of them will at some point run out of space to write down the date.</p>
<p>Almost nobody who was involved in fixing the y2k mess by switching from 2-disgts for the year to 4-digits for the year, seemed to care about what would happened on December 31st 9999 when we would end up needing 5 digits for the year if we make it that long and keep using their fix until then. We are mostly just pushing down the problem for future generations of humanity to fix if they manage to survive that long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
