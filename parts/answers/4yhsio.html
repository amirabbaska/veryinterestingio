<ul>
<li>Studies have shown that people are better at thinking of creative solutions while pacing about.     </li>
<li>Studies have shown that performing repetitive actions (like moving up and down in the same way) often has a destressing effect.     </li>
</ul>
<p>Another study talks about how pacing about may be a somewhat involuntary response to stress and anxiety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has been answered before in /r/explainlikeiamfive but the gist of it is that humans have been around for over 100 000 years and has evolved to communicate with each other through both audio AND visual means (ie, look at each other while talking) and to reply itself by physical feedback (ie, the person you are looking at is looking angry, you tense up. Looks shocked, and you try to look reassuring etc)</p>
<p>Now that we remove the visual feedback that you get from looking at the person you are talking to, your body/brain does not know how to respond with physical feedback, so instead of just doing nothing, you pace around to do something with your lack of possibility of physical feedback.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best response I've heard is that it's distracting, but in a good way. Like scribbling, it keeps the impatient, wandering mind occupied while your focus is kept on the phone call. I think of it like being on a train, or a passenger in a car, where the passing scenery is just distracting enough that I can think really clearly and not get antsy or lose focus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing that comes to my mind is that we are missing a key component to communicating when we are communicating on the phone. We are missing the component of visual cues. Sometimes when we are not receiving a conduit of stimulation, or feeback, that we are accustomed to getting ; we will start mimicing the action we need. It is like seeing a bothersome piece of lint on a persons shoulder , but they are a stranger so you start picking at your own clothes to make sure they are clean. When on the phone, it is impossible to 'feel' the cadence of a conversation without seeing the other persons face and visual cues. Therefore we are start adding more communication cues from our side of the conversation hoping to 'fill the empty space' with more information. I have been paying attention to myself do this for years. I have been speaking with a lot of technical recruiters lately while on the job hunt, and i asked myself why i go outside and start walking around when giving my sales pitch for a new job.</p>
<p>TLDR; I think we are missing important visual communication cues when speaking on the phone. We reflexively overcompensate for this deficit by moving around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
