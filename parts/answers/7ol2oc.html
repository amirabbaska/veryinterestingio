<p><strong>Physiological/Morphological Adaptations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Feathers</strong></p>
<p>Birds’ feathers provide excellent insulation against the cold, and many species grow extra feathers in the late fall to give them more protection during the winter months. There is also an oil that coats birds’ feathers which provides insulation as well as waterproofing. This is exuded from their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uropygial_gland" target="_blank">uropygial gland</a> located near their tail. Birds also have a layer of soft, insulating feathers called <a href="http://www.earthlife.net/birds/images/anatomy/f-pic-down.jpg" target="_blank">&quot;down&quot;</a> (you can see it's soft, and fluffy) which traps their body heat, minimizing heat loss.</p>
<p><strong>Feet and legs</strong></p>
<p>Birds’ legs and feet are covered with <a href="http://www.hiltonpond.org/images/HawkRedShoulderedFoot01.jpg" target="_blank">tight, overlapping scales</a> that reduce heat loss. They can also constricting blood flow, which reduces heat loss, by controlling the temperature of their legs and feet separately from their bodies. Aside from this you may have noticed that water fowl, such as ducks and geese, can tolerate cold water. This is a great adaptation called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countercurrent_exchange#Countercurrent_exchange_of_heat_in_organisms" target="_blank">&quot;counter current heat exchange.&quot;</a> How this works is the warm arterial blood flowing away from the heart warms up the cooler venous blood heading towards the heart. This exchange keeps their feet from freezing while standing exposed or floating in water. <a href="https://bybio.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/countercurrent-exchange-figure.jpg?w=584" target="_blank">Here is a diagram to help you visualize this process.</a></p>
<p><strong>Metabolism</strong></p>
<p>Birds are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endotherm" target="_blank">endotherms</a> or warm-blooded (we don't really say warm-blooded anymore, but I know folks are familiar with the term). This means they create their own heat from their metabolic processes. Birds also have a much higher resting metabolic rates than humans do. The average bird’s body temperature is 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40 degrees Celsius). <a href="http://people.eku.edu/ritchisong/birdmetabolism.html" target="_blank">This page has a lot of great information on bird metabolism.</a></p>
<p><strong>Reserves of body fat</strong></p>
<p>Birds, along with other animals, can build up a fat reserve during the Fall to prepare for harsh winter months. They gorge on food for the entirety of the Fall, which gives them a protective fatty layer. <a href="https://www.birdsoutsidemywindow.org/2010/12/17/fat-reserves/" target="_blank">More great info and photos here</a>. In humans, we turn <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14715917" target="_blank">brown adipose tissue</a> into heat, but this specific tissue type <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2375860/" target="_blank">is not found in birds</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Behavioral adaptations</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.dorsetlife.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/1211edLEADOFF2ROBIN.jpg" target="_blank"><strong>Fluffing</strong></a> - birds fluff out their feathers in cold weather. This action creates air pockets that add additional insulation. This is where that layer of fluffy down comes into play!</p>
<p><strong>Roosting</strong> - certain species of birds will flock together in winter to keep warm for the evening. We see this in the <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/crows/images/roost.jpg" target="_blank">America crow</a> (<em>Corvus brachyrhyncos</em>) around sundown in the cooler months. Near me at 4pm beginning in the Fall you can watch them gather together in large groups. During the Winter months I also notice Dark-eyed Juncos, Black-capped Chickadees and Northern Cardinals flocking with conspecifics but also with other species.</p>
<p><strong>Sunning</strong> - allowing the Sun to do the hard work, birds can keep warm (like other animals) by ensuring they are spending time in the sun.</p>
<p><strong>Shivering</strong> - shivering keeps birds warm just as it does with humans and other animals.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torpor" target="_blank"><strong>Torpor</strong></a> - During torpor a bird reduces their metabolism when their body temperature is low. Their bodies then require fewer calories to maintain a comfortable body temperature. Interestingly, due to their high metabolism, Hummingbirds enter torpor every evening so as not to use all of their energy reserves overnight.</p>
<p><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-68_aL5l-7Wg/UyW7ZCizE9I/AAAAAAAAlI4/tkpNZYbwQkI/s1600/lbcu01.jpg" target="_blank"><strong>Tucking</strong></a> - you'll often see birds tucking a beak or one leg up into their feathers to minimize heat loss. You'll probably notice ducks and gulls doing this all the time! They do it in the summer as well as it's a comfortable resting position for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of animals store up extra fat cells, particularly what's called brown fat. Most mammals grow their extra coats of fur if they stick around. However, Snow is actually a really good insulator. At a specific depth, which I can't remember at the moment, the temps stick to around 32F or 0C. Pretty cozy. This is why Mountaineers all learn how to build an emergency snow cave. Other animals migrate out for the winter!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplest approach from an evolution perspective : </p>
<p>The fur / weather protection / tactics on the animal will generally be built for trying to cope with the biggest swings in temperature.</p>
<p>So they might be 'uncomfortably warm' half the year, but that doesn't kill them.  Then a extreme cold snap comes by and they're like 'oh, this is stupid cold' instead of 'ok, I dead'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
