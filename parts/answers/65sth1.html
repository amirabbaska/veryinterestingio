		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone else already answered correctly that the point of zero velocity at the peak of the bullet's travel is only instantaneous, but another interesting way to look at this scenario is that the last 10ft of the bullet's travel before reaching the peak would look about the same as if you threw the bullet ten feet in the air (ignoring changes in the air conditions at the higher altitude, and assuming that you were able to throw the bullet so that it was oriented and spinning similar to the way it is fired from a gun).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things don't just stop in mid air. Not for any amount of time anyway. It would be no different to asking &quot;If you throw a ball up in the air, how long does it hang motionless for?&quot; At the point where it's motionless, it goes from going in one direction, to going the opposite way, instantly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you asking how long it takes to hit the ground, or how long it actually sits in the air motionless (like Wiley Coyote)? If the first, then yes this is easily calculable. The second is even easier--zero seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The graph of its height over time would look like an inverted parabola. To answer your question, that would mean finding the &quot;flat&quot; top of that parabola, which would indicate zero height change over a time period. As you can guess, that doesn't exist. The more you zoom in on that parabola, the &quot;flatter&quot; it would look, but it would never be completely flat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
