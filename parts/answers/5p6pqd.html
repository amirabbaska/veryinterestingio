		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possibly, but not nearly as much as you would think. As bipeds, our muscles and bones are designed to keep our heads upright, looking forward. Most pets have musculoskeletal structures that are meant to keep their eyes aligned with their spines. Looking up is a much smaller movement and less effort for them, so they can do it more often and for longer with less overall strain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals do get sore after exercise or being cramped in one position for too long but I don't think they get sore looking up at us.  Compare the amount of time they spend looking up to the amount of time they spend sleeping, sniffing, running, etc. It's pretty negligible.  They might be a little stiff if they stared up at you for an hour straight while you ate but generally animals don't really commit like that to things that hurt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert, but I'd say: depends on the animal, but for most common pets, the answer is probably <strong>no.</strong></p>
<p>First, I doubt that most pets <strong>always</strong> look up, they usually move their heads around all the time. Also dogs and cats can look up without moving their heads, since their eyes are on top of the head.</p>
<p>Second, most animals have stronger, more versatile necks than humans, since they (or their ancestors) need to catch quick/small animals in order to survive. Just play catch with a dog and a ball and see what kind of stunts they pull off with their necks. Just look at <a href="https://cloud.graphicleftovers.com/17807/1259255/dachshund-dog-look-up.jpg" target="_blank">this neck</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bigger concern is the size of your animal vs the world. Larger dogs often have joint and bone problems just due to size. I've also personally had a beagke/dachshund mix with spinsl problems that ended their life. Her vet described it as relatively common due to the small stature vs the size of steps and other  or all human-sized objects. So it's not unreasonable to think arthritis and similar issues have a correlation to the size of our pets vs their environment. </p>
<p>Otherwise, I would have to think the answer to this is yes, if indeed they spend a majority of their time looking up at you - which they probably don't. You don't find people out of sorts for looking at the sky, which happens all the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you get a sore neck looking at street signs and traffic lights? me neither. Most animals are moving around or laying on their back when they look at us, very rarely do you see a dog craning its neck to get a good look at something. Yeah they can strain muscles but most animals are not dumb like people. A person will lean over the edge of something while trying to screw in a light and end up wrenching a half dozen muscles. People will hurt themselves to get something done because they can weigh the consequences. If a dog is bending at some funny angle and it starts to hurt, the dog stops. Animals won't knowingly endanger themselves unlike us. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
