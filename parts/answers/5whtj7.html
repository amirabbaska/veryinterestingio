		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first time someone thought to try and answer this was sometime in the 50s and the paper was called 'the cocktail party problem' they basically posed the question 'how is it, when I'm in a room full of 100 people at a cocktail party, that I can easily ignore many other voices and focus in on my target conversation?' </p>
<p>Since that time hundreds of studies have tried to pinpoint how it is possible for the human ear to cut through all the stimulation and information that is constantly bombarding the auditory system in order to hear the desired source of sound. </p>
<p>If we start from Outside the ear and go in I think it will it will. Make the most sense. </p>
<p>Ever noticed how when someone calls your name and you can immediately turn your head pretty much by reflex and be looking at the source of that sound?
The way each individuals ear is shaped 'bounces' the wave made by the sound and as it enters the ear and through years of practice (perfected Thru our development as a child) our brain has essentially figured out that if a wave has hit the timpanic membrane (ear drum) in a certain way it is most likely coming from a specific location. A study I recall changed the contours of people's ears and found that they were now terrible at locating specific sound sources. </p>
<p>So that's how we can separate a stream in space, it becomes more complex when there are competing noises, but already we have one way of separating that stream and hearing it over other noises by knowing where it's coming from. </p>
<p>Now focussing in a bit more on the guitar stream which you can now easily separate from the bass, drums and vocalist or whatever other distractions there are. With headphones on, your unique ear shape is now taken out of the equation - so how do we do it? </p>
<p>Luckily, many people have asked a similar question and it's mainly based upon the properties of the waveform of the sound (frequency, amplitude etc) and how loud the noise is (decibel lvl) </p>
<p>I've just arrived at work though so will have to defer until later, if you guys want me to keep going, I'll hit it up later in the afternoon. </p>
<p>OK, I'm back. </p>
<p>From many many studies we have realised that humans are incredibly well adapted to hear sound in a specific range of frequency, but not very good outside of this (think dog whistle, or mosquito tones). The advantage of this for example is when you talk on the telephone, decibel levels are low and overall quality of sound is pretty terrible (especially back in the day!) but we still usually hear with ease on the phone. This is because of something called attenuation. So in the case of the telephone, the speech is battling against white noise or static. Static has a pretty specific frequency which is not really at all close to the frequency of human speech which makes it easy for our well adapted systems to essentially find the noise that has excited the finely tuned 'hair like' fibres in our inner ear that tickle our nervous system and then increase the amount of excitation of the desired stream whilst decreasing the excitement caused by the undesired or static stream of noise. </p>
<p>Taking this Thru to the sound in your headphones, it's pretty much the exact same process. The guitar has a different frequency  and amplitude compared to the bas compared to the drums etc etc. However it's not as straight forward as say human speech vs static because the frequencies are all sitting in a similar zone. </p>
<p>So how do we differentiate similar sounds?
This is where it starts to get a LOT more complicated and there is a lot of 'top down' higher processing in the brain where we combine visual cues, learned experiences and pattern recognition (just to name a few). To take it back to you being able to separate the guitar and focus in on that after listening to the song, you have essentially learned how to fine tune your top down processes through experience, concentration and pattern recognition (for example learning the melody of the riff) and combining this tune up with the basic information or cues that your ear is delivering to the brain. </p>
<p>I think thats probably enough detail for an ELI5 haha! </p>
<p>But for a quick addit because I do find it interesting:</p>
<p>Were best at differentiating one voice from static.
Then a little worse at differentiating a voice from a tonal noise (singular frequency - like a droning beep)
A little worse again for beeping tones
Worse again for differentiating a female to a male voice
Worse again for differentiating same sex to same sex voice
Worst at differentiating the same voice from the same voice. </p>
<p>Extrapolate from that as you will! </p>
<p>The cocktail party problem paper should be easy to source online in the meantime, it's a godly paper!</p>
<p>The above only touches the surface of how complex the whole thing actually gets, this is why siri and other voice recognition programs still have absolutely NOTHING on the marvel that is our own, grown auditory system! </p>
<p>Edit: realised I didn't answer the why can't we stop hearing the breathing noises etc once we've clued onto them. </p>
<p>My memory on this one is hazy, nonetheless.. </p>
<p>Most natural noises that we hear (birds, monkeys, crickets, geckos for example)are at the basic level, single tone, repetitive noises - much like the breathing in a song, or someone continually saying 'umm' during a speech. This next bit is a stretch because I can't recall studying papers that specifically looked at this, but basically, evolutionarily it has been beneficial for us to be able to hear natural noises for reasons of survival or safety. Think monkeys or birds fleeing from danger, they're noisy, the caveman wakes up because we are hard-wired to attenuate and increase the excitement of the hairs (like above) that are being hit by the repetition of nature giving us the heads up that danger is about. </p>
<p>Try playing with your top down processing and see if you can modulate the annoying breath of the singer to make it a less dominant stream - change from focussing in on guitar to bass to drums - practice makes perfect, see musicians for evidence of the finely tuned ear. </p>

<p>I've been waiting for an ELI5 for me to answer, as I mooch off of all you people almost daily! So pleasure to finally have some knowledge to return to the community! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because right from the moment we're born, we're becoming pattern matchers. That's really at the core of what the brain does - it's a pattern matcher.</p>
<p>Someone blind from birth, whose eyesight is suddenly fixed - they're now, at age whatever, seeing for the first time - can't make sense of what they're looking at. It's just noise. Their brain has never had to deal with incoming visual information, so it has to learn how to recognise things.</p>
<p>And when we're born, our senses, particularly sight and sound, are just streams of input our brains don't know what to do with. But gradually, our brains spot patterns in the data - repeated chunks - and from then on we can start to at least acknowledge that &quot;ahh - that's a pattern I've got previous experience of&quot;. </p>
<p>It happens consciously at first - we <em>notice</em> the pattern, even if we don't know what it means, and then as the pattern starts to become more frequent and familiar, our brain thankfully starts to do it without requiring our conscious attention, and we can start dealing with higher-level things. Instead of thinking &quot;that pattern of sounds is familiar, and in the past that pattern has coincided with Mum handing me something to eat&quot; we can let the subconscious brain do that for us and just consider the sound, consciously, as meaning &quot;Food!&quot;</p>
<p>This starts to happen at higher and higher levels.</p>
<p>Think of the way we learn to walk. It starts with a conscious effort to move this muscle, then that one, to move our foot; after a while the brain has learnt the pattern - these kinds of patterns we may consider more as <em>habits</em>, but they're still just patterns - and we stop having to think about which muscles to contract in which order, and we can concentrate on the higher level tasks. <em>I need to move my foot forward</em> then <em>I need to move my body-weight forward</em> and then <em>I need to swing the other leg forward</em>. After a while, even that pattern of tasks can be left to the subconscious, and we can eventually just start thinking <em>I need to walk over to the table</em> - the brain now having layer upon layer of task management in place to break that high level desire down into which muscles need to be triggered.</p>
<p>Eventually we stop even needing to think &quot;I need to walk over there&quot; and we can just think &quot;I'm going to get a drink from the fridge&quot; and lo and behold, a whole complex set of tasks gets broken down by the brain, further and further, subtask into subtasks, right down to which muscle to trigger, which senses need to be monitored so we know when to stop triggering the muscles.</p>
<p>So when you hear the guitar riff, it's because your brain has built up this enormous hierarchy of logic that lets it handle the stream of  vibrations coming in, organising it into frequencies and timbres, determining that those particular ones are recognisable as &quot;guitar&quot;, letting us separate them out from the jumble.</p>
<p>It's useful to understand this, because it informs how we <em>learn</em> stuff - if you want to play the piano, start slowly enough to <em>get it right</em>, and after you've got it right enough times, your brain can do it for you and you'll find you can play it faster without having to consciously think about it. And it explains why we sometimes need to unlearn stuff that we got wrong - the brain's trying to hive off these tasks for us, and if we keep getting <em>that difficult bit</em> wrong, our brain will have (un)helpfully turned the mistake into a habit. So if you're learning a tune and you keep getting a bit wrong - stop! <em>Get it right</em> before going on. If that means slowing down to a crawl so you can consciously move this finger onto that note, then this finger onto this note, then that's what you must do. Don't just start the piece again and hope you'll thunder through getting it right next time.</p>
<p>And all this pattern matching / habit forming stuff is so important to understand because it's how our emotions work too. </p>
<p>Happy people are in the habit of being happy, and unhappy people are in the habit of being unhappy. That's not to say you can just choose to be happy if you're not, but you <em>do</em> have a level of control over it. Just like playing the piano, you can, if you notice your brain making emotional mistakes - like saying to yourself &quot;I'm just an idiot&quot; or &quot;I'll never get over <em>x</em>&quot; - stop! <em>Consciously</em> correct the error: tell yourself (whether it seems believable or not) &quot;I may have done an idiotic thing, but that does not mean I'm set in stone as an idiot&quot; or &quot;I'm having difficulty getting over <em>x</em> but that's to be expected right now and I <em>will</em> recover, given time&quot;.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter whether you feel deep down that it's true; if you correct the error enough times, after a while your brain will do it for you. You'll stop telling yourself you're an idiot. Your brain's habits - your internal monologue - will change. Your outlook will change. </p>
<p>We are just pattern-matching habit-forming creatures, and it's a blessing as it lets us think about, and do, higher level, more abstract things. But it's easy to get into bad habits, physically (getting that fingering wrong) and emotionally (letting our internal monologue get into cycles of negativity). Just never forget that every habit can be changed, and it always happens in small steps. Carpe diem.</p>
<p>(and since this has gone off on a bit of a tangent, man, I wish I'd never learnt to spot bad kerning. It's the first thing my brain screams at me now, before I've even read the <em>words</em> I'm looking at)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our ability to focus on a sound or an image is our mind ability to perform real time pattern recognition. Once you have a mental model of what you are looking for, your mind then listens for that pattern and draws your attention to anything fitting that pattern. It's all mental. For instance when you play a &quot;Wheres Waldo&quot; game and look at the big complicated picture, you are looking for a pattern of red and white to find his hat. Your mind ignores most of the other input and searches for the pattern in your mind. You might not even notice something like a person with 6 fingers, or wearing their hat upside down, because it doesn't match the pattern. When you listen to a song and hear a guitar, you perceive what the guitar is doing, the melody, timing, etc. Then you can remember that pattern, and look for it again easier the 2nd time. </p>
<p>Everything we see, hear, taste, and feel is perceived by us after a considerable amount of processing in the brain. Your senses are not a direct way of experiencing the world. In other words when you look at something, you aren't seeing the unfiltered 'direct' view of it. For instance we all have blind spots in our eyes, we lose focus towards the outside, we have veins and liquid in our eyes causing lines and spots in our vision. The mind filters out this background level of sensation, and highlights the things we need to see, like the edges of objects, motion, bright colors, etc. </p>
<p>Your sense of hearing is similar in that the actual sounds around you are not what you hear, but instead you hear your brains interpretation of those sounds. And much like the eyes, the brain makes up for deficiencies in our hearing organs, and filters out noise and other things we don't need to hear. Instead it can pick out sounds through mental filtering and draw attention to them by frequency, position, and loudness. </p>
<p>For instance you can listen to a box fan and tune it out so you don't pay attention to it. Yet the very quiet sound of a bee flying close to your head instantly grabs your attention even though it's not as loud as the fan. </p>
<p>Much like the way we can look at things to examine them more closely, our sense of hearing can focus and be selective to concentrate on different parts of a sound. </p>
<p>All things being equal, most of the difference in hearing between somebody like a recording engineer or audiophile, versus a person who doesn't care about sound isn't that they have better ears. It's that they have a very good system of splitting sound up mentally, and examining different parts of it. Basically the same hardware of 2 ears, ear canals, cartilage to direct the sound into our ear canals, etc but different 'software' or processing of the sound. </p>
<p>When you focus your attention on part of a song, it isn't changing what your ears hear, it is changing your attention and focusing it. If we could move our ears like cats and dogs, we might be doing that as well, but we can't so most of our attention is done in the brain instead of with our ears swiveling about. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
