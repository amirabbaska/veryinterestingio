		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a bit confused by the situation. The volcano already appears to be erupting, but there appears to be a fear that a more major eruption is still feared. </p>
<p>I naively thought that eruptions were a bit of an all or nothing thing. I pictured it as a pressure cooker that when it reached a critical pressure all hell breaks loose. But in this case the eruption appears to progress in steps. Could someone explain why the eruptions appear to take place in stages or in the form of discrete events? Is it different magna chambers kicking into action or is something else going on?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every once in a while someone brings up Yellowstone's chance to erupt, but it's all people speculating at gatherings. This is why it's great to have experts in this field to ask questions to!</p>
<p>When can we expect a Yellowstone eruption as I am sure it's not an if but a when situation, how bad will it be and will we know ahead of time? If so, enough to get people to safety? Is there a way to stop or disrupt an eruption?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
