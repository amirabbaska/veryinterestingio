		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The body isn't a perfect system, so sometimes the Epiglottis doesn't fully block off the Trachea when you swallow. If food does go down the Trachea, a cough response is triggered, and you cough it back up out of the Trachea, then you can swallow it down the Esophagus.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Lung doctor here.  Explanations here are good.  Imagine an upside down Y.  One pipe leads to two pipes.  The first pipe is from your mouth down.  The two pipes from that one pipe - one goes to your lungs, the other to your stomach.  Flappy thing lets you only get one thing down at a time - food/water or air. <br><br>Most of the time, the flappy thing and your learned abilities prevent food from going to the lungs.  When that happens, you usually just cough it up and the food headed down to the lungs gets pushed up into the first big pipe and goes down the pipe to stomach.<br><br>If a big piece of food gets stuck in the lungs - it takes a big maneuver to generate pressure in your stomach to force a big puff of air out of your lungs to push the food out.  <br><br>If it REALLY gets stuck, AND it doesn't make you dead due to lack of oxygen, then I get to pull it out.  I use a tool that looks like a snake with a camera and light at the end of it.  I go into your mouth, get past the flappy thing and go into your lungs.  Then I get some tool to grab the food and pull it out.<br><br>Cool things I've pulled out in 2016:<br>- iron pill<br>- multivitamin<br>- steak<br>- chicken bone<br>- fishbone<br>- tooth (a few of these cases - what the hell you dentists doing??)</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The top comments here are lacking. I'm a speech-language pathologist. We specialize in dysphagia, or disordered swallow. Most of these comments are only focusing on the epiglottis. The epiglottis is involved, but there is much more going on. <br><br>If you were to look down into your throat (like we do when we perform a Fiberoptic Endoscopic Evaluation of Swallowing test) you will see a big hole with a V at the opening. The V is your vocal cords, and these open and close over your trachea which goes to your lungs. You will not see another pipe. The esophagus which goes to your stomach stays closed except for when you swallow. You will not see two pipes! Your trachea stays open to allow you to breathe. However, when we swallow this big open tube has to be completely protected so that the food and liquid do not get in. <br><br>So how do we get food and liquid into the right pipe? Our bodies have 3 main methods of protecting the airway. Those vocal cords close tight over the airway, essentially putting a lid over the airway. The epiglottis flaps down and essentially puts another lid over the airway. Then the whole &quot;Adams apple&quot; (larynx) area is pulled up and forward by muscle contraction. It is at this point that the esophagus opens up, and negative pressure pushes the food or liquid into the esophagus. Then everything almost immediately resets to allow you to breathe again. <br><br>Now that's if everything is working correctly. Speech therapy is there when it is not. If the muscles that protect the airway are not strong enough or coordinated enough, the airway will not be fully protected. If food or liquid makes it past the vocal cords, that is called aspiration. A healthy sensory system will tell you to cough and cough hard. Some people, however, will aspirate and not even feel the sensation to cough. This is called silent aspiration. <br><br>Aspiration of food and liquid into the lungs generally equals a big party for bacteria in your lungs. You are also bringing down all the bacteria from your mouth. Lungs are not equipped like the stomach to break down food and liquid. They will try, but if the bacteria begins to take over then you will develop aspiration pneumonia. This is most likely to happen in the right lower lobe because of the way the lungs line up. <br><br>Still reading? Good for you! You may be wondering how in the world we can fix this if it is happening. This is something often seen in people with dementia or stroke. One way to address this is to change the texture of the solid or liquid. Thickened liquids move slower and work better with slower, less coordinated muscles. Softer foods require less effort and pressure to move through the swallow. There are also exercises we can train if the person is cognitively able to complete them. These things are all done by speech therapy. <br><br>Anyone with more questions about swallowing, feel free to message me!!!</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Everyone has given lovely answers so far, and they're correct, but I want to add another perspective on the &quot;Why does it happen?&quot; part of OP's question:  <br><br>This is one of my favorite human malfunctions, because it's a great example of evolution being a pretty dreadful engineer of organisms.  As an evolutionary biologist a lot of my teaching is about showing students the majestic wonderousness of life's diversity, including highlighting the intricate and detailed ways that creatures have evolved to match their environments and their lifestyles.  The problem with this teaching approach is that it can start to tempt students into thinking that evolution is a flawless designer of organisms, which can lead some students to be more receptive to the idea of an intelligent designer.  I use the example of choking to highlight that any sentient designer claiming responsibility for designing us should be sharply chastised for doing such a poor job. <br><br>The last ancestor we share with the rest of our vertebrate cousins evolved to have a breathing system and an eating system that overlapped in the oral cavity.  They had one pipe that split into two pipes with two separate functions, and so we were forced to start with the evolutionary legacy of that basic bodyplan too.  Any mutation our genes come up with that tries to separate breathing from eating runs the risk of disabling one or both of those systems - not good for the mutant's survival!  Thus, mutations that radically alter the structure of our throat are rare to occur and even more rare to be passed down, and so we don't solve the choking problem.  And, I mean, coughing is a <em>pretty good</em> way to keep us from dying every time we choke.  I mean, yeah, lots of people choke to death every year, but we evolved to cough really hard and that should, like, totally be good enough, right?<br><br>Now, one might think that <em>eventually</em> we could evolve past this, since choking is a genuine cause of death for humans of all ages, and so there should be an evolutionary pressure to solve the problem.  Why haven't we evolved a better system?  Well, as best we can tell, this wasn't really that big a deal for us until relatively recently.  It's only since our ancestors began using vocal communication in earnest that evolution had to move parts of our trachea and larynx around in our throats to give us the ability to speak complex languages.  Unfortunately, those rearrangements also greatly increased our risk of choking by stretching the epiglottis and exposing more of our trachea to the foods rushing towards our stomachs.  Not to mention the fact that our species likes to eat socially, so we often talk while eating! What's a poor epiglottis to do?  Evolution hasn't solved this problem for us yet (and likely never will) because until very recently choking was as much of a freak occurrence for us as it is for other great apes, so there was little evolutionary pressure acting on our genes to prevent it.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Speech pathologist here (SLP). I treat people who have swallowing disorders in a hospital.<br><br>Things that can happen when food or liquid &quot;goes down the wrong pipe&quot;, which is called aspiration, in the direction of your lungs:<br><br>1. Healthy person with normal swallowing function should immediately cough pretty hard and get the food or liquid out of their airway.<br>2. Someone who is weak or sick might feel food or liquid go into their airway but may not be strong enough to cough as hard as they would need to in order to expel the food.<br>3. Sometimes people do NOT cough when food or liquid starts going into the &quot;wrong pipe&quot;/airway. They don't even notice it's happening. This is called silent aspiration. <br><br>The problem is that sometimes people either don't seek medical attention or don't realize this is happening and develop aspiration pneumonia.<br><br>Now look at this cool video :)<br><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWRfKb32-Rk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWRfKb32-Rk</a></p>		<div class="replies-controls">
