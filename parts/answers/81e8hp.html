<p>Coma patients have brain activity in basic life sustaining components, such as midbrain. Sometimes on life support, none at all.</p>
<p>When you sleep there is significant brain activity, slow but constant and depending on what part of your sleep cycle it can get very active.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m on mobile and I can’t share the links easily, but you can find studies that show brain wave activity in coma versus sleep. There’s a great deal more going on in your brain when you’re asleep, whereas particularly deep comas can literally show no activity at all, just a flat line on the EEG.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't say exactly which brainwaves are different, but it has to do with how well your thalamus is working.  There is a lot of evidence that the thalamus the thalumus cortex regulate consciousness, and coma patients have damage to that part of the brain. General anesthetics slow the metabolism of the thalamus too.</p>

<p>I couldn't find the full article online for free, but this is basically what the part about comas said:
&quot;The most consistent effect produced by anesthetics at LOC is a reduction of thalamic metabolism, suggesting that the thalamocortical system is the major system that is essential for conscious activity. Post-mortem analysis of coma patients revealed suppression or destruction of thalamocortical functions, and electrical stimulation of the central thalamus restored a degree of behavioral responsiveness in a patient who had been minimally conscious for 6 years.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
