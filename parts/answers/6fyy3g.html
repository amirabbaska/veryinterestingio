		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are.  </p>
<p>The problem with some allergic reactions eg peanuts, is the rate of onset of the reaction.  This is mostly due to either the concentration of the the allergen or the host's sensitivity to a particular allergen.  </p>
<p>Your seasonal allergy medicine is designed to work against a relatively low level of physiological reaction (low concentration of antigen or lower immune response).  Meanwhile, high dose epinephrine (eg. EpiPen) can counter the inflammatory response to a high level allergic reaction. </p>
<p>The main reason that we don't take those medications on a continual preventative basis is that the side effects include all sorts of bad things up to and including cardiac arrest.  So most of the time, people are better off waiting until they start having a reaction and then taking their medicine, if they have a known allergy problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do allergenic extract review with a national regulator and there are plenty of peanut extracts coming through the pipeline in tablet form. The major factor is development time, but another issue is their status as biologics.</p>
<p>Currently, many countries don't regulate them as stringently as injectables, but that is slowly changing. By the time some products make it to review in one country, they may start to be regulated differently in their home country/region. This can cause delays in the review process or time to submission by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>TL;DR they're coming, for everything</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the severity of the allergic reaction and the risk of the allergy that determines whether or not an anti-histamine (allergy medication) can take care of it. If someone has a really mild peanut allergy that only causes itchy eyes or hives, Benadryl can probably take care of it. They still should just avoid peanuts, though, because they are still at risk of an anaphylactic reaction with peanuts, in which blood pressure drops and airways narrow. Anaphylactic reactions are life threatening and is treated with epinephrine since it acts fast enough. An anti-histamine simply does not act fast enough and isn't &quot;strong enough&quot; to handle severe allergic reactions. Seasonal allergies are generally on the milder end of allergic reactions, so anti-histamines can handle them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allergies in medical parlance are known as hypersensitivity reactions, and there are 4 or 5 different types of these reactions.  This wikipedia page covers it well:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypersensitivity</a></p>
<p>The core differences between these type of reactions is whether body mounts a systemic (i.e. entire body) response, or localized (i.e. at the site of mosquito bite) response.  A secondary difference is the speed with which the body responds. </p>
<p>For class 1 reactions (a true anaphylaxis to peanuts), the reaction is the entire body and within minutes.  It tends to cause almost immediate swelling of the tongue, airway, esophagus, and can compromise the airway (i.e. choke someone).   Please note, not all people who are allergic to peanuts have a class 1 reaction, any of them are possible.  This can be confusing.</p>
<p>Similarly, a mosquito bite is typically a class 4 reaction; hallmarked by swelling at the site of the bite only and taking minutes to hours to manifest.  That said a mosquito bite can rarely be a class 1 reaction, and immediately life-threatening.  </p>
<p>So, the class of reaction determines which level of medicine(s) should be employed.  For someone having a class 1 reaction they will get a cocktail of epinephrine (adrenaline), diphenhydramine (benadryl), pepcid, and hydrocortisone along with humidified oxygen and intubation (a breathing tube) if necessary.  All of these medicines/ interventions also have side effects - some strong - so should not be utilized for other classes of reactions.  </p>
<p>So for your mosquito bite, the topical cream probably was best.  Most oral or IV medications would effect all parts of your body, rather than only the itchy spot.  Most of these medications would make you sleepy, confused, and even lower your immune system.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
