<p>it doesnt make sense for bismuth to look like this when most crystalline metals are much less orderly structured.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Literally the definition of a crystal is that it has an ordered [e: repeating] long-range structure.  You're right that we don't see the crystal structure very often, and that's because [e: many of] the things we see that are crystalline at the microscopic level are made up of many small crystals instead of a few big crystals.  Generally speaking, the faster something is cooled, the smaller the crystals are. Bismuth has a low melting temperature, so it's relatively easy to cool it down slowly and end up with only a few relatively large crystals instead of a large number of small crystals. But the crystalline structure of other metals, like iron, is often visible.  If you've ever seen sort of &quot;splotchy&quot; galvanized steel that looked <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot-dip_galvanization#/media/File:Feuerverzinkte_Oberfl%C3%A4che.jpg" target="_blank">something like this</a>, you've seen zinc crystals. You can see similar nickel-iron crystals in the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/36/Widmanstatten_hand.jpg" target="_blank">slice of this meteorite.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, the rainbow colors are interference effects stemming from a layer of bismuth oxide on the bismuth crystals. If the oxide layer is in the 200-500 nm range, it's index of refraction becomes strongly wavelength dependent because light at some wavelengths can form a standing wave inside the oxide layer, while this is impossible at other wavelengths. Clean Bismuth is just a dull gray metal.</p>
<p>Anyway, onto the crystal structure. Because of it's unit cel, which is rectangular, bismuth prefers to grow into rectangular crystals, and if you pick the right growth conditions you just end up with a cube of bismuth. It will be a dull grey cube too, so not particularely interesting. However, under usual growth conditions, Bismuth undergoes what's known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hopper_crystal" target="_blank">hopper crystal growth</a>. Basically, bismuth atoms prefer to attach to the edge of a growing crystal rather than the faces. The result is that the crystal never fills in, but instead you get a fractal structure that consists of a large number of steps. The steps are rectangular because bismuth strongly prefers that crystal morphology.</p>
<p><a href="http://66.media.tumblr.com/e98efc0c4339a0230cf199d363414b64/tumblr_nuczsbACud1tt8afro1_1280.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example of naturally occuring Perovskite crystals showing the same kind of hopper crystal growth.</p>
<p>If you get a similar growth mode in a crystal that doesn't have such a strong preference for a specific morphology, or if the driving force for crystal growth is much larger than in the hopper growth case, you get dendritic growth instead, which results in snowflake-like patterns, such as in <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/f7/22/b9/f722b935623a6027c5f32e1714813a62.jpg" target="_blank">these</a> ammonium chloride crystals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other commenter, bismuth only crystalizes like that under artificial conditions. Otherwise it has a similar crystal shape but not as neat looking.</p>
<p>Look up halite (aka table salt), galena, and iron pyrite. All of these form approximate cubes in the right conditions. </p>
<p>Galena looks like a Borg ship imo. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crystal growth can be an incredibly complicated process with several factors defining the shapes / morphologies you end up with. Temperature being one of the main ones as other commenters have mentioned, but also concentration of the species that is in the medium where crystallisation is taking place. The actual medium you crystallise from can also have a large effect on the shapes you end up with, among quite a few other factors, the Wikipedia page on crystallisation is a really good source of information with a lot more detailed information along with graphs and equations that define the processes during crystallisation.</p>
<p>One of the main things I've come across in my research that governs crystal shapes is a parameter called the supersaturation (or thermodynamic driving force). This is defined as the difference in chemical potential between the crystal structure (chemical potential in very simple terms is how much potential a system has to change) and the medium that it's crystallising from and is in fact goverened by temperature and concentration. </p>
<p>Crystals grown under high supersaturation can have completely different morphologies to those under low supersaturation and grow via completely different means. Low supersaturation crystals commonly grow as spirals from a defect in the crystal known as a screw dislocation. Medium supersaturation crystals commonly grow by layers or by the birth-and-spread mechanism (layers catch up to one another). High supersaturation crystals can grow isotropically, so spots growing all over the place! </p>
<p>The overall morphology of the crystal is totally defined by these surface growing mechanisms, which can be studied with high powered microscopy techniques such as atomic force microscopy (AFM) - scanning electron microscopy can't investigate the surfaces of crystals on this scale! It is also quite interesting that the morphologies of crystals can sometimes appear from growth patterns you would expect to form completely different shapes, faujasite is a very interesting example!</p>
<p>Apologies for rambling but crystal growth is a massive and interesting field (I'm not biased, honestly) which is still under a great deal of study. If you're looking for other interesting shapes crystals, zeolite A, MFI, H-KUST-1 and UiO-66 all form regular but different shapes. But as for Bismuth, LOTS of factors govern the overall shape that we see and people are still trying to figure out how to control these.</p>
