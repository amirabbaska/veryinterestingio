		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because part of the state of the particle is its spatial wavefunction.</p>
<p>Particles in quantum mechanics don't generally have well-defined position, so when we say that two particles are &quot;in the same position&quot;, we mean that they have the same spatial wavefunction. Two identical fermions can only be in the same position if they have different spin projections, or another difference in some additional quantum number that they may have (isospin projection, color charge, etc.).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's extremely relevant as it determines the electronic structure of materials and molecules. If not for the Pauli principle, electrons would be Boltzmann-distributed in the same way as atoms and molecules, i.e., most of the would be in the lowest-energy state with some in excited states. There would be no chemical bonds either, as the formation of chemical bonds as we know them is also a consequence of the Pauli principle. Note that this doesn't require them to be extremely close as it affects chemistry even when the electrons are in different molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wavefunctions decay to zero in any direction away from maximum (which is the classical analog of the particle's position). Depending on the conditions the Heisenberg uncertainty principle states that any pair of complementary phase space coordinates (such as position and momentum) have to have uncertainty whose product is a nonzero value (proportional to Planck's constant). A measurement or other physical interaction between a fermion and it's surroundings may narrow the uncertainty of one variable and this automatically raises the uncertainty of the other complement. This has the effect of spreading out the component of the wavefunction that corresponds to that variable. Only then the wavefunctions can actually come &quot;in contact&quot; so to speak and then Pauli kicks in. For instance electrons bound in chemical bonds are close together (because due to electric force of positive nucleon they can't get too far away which narrows their possible position to a small volume) and in similar energy states (because they are bound) therefore their spins have to be flipped and any other electrons have to assume different orbitals in order to differentiate their states. That's how all wavefunctions of electrons in participating in atom's or molecule's electron clouds overlap, including brief overlaps with electrons that belong to other atoms/moleculas that come to a collision with the given one.</p>
<p>Free electrons, on the other hand, shooting through the cosmic vacuum are (on quantum scale) so far apart that their wavefunctions do not feel each other (there's no overlap or any superposition to speak of) and on top of that their states are not even quantized (they are semi continuous) so there's no chance whatsoever for them to get even close to a similar state, let alone identical one. Same goes even inside a core of a dying star, where Heisenberg forces large spreads of energy and momentum but only till no more spreads are possible due to geometric constraints of the core. Then Pauli manifests as the degeneracy pressure that forbids further collapse (and thus further coming closer together). Until catastrophic collapse and proton electron pair fusion into a neutron, which being fermions themselves are also subject to degeneracy pressure and PEP but require enormously greater pressures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong>: the exclusion principle comes from a weird, nonintuitive way that spin-1/2 particles behave under rotations.  If you accept that, you get Pauli's exclusion principle for free by waving your hands.</p>
<p>Pauli's exclusion principle was empirical and explained the electron states in atoms -- but now we know that it is because of the symmetry properties of spin-1/2 particles.  It's worth thinking about that because it may help your intuition.</p>
<p>Just as there is a duality between <em>spatial frequency</em> and <em>momentum</em>, there is also a duality between <em>angular frequency</em> and <em>angular momentum</em>.  If you convert to polar coordinates, you find that systems which are spinning oscillate in the angular direction.  </p>
<p>Systems with spin 1 have exactly one oscillation per 360° of rotation.  If you rotate the system a full circle (or walk around it while staring at it), it will advance in phase by one full rotation in the complex plane, and arrive back to have exactly the same characteristics as before.  That's intuitive, right?  It works for spinning atoms, and it works for bicycles too.</p>
<p>Systems with spin 1/2 are weird and counterintuitive, because they have exactly 1/2 oscillation per 360° of rotation.  If you rotate a system like that in a full circle, the wave function will have 180° phase shift -- it will have a sign shift.  That is weird and unintuitive.  There are a few classical systems that work that way.  The one I like the most is the revelation that you can hold a coffee cup firmly in one hand and rotate it around the vertical axis arbitrarily many times without spilling it or letting go.  The trick is to hold it by the base, and flex your wrist so you can bring your arm around it once over the top and once under the bottom of the mug.  The arm-hand-mug system only returns to its original state after 720° of rotation.  Another (cheaty) system is a car engine:  the engine returns to its original state only after the crankshaft rotates 720°, not just 360°.  The reason that's a cheat is that the camshaft in the engine is geared down 2:1 to accomplish that.</p>
<p>Anyhow, <em>two</em> spin-1/2 particles (fermions) next to each other are a very simple system, and you can figure some things out just by thinking about the symmetry of the system.  Exchanging the position of the two particles is the same thing as walking 180° around the system.  If you do that, each fermion gives you a phase shift of 90° (a factor of <em>i</em>), because you've gone <em>half</em> of a full circle.  But there are two of them, and (you may remember) you therefore have to multiply the two wavefunctions together.  That's easy, since <em>i</em>^2 = -1.  So walking halfway around a system of two fermions multiplies the overall wavefunction by -1.</p>
<p>The way Pauli's principle comes from that is this:  if the two particles are in <em>exactly the same state</em> then exchanging their position does nothing at all.  So doing that must not change the wavefunction at all.  So we can set the (unknown, unspecified) wavefunctgion Ψ equal to its own negative (from above).</p>
<p>So we've arrived at the equation &quot;Ψ = -Ψ&quot;, which of course is just another way of saying &quot;Ψ=0&quot;.  So the only wavefunction that can have the two particles in the same state is identically zero.  That means the probability of finding them in that state is zero -- which is just Pauli's exclusion principle, said another way.</p>
<p>If the two fermions are in different states, then the spatial distribution of the two particles' wavefunctions is different, and you don't get the nice cancellation that yields the exclusion principle.  So if they're in different locations or different energy states, the probability of finding them in that joint  state <em>doesn't</em> go to zero.  Which answers your question, I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
