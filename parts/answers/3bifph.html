		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting phenomenon that goes back to how television was first referred to. A television is a physical object, so when you watched one, you were watching the pictures projected <em>on</em> the television screen. &quot;Look, the president is <em>on</em> the television.&quot; </p>
<p>A movie, however, is not perceived as a physical object, but is instead a collection of information, much like a book or song. Someone is in a movie in that they are included in the collection of information the movie contains </p>
<p>Over time these definitions have merged and blurred, but we still have the &quot;in vs on&quot; division as a relic of an older style of language. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the simplest way to think about this is that you also say someone is ON the big screen (when you're talking about their movie career) or IN a TV series. </p>
<p>You were comparing the wrong things. A movie should be compared to the TV series, and for the medium, the big screen is compared to the television.</p>
<p>Edit: Ah! I believe the current top comment is the most correct. I think he conveyed what I had failed to convey. My reasoning was entirely based on his in my head, I just didn't know it. </p>
<p>Edit 2: I think my comment below (which i will repeat with edits here) is the best articulated version of my answer to this question.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to get at is that this is a result of how language has evolved to use both in and on TV shows. Because the sentence &quot;He is on this TV show&quot; is (I believe) only said because of the word TV, as you can say &quot;He is in this TV show&quot; and thus probably evolved from saying &quot;on TV&quot;. I think the &quot;correct&quot; (in parenthesis because language changes) way to say it was originally &quot;He is in this TV show&quot; as opposed to &quot;He is on this TV show&quot;.</p>
<p>It's all about whether you are speaking about being IN the intangible idea of a SHOW, MOVIE, PLAY, or ON the tangible medium, TV (Television screen) , BIG SCREEN (movie screen, projector screen, I dunno what else it may be called), STAGE.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it has to do with the fact that Television is a recurring media. Where as Movies are general are one time deal. They were &quot;on&quot; the show because the show is regularly occurring, or they were &quot;in&quot; a movie which was a one time thing. Now it's a little hard to go by this because every movie being released is a part of some larger series so they've also become regularly occurring things. But before the concept of the sequel is where that could come from. Just my thought.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dont listen to those made up explanations.</p>
<p>The reason:</p>
<p>Because in english, prepositions make no sense.  Most times they give the  illusion that they do but in reality, it's just a matter of usage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
