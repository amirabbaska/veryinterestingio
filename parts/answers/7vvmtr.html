		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's a way of quickly and robustly shaping the magnetic field with a tokamak's kind of magnet to do what your proposing. You'd presumably need something with a load of smaller magnets, and then you'd have very little field strength for containment.</p>
<p>I'm also not sure you could design a circuit (i.e. sensor, computer to invert image, computer to process how to respond, circuitry to increase the current to a magnet) that could respond quick enough to prevent all the significant turbulence, even with a really fast computer. But I'm also not sure, while I'm sure you could do something to help mitigate the lower frequency oscillations if you had free control over the magnetic field shape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>Princeton researchers can exceed the predictive capability
of conventional simulations by achieving 90% accuracy with less than
5% false positive rates. With this, they are well on the path to the key
goals of (i) demonstrating the portability of the deep learning software
trained on one major experiment such as JET to many other current
tokamak facilities and eventually to ITER; and (ii) reacting in a timely way
the predictive capability to deliver accuracy and reliability of 95% true
positive and less than 5% false positive at 30 milliseconds or more before
the onset of disruptions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Particularly for nonlinear plasma disruptions in fusion experiments, machine learning may be practical for &quot;predicting&quot; or detecting when a disruption is about to happen and providing feedback control to avoid. I believe as early as the 90s, neural networks have been used to predict disruptions on tokamaks.  Machine learning is also increasingly being used for Design of Experiment and data analysis.  It will almost definitely play a major role in fusion research going forward, but there are still many challenges.</p>
