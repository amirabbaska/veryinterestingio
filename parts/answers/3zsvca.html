		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is pretty simple. No, it would not spin. A ball spins down a slope (when there is friction) <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/149731/ball-rolling-down-an-inclined-plane-where-does-the-torque-come-from" target="_blank">because the ball experiences a net torque</a>. What you will find is that if you push a ball down a frictionless slope, it will have a greater lateral acceleration because none of the translational energy is being lost to rotational energy.</p>
<p>Kinetic energy is 1/2 m v^2 while rotational energy looks pretty similar, 1/2 I ω^2. I is the moment of inertia and ω is the angular velocity. The total energy of the system will be equal to the ball's kinetic energy + the rotational energy, so when you take friction out of the equation, none of the translational energy will be expended in making the ball rotate because there will be no torque applied to the ball.</p>
<p>Edit: If the center of mass of the ball is not at the geometric center, the ball will rotate. I was assuming that we have a geometrically centered center of mass. For an explanation of why this happens, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3zsvca/without_friction_would_a_ball_still_spin_when/cyozco0" target="_blank">please look at the comments below.</a> Also, I was assuming that the ball had initially no spin because of how I interpreted the grammar of the OP's question. The ball will retain the angular energy given to it at t=0. If this energy is zero, it will continue to be zero. If it is non zero, it will continue to be non zero. This is simply Newton's first law. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You already have your answer, but I can still give you an example of this in real life. I'm a bowler, and when bowling, there will be many times where the ball will go through a thick patch of oil, and will not spin. It will just glide. And then when it gets out of the oil, it will start to spin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're getting a lot of answers regarding the &quot;friction&quot; aspect, so here's one regarding the &quot;ball&quot; aspect, as this is also important. If you think about it, all surfaces on the ball are orthogonal (perpendicular) to the center of mass, so when any surface (without friction) hits the ball, it is pushing down a line through the center of mass, which wouldn't rotate it.</p>
<p>Lets just say, theoretically, you had a perfectly round sphere. I mean, PERFECTLY round, down to a subatomic level. Assuming everything else in the world was normal, there'd be no conceivable way to rotate the ball at all. The reason for this is there is no way to exert a force on the ball in a direction other than through the center mass.</p>
<p>For most other objects, because there is a surface that is not perpendicular to center mass (cubes, prisms, etc), even without friction they can be rotated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not unless a differential in air resistance caused an imbalance. The air resistance will strangely be lower near the frictionless surface so the ball might rotate backwards from what you might expect.</p>
<p>Without air resistance, no rotation. If it was irregularly shaped instead of a ball it would rotate relative to the normal force that is perpendicular to the frictionless surface. (try to lay flat against the frictionless surface)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
