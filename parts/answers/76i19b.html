		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light is 300,000 km/s (in a vacuum), the speed of an electrical signal in copper cabling is probably closer to 120,000 km/s, and there are things like drift and collisions that present problems.</p>
<p>When you are sending a signal across the internet, that signal isn't just travelling in copper.  If you're on WiFi, it's first travelling through the air as a radio signal.  Then it's hitting an access point which will likely convert the signal to copper.  Then it will probably go to the cable modem, which will transform the signal again so that it can travel across coaxial cable to the neighborhood junction.  From there it shifts again in shape and enters the cable provider's network.  That's still copper until it gets to a point where it's reasonable to have laid fiber and reasonable to splice into it.  The signal is converted again, but this time it's blended with other traffic.  Who knows how many hops from there until it reaches a network bridging point between providers, then across the adjacent providers network until the desired endpoint is reached.</p>
<p>All this combining and converting signals is problematic.  All sorts of things can happen along the way to mess up the message.  Anything from regular old drift to radio interference to electromagnetic interference to stinking cosmic rays or just bad luck.  So there's a language that all of these components speak at layer 1/2 to help ensure that the communication is clear and reliable.  (layer 1 is the physical layer, e.g. the actual components, layer 2 is the data link layer, basic electrical communication is defined at both levels).</p>
<p>Then there are the things that happens at level 3 - the network layer.  This is the routing and switching.  These are the &quot;hops&quot; you see on a traceroute.  Kind of.  Basically, these are the components that send all the right signals in all the right directions, put everything into packets, do all the sequencing.  We think about TCP/IP as sort of the base level of communication, but that doesn't even start until layer 4.  At layers 1, 2, and 3 there's all kinds of groundwork that needs to happen before TCP/IP can even be a thought.  All of these different components need to have connectivity.  They need to know about each other.  They need to have a common language.  All of that means signalling.  And that means signalling on the same set of connections that your data is travelling through.</p>
<p>We think of a web request as data going to the server, data coming back from the server.  No...</p>
<p>At layers 1, 2, and 3 there is a lot of off-band bidirectional communication so that everything along the way knows what is what.  You don't want to send signal down a dead path.  You want to prefer shortest pathways.  You need to be aware of other potential pathways.  You need to know what language the other components of the network speak.  You need to tell them about you.  All of those bi-directional conversations... well every bidirectional stanza effectively doubles the length of the path a signal has to take.</p>
<p>Now when you get to Layer 4, there's TCP/IP.  The reason so much of the internet uses TCP/IP is that it's a reliable protocol.  Lot's of extra communication happens to get something going.  Starting a connection means Syn - SynAck - Ack.  That just tripled the distance required.  Within TCP, messages are cut into chunks of transmission sized data.  Intelligent endpoints will inspect those chunks and do things with them along the way.  It could be resequencing (not every packet comes in order).  It could be rejecting.  It could be forwarding.  It could be re-packaging and sending along.  It could be re-packaging, splitting, and sending on.  The decision for what to do takes processing power and time.  Every &quot;hop&quot; you see in a traceroute has these decisions to make and adds time to the transmission.  It can also mean requests for re-transmission, again doubling the signal distance (actually, potentially multiplying the distance by 5). </p>
<p>Then you move up the layer stack and guess what?  More bi-directional communication at each layer (there are 7 layers, we haven't talked about the session, presentation, and application layers at all).</p>
<p>And let's remember too that when you send a message to grandma's house 3 miles away, the actual phyical paths that a message travels could be anywhere between 5 miles and 700 miles or more.  </p>
<p>If each layer multiplies the travel distance of a signal by 5, you are now at 39,420.5 km travelled.  Yeah, that's a tenth of a second, but that's only the first transmission.  Now that connectivity is established each consecutive communication has less distance to travel and all of those devices along the way can work faster now that they've worked things out.  Still, all of those devices have work to do and the more devices (and the less clear the signal to those devices) the more work has to get done.</p>
<p>But that's not really the amazing thing.  A signal isn't travelling at all.  No single electron makes it's way from one end of the pathway to another.  What you've done is told one electron to dance, and it's told it's nearest neighbor to dance as well.  And so on and so forth.  Consider that there are 3 trillion atoms in a spec of dust.  And of course there are several electrons in each atom.  Lay that out end to end over tens of thousands of kilometers and you have interacted with a number of atomic particles that you cannot even fathom.  All by pushing a button on a keyboard.  And we live in the one special place in the universe with the right temperature, the right combination of elements, the right amount of gravity, the right amount of everything that makes it possible for you to cause all of those little pieces of universe to bend to your will as if you were waving a streamer like a gymnast.  And you live in the one special place in the universe where life was generated intelligent enough to figure all that was necessary to build this structure out AND had the motivation to do it.  Billions upon billions of cubic miles of nothingness and your particles just happened to end up in the right spot so YOUR BRAIN could make the decision to tell the other person on the XBox Network &quot;you are a good shot!&quot;</p>
<p>It's very much a miracle that any of this happens at all. One little blip.  One meteorite that hits at a different time or at a different angle at the right time in history and we're all bits of moon rock desperately trying to stay still and do nothing.</p>
<p>Or you know... some other reason.  I don't really know for sure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that all cars, freight ships, trucks, and airplanes would move at light speed. Now think about how long it would take to send a package around the world. Of course it would be faster now, but it wouldn't come close to the speed of light. <em>Moving the package</em> would take almost no time, but the package would still spend a significant amount of time being inspected, loaded, unloaded, etc...</p>
<p>This is essentially how the internet works, too. Many of the same words are used here as well: traffic, package, destination, route, ... The information <em>moves</em> at light speed, but spends a lot of time being <em>routed</em> or even queued. Just like you don't have a dedicated road to every person on earth, data packages have to manoeuvre through a network of shared connections.</p>
<p>Imagine you're a router in such a network and you receive a package labeled with the destination &quot;216.58.207.78&quot; and you're connected to five other routers. You're gonna have think about where to send this for a bit unless you would want to send it to all of your router friends, which would make the internet wildly inefficient.</p>
<p>On top of that, as several people already pointed out: When looking at the scale of the earth the speed of light suddenly becomes significant. Going from Los Angeles to Berlin at light speed will take 31ms. Go back and forth (that's what a ping does) and you're at 62ms. That's already enough to ruin most online games. The overhead from routing roughly doubles the travel time, so in practice you would be working with a ping of around 124ms, which will make the game feel like you're wearing oven mitts.</p>
<p>EDIT: As /u/HakushiBestShaman pointed out, the information doesn't actually travel through the cabel at light speed, but quite a bit slower <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/80043/how-fast-does-light-travel-through-a-fibre-optic-cable" target="_blank">at around two-thirds light speed</a>. Taking that into account it seems that the overhead from routing is quite low for long distances along <em>common</em> routes, e.g. US&lt;-&gt;EU.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also noteworthy that the speed of light isn't the same in every material. Optical fibers lower the speed by a decent percentage (~30%), and many common copper data cables (cat 5/6) can be even worse.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_factor" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_factor</a></p>
<p>Interestingly, optical fibers <em>wouldn't work</em> if the speed of light in them wasn't significantly lower than the speed of light in air/vacuum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The latency comes more from the various bits of hardware the signal has to pass through, than from the wires. Even so, if you're going halfway around the world at the speed of light without detours, that's 20,000 km / 300,000 km/s = 66 ms (edit: in each direction, so the ping time would be +133 just from distance) which is already a pretty respectable ping time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers deal with why latency exists, but I would like to add that electricity does not travel at the speed of light through a vacuum, through wiring.</p>
<p>It's varies from 50-99% of that.</p>
<p>Still extremely fast, so the limiting factor is still computers receiving, retransmitting, and calculating and all that.</p>
<p>Now if satellite is brought in to the picture anywhere, there's actually a lag solely because of the travel time to and from the satellite. Not a problem for most connections, but those with satellite internet can't avoid a minimum lag from that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
