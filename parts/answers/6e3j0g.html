		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some more information might help like:</p>
<p>What services are common between the devices</p>
<p>Did that search play any audio</p>
<p>Can you confirm the devices are on the same network?</p>
<p>If so, what carrier?</p>
<p>It's possible that your ISP inserted a &quot;super-cookie&quot; into your work laptop's data, which would correlate the laptop with your phone as if they're on the same network, they might get the same super-cookie. Taking this further, Google and Facebook might share &quot;super-cookie data&quot; with one another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
