<p>However they are a handgun round.  They're less aerodynamic and have less power coming out of the barrel.  They're not designed for long-distance flight.</p>
<p>7.62/.308 and 5.56/.223 are rifle rounds.  They have more power out the barrel and are designed for long- distance, accurate engagement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the ELI5 would be that the size of the gunpowder charge behind the bullet is what makes the difference. I could take any of those bullets you listed and throw it at you, and it's not gonna do much damage. Rifle rounds have a much bigger gunpowder charge behind them, which makes a bigger boom, which moves the bullet faster, and a faster bullet has more energy to transfer to soft bodily tissues. A lot more still comes into play though, like what material the bullet is made from, how far the bullet travels, and where you are hit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diameter of the bullet isn't the only dimension that matters.</p>
<p>The 9mm bullet is larger in diameter than the two rifle rounds, but has significantly less energy behind it and is lighter than the 7.62 bullet.  The rifle rounds have a lot more gun powder packed behind them so they leave at much greater speed and can deliver a lot more energy to the target.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.prep-blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/22lr-9mm-556.jpg" target="_blank">Look at an image of the various rounds</a>, the two on the left have the largest diameter, but the two on the right have a lot more <em>Boom</em> behind them to get them to the target.  The far right round is the 7.62 that AKs use, the NATO 7.62 is significantly longer</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why are basketballs less dangerous than baseballs? Shouldn’t they deal more damage with bigger size?</p>
<p>Baseballs move a whole lot faster than basketballs, typically. And despite being smaller, they are heavier for their size.</p>
<p>It’s like that with bullets. Rifle bullets aren’t as wide, but they’re longer and they’re moving faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, a 9mm bullet (~8 grams) has more energy than a 5.56mm bullet (~4 grams) and will therefore do more damage <em>if they are moving at the same velocity.</em></p>
<p>That last part is a big caveat. If you just look at the two cartridges, you'll see that a 5.56 rifle round has much more propellant than a 9mm pistol cartridge. Also, a rifle's barrel is longer which means the bullet has a longer distance over which to accelerate.</p>
<p>What matters is the mass of the bullet <em>and</em> the velocity at which it flies. Gun types express this as &quot;muzzle energy&quot; which is 1/2mv^(2) (m being the bullet mass and v being the velocity as it leaves the barrel.)</p>
<p>Depending on the gun, a 9mm bullet has around 600 joules of muzzle energy, where a 5.56mm has around 1800 joules. This is a closer analogue of what kind of &quot;damage&quot; the round does but that also depends a lot on the target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
