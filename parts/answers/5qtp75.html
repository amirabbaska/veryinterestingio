		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He is most likely talking about the pause of Iraqi refugees in 2011. Trumps ban is basically Obama's but on steroids. In 2011 if you where a refugee or requesting asylum in the U.S while in Iraq you could apply but none of the info would be process for during a six month time period. This was brought on by 2 terrorist found in the united states that most likely came in as refugees.</p>
<p>Trumps ban pretty much restricts all non-u.s citizens coming from several middle eastern countries. The original order actually calls for the deportation of people coming from the specified countries that are in transit or already hold visas, however this was denied by several judges. Basically the key difference here is that during Obama's you couldn't get a visa to get into the states. during trumps it doesn't matter you just cant get in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember that happening because there was a connected story about an an interpreter who had helped the US in Iraq being killed because his visa application was delayed by the action.</p>
<p>Carter apparently did a similar thing during the Iran crisis. There are, apparently, similar precedences in history.</p>
<p>The obvious objectionable (it seems) difference is that these were enacted in response to specific incidences and somewhat limited in scope.
Trump's targets several countries and city states but excludes certain religious minorities . This gives it the definite quality of his fulfillment of tge &quot;Muslim ban&quot; promised in his campaign. </p>
<p>If it were backed up with a credible intelligence report on a specific threat it might go down easier. But as it is it's a pretty blatantly discriminatory fulfillment of divisive and fear mongering rhetoric and only part of a larger agenda. </p>
<p>So people who oppose that are reacting powerfully to try and nip it all in the bud... So to speak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's extremely different. The claim your buddy is making is one that is a Republican talking point voiced by Spicer this morning and also echoed by various republican operatives on the news today, which is why it seemed to erupt all at once from every Republican talking head and any supporter who watched the news at all on TV in the past day. There's really no truth to it, it was just designed as a response to basically blame Obama for the things that Trump has done, or else to make it seem like democrats are hypocrites for not protesting it then, but protesting it now. Here's why it's not a valid criticism but really more resembles propaganda and is a gross misrepresentation of what has happened:</p>
<p>Trump's executive order:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Bans entry to the US for people born in seven majority Muslim countries - Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - including holders of legal green cards and visas - for 90 days.</strong> It's almost unprecedented to ban people with green cards and other legal visas on a blanket basis with no cause against them, and against people who had <em>already</em> gone through the &quot;extreme vetting&quot; that Trump claims he wants to institute (but that is already being done). Obama did nothing remotely like this. No other president in living memory has done anything remotely like this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suspending the Syrian refugee plan indefinitely</strong> -- this is a humanitarian disaster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Suspending entire refugee plan for 120 days</strong> -- this is a humanitarian disaster</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Bans entry to the US for dual-nationality passport holders - meaning citizens of the above countries who also hold, for example, a British passport, are also banned for 90 days.</strong> Obama did nothing like this. What he did do was require people who meet these criteria to have to apply for a visa (rather than be automatically allowed into the US), but only if they had been to any of the listed countries in the last few years. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritize Christian refugees over Muslims</strong> -- this is very likely unconstitutional, as there's not supposed to be a religious test of this kind. And incidentally, Trump lied when he said that it was &quot;impossible&quot; to get a visa if  you were a Christian refugee from these countries, but if you were a Muslim, you could get a visa.  In fact, overall for these countries, a larger percentage of Christians got visas than Muslims. That is, Christians make up a tiny percentage of the population, but a larger percentage than that got visas. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He capped the refugee total to 50,000.</strong> This wasn't done by Obama</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>He did it out of the blue.</strong> Not done by Obama, as explained below.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Did it via executive order</strong>, with no consultation/input with other departments or experts, and without any (or almost no) warning to any agencies who handle these things, like Homeland Security. Bannon and Trump overruled things like having this not apply to people with green cards.</p>
</li>
<li>There's a smoking gun, in that <strong>Giuliani says that Trump asked him how to ban Muslims, but legally</strong>, so any denial that this is a Muslim ban, is clearly false. And a commission was assembled to figure out how to do that. This is distinct from a commission of experts figuring out how best to detect terrorists and keep them out as described below as having been done by Obama. The commission Giuliani described as having assembled for Trump was of lawyers to figure out how to ban Muslims in general, but legally.</li>
</ul>
<p>In contrast, Obama: </p>
<p>Paused approvals of refugee applications from Iraq for a period of six months after two Iraqi al-Qaeda terrorists were discovered living as refugees in Kentucky. So it was a very particular and narrow ban based on a hard evidence example, not a blanket ban and not targeted at Muslims in general with a specified preference for people of a certain religion. Also, it was done after careful consultation with the security experts in these matters to see how best to screen people to find potential terrorists. Trump banned all refugees for a certain period of time and severely limited the number we'd take in. This is quite cruel as a huge number of refugees have been created recently.</p>
<p>Another thing Obama did was put several countries on the list of countries that wouldn't get automatic visa waivers. That is, suppose you're from Japan and you want to go to the USA for a visit. You can just come--get on the plane with your passport, land in the US, get the passport stamped, done. It's easy, as a courtesy for two countries that trust each other and have friendly relations. You don't need to go to the US embassy in Tokyo and fill out an application and send in your passport and money and then get a stamp that allows you one entry and one exit to the US during a particular time period and for a certain number of days.  But with some other countries, you do need to go to the embassy and fill out a form, etc., for a tourist visa (you have to fill out forms and apply for almost all countries if you want a non-tourist visa to work or something). And Americans need to do that when in turn going to those other countries. So Obama put a few countries, responding to events occurring at that time, on a list of the many countries where they don't get the easy way to get a visa--they have to apply at the embassy, etc. Not <em>everybody</em> from those countries (Somalia, Libya, Iran, Iraq, Syria, Sudan, and Yemen, but just people who have passports from those countries and have visited those countries <em>recently</em>. </p>
<p>The concern is that terrorists living in, say, Britain, might get radicalized on-line and then visit those countries or a few other countries we are watching, and take terrorist training camps and make plans with enemy groups for terrorist activities. So people with those specific characteristics need extra vetting by our security forces to make sure they're not going to be a problem. </p>
<p>But newborn babies and 5 year old kids and disabled 85 year old women in wheelchairs who have lived in the US for decades and doctors who have lived in the US for decades didn't end up, with Obama's action, getting trapped at the airport without food or water for many hours, not allowed to see a lawyer or, in the case of the 5 year old, alone and not allowed to see a parent or guardian. Nor did anyone have green cards confiscated. That's what happened with Trump's plan. And Obama's thing wasn't an executive order--it was in a much larger bill proposed by congress and signed by Obama. So there are numerous very specific and very nasty reasons why Trump's Executive Order is a nightmarish abuse of power, unconstitutional, as well as cruel, and none of those reasons apply to Obama's actions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The executive order issued by Trump places a ban on entry and applies to ALL foreign nationals [edit: of the named countries].  That includes Green card holders, people with valid travel and student visas, people who have already been confirmed to qualify for asylum working through qualified refugee resettlement programs, minor children and orphans, doctors working in US hospitals, spouses and parents of US citizens.</p>
<p>Not only does this violate US immigration law in and of itself, it effectively imprisons noncitizens [edit: from those nations] currently in the country on valid visas.  If they leave, they do not know if they can return. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
