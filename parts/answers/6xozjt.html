		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of he biggest killer of plants is over watering. (Yes, a lot of people pay too much attention to the plant and kill it)</p>
<p>When indoors you're completely changing a plants environment. There is so much that can affect a plant in how it - takes up nutrients, water and light. </p>
<p>When you have a plant that in its native habitat gets a lot of light and a lot of warmth and you have it indoors with considerably lower light and temperature (when bought young they are more likely to adjust without going into shock) it is going to have to adjust to those conditions meaning - since it has less light it will need less water and less nutrients, the plant is not using all its resources up like it would so it doesn't need to &quot;re-up&quot; because it really hasn't lost much. </p>
<p>So even though it uses less there are many factors that affect the soil- AC will dry out a well ventilated area rather quickly depending on the pot type. Also many plants indoors lack humidity they'd have in their native range. </p>
<p>Having a larger pot for small roots is bad because it will not dry out as evenly, the top will become more dry while it could still be sopping wet at the bottom. Seeing that you go and water the plant again when it doesn't need it and the plant becomes water logged, suffocates and dies.  </p>
<p>The killing of indoor plants by overwatering is #1 most common, especially since when you bring a plant home, unless you have the same environment as the place you got it from in your home, it is going to go through some shock, many people don't know this and see their plant a little sad after they just got it and then panic and water the plant. </p>
<p>Plants need time to adapt. You can't just keep changing things and expect to see results in a day or two. Often times even if they look a little sad it's best to leave them be, especially if they have enough water, light and humidity. They need time. </p>
<p>Starting small when buying a plant in general is much better practice, for so many reasons. Just don't put it in a huge pot :)</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, didn't think this would get this big lol Thanks so much for such interest in plants and horticulture! </p>
<p>To be clear I was mostly talking about house plants in this, since they are a plant that is usually not of the climate where you live and is why they're a house plant because the can't live outside. (But not always- in FL many &quot;house plants&quot; can do better outside, depending on the plant still) </p>
<p>Doing my best to answer questions- you guys are lucky I'm sick and aren't busy outside :P</p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/VXypP" target="_blank">Here</a> are a couple pages from one of the best houseplant books I've seen and had. There is helpful info that can be used for other plant types as well. You can get the book off <a href="https://www.amazon.com/House-Plant-Expert-D-G-Hessayon/dp/0903505355#immersive-view_1504415707650" target="_blank">Amazon</a>, its rather inexpensive and 100% worth it.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Forgot to stress the fact that many of our tap water had loads of chlorine and chloramine in it. The chlorine can evaporate out if the water is left out before use but the chloramine will not.  These are things that can really affect a plant over time. Along with mineral build up from water and fertilizer. <a href="https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/watering-and-soluble-salts-houseplants" target="_blank">Here's</a> another good resource.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a confined space, like a properly sized pot, nutrients and fluids are easily accessible by roots.</p>
<p>In a less confined space, the roots may have to work harder to reach the moist soil and fertilizer, depending on the distribution.</p>
<p>Plants out in the wild are quite different.</p>
<p>There's a few different ways plants reproduce.  Some &quot;pup&quot;.  Pups are children that grown directly off the parents and eventually develop their own root system. </p>
<p>In such an instance, the parent provides nutrients until the plant can fend for itself.</p>
<p>Another reproduction method is through seeds.  Seeds won't germinate and grow if conditions aren't favorable.  In other words, when you see seeded plants in the wild, you're only seeing the survivors who were in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>Also worth considering: depending on where in the world you live, wild plants don't really have unlimited soil.  The truth is, the healthiest, most nutrient rich growing medium only covers the first couple of inches of soil.  Leaves, detritus, and other organic decompositions all provide the sustainability plants need.  All this good stuff is created at or juuuuust below the surface.  That means there's a trickle-down effect but the further down you go, the less nutrients are available.  </p>
<p>So, relatively speaking, wild &quot;pots&quot; are only 4 inches deep, not unlimitedly deep.  Due to competition between other nearby plants all fighting for the same nutrients, that pot is only inches wide as well, and not endlessly​ open space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have read through many of the replies but have not come across one that hit on a key element of your question.  There are variables involved, relative to your question.  Different types of plants require different care and will do best with specific mediums (soil mix).  Some species of plants are water hogs (such as Spathiphyllum/Peace Lily) and some don’t care how much water they receive (such as Sansevieria/Mother-in-laws Tongue).  My Professor from the University of Illinois had said that each of us could grow plants on rocks as long as the conditions were correct.  Meaning proper light, nutrients, temperature and air were at a level for the requirement of that particular plant.  Thus it is very important to choose the correct potting mix for your plant.</p>
<p>I used to be a Florist, Grower and Interiorscaper.  In fact I was one of the pioneers to help develop the Interiorscape industry.  The most challenging was putting live plants into malls, restaurants and office spaces and is probably the most relevant to your question.  I was always battling those who would pour drinks (coffee and soda) into the plants like it was a sink drain.  My way around this was to put a cone shaped piece of waxed cardboard around the plant and covered it with mulch material.  Then when a person was pouring a drink into the pot it would run over the cone and down into the outer decorative container.  This worked very well to help control the liquids that were entering the medium.  </p>
<p>As for container size, it generally does not matter to the plant as long as it is not over watered and moving to a very large pot, increase the likelihood that a homeowner would make the mistake of watering the plant.  By continuing to water at the same frequency with a higher quantity of water (to compensate for the larger pot) would almost guarantee that the plant will develop wet feet.     However, some species of plants will not flower or take-off (start to grow) until the roots have taken an abrupt turn in the medium such as growing out and making contact with inner sidewalls of the growing container.  The main reason for using smaller containers within a growing operation (greenhouse) is cost per square foot.  As a plant progresses to its salable size the plants are bumped up in pot sizes based on the determination of the Head Grower.  Having plants in containers that are relative to their size also helps the grower to have much more control over the crop.  They can easily vary moisture, adjust nutrient or micro-nutrients levels or if levels go too high, it is much easier to leach the medium when dealing with smaller pot sizes.  When plants are placed into a home or interiorscape situation.  The medium volume is important so that the plant is easiest to care for.  Larger pots will help a plant grow larger as usually determined by what is called “Root-to-Shoot Ratio”.  </p>
<p>I have found that bottom watering really helps in the Ineriorscape industry as plants are typically cared for and watered once per week in most cases.  Bottom watering is a whole different subject as a micro climate is created within the growing medium.  Many plants do very well with bottom watering but require a lot of work to set-up right  The medium in the container is generally layered with different mixes to properly achieve this type of micro climate that the plant will adapt to.  The setup works incredibly well for plants in low light areas and when plants are located in breezy places. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
