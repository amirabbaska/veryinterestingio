		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excellent Minutephysics video explaining exactly this. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxJ4M7tyLRE" target="_blank">Why is the sky dark at night?</a>   </p>
<p>Summary:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Universe had a beginning so there aren't necessarily stars in every direction</li>
<li>Some of the far away stars light hasn't reached us yet</li>
<li>The really far away stars light is red-shifted towards infrared (not visible to the naked eye) because of the expansion of the universe. </li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: To add in some points from the comments.  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Yes some of the light from distant stars is blocked by dust and other objects in the way. The dust tends to absorb visible wavelengths and re-emit in the IR range which we can’t see but that wasn’t in the video so I didn’t include it in my summary.   </p>
</li>
<li>Inverse-square law for light intensity. Intensity reduces massively over interstellar distances but that doesn’t really help answer the question because every star does this. Multiplied by an infinite number of stars in every direction, suddenly that tiny bit of light from each star adds up and the night sky should be far brighter than it is. For why it isn’t, I refer you back to the video and my original 3 points.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The existing top comment correctly realises the OP is asking an age old question, that of Olber's paradox. The top comment though goes on to make some mistakes, the first is the solution of the paradox and the second is crossing the CMBR with the paradox which are not related.</p>
<p>The paradox is: If the universe is infinite then in every direction there must be a star. In such a scenario the whole sky would be a uniform brightness, the same brightness as the surface of a star in fact.</p>
<p>The paradox was first resolved long before we knew about the expansion of space, with a finite speed of light and a finite life time for stars there is only so much of the universe that each star can be illuminating at once. Imagine a shell that has a thickness equal to a stars lifetime propagating through the universe at c.</p>
<p>We later learned that not only would an infinite universe not be bright that our universe is not infinite, there is a observation horizon due to it's expansion and a start point 13.7bn years ago. This defeats the entire premise of the paradox where every single line of sight direction intersects with a star.</p>
<p>While you can explain the lack of light from distant stars as being due to redshift, it is answering a question already answered and is being a bit dishonest anyway since, you are going to be caught out in several other aspects of the more classical solution on your way to a more complicated unnecessary solution. For example, if you were to work out the average redshift of each unit solid angle in the sky you would find the sky would be much brighter than it is, and much MUCH brighter than the 2.7K you rattled off.</p>
<p>This 2.7K is where the mistake really lies is in equating the redshift from distant stars to the CMBR. The CMBR was not emitted by stars (which are the subject of the OP and Olber's paradox) but by a global distribution of hot gas circa 380,000 years after the big bang. </p>
<p>The biggest difference here is that the CMBR was in every direction, unlike stellar light which is only where a star is, it was also initially much cooler (&lt;3000K) and importantly this was emitted long before - and therefore much more heavily redshifted - than the light from even the earliest, most distant stars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a video with a great explanation of both the parodox and the answer.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/yQz0VgMNGPQ" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/yQz0VgMNGPQ</a> </p>
<p>The paradox is basically.</p>
<p>1) If the universe is infinite then no matter where you look eventually you will directly see a star.</p>
<p>2) If every point in the night sky directly leads to a star then the entire sky will be as bright as all those stars. </p>
<p>I've seen a lot of responses about light dropping off in intensity based on distance however you have an infinite number of stars so it doesn't really matter how little light each star provides.</p>
<p>The correct answer to this parodox is that the universe is not infinitely old. So light from stars far away from us hasn't had time to reach us.</p>
<p>The expansion of the universe will prevent us from ever having a sky as bright as the sun because most stars will always be too far away for the light to reach us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Incredibly sad to see that no one has provided the correct answer. While it is true that the red shift from the expansion of the Universe does play a role, it's a minor one, at least at this point in time, and the inverse square law is entirely irrelevant as the amount of stars at some distance grows with the square of that distance, which cancels out the inverse square law of the intensity of the emitted light.</p>
<p>EDIT: For the CMB the expansion of the Universe is the key factor for not lighting up our sky and in that regard /u/Surprisedpotato's answer is correct , but not when it comes to star light as in OP's question.</p>
<p>The real answer to your specific question is time. The Universe has a beginning, a birth. The Big Bang happened a finite time ago so light from distant stars have only had a limited amount of time to travel, which means that light from the furthest reaches of space haven't had time to reach us. And most of the light emitted from the far reaches of space will never reach us, because of the expansion of the Universe, which is why that does play a role but that role will be a bigger, more important one, later on in time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question you are asking is famously known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olbers%27_paradox" target="_blank">Olbers' Paradox</a></p>
<p>The main to arguments given are due to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Doppler effect, the further a galaxy is away from us, the fast it travels away from us, thus the light shifts into the infrared spectrum in our perspective which is not visible to the human eye.</p>
</li>
<li>Light from stars that are very far away has not reached us yet.</li>
