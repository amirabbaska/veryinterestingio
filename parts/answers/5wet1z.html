<ul>
<li><a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2410/2" target="_blank">Collards</a></li>
<li><a href="http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/vegetables-and-vegetable-products/2461/2" target="_blank">Kale</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Those are both for 1 cup of chopped, raw product, but the kale is heavier, so take that into consideration. But it's easy to see that, for example, the ratios of calories from carbs, proteins, and fats are significantly different between the two. The differences go beyond just that, but it's an immediately noticeable difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
