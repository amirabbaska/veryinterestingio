		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple ELI5 Answer. </p>
<p>Suppose I have a box of Lego, and my son wants to make a Death Star with them.</p>
<p>The box of Lego is the game's contents saved in a hard disk (HDD), the process of making a Death Star is the gameplay content that will be visible to the player (my son) at the time.</p>
<p>Now I have 2 ways to do this: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Either I take all of the neccessary pieces out at the beginning, and let my son make a Death Star with them</p>
</li>
<li>Or I just take out each piece when my son's working on that particular part.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first method require my son to wait a long period of time while I prepare; while the second method require my son to wait a little bit each time he needs a new piece. After some tries I find out that the second method create hiccups during my son's gameplay, during which he has to stop playing and wait for the next piece to come, and soon he loses interest in the Death Star and give up. Finding my son's interest in making the Death Star vital for the glory of the Empire, I decided to go with method 1.</p>
<p>But then I faced yet another problem: after requesting the construction of the Death Star my son only see me run away somewhere without saying anything. He's confused, wondering why I'm away for so long. Did I not hear his request? Or am I too busy to serve the Empire? Maybe I just forgot about him completely?</p>
<p>I forgot to tell him what I was going to do. So I run back, telling him I'm getting the pieces and will be right back in a couple of minutes, and turn on a distracting cartoon for him to watch while I'm away. That, is the load screen.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The computer moves needed data from its hard drive to RAM.</p>
<p>When doing all the calculations needed to play games, the processor needs fast access to all the data necessary to do what it does, in this case, play the game. A typical hard drive is way to slow for this, it needs the data fast. So we came up with the idea of Random Access Memory, or RAM, which acts as super super fast memory that stores data needed for running programs.</p>
<p>But the data needs to get into the RAM in the first place, and this is why loading happens. Hard drives are once again, slow. </p>
<p>That being said, if you use a Solid State Drive, which is just a faster type of permanent storage, your load times will be significantly reduced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h2>Edit: Sorry, this comment became a little bit huge. </h2>
<p>All those points that were covered here are valid and correct, but its not the complete truth that applies always. I'm myself in the game development industry, so i have quite some insight into those things.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Different types of games, different approaches. generally, the quality of assets (graphics, sounds, etc) and the size of the level affect the amount that needs to be loaded, your computer hardware defines the amount of time it takes to load those assets. Also, the higher the quality of the game is, the higher usually the base requirements of the engine are, i am currently working on a AAA game where the engine (unreal engine 4) alone is of quite some size and needs to be loaded too, before even starting up the whole game.</p>
<hr />
<p>Long form: Lets take some different types of games into account.</p>
<p>A) Most simple, low requirements offline games, think of them a little bit like those old text adventures that we had in the beginning of computer games</p>
<p>basically no loading times.</p>
<p>B) Still offline, but more advanced games, for example fancy textures, procedural generation, etc etc. (think of some basic offline mobile game, although that might not be so much the case because most are actually driven by very advanced game engines. how expensive they are computationally differs extremely)</p>
<p>loading times range between loading-everything-when-i-start-the-game (which might take multiple seconds, because all those graphics and assets need to be copied into RAM) and i-load-bit-by-bit-when-i-need-it where you can come up with some fancy animation or some ad popup while loading the next level, you have lots of loading steps which take very short time (like, half a second or less).</p>
<p>C) offline open world games (think of the newest legend of zelda for example)</p>
<p>the reason why i chose to seperate open world games is that they need to be handled substantially differently than &quot;normal&quot; games. the ability for the player to run around <em>anywhere</em> in a huge level makes it often impossible to load up all the stuff when the game starts, not only because of long wait times, but also because of limited amounts of RAM (besides, always calculating everything for the entire world is a hell lot of overkill)</p>
<p>when developing open world games, you usally seperate the world in smaller pieces (called chunks). when you start up the game, you load the initial chunk where you spawn, and as the player moves around the game loads the chunks that the player is just about to enter and unloads those he leaves (this is called level streaming because you basically stream the level from the hard disk to the ram and have constant hard disk accesses, as it is needed). in this case you try to have rather short loading times (like one second) and if it is one predefined map you can also load it up while the player is still in the main menu.</p>
<p>D) Offline open world games with procedural map generation (think of an offline minecraft game)</p>
<p>when you create the map, you need to wait several seconds because the computer is generating the world (or, to be more precise, the initial chunk(s) (in minecraft a chunk is 16x16 wide, so you usually see many chunnks)) when you then load this map, you load the initial chunk(s) from disk as point C). the tricky part is now, when you explore beyond what is already generated. then, your computer doesnt have to load up the world from the disk into ram, but rather generate it on the fly in ram (which is way more expensive) AND write it to disk (well, you dont visually see the writing to disk, but that usually takes longer than reading from the disk). that is the reason, why if you are running minecraft on a low spec computer and explore further and further sometimes you see chunks of blocks appear in the distance seconds after they should be visible. the computer first needs to generate them</p>
<hr />
<p>That was the group of offline games. when it comes to online games, things are more complicated</p>
<hr />
<p>E) Online games that use level streaming. (an online minecraft game)</p>
<p>here the term &quot;level streaming&quot; is way better than if you are just offline. the server has the complete map and actually streams it (in minecraft every block) to the client as the client moves around. here also the server handles world generation. loading times mostly differ based on your and the server's internet connection as well as the server's general hardware specification (the server need to have <em>all</em> the chunks from every player in memory, not just those from one player like the client). i've also seen games where the initial connecting-to-server process includes downloading the (whole) map (smaller size maps) and afterwards you only send &quot;block updates&quot; so if a block is destroyed or has changed.</p>
<p>F) Online games that dont use level streaming (all the ordinary shooters and online games, Counter Strike, Call of Duty, Battlefield, just to name a few)</p>
<p>Here you usually have a combination: because you are connecting to a server, you cannot know the map in advance like in point C) but only know it in the moment when you join the server. additionally, you have the whole process of server connecting, handshaking, authentication, anti cheat systems, etc (all that usually works in the background while you see a &quot;connecting to server&quot; or &quot;loading&quot; screen), usually only after that the actual map is loaded. so connecting to a server might take a second, then loading the map usually takes a few more seconds.</p>
<p>G) Online games that use some mix between not level streaming and level streaming (a stateful world; prominent example: Ark: Survival Evolved)</p>
<p>First, you have to establish a connection to the server (~1 second). next, you get the info which map to load and do that (ark is open world, so you have level streaming from the disk; multiple seconds). and then, you also need to stream the state of the world: structures players placed, houses they built, positions of players, positions of NPCs, which trees are already cut down, which arent, etc etc etc. basically a subset of all the changes you need to do to transform the &quot;base map&quot; you have on the disk to the current state. </p>
<p>H) Game engine loading times</p>
<p>this usually happens before anything that you as developer can control happens, so either before you see <em>anything</em> or while you still see a black screen. depending on the game engine this takes a few seconds too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Games are like IKEA furniture.  </p>
<p>When a game developer makes a game, they make it in its complete state. Likewise, when a piece of IKEA furniture is designed, it's designed and tested in it's completed state.  </p>
<p>Then, like a game developer, IKEA furniture manufacturers have to figure out the best way to deliver that furniture to you.  </p>
<p>So, a game developer will take their game and break it up into pieces and compress it down into a tightly wrapped up package. Sometimes this is in the form of .ZIP files, sometimes it's in .JAR files (such as Minecraft), and sometimes it's in some unique, proprietary file type that was created by the developers themselves. No matter the file type, the goal is always the same - to break down the game into smaller, compressed pieces.  </p>
<p>Let's say you buy this game, or, in our analogy, a piece of IKEA furniture. You know what it should look like. You know what it's supposed to do. But when you buy it, it's in broken down pieces and in a compressed package. It's easy to store on the IKEA shelves, or in the game's case, on your hard drive. It's relatively small (compared to how big it would be if fully assembled - so those 50GB games would be MUCH bigger if uncompressed).  </p>
<p>Thankfully IKEA furniture comes with instructions. Games come with instructions on how to assemble the pieces. (The game engine)  </p>
<p>In the case of IKEA furniture, <em>you</em> are the CPU, and your living room floor is your RAM. You take pieces out of the box, load them into your RAM, then using the included instructions, you assemble the pieces into the final product.  </p>
<p>Large games (like Skyrim) are more like an entire IKEA store/warehouse, and you only load necessary pieces to furnish your living room (or one area of one level/stage/city/etc in your game), because there's no way your house (your RAM/HDD) can hold an entire IKEA store's (game's) worth of assembled furniture (uncompressed, fully loaded data)  </p>
<p>Loading takes time, just like it takes you time to read the instructions and put the furniture together. The better tools you have and the more people helping you (the better your CPU/RAM), the faster it is to load.  </p>
<p>Regarding HDDs vs SSDs:  </p>
<p>A HDD is like an IKEA warehouse full of manual laborers. Lots of moving parts. Prone to errors, and sometimes the workers are lazy and slow.  </p>
<p>A SSD is like an Amazon warehouse. Fully automated, using robots, super quick and efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
