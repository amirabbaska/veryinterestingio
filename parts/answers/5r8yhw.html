		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two areas of thought that apply.  The first is for the enlisted and the second is for officers.</p>
<p>While there is a common duty to disobey orders that are &quot;illegal, immoral, or unethical&quot;, a further duty to steward and lead dissent is implied in the officer's oath versus the enlisted oath.</p>
<p>The enlisted oath expressly states that the enlisted will &quot;follow the orders of the President of the United States and the officers appointed over me&quot;.  The officer oath has no such passage.  Instead, officers are charged to &quot;protect and defend the Constitution of the United States, against all enemies, foreign and domestic&quot;.  The latter oath is more akin to that taken by a federal office holder (cabinet member, Congressman, President, etc.).  This is further compounded by the fact that the officer oath contains the phrase, &quot;of the office about which I am about to enter&quot;.</p>
<p>That is, officers should hold Constitutional values above all else in their duties.  While enlisted should do the same, the big picture may not always be evident to them.  They are not charged to think second and third order effects of being told to, for example, mow the grass.  If that act itself is legal, moral, and ethical, they must comply.  Officers, by a reasonable measure, may decline to do so and decline for members under their command to do so if it can be reasonably defended that the act or operation as a whole is somehow of detriment to the Constitution.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: The President is just another dude who is responsible for defending the Constitution and serving the nation.  An important guy, but just a guy.  He is fallible and susceptible to the flaws of man.  Therefore, everyone swears fealty not to a man, but to the Constitution, the base document of our nation and ideals.  That way you would not break an oath if the President went crazy.  But you better be damn sure he went crazy before you disobeyed.  </p>
<p>Source: was a military officer and studied Constitutional law.</p>
<p>EDIT: It's been a while since I reenlisted a service member but I should have remembered that there is a part about supporting and defending the Constitution in the enlisted oath.  Rather the part about obeying orders is OMITTED from the officer's oath.  Obviously everyone should support and defend the Constitution.  The basic premise above, however, is the same.  The omission defaults an officer's charge to think critically about the larger picture.  Thanks to those in the comments that reminded me.</p>
<p>EDIT the second: In my opinion, no, there is no provision to overthrow the government or President based on an order that may be unlawful, unethical, or immoral.  You would be committing treason at that point.  There is a proper way to dissent -- through inaction if it doesn't pass the legal, ethical, and moral test.</p>
<p>EDIT the third: Thanks for the gold!</p>
<p>EDIT the fourth: KesselZero's comment below is a more succinct answer to the actual question at hand.  Basically, our Constitutional system of government has several redundant mechanisms to prevent a rouge (rogue) President.  </p>
<p>EDIT the fifth: I'm keeping my typo, dammit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, military commanders are supposed to disobey an order that is unconstitutional: no need for a coup.</p>
<p>In theory. Of course, if said commanders back the President anyway, that won't make any difference -- and it's not as if there's anyone else in a position to stop the military. This is the problem with a standing army, one which the US, in its early history, actively tried to avoid (hence the Second Amendment, which speaks of the need for a &quot;well-regulated militia&quot;). You should probably cross your fingers and hope we never have to find out.</p>
<p>Suppose the President suddenly announces that all presidential elections are cancelled, and that he is President for life. A blatantly illegal and unconstitutional act. What could happen?</p>
<p>Well, if things work correctly, either Congress or the Supreme Court, or both, will put a stop to that. For example, Congress could impeach the President -- effectively putting him on trial, and if found guilty, removing him from office. But what if things go really, horribly wrong. Perhaps Congress refuses to impeach. Maybe the President and those around him have been using personal and direct threats against Congressmen and their families (Hitler did something similar to ensure his rise to the top). For whatever reason, that mechanism has broken down, and those few brave souls who dare speak out are silenced, perhaps arrested or simply dismissed. Can the military stage a coup?</p>
<p>To be honest, if things have got to that stage, then the rule of law has irretrievably broken down anyhow: doing nothing at all would simply allow the totalitarian dictatorship to establish itself. And I would imagine an awful lot of civil unrest, as civilians opposed to the President protest and are met with those sympathetic to him, and that might be serious enough for the military to impose martial law, simply to restore some kind of order.</p>
<p>But here we're talking about a military coup, and military coups are not often good news. If you're lucky, a military coup might succeed in removing the dictatorship, and returning the country to civilian rule as quickly and painlessly as possible. If you're unlucky, a military coup simply replaces a civilian dictatorship with a military dictatorship.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the Constitution is set up to protect the peaceful transfer of power. Basically, the only way the government should ever change hands is through different candidates winning elections.</p>
<p>So while the armed forces swear to the Constitution, not the president, the Constitution itself includes a couple of methods (impeachment and the 25th amendment) by which a bad, crazy, sick etc. president can be removed and replaced. Ideally this would remove the need for the army to overthrow the president, because the other parts of our government (legislature and judiciary) could handle it. The problem with the armed forces doing it is that a.) it's not a peaceful transfer of power, and b.) the armed forces are now in charge of the government, which is bad.</p>
<p>Having the military swear to the Constitution also serves another purpose, which is to separate them from the president, even though he's the commander in chief. One important move that Hitler made when he came to power was to have the military stop pledging to serve Germany and start pledging to him personally. His hope was that their loyalty to him would lead them to follow his orders even if they were harmful to the nation or its citizens.</p>
<p>This fear goes back at least as far as ancient Rome, when (for example) Julius Caesar was able to become <del>emperor</del> dictator because he had a large army of soldiers who were loyal to him personally, rather than to the Roman Republic. </p>
<p><em>Edit:</em> Thank you for the gold! And thanks to those who are correcting and refining my history. This was all off the top of my head so there were bound to be mistakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people who have never served in the armed forces (the vast majority of the present population of adult Americans) have no idea how strongly our veterans feel about the oath of enlistment or oath of commission that they took when the joined our armed forces.</p>
<p>I am 66 years old.  When I was a boy, virtually all adult men were veterans of WWII or the Korean War.  Those veterans all shared a common military experience.  They were patriotic, and they expected certain behavior and attitudes out of other adults.  With the upheavals associated with the Vietnam War, and the cessation of the Draft in 1972, this is no longer the case.  Most adults today do not consider our armed forces to be &quot;part and parcel&quot; of the civilian population, and have never served as a soldier.  They do not understand, because they never experienced military boot camp and training, that our servicemen and servicewomen are taught that they are to <em>defend the Constitution.</em>  Most of us cannot imagine a situation where a tyrant might attempt to seize control of the United States.  Conditioned by a recent history of presidents who attempt to do as they please through Executive Orders, many people believe the power of the president is not checked by Congress or the Supreme Court.  This is not the case, and don't think for a second that the men and women of our armed forces are not acutely aware of this fact.  As a young Marine sergeant, I saw teen-aged Marines outraged and offended when they believed General Haig (the Secretary of State at that time) was trying to take control of the government when President Ronald Reagan was shot.  They were shouting, &quot;He's not next in the line of succession!  It's the VICE-PRESIDENT!&quot;  Haig later apologized, but as a general officer and the <em>Secretary of State,</em> for pete's sake, he should have known better.</p>
<p>This little story is <em>exactly</em> why we need to continue to teach Civics and Government in high school.</p>
<p>Americans should trust their armed forces more.  Soldiers are CITIZENS, not robots.  In my opinion, the Republic is in no danger from its armed forces.  (Plus, the civilian population is armed to the teeth with 300 million firearms.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit for ELI5: Dad tells you to fight the school bully who picks on little girls at recess, you do it because mommy and daddy have taught you right from wrong. then...</p>
<p>Dad tells you to attack the neighbors friendly cat but you refuse because you know the cat didn't do anything to deserve that. Hes still your dad and you can't do anything about that but you can refuse to physically commit harm to another innocent being.</p>
<p>As a former service member with a conscience, I would not follow an order if I thought it would be against my moral compass. We had discussions about how we would react if ordered to act against our own counties people and 10/10 people I spoke with would not entertain the thought of helping with a strike against civilians. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
