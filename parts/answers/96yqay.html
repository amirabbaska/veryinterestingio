		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many, many people were exposed to radioactive contamination as a result of these tests. The US government has a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/civil/common/reca" target="_blank">compensation program</a> that has paid out over $2 billion to residents of nearby areas. However, nuclear tests cannot make entire regions uninhabitable. People live at the center of Hiroshima and Nagasaki today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Strictly you can walk around at any of the above ground detonation sites today and suffer no real or obvious ill effects.  You'll get a slight dose but no worse than flying over the poles or living in Telluride (12K feet).</p>
<p>Most fallout has relatively short half-life and that is also the most intense radiologically.  So the greatest risk is short-lived - after 3-6 months, the radiation dose from high radiation sources is 1% of peak; and within 2 years it's a a tiny fraction of that.</p>
<p>Longer half-life materials last longer but have far lower radiation dose so are low risk anyway.  The long half-life sources come to dominate within a few years but are nearly at a background dose rate.</p>
<p>On top of all of this, there is still weather including rain, snow and wind even in the Nevada desert so what was left on top of the soil has long ago been washed away and diluted to low concentrations.  That further reduces any direct risk.</p>
<p>This is why you can walk on the detonation sites.  How do I <strong>really, really</strong> know?  I've been to these sites - I used to hold a Q-clearance and participated in &quot;UGTs for radiation effects on electronics&quot; back when testing was still being done.  Wore a film badge and all that.  Total radiological dose reports listed nearly zero dose from my visits.  I still have the paperwork for it.</p>
<p>In general, there's a lot of misinformation about radiation.  People are still stupid enough to confuse non-ionizing cell phones with ionizing gamma rays.  It's almost like we no longer teach science in schools!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We did experience it. In fact a group of people got together, mostly Citizens of Utah who lived down wind of the tests. In fact they became known as the &quot;Down Winders&quot;. They sued the Federal Government, but they lost. Apparently unable to prove their case, even though the increased cancer rates of the Down Winders was well documented.</p>

<p>As I was searching for this link, it appears the US is paying people who are down winders that have cancer.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The majority of fallout comes from a ground burst, yet most nuclear blasts are air bursts to maximize damage.</p>
<p>&quot;The air burst is usually 100 to 1,000 m (330 to 3,280 ft) above the hypocenter to allow the shockwave of the fission or fusion driven explosion to bounce off the ground and back into itself, creating a shockwave that is more forceful than one from a detonation at ground level. This &quot;mach stem&quot; only occurs near ground level, and is similar in shape to the letter Y when viewed from the side. Airbursting also minimizes fallout by keeping the fireball from touching the ground, limiting the amount of debris that is vaporized and drawn up in the radioactive debris cloud.&quot;</p>
<p>Examples on Nukemap</p>
<p>100 kt air burst at the Sedan crater - <a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=100&lat=37.176944&lng=-116.0461112&hob_psi=5&hob_ft=4755&fallout=1&ff=50&fallout_angle=252&psi=20,5,1&zm=10" target="_blank">https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=100&lat=37.176944&lng=-116.0461112&hob_psi=5&hob_ft=4755&fallout=1&ff=50&fallout_angle=252&psi=20,5,1&zm=10</a></p>
<p>No fallout pattern</p>
<p>100 kt ground burst at Sedan crater - <a href="https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=100&lat=37.176944&lng=-116.0461112&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&fallout=1&ff=50&fallout_angle=252&psi=20,5,1&zm=9" target="_blank">https://nuclearsecrecy.com/nukemap/?&kt=100&lat=37.176944&lng=-116.0461112&airburst=0&hob_ft=0&fallout=1&ff=50&fallout_angle=252&psi=20,5,1&zm=9</a></p>
<p>Long fallout pattern</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_Crater" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedan_Crater</a> - the crater was created with a 104 kt device by Operation Storax Sedan shot</p>
<p>&quot;The explosion created fallout that affected more US residents than any other nuclear test, exposing more than 13 million people to radiation. Within 7 months of the excavation, the bottom of the crater could be safely walked upon with no protective clothing and photographs were taken&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a happy note, Akiko Takakura was in reinforced concrete building that was 300 meters from ground zero and sustained only minor injuries from the 16k bomb at Hiroshima.  She was 88 in 2014 and was 20 when it happened.  Drank the black rain and everything.  Had children and raised a family.</p>
