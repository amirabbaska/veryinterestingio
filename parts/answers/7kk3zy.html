<p>When is something we can measure. Studies in children show that by 48 months, almost all start to display a firm preference for one-handed or one-sided activities. Under 18 months we all just sorta picked different hands to do things more randomly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I'm left eye dominant which means I <em>should</em> be left handed. </p>
<p>But since my grandmother &quot;encouraged&quot; me by smacking my left hand anytime I tried to use it to not be lefty I am right handed.</p>
<p>To be fair my grandmother is very old and where she grew up left handedness is a sign of the devil so that's what prompted her to change me. Superstition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a book titled &quot;Right Hand, Left Hand&quot; by Chris McManus which goes into some theories involving the development of handedness. Tl;dr - the body is inherently asymmetric (your heart is on your left side except in very rare cases). In most humans, dominance develops on the same (right) side relative to the body axis. This is under genetic influence (let's call the gene X). Some individuals have a variant of gene X, where the dominant side develops <em>randomly</em> relative to the body. These people may be right- or left-handed. McManus goes into molecular theories as to how  this may work, which I don't find terribly convincing.</p>
<p>There is also some academic literature on hair whorls in relation to handedness. Most right-handed people with a single hair whorl on their heads have the whorl going clockwise. People who are not right-handed have a much higher incidence of anti-clockwise whorls. The authors speculate that the genes controlling hairl whorl direction and handedness are linked:</p>

<p>I also did a little self-experiment. I was born right-handed. At the start of this year, I started writing and doing all other tasks exclusively with my left hand as if I were left-handed. This includes eating and manipulating objects (ATMs etc). I can write very neatly at normal speeds with my left hand now, such that nobody can really tell the difference between my left- and right-hand script. However, I find maximum writing speed to be the limiting factor. My left just cannot write as fast as my right. I'm not sure if this will eventually go away with more training.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer the last question you asked, yes it can be changed with outside influences. Even after you have been right or left side dominant for years. The problem is that it's hard. Like near impossible hard.</p>
<p>Let's say you are right handed, and want to become left handed. You have built up so much of a habit of using your right hand for all one handed tasks that your brain doesn't even think about which hand you should use when you do something, it just automatically starts with your right hand. Now of course there are tasks that some people do with their left hand when they are right handed for everything else, but for the most part that's more of a sign that right or left side dominance isn't unchangeable. You just need practice. If you learn a new thing you've never done before, like pitch a baseball, and you start with your left hand, after a while every time you pitch a baseball you will do so with your left hand without thinking about it. The reason why it's hard to become left handed instead of right in this example is that you have had years of conditioning your body to do all of these actions with your right hand, so to become left handed, you not only have to use your left hand for everything one handed that you learn in the future but also have to overwrite years of practice of the things you already know how to do with your right hand. While doable in theory, it's next to impossible in practice if you're not very young or slightly ambidextrous since young.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
