		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Why doesn't everyone do this if they're more efficient?&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I work in Automotive Climate Control. Cost and reliability are the biggest drivers in the auto industry and this sounds like something that wouldn't make a large system wide difference, but would add headaches in terms of things like reliability and system complexity. The turboexpander would have to be able to handle two-phase flow and remain operable for the lifetime of the vehicle. Also the cost for this component is going to go up when you consider that it will have many more parts, and have many more manufacturing steps and engineering tests done on it.</p>
<p>Space is also valued highly, having to find more room for the turboexpander where it could usefully extract work and be connected to the refrigerant transport lines might not currently be feasible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Phase change is actually a super efficient methodology for heat transfer and allows for heat transfer at a very controllable temperature. It also allows for pumping energy (heat) from the lower temperature to the higher temperature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Joule-Thompson effect is pretty much negligible in a refrigeration cycle. Itâ€™s the phase change that transfers the large bulk of the heat. The working fluid is vapourized to absorb heat, then condensed again to reject that heat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
