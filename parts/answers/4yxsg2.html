		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, humans are born with the innate knowledge and ability to survive as is necessary for a baby. We're born with a suckling instinct, for example, to latch onto nipples and draw food. We also have all the autonomic reflexes already, such as ticklishness, breathing, heart rate regulation, etc. These are common to all mammals, of which we are a member.</p>
<p>This is because primates are social animals; we are born into a group collective (a family unit) and predictably have a social group to learn from. You have to remember that when it comes to survival, humans know everything they need to know right when they're born, because all that is required of them is autonomic in nature (breathing, heart rate, feeding, urinating, defecating, sleeping, waking), and we only require more complicated systems when we've grown.
Humans as a whole are very weak when they're first born, and require a great deal of security for quite a long time, compared to other animals. This is likely because we devote such a great percentage of the nutrients we ingest in order to develop our brains, as opposed to most other animals needing only to develop their bodies. This is likely why parents have an overwhelming emotional bond with their children.</p>
<p>Some animals are not social, and are therefore unable to learn from others of their species, and so they're born with (or learn shortly after birth) more complex instincts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically no one gave you the real answer... The answer is some animals are precocial - meaning they are born relatively mature and self sufficient.  </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precocial</a>  </p>
<p>Some animals are born altricial - meaning they are born nearly helpless.   </p>
<p>They are different means of survival that different species have adopted. Precocial species generally have large litters (that's the wrong general word but whatever) where they depend on the young to fend for themselves. Lots may die but many live.  </p>
<p>Altricial species generally have less young per gestation period but invest a lot of time in them to ensure they live and propagate the species.  </p>
<p>Essentially it is just a different way to further a species. Some evolutionary paths favored allocating large resources to small births to ensure a successful breed and some paths favored having a shit ton of offspring that you didn't have to look after at the expense of lots of them dying. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is easily disputed with the example of the common household cat.</p>
<p>Baby kittens are born blind, without the ability to keep their body temperature and without the ability to poo/pee by themselves. Baby kittens need to be pulled by the mother/slowly flail to the other kittens relaying on each other and mom for body heat. They are blind so mama cat purrs at them to call them to come suckle. Finally, after they finish eating mama cat licks their bottoms to force them to poo and pee, which she cleans off. This is so that there would be no smells to attract predators to the helpless kittens. In fact for weeks all these kittens do is eat, sleep and when mama cat makes them poo and pee. </p>
<p>You may find it educational to volunteer at your local animal rescue shelter. You will then find out that they keep heating pads/disks for baby kittens to keep them warm.  If you ever get to feed a baby kitten you will learn that even if you get a nipple in their mouth form a baby bottle they may not eat thus having to sometimes syringe feed them, i.e.,  forcing special kitten milk on their tongues to trigger swallowing reflexes. Then you have to take a baby wipe to their bottom to force them to poo and pee. Even when abandoned they don't know how to do that and can die if not properly expressed.</p>
<p>In fact all primates have to take care of their young... lower, on the evolutionary tree, organisms such as fishes and some reptiles do not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This may have been answered somewhere else in the thread, but the reason humans (read: mammals) are born not knowing how to &quot;human&quot; is due to our brain size compared to our body sizes.  </p>
<p>We are born &quot;not knowing how to human&quot; because if we stayed in the womb long enough for our brains to finish growing enough for us to human right away, our bodies would also continue growing and would eventually far exceed our host vessel's (aka yo mama) ability to safely carry us. That means that we need to be born before our brain us fully developed (relative to other non-mammal) so our brain can continue to develop outside of the womb. From there we begin our life long struggle for survival by learning from others, which requires our brain to keep growing, while other species begin their long struggle for survival by using natural instincts which can be accomplished with a smaller brain (no disrespect to mah snakey friends).</p>
