<p>In American English, the verb burgle, meaning to rob, is regarded as a humorous backformation from burglar, and burglarize is the preferred term in serious contexts.</p>
<p>In British English, it’s the other way around. Burgle is a legitimate verb, used even in sober news reports, and burglarize (or burglarise, as it would probably be spelled if it were an accepted word in British English) is virtually nonexistent in serious contexts. Some Britons view burglarize as an American barbarism.</p>
<p>Irish, Australian, New Zealand, and South African writers tend to go along with British writers on this. Canadians prefer burglarize.</p>
<p>Burglar has a long history going back at least to the Medieval Latin burglator and probably beyond. Burgle and burglarize both came about in the late 19th century—neither is significantly older than the other—developing separately on opposite sides of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Basically Americans thought it sounded silly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both 'burglarize' and 'burgle' came about in the 19th century, hundreds of years after 'burglar' and 'burglary' came to us from french.</p>
<p>Since English had the word <em>Burglary</em>, verbifying it as <em>Burglar+ize</em> was an obvious process. Someone did that, and it caught on.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, someone realised that <em>Burglar</em> sounded like 'burgle+er', and decided to coin [or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Back-formation" target="_blank">Back-form</a>] a new word 'burgle' to refer to the thing that burglars do. It caught on too, just in different places. </p>
<p><a href="https://archive.org/stream/The_Sydney_Morning_Herald_24_08_1867#page/n7/mode/1up" target="_blank">The first use I can find of 'burgle'</a> is an 1867 Australian newspaper mentioning that an American newspaper coined the term, so it's likely that <em>both</em> are American inventions. </p>
<p>[General note: I'm not American. Americans don't write 'realise'.]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans everywhere like playing with language, and English in particular tolerates a lot of (near?) synonyms. So you can end up with several words for the same thing. Often these have slightly different meanings, even if it's only that one sounds more formal. Or two different groups of speakers create similar words with the same meaning around the same time.</p>
<p>Burgle~burglarize is similar to other pairs of related words that exist: Orient~orientate, use~utilise, colour~colourise, plus others already mentioned.</p>
<p>My favourite &quot;why did they bother?&quot; is the reanalysis of &quot;pease&quot; as the plural form and the subsequent creation of the new singular form &quot;pea&quot;. It's like people decided to use &quot;rai&quot; in the sense of &quot;It's raise time at work, and I got a rai&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a somewhat common process. Some other examples</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Self-destruct&quot; becoming a verb through back formation from &quot;self-destruction&quot; (you cannot &quot;destruct&quot; something)</li>
<li>&quot;Commentate&quot; becoming a verb through back formation from &quot;commentator&quot;</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually have some of this backwards.  <strong>Burglar</strong> is the word of origin, not burgle.  It goes back to the Medieval Latin word <em>burglator</em>. </p>
<p>The verbs burgle and burglarize developed around the same time in the late 19th Century.  In the US, burglarize became the preferred form and burgle sounds almost comical, and the opposite in the U.K., etc.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
