		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The smallest fire is defined by the quenching distance. If a flame is smaller than this distance, then heat loss to the environment will be faster than heat generation by the flame. This is because heat loss it's related to the perimeter of a flat flame, and heat generation is related to the surface area. The quenching distance is usually on the order of a millimeter.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is how flame arrestors work. If you're worried about a flame traveling &quot;backwards&quot; in a tube to the fuel/air supply, you put in a flame arrestors or flashback arrestor. These have narrow openings smaller than the quenching diameter so that a flame cannot pass through. </p>
<p>Edit: From some <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_Experimental_Safe_Gap" target="_blank">Wikipedia searching</a>, the smallest gap is 0.25 mm for acetylene</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Piggy backing on this, is fire, like let's say in a candle or bonfire, one constant flame that stays lit as long as there is fuel or is it constantly going out and being reignited with new fuel, in other words a &quot;new&quot; flame taking over the old one. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fire is best thought of as a bulk property of a reacting system. The reaction is occurring such that thereâ€™s enough heat to make the involved gasses glow in the visible range. You can actually calculate this value by taking the threshold detection of a given wavelength of photons (basically the minimum amount of light particles needed to see a given wavelength) and determining the temperature at which the optimum wavelength is generated most efficiently then determine where this would happen for a given fuel. This would be the smallest possible fire for a given substance. Then just find the one from the pool of fuel/oxidizers that is the smallest of that group and poof. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
