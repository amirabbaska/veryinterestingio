		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually have separate muscles that close and open your eyes. </p>
<p>As others have said, the orbicularis occuli muscle closes your eyelid. It is innervated by cranial nerve 7 (facial nerve). </p>
<p>The levator palpebrae superioris muscle opens your eyelid. It is innervated by cranial nerve 3 (occulomotor nerve). </p>
<p>So in truth, at any given moment your eyelids are where they are because of a combination of those two muscles. If you close your eyes, you relax the levator palpebrae superioris muscle and contract the orbicularis occuli. If you open your eye, it’s the opposite. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want to voluntarily close your eyes (think squint), you’d primarily be using your orbicularis oculi muscle. However, it would be very tiresome and inefficient to have to contract this muscle the entire time that you’re asleep. </p>
<p>Instead there’s the superior tarsal and levator palpebrae muscle. These work together to keep your eyes open during wakefulness and are innervated by your autonomic sympathetics (you can’t consciously control them). When you sleep, these sympathetics are down-regulated and parasympathetic activity dominates. This causes your superior tarsal and levator palpebrae to relax, allowing the eyelid to close. </p>
<p>Additionally, the levator palpebrae is responsible for voluntarily opening and closing your eye lid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Levator palpebrae superioris - A muscle that receives its nerve supply from the oculomotor nerve. Contraction of this muscle allows elevation of the eyelid (opening of eye).</p>
<p>Orbicularis oculi - A muscle that receives its nerve supply from the facial nerve. Contraction of the muscle allows closing of the eye. Commonly affected with other muscles of facial expression in Bell's palsy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 11th grade we learned that muscle cells contract. Years later I learned that bodybuilders used different exercises to develop different sets of muscles in the arms. Still more years later watching bulldozers i figured out that pistons needed hydraulic fluid on both ends. Pressurize one end and the piston pushes that end. A valve controls which end gets the fluid. Only then did I put it together that muscles come in pairs to move in both directions. One set relaxes while the other pulls, and vice versa. The eureka moment came when I realized that if muscles were only on one side you couldn't do anything. </p>
<p>I feel like my teacher could have explained that better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
