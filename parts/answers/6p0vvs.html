		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This would cause some problems theoretically. There are two kinds of particles which can exist: those whose quantum states are totally antisymmetric under exchange of identical particles, and those whose quantum states are totally symmetric under exchange of identical particles.</p>
<p>There is a theorem called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinâ€“statistics_theorem" target="_blank">spin-statistics theorem</a> which states that all of the symmetric kind of particles have integer spins, and all of the antisymmetric kinds have half-integer spins.</p>
<p>2/5 is neither an integer nor half of an odd integer, so it's not a boson nor a fermion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The spin of a particle is intimately connected to the phase gained in the wave function after a rotation by 360 degrees. This where the problem occurs, the number of times it takes to return to the base state, indicated the number of time the group of rotations needs to be &quot;covered&quot; in order for this work. By &quot;covered&quot;, I mean that the symmetry group admits a connected covering space. In this case SO(3), the group of rotations in 3-dimensions, this group admits only a double cover (relating to the fact that its first homotopy group is Z/2). This is why you can get things like 2D anyons with fractional spin, in this case the group of symmetries is SO(2), or relativistically SO(2, 1), which admits nontrivial covering spaces of arbitrary degree, which indicates that the spin should be able to take any value in a 2D system. In general, more or less any nonabelian (I think you actually need the group to be perfect, but people usually just say nonabelian) symmetry group constrains the spins to take values in integer multiples of the reciprocal of the 1st homotopy group. So more or less, the answer is, to make what you want to occur, either the electron would have to not be rotation invariant, and admit symmetry by either an abelian group, or just a group with first homotopy group containing 1/5 (I don't know any of these), or we would have to drop our relation between spin and rotations, which is more or less equivalent to the spin-statistics theorem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know we only have theories for integer spin and half integer spin particles so 2/5 spin? I don't know. But if electrons were e.g. spin 1 all of a sudden, all of chemistry would change since then the &quot;exclusion rule&quot; would no longer apply which means electrons could all occupy the ground state instead of &quot;filling up&quot; the electron shells/states.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Putting aside whether or not spin 2/5 electrons can be described by quantum mechanics, one possibly interesting effect is that magnetic field forming in ferromagnets would all become 1/10th weaker. </p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The magnetic field in a ferromagnet occurs because the spins of all electrons in unfilled shells align in the same direction. The magnet moment of the electron (which relates the the strength of the magnetic dipole field produced by the electron) is related to the spin of the electron by something called the g-factor (roughly 1/spin). So if we change the spin we change the magnetic moment and thus the ferromagnet weakens. </p>
<p>Edit: given that ferromagnets are used in all sorts of everyday appliances I guess a lot of tweaking would be required :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
