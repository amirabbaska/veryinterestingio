<p>The highest likelihood is that the animals can read body language very well, and pick up on these physical queues.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hunans put off a different scent when they “force sweat” under epinephrine (adenaline) stimulation.  It’s sour and kind of awful.  I don’t know if other animals have a natural reaction to this but they’d certainly be able to smell it if we can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was actually a study published in 2002 in which humans were found to be able to smell fear on other people. Participants watched a video of either a neutral stimulus (video of a train), or a fear-inducing stimulus (Candyman), while wearing absorbent pads in their armpits. Other participants then smelled the pads and rated whether they smelled like fear, sex, or aggression. Pads worn by the people who watched Candyman were more likely to be rated as smelling like fear than those worn by people who watched the train video. </p>
<p>I don't know of any followup studies to repeat this, or to determine whether this effect is ecologically significant--that is, whether the effect occurs outside of the laboratory and influences people's behavior.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apocrine sweat glands are sensitive to adrenaline and are responsible for 'emotional perspiration', i.e. stress, fear. Dogs can easily discern this odor, it's why k-9 folks will tell you the most difficult people for a dog to track are sufferers of dementia, because they are generally not afraid, and so don't secrete that specific scent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
