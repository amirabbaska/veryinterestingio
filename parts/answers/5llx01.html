		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a couple of my own theories.</p>
<p>1) the audio from another input on the TV is leaking onto the audio jack channel.</p>
<p>2) the cable is acting as an antenna and picking up a radio station (but what is the receiver?)</p>
<p>3) I'm acting as an antenna and picking up a radio station (how would my headphones pick that up, and where's the receiver?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A nearby AM radio station is being picked up and rectified by the TV. </p>
<p>A simple AM receiver can be made with a junction of two dissimilar metals or a metal needle point on a crystal. I suspect the electronics in the TV are performing the rectification and the headphone cable is the antenna. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pirate radio yyarrr! This is actually normal and happens with low quality speakers. Essentially the wire in your headphones are not shielded well so they are acting as an antenna. They are able to pick up a certain AM frequency because of this. I actually was able to once get legitimate pirate music (literally yo-ho ho and a bottle of rum type music) once from some old crappy speakers I had would wake me up at night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere in the headphone circuit there's a cheap half-bridge rectifier. The headphone extension is also unshielded, allowing it to act as an antenna. The AM radio signal is its own power.</p>
<p>If the guilty circuit had used a <strong><em>FULL BRIDGE RECTIFIER</em></strong> ^^cough ^^cough ^^sorry or if the cord was properly shielded, you wouldn't pick up the station.</p>
<p>Radio Shack used to sell (and may still sell) ferrite donuts called Chokes to snap over cables to eat parasitised RF signals.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cord of your headphones can act like an antenna, if it's not shielded (surrounded by a tight metalmesh). You're likely catching a nearby radiostation.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
