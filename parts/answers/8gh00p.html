		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A point I havent seen anyone else make is that because it isn't a spoken language the meanings of words don't shift, the shift in meaning is called semantic change and it describes how words like Gay which used to mean lighthearted and awful which used to mean inspiring wonder have different meanings nowadays. Latin is used because it doesn't experience semantic change, and this is especially useful for science which needs consistency. </p>
<p>Edit: Erm.... thanks for the karma lol, I literally know no Latin other than scientific names for species / in chemistry and biology etc I just knew this was one of the main reasons!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because over a thousand years it has evolved into the romance languages (italian, spanish, and french to a lesser extent are examples). Because languages change.</p>
<p>People are still learning it for 3 reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>a lot of classic academia is in latin, and most of zoology still is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the etymology of most latin languages (and english) is mostly derived from latin. Learning latin can help you figure out works in different derivative languages.</p>
</li>
<li>and most importantly: cultural inertia. They teach latin because they always taught latin. Its not a good reason but its a big one.</li>
</ol>
<p>Most places dont even teach it anymore, but historically it was mandatory for education, we are moving away from that but people are slow.</p>
<p>EDIT: clarified that my list of romance languages was not comprehensive</p>
<p>EDIT2: formatting</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Why are there no native speakers of the Latin language</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because there is no group of people teaching it to their kids as a first language. What was the Latin language evolved over time and fractured into the numerous romantic languages we have today (Spanish, Italian, French, etc.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and why are people still learning it today?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It was the de facto language for sciences, medicine, law, and religion, at lot of which still use words in the original Latin. While knowing the Latin meaning of the words really isn't necessary to succeed, it is interesting and can broaden ones understanding of the historical context in which those concepts reside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Since Latin undermines a number of prominent modern-day languages, understanding Latin can give a deeper understanding of how those languages are related.</p>
</li>
<li>Learning languages is fun!</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad was a Latin and Greek scholar (&quot;Classics&quot;), which was an odd choice for a Jewish kid from Chicago back in the 60's. Nevertheless, he persisted and worked towards his masters and then PhD. He taught Latin and Greek at Marist High School in 1971-2, a Catholic school in Chicago. He endured a lot of criticism from his family for wanting to do this (vs. other more Jewish pursuits like being a doctor, lawyer or CPA). He also got a lot of backlash from the schools he went to and where he taught - mostly for seeming like a poser. But throughout his life, he has taken such joy from being able to read, write, and teach the classics. And despite progressive dementia, he still can recite many ancient Greek poems by heart without missing a beat. I took four semesters of Latin in college, mostly to appease him (while meeting my language requirement), and one of my fond memories is of him driving down to Champaign and pulling an all-nighter with me studying for my Latin final. One of my kids took both Latin and Greek in high school, and it was such a joy watching my dad read with him and help him with school work.</p>
<p>Anyway, not relevant to this ELI5, but seemed like as good a place as any to post.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
