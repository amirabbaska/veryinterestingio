		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: I'll provide a link to the studies when I get home, for anyone interested. </p>
<hr />
<p>This is a common misconception. For us, humans have diverse faces which are instantly recognizable but we're humans, which means that maybe we are good are telling each other apart because it's important for us to tell each other apart.</p>
<p>There's a study performed on chimps to see if they were able to tell human faces apart, after all we're instantly recognizable, aren't we? The chimps were presented with sets of faces and they tried to recognize the people in them, at the end, scientists found they were as good as guessing. If humans are so different why aren't chimps doing it better than chance? After that a similar study was performed but this time they used chimp faces instead of human faces. To their surprise, chimps were instantly better, almost perfect at recognizing the faces of other chimps. This tells us that humans are good at recognizing humans and chimps are good at recognizing chimps, which makes sense.</p>
<p>Another study compared human face recognition by chimps where one group of chimps wasn't used at interacting and seeing humans, whilst the other was. The group which was used to interacting with humans performed better. This tells us that you can get better at recognizing foreign traits and features
by exposing yourself to them. For example, if you see a pack of dogs from the same breed that are roughly the same age, you won't be able to tell them apart in the beginning but if you interact with them for months, you'll be able to recognize them. On this, have you ever heard the phrase &quot;they all look the same&quot; when someone from a racial group talks about another racial group? They can't tell them apart because they aren't used to the traits and features of their faces.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, I can easily tell apart my dad's face from my friend's face, but all of the squirrels that run around in our backyard look the same. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you think about it, you're good at telling apart two close members of your species and your family, that's because you're a human and humans have to tell apart humans, even more if they're closely related to you. You can't tell squirrels apart because you haven't been thoroughly exposed to them, if you saw them everyday for years (just like you did with your dad), you would be able to tell them apart from each other instantly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does it have to do with our brains, or is it a matter of practice (so that to an infant, all faces do look the same)?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A little bit of both, we don't know the specifics yet but we think there's some brain wiring involved and some mind development involved as well.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Or is it that human faces are inherently more variable than the faces of other animals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really. If you took the biometrics of the face of your family, you would find very little variance, after all, they're all related. The variance comes when we look at the whole landscape of humans faces, but locally, the variation isn't as big as you think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is literally a part of the human brain (right fusiform gyrus, in the lumpy gray section) dedicated to facial recognition, separate from the other parts that recognize color and shade patterns. We need to see faces for many reasons: communication, response, survival etc. You could say we're just built for it. Prosopagnosia is a disease that disables that part, so everybody looks like a Picasso painting.</p>
<p>Edit: not exactly like a Picasso, clarified in the comment below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct me if I'm wrong but this is similar how people of different ethnicities can look similar even though we are the same species. Likely your brain is not trained on identifying the small differences that make the individual. </p>
<p>Personally, I can't imagine a pet owner with sibling dogs be able to tell them apart, but to them there are a world of differences.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I knew someone who worked at a wildlife center focused on monkeys. They had a group of 30 or so javan macaques, and she knew them all by name and how they behaved, who they were aligned with, etc. You just need to get time to get to know the thing. You forget many inconsequential things, like the guys face that you walked by on the way into a store.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
