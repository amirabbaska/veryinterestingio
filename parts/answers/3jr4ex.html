		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top answer is close but the phenomenon is called first bite syndrome. Learned about it in dental school. It's from your salivary glands pushing out a large volume of saliva when you first bite into some types of foods. The large amount of saliva being excreted causes pressure in the salivary ducts which you experience as pain. Your major salivary ducts are located below your tongue and in the cheek next to your top molars. It's pretty common. I notice it when I first eat salt and vinegar or dill chips. Completely harmless. It should improve as you continue to eat your food. </p>
<p>I don't have a link right this second because I'm on mobile but I can reference one of my textbooks when I get home if people are still interested. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salivary glands secreting.  I had this sensation every time I ate for a few days.  Then I literally woke up one morning with my cheek the size of a golfball.  Turns out your salivary glands can get a blockage not unlike a kidney stone.  That sucked.  Aside from surgery (which was deemed not necessary), the remedy is simply sucking on lemon drops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
