<blockquote>
<p>The heat, due to a layering of two high pressure systems over much of Japan, is expected to ease slightly this week but temperatures of around 33 are expected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly a complete answer, but the rest of the answers here don't really answer OP's question.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Weather is a complicated subject. Mainly so long as you are south of russia or north of new Zealand then your weather is a lot more dependent on your local atmosphere than solar intensity.</p>
<p>It depends on how much water is in the air, how much cloud cover, what pollutants are there in what concentrations... all of which are local factors. Which is why areas north or south of the equator can be hotter than the equator sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun only shines directly on the equator on the equinoxes. In the summer, it shines as far north as the tropic of Cancer which is at 23 degrees. So at least on the solstice, the equator is no closer to the sun than the 46th parallel, which runs through places like Oregon, Michigan,and France. In addition, the days are much longer in the summer the further you get from the equator. Consequently you can expect more extreme weather in temperate climates. </p>
<p>Edit: got Cancer and Capricorn mixed up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three parts this answer</p>
<p><strong><em>Part 1:  The water cycle acts as an natural air conditioner, and this cooling effect is strongest at the equator</em></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>The higher the temperature the more water evaporates.  And when water evaporates, it carries heat away with it.    So until the water is all gone, it will be hard to raise the temperature beyond a certain point.</li>
<li>Additionally at the equator there is already an air cycle ( called the <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/TFACrSKwxPw/maxresdefault.jpg" target="_blank">Hadley Cell [Link]</a>  ) in place that easily moves this water to the upper atmosphere where it can be more easily radiate the heat into space.  Temperate areas don't have as effective of a cycle.</li>
</ol>
<p>So on a world with water there is natural buffer to heat increases.  If you add more energy to a wet world, it translates into a faster and faster Hadley Cell, creating diminishing returns on additional heat resulting in higher temperatures.</p>
<p><strong><em>Part 2:  Summer days are longer at higher the latitudes than at the equator</em></strong></p>
<p>The next element of answer is that the equator experiences pretty stable solar radiation, but the higher the latitude, the more extreme the effect summer has on the climate.  That is because at the equator the sun is always at about the same angle and the day is always about the same length.  But in summer the days get much longer higher latitudes than at the equator and the angle of the sun fluctuates much more the high latitudes over the course of  year.</p>
<p>If you know someone at the same longitude, but a lower latitude you can try this out.  Skype them about an hour before sunset right now (as of July 24).  You will see that the sun has already set for them today, while it will still be shinning pretty bright for you. (And the reverse will happen for you in winter, the sun will have already set for you in December, but still be out for them).  I experienced this when my girlfriend lived in Colombia and i lived in Washington DC and we skyped in the evenings.  Similar longitude, but very different latitude.</p>
<p>So the end result is that if you have a increase in the greenhouse effect, that effect is going to be exaggerated by longer summer days of higher latitude than at the equator.</p>
<p>For visual people, in this <a href="https://permaculturenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/ravsunImage2.jpg" target="_blank">[Link]</a> notice that Equator is also tilted away the sun during summer, not just the southern hemisphere.   At the equator, your longest day is at the equinoxes, not the solstices.  </p>
<p><strong><em>Part 3:  There is population bias on the reporting.</em></strong></p>
<p>A lot of people who live in the tropics live closer the rainforests than the deserts.  People near the rainforests are protected by the Hadley Cell and benefit from an more even sunlight input.  But if you check out tropical places that are not protected by the Hadley Cell, but still have lots of people you will find that they are having record temperatures also.</p>
