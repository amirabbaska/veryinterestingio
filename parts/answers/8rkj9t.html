		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's honestly more often than not just down to convention. For the same reason Europe is considered a seperate continent from Asia. There is no major physical barrier, at some points between Russia and Kazakhstan none at all even. Still the vast majority of people consider Europe seperate. There is no geographical reasoning behind this, it's mostly historical. Sorry to disappoint you, but there is no universally accepted metric to measure a peninsula. Some groups might have their own definitions, but those will vary between said groups. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's more a question of the definition of mainland. Total landmass is accounted for more than anything. So Alaska itself would be considered &quot;mainland,&quot; whereas The Alaska Peninsula (which extends from the landmass) is, as the name implies, a peninsula. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I am reading the comments correctly, many are misunderstanding the meaning of peninsula.  </p>
<p>It is not so much its relationship to the mainland that is important.  It comes from the Latin words &quot;paene&quot; and  &quot;insula&quot;, meaning &quot;almost&quot; and &quot;island&quot;.  So It just has to give the impression of being an island, from some angle or some map, in order to be called a peninsula.</p>
<p>To me the important bit is that the land  mass is somehow pinched, to give the impression of an island.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of strange. I live in Michigan, the state with two peninsulas. If you're not from Michigan or haven't spent time here, you may have learnt in school that we're two peninsulas, but then completely forgot about it. We, though, live it every day.</p>
<p>I'm from the LP (&quot;lower peninsula&quot;). I'm a troll, 'cos I live under the bridge connecting us to the UP (&quot;upper peninsula&quot;), where the &quot;yoopers&quot; (UP-ers) live.</p>
<p>There's nothing that <em>feels</em> like being on a peninsula when we're here; both peninsulas are just too big. We're peninsulas of peninsulas, I suppose, and it's not until we're on, say, Old Mission Peninsula that we even think about being surrounded by water. Heck, I grew up in The Thumb (yes, we really call it that), which is a peninsula, too, but no one ever refers to it as that.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if there's a record for peninsula of a peninsula of a peninsula of a peninsula (etc.) somewhere, but I wouldn't be surprised if someplace in Michigan were on the top 10 list.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Latin, ‘insula’ is an island and ‘paene’ is almost. The word peninsula comes from these roots and is therefore by definition an ‘almost island’. By convention it’s a landmass surrounded on approximately three sides by water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
