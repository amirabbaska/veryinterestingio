		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's surprising to me how far gone a plant can be without really dying. Even if you chop a tree down incorrectly (too high or in the wrong season) it can come back. Done intentionally this is called coppicing. Some coppiced stumps are ancient. They just keep cutting it down and letting it grow back to harvest the wood.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A plant can probably be considered truly dead when it can't react to environmental stimuli. When a plant can no longer acclimate to certain stresses (i.e. salt stress) the damage becomes irreparable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
