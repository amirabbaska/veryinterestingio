		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A lot of misinformation here so I made an account to reply. I'm a water/wastewater engineer with 8 years experience practicing in Canada. <br><br>In cities and towns in North America, there are generally two stages to treatment of water. First it is disinfected at the source with either chlorine, uv, or ozone. It may also be filtered at the source. The disinfection at the source removes pathogens; however as you have identified, there is risk of regrowth in the distribution system if additional steps aren't taken. <br><br>The distribution system is carefully designed to maintain a chlorine residual to prevent growth of pathogens. Essentially a small concentration of free chlorine is maintained throughout the system. Chlorine booster stations are installed along the piping to maintain this residual where needed. Computer models and field sampling are used to identify the chlorine residual throughout the system. This residual chlorine can be referred to as secondary disinfection. <br><br>One of my summer jobs while in school included sampling people's hose bibs outside their houses to measure the chlorine residual. <br><br>There has been some discussion of main breaks and silt intrusion. Since the water system is pressurized, there is little intrusion of silt during a break. When the break is repaired, it is isolated, fixed and the line is flushed. Further, distribution systems are designed and operated to prevent reverse siphoning of outside material and water into the lines. <br><br>In Europe I understand that there are different practices. For example, secondary disinfection with residual chlorine is not applied in Germany. Also, the information above may not apply to all North American jurisdictions.  <br><br>If you are lucky enough to live in a modern city or town with potable tap water, please drink it and don't bother with brita filters and bottled water.  In Canada, tap water is held to a higher health standard than bottled water. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Licensed Water System Operator here:  The main reason drinking water is safe is the pre-treatment, treatment, and post-treatment process'.  Depending on where the water comes from, surface (like a lake) as opposed to ground water (from a well) there are several different methods of treatment.  Filtration, suspension, UV, chlorination, reverse osmosis, are just a few and the most common.  But the bottom line is, for any public water system, there must be a free chlorine residual in the lines and at your tap at all times.  This makes sure that there are very few if any pathogens left for you to drink.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There are a few things at play here:<br><br><em> <strong>Filtration</strong> - Water is filtered during the water treatment process, which removes most of the particulates in the water and prevents dirt from entering the pipes.<br></em> <strong>Residual disinfectant</strong> - Most communities have requirements for having a residual of the disinfecting process/chemical in their water when it leaves the water treatment plant. This can be an additional dose of chlorine, chloramine, ozone, or another similar chemical or it can be other processes. <br><em> <strong>Pipe-system layout</strong> - Modern water distribution systems are designed in such a way that tries to avoid having water sitting in pipes and not flowing. This slows the growth of algae and decreases the likelihood that the water will freeze in the pipes.<br></em> <strong>Pressurized flow</strong> - By creating a pressurized system, breaks in the pipe will spew water out instead of having water enter the system. This is why water-main breaks become so messy where they happen. Once fixed, those pipes have to be thoroughly flushed before they can be used again.<br>* <strong>Construction practices</strong> - Many communities have construction standards which mandate thorough flushing of pipes and inspection by a regulatory authority before they're buried or connected to the system.<br><br>Source: I have a B.S. in Civil Engineering and focused on water/wastewater treatment and water systems.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Well, in many places, it is dirty. But aside from that.<br><br>The water department in your town is probably maintaining (by law) a certain level of chlorine or other chemical to kill nasties in the water. <br><br>Even if pipes are leaking, they are pressurized (the same pressure that moves the water to your building) and the pressure will tend to make the pipe leak &quot;outward&quot; rather than let ground water and mud in. If pressure drops too low, then the outside gunk can leak into the pipe, and a big enough crack could do that. And should usually be detected by your water authority.<br><br>The other thing protecting you (often) is just the amount of water vs. the rate rust and such are produced. Those hundreds of miles of water mains are rarely sitting water, as opposed to the final section of pipe to your home and to your sink, which if you don't use the water for days or weeks and let it sit, can become full of rust and junk. Chlorine and other anti-septic also degrade over time if just sitting.<br><br>Here's a mildly interesting specific case explaining how water main contamination can be the result of shoddy repair work.<br><a href="http://www.dnr.mo.gov/pubs/pub2442.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.dnr.mo.gov/pubs/pub2442.pdf</a></p>		<div class="replies-controls">
