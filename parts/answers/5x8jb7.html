		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We sort of can, but that's not really all or even a majority of the fat in a person. There's subcutaneous fat which is the layer of fat just below the skin, sort of like the layer of fat on the outside of pork belly bacon. Then there's the visceral fat that's wrapped around the organs, like the suet on beef kidneys. Then there's intramuscular fat, like the marbling on a steak. </p>
<p>Liprosuction is an example of a fat removal procedure that can remove the subcutaneous fat. Removing the visceral or intramuscular fat on the other hand is far more difficult, if not impossible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its an extremely traumatic process on a large scale, liposuction effective tears out adipose (fat) cells. Those cells have capillaries supplying blood flow / oxygen, which on a large scale damage to these may lead to cardiovascular events. Plus the risk of infection, cardiac arrest, all the normal things that go with surgery as well.</p>
<p>I don't have a link for proof of stats, but you are 20 times more likely to die from liposuction over general medical procedures.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In small amounts, it's called liposuction. In large quantities, it's way too invasive and traumatic. Fat isn't just a tank of lard, it's actual living cells with blood vessels and everything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to points already made about visceral fat, the maximum volume that can safely be removed by liposuction is 5 liters, depending on who you ask. Only a portion of this volume is actually fat due to a percentage of aspirated tumescent fluid, which is a mix of saline, lidocaine, and epinephrine injected during the liposuction procedure to decrease bruising, bleeding, and pain postoperatively. Higher volumes of liposuction aspirate increase risk of bleeding or more severe complications such as pulmonary embolism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can remove a large amount of it <em>but</em> you encounter problems. One is that it's a traumatic operation, two is that the fatter someone is the more likely complications are to result from surgery. Morbidly obese people would likely die if you tried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
