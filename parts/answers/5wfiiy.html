		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all &quot;worms&quot; have the same body plan.</p>
<p>Segmented worms, earthworms for example, are bilaterally symmetrical, and have a dorsal (upper) and ventral (lower) side. These characteristics are shared with all segmented creatures, ranging from earthworms to insects to vertebrates. Note: tapeworms, although &quot;segmented,&quot; are not members of these groups.</p>
<p>As pointed out in the thread above, creatures with dorsal/ventral body plans are &quot;aware&quot; of their physical orientation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
