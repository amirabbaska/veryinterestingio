		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one is completely sure exactly what causes acne, but we know some things that put you at higher risk.  </p>
<p>Acne is a disease of the glands that secrete sebum onto hair follicles, sebum is a waxy/oily substance that protects the skin.  These glands are most dense on the face.  Then hormones, especially &quot;male hormones&quot; (androgens) cause these glands to secrete even more, providing a nice oily, anaerobic (no oxygen) little bubble for the bacteria that causes acne to grow in. The glands that are most sensitive to these hormones are found in face/neck/chest/back, which is another reason why those are the sites of acne flares.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three types of sebaceous glands in the body.
One associated with thick hair on the scalp, these sebaceous glands have a thick duct (due to the size of the hair) and thus do not normally get blocked.
Second are plain sebaceous glands without any hair follicle in only a few sites of the body like around the nipples, axilla etc. These get active very rarely and hence do not cause acne.
The third types are the sebaceous glands on the face, chest and back, these are big glands associated with small hair follicles. We, call these glands sebaceous follicles, and due to the small size(thickness) of the hair, these glands tend to get blocked when stimulated with the androgenetic hormones(testosterone, 5DHT).
The moment these glands become hyperactive, the entire duct becomes sticky and combine that with the skin debris and external agesnt (pollution etc), a plug is formed in the follicle (comedone).
There is still continued activity of the gland, leading to increase size of the comedone eventually forming papules.
Now P. acnes (which are normally present on the skin) sense this rich nutritious fatty area and invade them, forcing the body to react and cause pustules (pus is due to neutrophils).
Eventually when this pus filled pustule breaks, body tries to contain it further forming a big deep nodule.  </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR,</strong> The follicles associated with the sebaceous glands on the face, chest and upper back are thin. Thus the duct and the opening of the sebaceous glands are thin as well, while the sebaceous glands are not. When they are stimulated by androgenic hormones during puberty, the ducts are more likely to get blocked and cause acne </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To directly answer your question, the face and chest/back not only have the largest sebaceous glands of the body, they are also the most hormonally sensitive. This is why acne is more common in those areas. The sebaceous glands are what produce sebum and is where acne arises from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skin that gets exposed to all temperatures and conditions tends to be thicker. ..but our face is very soft in comparison. It's full of sebacious glands and we experience a lot of dirt in the air, bad diet,hormonal imbalances due to diet and environmental conditions. I have scars from acne that NHS doctors forces me to have until i had tried all antibiotics twice causing stomach problems that ruined my life. Eventually they allowed me to see a dermatologist who gave me yet another cream called epiduo which i only had to put on a few times in tiny amounts and after a few weeks it disappeared FOR GOOD. I'm sharing that for any people searching for answers to acne as it's very upsetting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
