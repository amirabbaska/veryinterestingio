		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this gives you some hand-waving intuation:</p>
<p>Spatial Fourier transform takes position space into wavevector space. A lens focuses parallel bundles of beams into a single point. So everything that was described by the same wavevector beforehand shares the same spatial coordinate in the focal plain of the lense.</p>
<p>So the spatial coordinate after the lens contains the information that was encoded in the wavevector before the lens which in mathematical terms corresponds to a Fourier transformation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two layman's experiment that's interesting to try. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The FFT of an impulse (spike) is a flat line. Place a small dot on your lens, you may expect a black circle, but instead, it's just a minor darkening of the image. One of the reason scratches on the lens is not an issue.  </p>
</li>
<li>Take a thick black piece of paper and cut a small shape in the middle of it. Say a 5 point star. Now cover the lens with it and take a picture contains lots of pointed light sources. In spatial domain, you would expect an overlay, like peeping through a keyhole. However, it acts like a convolution in frequency domain and every point source turns into individual star shape.  </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you make a spherical point source on the focal plane of the lens, it'll make a plane wave beam focused out to infinity (as per the thin lens equation and ray optics). But this works in reverse too, so any plane wave gets turned into a focused spot on the focal plane. The position of the spot depends only on the direction of the plane wave (since there's no other spacial dependence in a plane wave). Finally, any image source can be composed of a combination of plane waves going in different directions like a fourier transform, with higher spatial frequencies corresponding to more off-axis plane waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thats not directly related but maybe deepens the understanding. An optical grating is able to change the spatial momentum. This makes sense since any parallel beam e.g. widened laser beam is split into a central beam and several maxima so changes the 0 degree angle of the parallel beam. We used to filter the central beam in a 4f lens configuration by a small  paper card in the center of the focal plane of these lenses which so acted as a fourier filter. The first maxima are captured by the second lens and form two counterpropagating beams. From there you can use this to make structured illumination. I would recommend to visit the microscopy sites like olympusmicro.com to play around and get visual understanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not really an answer to your question, but maybe it is easier to grasp if you invert how you apply your intuition. When you diffract a field through a spherical lens, the answer is mathematically identical to a FT. Use the math to give you intuition for how a lens works, not the other way around. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
