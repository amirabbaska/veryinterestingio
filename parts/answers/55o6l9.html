		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when considering this question, we have to consider two things. First, what are the concentrations of each element on earth? Second, what chemical form(s) is each element found in? To be found in seawater in large quantities, an element needs to preferentially form stable, water-soluble species. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abundance_of_elements_in_Earth%27s_crust" target="_blank">This page</a> shows the raw abundances of elements. As you can see, sodium is one of the most common elements on Earth. All of the more common elements are components of water, also found dissolved in water or tend to form insoluble chemical species. Chlorine isn't quite as common, but is still present in large amounts. However, the elements more common than chlorine don't prefer to form water soluble species in the presence of water, oxygen and each other. Thus, we are left with large quantities of sodium and chloride. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Na and Cl are the most abundant salts in seawater because they have the slowest removal rates. </p>
<p>There's an easy way to figure out why this is the case - examine the concentrations of different ions in seawater compared to river water. Sodium and Chloride are the most concentrated ions in the ocean with respect to river waters (due to their extremely high solubility and low particle reactivity in the ocean). If it were due to sodium and chloride having the largest sources, they would also have to be the most abundant ions in river water, which they are not. </p>
<p>Sulphate and phosphate are used rapidly in the ocean by organisms and incorporated into organic matter. Lithium and potassium are certainly more soluble, but they have faster sinks - they can be removed by the hydrothermal circulation of seawater through the hot ocean crust. </p>
<p>This idea as a whole, is known as the kinetic model for seawater and is how chemical oceanographers understand the composition of the ocean - [Broecker 1971](<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003358947190041X" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/003358947190041X</a> )</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question. I've read some of the top upvoted comments and while there are parts of them that are close to the truth, they are all missing some <em>key</em> factors that adequately explain why Na+ Cl- are the dominant <em>ions</em> in sea water.</p>
<p>Firstly, the comment by u/shieldvexor is accurate in the discussion of abundances (the usual term is crustal abundance, not concentration 'on earth'). Crustal abundance is a term used to describe the availability of a particular metal or element in the crust, since the crust is really the source of <em>most</em> of the elements we find in nature. This isn't 100% true, but it's true accounting for geologic time.</p>
<p>Second, We <strong>must</strong> look at solubility product of some other common salts in order to assess or conclude why those salts/ions are not more common in sea water. Lets take the obvious example of calcium carbonate. CaCO3 would be a strong contender for dissolved concentrations in seawater, given the incredible store of <em>solid phase</em> CaCO3 (consider all the detritus of millions of years of shellfish, bones and coral in the ocean), if the solubility product of CaCO3 was significantly lower, there would be a lot more Ca+2 CO3-2 in sea water, which would (could) make these ions contenders for the top salts. Lets look at another example: Since iron and oxygen are some of the most common elements on earth, we might expect that iron would make up a significant portion of of the ion strength in sea water. The reason iron isn't one of the top ions is because any iron that does go into the ocean is immediately precipitated out as iron oxy-hydroxide (FeOOH). Furthermore, iron which might have travelled down streams and rivers to the ocean would almost always be removed by settling out of the water column before it reached the ocean. Because iron oxy-hydroxide has a very , very low solubility product, there would be almost zero opportunity for any iron to reach the ocean unless mobilized by turbulent water. Since turbulent water hardly ever reaches the ocean (turbulent water carries a lot of energy and will erode mountains much more quickly than slow moving water, it means that turbulent water will always rapidly erode the source of the turbulence thus creating (eventually) a shallower slower moving river on account of the built up sediment. This slow moving water is a perfect place for iron precipitates to settle out of the water column.</p>
<p>Thirdly, and arguably most importantly, we have to account for source term liberation and mobility. Because sodium and chloride, potassium and some other mobile ions <em>are</em> mobile, they are rapidly leached out of rock. Since rock is gradually 'weathered' by wind and water, the process of weathering releases (liberates) the most mobile elements first. Other elements that are bound by higher energy bonds such as silica, aluminium, are slower to be released. This means that those elements that are released more rapidly are more heavily partitioned into the liquid phase, while elements (even when they are more abundant (e.g. iron, silica) are partitioned more heavily into the solid phase. We can consider the previous two points in context of this point: If silica or iron was not bonded so strongly, what would happen? The liberation would elevate water in contact with source terms, but, since mobility isn't as high (also KSP's lower) then transport from the source term to the ocean would still take longer, and thus other elements with higher mobility would still out-compete these elements.</p>
<p>In summation, the reason why Na, Cl is elevated in comparison to all of the other potential salts is because of source term liberation mechanics favouring partitioning into the liquid phase, higher mobility (higher solubility product) in water, and finally elevated crustal abundance concentrations in the source term.</p>
<p>There are a few other more technical reasons regarding extremely high salinity water adversely affecting solubility constraints and the hydration spheres (positive/negative ion density of the ions and associated water molecule arrangements) but I'm not going to go into detail on these because they are largely irrelevant given the scale of the differences we are discussing - hyper salinity will adversely affect <em>all</em> salts with the possible exception of some Ca+2, Na+ and K+ salts as a function of Debye &amp; Huckel's observations (and others) as early as 1920's.</p>
<p>There is good reading on this topic and many advancements in the last 40 years (since the early 1980's) with special note to Kenneth Pitzer: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitzer_equations" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitzer_equations</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with the &quot;steady state&quot; or the balance of input-output of these elements in seawater. The sources for these elements to the ocean is from the weathering of rocks on land, like all other major constituents of seawater. </p>
<p>The difference between sodium and chloride is their sinks from seawater a pretty different than other elements. The largest sink (exist mechanism from seawater) for these elements is basically drying up of ocean basins at the end of the Wilson cycle (the life cycle of oceans). This, as you can probably imagine, takes hundreds of millions of years. They are not significantly used in biological functions like other major constituents in seawater. </p>
<p>Other major constitutes of seawater like calcium, magnesium, sulphate, ect. can get incorporated in the shells of phytoplankton or in their cells. That means these elements when the plankton die, or are consumed by the higher food chain and nicely packaged into fecal pellets are heavy enough to sink out of seawater and into ocean sediments. This is much faster in comparison to sodium and chloride.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
