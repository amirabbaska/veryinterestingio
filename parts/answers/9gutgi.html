It happens so quickly that the water slamming back together makes a sound.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When water is boiling, bubbles of vapour appear in it. Small bubbles take less time to pop than large bubbles. When the water is starting to boil in the kettle, only very small bubbles can appear near the heating element. Millions of tiny bubbles form, but each bubble only lasts a tiny amount of time. The noise you hear is all those tiny bubbles forming and popping very quickly.</p>
<p>Once the water gets to a high enough temperature, larger bubbles can form. The larger bubbles take longer to pop and there are less of them, so instead of the continuous noise you heard before, you get the &quot;blub blub blub&quot; noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! Power Plant Operator here. Steam is my life, I got this! But first a Fun Fact: When water boils it expands about 1700x its original volume at atmospheric pressure, just goes to show the power of steam and why a high pressure boiler explosion is so dangerous. </p>
<p>The water is boiling and creating steam bubbles.  However those steam bubbles quickly give up heat to the colder water around them and they collapse making that snap sound. This is called &quot;Water Hammer&quot; very similar to cavitation but slightly different. </p>
<p>Once the water is boiling and hot enough those steam bubbles make it to the surface and condense into the visible &quot;steam&quot; we can see. Real steam is actually invisible water in a vapor state. The steam we can see is just tiny water droplets. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
