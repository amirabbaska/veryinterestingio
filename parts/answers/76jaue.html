		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the type of reactor. Most plants are so ridiculously automated it's not even funny. Even the older ones.</p>
<p>As someone stated though the lack of load would cause the generators to trip and with that happening the reactor would trip because there's nothing to take the load. Nuke plants aren't great at varying loads so a sudden drop off in load usage would cause it all to shutdown for safety reasons automatically. When we had that big power outtage many years ago on the east coast the plants all went into shut down because the systems all tripped as there was a sudden lack of load as far as the generators were concerned and all the reactors went into safety &quot;OH shit our powers got nowhere to go&quot; mode and started shut down processes. Which sometimes causes problems as the back ups for some plants are primarily fed from the grid (backups used if not acailable) but because the whole grid went down some back ups didn't do what they should have.</p>

<p>Edit:
Few questions were asked.
1) Depending on the age of the plant, in a perfect world they should technically run without any human intervention for quite awhile. That said no plant runs perfectly so it could be as short as a day before lack of humans causes it to shut down or a few weeks. As someone said they have entire shifts of people for the reactors I'm at at all times and they're integral to making sure it runs smoothly but even without us it generally can run for awhile before issues arise and it shuts down, but it's also a much older so without us it'd fall apart.</p>
<p>2) The simulated load is incredibly low as the plants can't really run if there's nothing to draw the load. It's hard to just have electricity go to nothing and it's hard to pretend there's a load that can use up the pure energy a nuclear reactor puts out. Nuclear reactors do not handle adjusting their power very well and at relatively high numbers begin to poison themselves out if the level is too low. Something like 60%, I think I can't remember, reactor power causes it to be overwhelmed by it's byproducts to the point where it can't keep going and has to basically be shut down restarted after x amount of hours so that it can decay enough to not cripple the reaction. The simulated load would have to be equal to a load above poisoning levels and that's obscenely high. Generally if the generator detects no load drawing from it, it has no choice but to basically be like &quot;Mr reactor you need to turn off or shit going to go Cray.&quot;</p>
<p>3)Most reactors built nowadays generally have a ton of safety features to hopefully power cool the reactor and poison it out to the point where the reactions stop. However... the fuel is still hot. Really fricken hot. Without the water circulating through it constantly there could be some huge issues. I work at a CANDU reactor. We use heavy water as our heat transfer medium. One of our in case of emergency cool and poison the reactor mediums is a large eater tower that gravity feeds normal light eater into the reactor as that cools and absorbs the reactor faster than the current heavy water in it. However.. It's designed for 1 reactor messing up hard and hoping people can shut the others down (all reactors are independent system wise so that faults on one isn't faults on all 4). Another feature they have assuming 100% lack of power (no back up generators for emergencies) the system is designed to go for as long as it can on a thermal flow option... like, the hot water will flow through the system cool and return back, which they got to test in real life by accident during the black out because the faults were so bad. However it only last so long. The systems probably would never breach containment if it got too hot honestly however the plant itself would be a terrible place to be with how their systems are set up. A meltdown on the levels of what has happened with 3 mile and fukushima are interesting edge cases of poor decision or poor design. Fukushima actually caused my plant to put safeties in place in case something were to happen here... Even though we are nowhere near fault lines. Meltdowns are honestly a hard thing to judge. It depends on how containment is built. It's such a plant by plant basis that it's impossible to say how every plant would react.</p>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<p>First off sorry I don't have much for sources. It's mostly the courses we took in training and operating procedure and most of it's not really linkable.</p>
<p>Most plants are designed yes to just shut down the reactor if a problem arises and no human interaction occurs. The rods at most meant for poisoning the reactor out and shutting it down are gravity held up by electronic means. If no power, rods drop and kill the reaction really fast.</p>
<p>Also the reason the load matters isn't for the reactor itself. It's for the generators. If they aren't using the steam from the reactor to power anything there's almost no reason for the reactor to be running so it would begin to shut itself down.</p>
<p>Also my plant will never be re-tubed if that helps. Too old. On her last legs. Which is why we have to be more involved with plant operations, older plant with lots more terrible manual valves and etc.</p>
<p>Plants are designed to have as much automation in its processes as technologically available at the time of construction, and as such as time goes on newer plants have more sustainability assuming peak conditions.</p>
<p>Side note: If you want to get into it go for it but be warned rotating 12 hour shifts which we have are absolutely the worst. Anyone who says it's okay is an edge case.</p>
<p>Edit 3: I'm currently out, I'll try and have answers to what I can actually answer when I'm at a computer.</p>
<p>Edit 4:</p>
<p>Is CANDU the best: Eh. Depends. Its a system that works, its pretty safe, can run off not just enriched fuels, but its not necessarily the best or most efficient. It uses a Heavy Water Moderator for the heat transfer, as light water (normal ol' h20) tends to absorb a lot of the neutrons in the reaction, whereas Heavy Water does not. This is both good and bad, as the inventory of water for cooling has to be maintained and can't just be pumped from a lake (the water in most systems is never recycled back to the lakes, mind you) Edit edit: Biggest advantage of CANDU? Online refueling. We Refuel while she runs. Think of it like pushing the rods through a tube. Push one in, out comes one on other side. They very carefully balance the load with new/old fuel and which sides fueled for each tube to make sure there's no spikes in reactivity. Very neat stuff honestly.</p>
<p>If the plant tripped and had the resources, could we restart?: Absolutely. Most plants are designed that way. If its been down long enough, though, it has to start up -really- slowly. Most reactors take hours / days to start up and get to full power due to the nature of nuclear reactions. It has to be super controlled (which nuclear is very controlled and safe in that matter) so as to not cause problems (or to detect problems and either fix them if possible, or power back down as happens from time to time). The biggest issue is most nuclear plants don't really start up without external power from the grid kind of keeping the systems going and jump-starting what needs to be before you're getting any real power from the Generators. I honestly don't know if we could cold start, with 0 external power. That said, there's still Natural Gas and or Coal depending on where you are (no coal here) to act in the interim, so the power companies could basically shunt the power to the plants to help them start up, which is what happened during the blackout as people mentioned (Some plants were able to keep 1 or more running and used those to basically restart the others) and then from there do what needs to be done, but without any real power source the plant would be unable to keep going, let alone start up.</p>
<p>As for those who DO like shift work, honestly good on you. Legitimately. I found it tiring, staying concentrated for 12 hours isn't easy, and on a night shift on the last even 3 or so hours, you'll notice very few people doing anything that isn't urgent / mandatory outside of the control room.</p>
<p>As for water getting contaminated: I can only vouch for CANDU, but we keep our steam flow separate from the other flows. We used heavy water as mentioned in its own flow, and it basically is used to heat up a boiler, which then heats up normal light water, which then turns the turbines. The heavy water, which flows through the reactor, never leaves containment. It's not allowed to unless there's a breach of some sort, or the vacuum building (a containment device) gets triggered, and at that point there is a lot of &quot;oh god, we got a lot of clean up to do&quot; going on.... But even that is a large, sealed, concrete building. It's a lot safer than people realize. They monitor any air going into and out, all water, etc. Some newer plants don't even let you near the core itself while in operation at all, where as some older ones kind of do but for obvious reasons you don't. Very safe.</p>
<p>As for &quot;Melt downs&quot;, it depends. Only if containment was breached (it takes a lot to breach containment under most circumstances) would there be risk to the outside, and if there was a breach, how big? There would be a lot of signs if there was, and you'd have plenty of warning. Radiation is fast, but linear in its motion. It would have to literally spill out and or explode everywhere, and exploding is something they're designed generally to not do.</p>
<p>Oh this post got too long, had to cut two answer... I'll post as a comment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear engineer and senior reactor operator here. </p>
<p>Current day nuclear plants are not designed to go for more than 10-30 minutes post transient without human interaction. The logic and safety systems are only designed to respond to transients for immediate core protection and plant safety and do not bring the plant automatically to a cold shutdown condition. </p>
<p>Generation 3+ plants (none in commercial operation yet), do have up to 1 week of walk away safety, but require operator actions to ensure long term core cooling. </p>
<p>The bottom line is you can't leave a nuclear reactor. It takes a year or more before decay heat is low enough to prevent a zirconium fire and core melt or spent fuel pool fire. </p>
<p>Operators like myself are licensed at the plant and we cannot leave our watch station until someone else with a license turns over with us. So every day I go in, I cannot leave until someone else who is licensed and qualified for my position takes over. I've done some long shifts due to people calling in sick. </p>
<p>As for the plant side: you have to monitor and maintain equipment. Pumps need oil. Tanks need water filled (or drained). Systems need pressure vented. This stuff happens day to day, so without operators, equipment will fail and the plant will trip. </p>
<p>Best case scenario, you cool the plant down to cold shutdown and leave it in shutdown cooling mode. If power trips off or anything malfunctions you'll lose core cooling again though, as shutdown cooling typically doesn't have auto restarts. </p>
<p>Bottom line: you can't leave a nuclear reactor. And they won't be left unattended. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one has mentioned the last line for shutting down the reactor so I’ll add it here. I worked at a BWR and they had what was called the SLIC system. Giant holding tanks filled with boron to “poison” the fuel. I asked what happens if the boron accidentally got injectors. His response was we shut the doors and fill her with concrete because she’ll never work again. Pretty serious stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would somewhat depend on the plant and the exact situation. Most plants built in the 60s and 70s are designed to operate with no human interaction for at least 10 minutes. And that would be during what is called a &quot;design basis accident&quot;, which is some sort of large pipe break in most plants. In a situation where the plant is running fine and all the operators just <em>poof</em> disappeared, the plant would keep running normally for a while. If it lost output connection to the electric grid, the plant would automatically shutdown and maintain itself. If it lost electricity coming from the grid, the backup diesel generators would startup and provide power to emergency and safe shutdown systems. Nuclear power plants have enough diesel fuel on site to power emergency systems for at least a week at full load, so in a non emergency situation (ie  nothing breaks) probably longer than that. As for cooling water, it would depend on the plant, but every plant in the US has at least 30 days of cooling water available without makeup in an emergency situation. </p>
<p>Of course nuclear safety systems assume that every human doesn't just up and disappear forever, but they will keep themselves cool for quite a while without human interaction. I'd imagine in this scenario  you would start seeing serious issues at nuclear power plants sometime beyond the week mark once plants started running out of diesel fuel. And even then the decay heat would be pretty low and it would take a while after before you started seeing fuel damage. My guess is most plants would eventually end up with some fuel damage without long term cooling, but it likely would be far less than something like fukushima. There would likely be some elevated doses around the plant, but I would imagine they wouldn't be life threatening. Doses would be worse if there were a hydrogen explosion inside containment like fukushima unit 2, and there would definitely be some hydrogen generation once fuel gets exposed, though as long as containment stays intact, there shouldn't be any explosion. I'd hazard a guess that the end result would suck, but pretty much all nuclear material would remain on site and environmental damage would be minimal. </p>
<p>As for spent fuel in the spent fuel pools, eventually all the water would boil away without any makeup or cooling, but pretty much all but the most recently discharged fuel would be cool enough to not melt via air cooling. Even in fukushima, the spent fuel pools remained intact, though there was some boil off and a lot of debris in the pools. Some of the hottest spent fuel might experience damage and long term violate spent fuel pool integrity, though radioactive material would remain on-site, and the bulk of the radiation would be directed up from the spent fuel pool. Long term I wouldn't expect any major environmental damage. </p>
<p>Everything above of course doesn't look very long term, where the plant eventually collapses and nuclear material leeches into the environment, but we would be talking likely decades before ant plant experienced major structural issues. The real take away is the longer power and therefore cooling to the environment lasts after shutdown, the less bad the end result is. For fukushima they had less than an hour of power after shutdown. In this situation you are looking at likely a week or 2 before power is lost. Even after, core cooling would remain for a while until all that water boiled away. Long term you would still see core damage and elevated doses around the site, but the magnitude would be far less than fukushima. But you are also talking about all 400+ nuclear reactors having the same issue simultaneously, so the end result would be multiplied by that number. </p>

<p>Edit: HiddenCamper is more correct. While the plant would still have power for quite a while, containment cooling is not automated and therefore containment would eventually overheat and cause system failures well before the 7 day mark. Were there an operator available to put suppression pool cooling in service, the plant could feasibly keep the core cooled automatically for quite a while as I said above, though I am assuming nothing breaks after running continuously for days and days. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a similar question that was answered in the book 'What if' that went along the lines of if all humans disappeared, what would be the last light (source) that would turn off. </p>
<p>When he answered, he mentioned that anything running on electricity won't last more than a day (if running from a nuclear power plant). These plants will turn off any production of electricity if there is no human intervention (I think it has to do when the cooling water boils off) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
