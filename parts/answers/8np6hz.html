		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It comes in The Revelation, the last book of the Christian Bible. The writer, known to theologians as John the Divine, describes a vision he had of the end of the world. This involved the overthrow of Israel's enemies and the coming of a new age in which God would rule for all of eternity.</p>
<p>Chapter 13 talks about two &quot;beasts&quot;, one rising from the sea and one rising from the earth.</p>
<p>The second beast is described as having horns like a lamb and a voice like a dragon's, and he puts a mark on every person's forehead or hand without which they cannot buy or sell anything. And in verse 18, it says this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man: His number is...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then a number.</p>
<p>This book is an example of &quot;apocalyptic literature&quot;, which was very popular around that time. Rome ruled over Judaea, but not all Jews were very happy about the arrangement: there were actual terrorist groups fighting to free Israel from their Roman oppressors. Apocalyptic literature was often written to encourage these efforts, so it was a dangerous thing to be caught with: for that reason it was written in religious metaphors as a kind of a code, so that to the Romans it would look like the incoherent ravings of a religious nutcase. Unfortunately, nearly 2,000 years later, most of these metaphors are lost on us.</p>
<p>This verse is basically saying, &quot;If you can understand the code, you'll figure out what the beast represents. Here's a clue.&quot;</p>
<p>The text was written in Koine Greek, the &quot;ordinary&quot; Greek (spoken by ordinary people, not poets and philosophers) of the 1st century. Like Latin, Greek used letters to represent numbers. Most manuscripts that exist give the number as χξϛ, which represents 666; the oldest manuscripts, though, give it as χιϛ, which represents 616, and may be the original number of the beast. As it turns out, though, that may not be significant.</p>
<p>The best theory is that if you convert 616 into Hebrew -- which also uses letters for numbers -- you can get NRO QSR. Most vowels are not usually written in Hebrew (readers have to just know what the vowels are), so this represents &quot;Nero Qaisar&quot;, i.e. &quot;Nero Caesar&quot; in Latin. 666 also works, though: that gives you NRON QSR, for &quot;Neron Qaisar&quot;, which has &quot;Nero&quot; with an extra grammatical ending.</p>
<p>Most theologians think that Revelation was written after the death of Nero and during the reign of Domitian. There are at least three possibilities here:</p>
<ol>
<li>Although it uses the future tense, this actually refers to past events. This is quite a common thing: prophetic literature would often start with a list of things that had already happened, but in the future tense, so that readers would think: &quot;Yes, that came true, this came true, this thing also came true, so the rest will also come true!&quot;</li>
<li>There's an extra layer of obfuscation: having figured out the 616 or 666 refers to Nero, the reader has to understand that Nero is actually a coded reference to Domitian.</li>
<li>There was a widespread belief at the time that Nero hadn't actually died and would return in the future; or even that Nero had died, but would return from the dead.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT: Thank you, kind people, for the gold. I never thought this post would get this response...</p>
<p>EDIT 2: I'm doing my best to respond to as many comments as I can, but there are now over 1700 of them. But just to address one point here: My explanation here is only one of several theories, and there are several problems with it. However, as far as historians and theologians are able to tell, this explanation does seem to be the best fit, so it's the one that's most commonly accepted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read a bunch of comments regarding Nero, some of which were very thorough, so no need to rehash that. I'd like to share a different interpretation that I heard a year or two back from a Catholic seminarian.</p>
<p>Numbers in general hold a lot of significance in the Bible. The number 7 represents perfection, so 6 can be taken to represent imperfection, being one less than 7. According to this seminarian (I am by no means a scholar in any form of Hebrew), ancient Hebrew did not have superlatives like, for example, &quot;holiest&quot;. Rather, you would repeat the word three times, such as &quot;holy, holy, holy&quot; (something we still say at mass today). Thus, the number 666 could be taken to mean something like &quot;the most imperfect&quot;, as opposed to God who is the most perfect.</p>
<p>I want to state very clearly that I can't vouch for the validity of this explanation, but I personally found it very interesting so I thought to share it. Maybe someone else here could provide more clarity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Somebody wrote a Bible, while being angry at current emperor of Roman Empire, Nero, whose name spelling represents 666 (or sometimes 616). </p>
<p>Of course he could just say &quot;Nero's devil&quot;, and got to get creative.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are various interpretations. In Christian theology there are four main views regarding revelation: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Futurism - this is the belief that Revelation refers to future events yet to happen. This is the most common view among dispensationalists which are highly prevelent in American evangelicalism. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Preterism - this is the view that Revelation refers either partially (Partial Preterism) or fully (Full Preterism) to the fall of Jerusalem in 70 A.D. Full Preterism is considered a heresy as it denies a future ressurection. Partial Preterism is probably the most common view among non-evangelicals such as Reformed, Lutheran, and even some Catholics. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Historicism - this is the historic view of many Reformers such as John Calvin and Martin Luther. It is held today by a small amount usually in Covenanter and confessional Lutheran circles. This is the view that Revelation does not refer to simultaneous events but rather spans over the course of history: from its writing to whenever the Second Coming happens. </p>
</li>
<li>Idealism - This is the view that Revelation doesn't refer to historic events (strictly speaking) but rather is a vision showing the struggles of good and evil on a cosmic scale. This is becoming more popular. Originally really only liberal theologians held to it but a more serious version is held by conservative scholars like Vern Poythress, G.K. Beale, and Joel Beeke. It my opinion, this is the correct view. </li>
</ol>
<p>Each has a different view of what 666 means. For the Futurist, it is a yet to be meaningful name that will be revealed in the future. E.g. we don't know what it means but when the end comes we will. That's why American evangelicals tend to be obsessed with the number and trying to find it everywhere. </p>
<p>A partial preterist believes that it refers to Nero. This is the exegesis given by the top comment here. Should be noted that PPs mostly (with some exception) believe the Book of Revelation, being about the fall of Jerusalem, was written before said event so it was written pre-70 A.D. The other three views by and large believe the book was written in the 90s A.D. </p>
<p>A historicist believes the number refers to the Papal office in Rome and he who holds the office. The fall of the beast in Revelation marks a future event when the Pope will be defeated. </p>
<p>An idealist believes 666 does not refer a single person specifically but marks sin and evil in its various manifestations on earth. 7 is a number of perfection on scripture, with threefold meaning fullness (a superlative e.g. God being called Holy Holy Holy in Isaiah 6). 6 is a corruption of 7. 666, threefold 6, is the fullness of curruption, sin, evil, etc. </p>
<p>So in the end, what 666 means depends on one's school of eschatology. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s also a musical connection to that number as well. An interval of 6 semitones produces a tritone which is the most dissonant of intervals and called the devils interval a long time ago. Used in metal music and horror movie scores to create tension. An interval of 7 semitones is a perfect fifth and sounds beautiful by contrast. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
