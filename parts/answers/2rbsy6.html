		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes, in fact, there are certain plant species on earth that thrive in this environment. </p>
<p><strong>Longer answer:</strong> The sequoias, or redwood trees, can reach heights of up to 300 feet. How do they pump water up their trunks that high? Where do they get the water from? It turns out that the wet air, coming off the ocean, will condensed out and form a fog over land. The height of the redwood trees gives them a large and spread-out surface area, providing ample room for this water to condense out of the air and drip down to the roots, <a href="http://sunnyfortuna.com/explore/redwoods_and_water.htm" target="_blank">providing the massive amounts of water needed to fuel these behemoths.</a></p>
<p>So yes, such environments exist that thrive on fog and mist, and it seems that as long as there is a steady source of freshwater then life will, uh, find a way. Unfortunately though, <a href="http://baynature.org/articles/fog-and-redwoods-demystifying-the-mist/" target="_blank">the redwoods are in trouble. Global climate change is causing the misty belt on the Pacific coast to shrink, yielding less mist over the land. If this trend continues, we could lose the redwoods forever.</a> </p>
<p>Sorry for the preachy bullshit, but I really like the redwoods. Fuck Bruges, Redwood Natl Forest is like a fairy tale world. No where else on earth do you get trees as tall as football fields that are wide enough you can <a href="http://www.toocooldude.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/redwood-tree-tunnel.jpg" target="_blank">make a tunnel for a car.</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, an example of where this happens are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fog_desert" target="_blank">fog deserts</a> like the Namib desert in Africa and the Atacama desert in South America. Plants that specialize in acquiring water from fog are called nephelophytes. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namib_Desert_beetle" target="_blank">namib desert beetle</a> is also an insect that collects its water from fog, condensing it on its wings before collecting and drinking it. Here are some images of how it collects fog: <a href="http://www.asknature.org/images/uploads/strategy/dc2127c6d0008a6c7748e4e4474e7aa1/biomechbglowres.jpg" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="http://www.asknature.org/images/uploads/strategy/dc2127c6d0008a6c7748e4e4474e7aa1/biomechanics1.jpg" target="_blank">2</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds like you're describing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_forest" target="_blank">cloud forest</a>! I've been to the one in <a href="http://www.monteverdeinfo.com/monteverdes-cloud-forests.html" target="_blank">Monteverde, Costa Rica</a> and while I'm not sure that it <em>never</em> rains there, per se, the forest definitely does get its water primarily directly from the clouds passing through the high-elevation forests. Very cool!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
