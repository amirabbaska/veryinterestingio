<p>Though I've seen an article very recently and they are working on baking bread in space from scratch, first step to developing methods to cook in space (or rather, to cook in zero g space stations where something like flour and crumbs could float everywhere and cause fires and all kinds of trouble)</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Someone posted it in a reply already, but this is a similar article to the one I've read (can't be bothered to check history for that particular post, information is basically the same): </p>

<p>Most food on the ISS is pre-packaged and heated at mealtime. The closest they get to cooking is assembling a meal from pre-packaged components. The astronauts are free to mix and match the components to their liking (e.g. building a wrap using a tortilla filled their favorite ingredients).</p>
<p>They do have an <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1769.html" target="_blank">espresso machine</a> they use for tea, coffee, and soup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>HI-SEAS is a mars colony simulation programme that had cooking as one of the main research topics. </p>
