Now, you can't use a carbon crucible to melt tungsten because they will react and form tungsten carbide, but there are other compounds with high melting points that you can use, such as alloys or ceramics.</p>
<p>Most of the time though, tungsten and other things with high melting points aren't melted down, they're formed using something called powder metallurgy. I don't fully understand the process myself but you can look into it on your own if you like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process for melting tungsten is called induction skull melting. Basically several hollow fingers of copper are used to form the crucible in which the tungsten is melted. The hollow copper fingers are liquid cooled with water to keep the copper from melting at the extremely high melting temperatures needed to melt the W. The heat to melt the tungsten is generated through induction heating. A large cooper coil surrounds the hollow copper fingers. The copper coil has an alternating current passed through it. The magnetic field generated by passing the AC through the coil generates eddie currents in the copper fingers. The natural resistance to the eddie currents in the copper fingers generates the heat. The whole process usually takes place in a vacuum because W is very reactive and would react with almost any atmosphere. Copper is used because it has both a high thermal and electrical conductivity. Due to the massive temperature difference between the molten W and the copper fingers a fine layer of solid W forms between the copper crucible and the liquid W. This layer keeps the tungsten from reacting with the copper and potentially destroying the crucible and ruining the purity of the W. This process is very energy inefficient so despite the abundance of WO pure W is very expensive.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my lab, we use Arc melting, basically a tungsten tipped electrode that strikes an arc between it and a water cooled, copper casting plate with all sorts of shapes. That electrical spark can go insanely hot and melt tantalum and even tungsten. However, this heat is restrained to a very small area, less than 1/2 in diameter. So anything not directly touched by the spark is relatively cool compared to the direct spot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how it's done commercially, but I've actually melted tungsten before through electron beam bombardment.  Here's how I set it up:</p>
<p>I had the whole thing in vacuum, probably 1e-7 torr.  I had a chunk of tungsten.  The back part (which never melted) was wrapped in a tungsten or tantalum wire (I forget which -- tungsten is kind of brittle), which was then wrapped around a threaded rod on the other end (the rod was also a refractory metal).  The front part of the tungsten was bombarded by electrons.  The electrons came from a heated metal filament, and accelerated across a 5kV gap.  If you have enough electron current across the gap (over a hundred mA I think), you're delivering a lot of power to the tip of the metal chunk (almost a kW).  In a vacuum, this is enough to heat it up to its melting point.  The whole assembly was inside a water-cooled jacket to try to keep the temperature down (or else things start to outgas).  Near the melting temperature of tungsten and even at slightly lower temperatures, a significant amount of the chunk starts to evaporate, so you can create fresh thin films of tungsten on new target surfaces that have very high purity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pure metals are elements. Elements are single types of atoms together. If you mix different elements, you can get a compound with a melting point higher than some elements. Tungsten has the highest metal melting point, not element. And still doesn't mean it has a higher point than anything</p>
<p>Based on some comments, OP didn't understand that too much (not trying to be rude)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
