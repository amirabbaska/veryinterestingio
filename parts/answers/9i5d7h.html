		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short periods of pressure your restricting blood flow causing your skin to turn pale/white. Once pressure is relieved you get a rush of blood flow making the area look flush/red. This is called reactive hyperaemia. </p>
<p>In longer periods of unrelieved pressure you get non blanchable erythema I.e persistent redness despite relieving pressure. The prolonged lack of blood flow and oxygen results in blood vessel damage and  other cellular processes.  As a result your blood vessels remain dilated and even leak blood into surrounding tissues. This causes that persistent redness. Tissue will recover if pressure is completely relieved, if not it can result in a pressure ulcer! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While pressure is applied, the skin is white because blood isn't able to force its way in through the pressure.  When pressure is relieved, the blood all rushes back into the skin, making it turn red.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are small tubes running to every part of your body bringing blood, including your skin. When you press your skin for too long, the small tubes collapses and blood does not go there. When you stop pressing, the skin has not have blood for quite awhile. The skin is starving for blood so it causes the tubes to become bigger to bring more blood to the skin. This causes the skin to looks more red. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
