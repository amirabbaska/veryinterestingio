		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have multiple cameras covering the game from every angle.  </p>
<p>Somewhere (stereotypically in a truck) there's a <a href="http://xs-trading.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/production-equipment-1600x888.jpg" target="_blank">room full of television sets</a> where a group of people who can see the output of <em>all</em> the cameras and choose which ones to show.  </p>
<p>The people who make those choices' day job is to watch a sport and choose angles to show, so they've almost certainly seen a play similar to any given play from every possible angle.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I directed live multicamera stuff for a while (not sports).  I could see all camera feeds simultaneously in the control room.  With practice you learn to anticipate actions and you can assign cameras accordingly.  Mine had manual movement control and preset shot positions and so you learn the space.  Early on I stressed about it, then learned to adapt when I made a mistake, so if I chose the wrong shot I would do a pan to bring the right shot in, for instance.  I sometimes see moves in live events and wonder if they are smoothly handling a miscall.  Also, some events are not actually live, but have a delay.  I never had a delay, so I cannot speak to the utility of such.</p>
<p>If you want to learn to handle stress, go work in live TV.  you learn quickly or you quit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
