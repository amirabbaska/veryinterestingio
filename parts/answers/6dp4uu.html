		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have nothing useful except that this is one of those questions that's both original, interesting and testable without expensive equipment. Makes my high school teacher's heart beat faster. This is a perfect end-of-year question to engage my 15-year old pupils with. It'll be great fun to have them try to answer without me giving them anything more than the question, really. Thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
