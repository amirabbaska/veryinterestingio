		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Waterfalls form where a layer of hard rock lies on top of a layer of soft rock. The soft rock below erodes faster, creating a steep drop, sheltered by a ledge of hard rock above. Eventually, the soft rock starts to erode beneath the hard rock, creating an overhang, which breaks off when it gets too long, creating a new vertical face, so the waterfall gradually moves upstream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/CrustalTrudger nearly got the point.  Some event causes an offset in elevation, like at a <strong>fault zone</strong>, where some piece of land is lifted/dropped in relation to another. When a river is involved, this creates the waterfall at the fault because there is an offset in elevation (this is referred to as a <strong>knickpoint</strong>).  Through time, instead of this knickpoint being eroded down, it actually migrates upstream (<strong>knickpoint migration</strong>).  It may become more gradual through space and time, though generally this knickpoint migrates upstream to the headwaters.  </p>
<p>You see this happen all the time.  A colleague of mine was performing a study on the rates of this phenomenon in the lower Rocky Mountains, where the fault line near Jackson has caused knickpoints that are migrating upstream.  It's pretty interesting stuff.   </p>
<p>There are undoubtedly other processes that form waterfalls.  This is just the general process that my geomorphology professor taught us.  </p>
<p><strong>Source:</strong> I just received my degree in Earth and Environmental Systems, focusing primarily on surface processes involving hydrology.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water falling down the waterfall causes more erosion than the water simply flowing at the top.  Waterfalls do move &quot;backwards&quot; over time, but the rate of erosion across the top and at the bottom isn't the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My limited understanding is soft rock gets worn away faster than hard rock where they meet. Once an incline develops the force of the water moving faster or impact on the soft rock  (gravity) will be greater causing further erosion. The harder rock will still slowly erode but not at the same rate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
