		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For decades, the Russian-led Soviet Union was a huge threat to the US and the Western World. This belief is still strong.</p>
<p>Since Russia recovered from the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russia is actively working against the US-led World Order. The US and its allies believe in a unipolar world. The US as the strongest nation to lead the others and make everybody adopt representative liberal democracy, capitalism and free markets. For this, the US created and supported several international organisations like the UN, the IMF, etc.</p>
<p>Russia believes in a multi-polar world with several equal leaders. So they don't want the US to meddle in what Russia considers <em>her</em> corner of the world. Russia has little regard for Western rules like territorial integrity and has often acted militarily against its neighbours like Georgia or Ukraine. </p>
<p>This is the general animosity between them. Now for some current issues:</p>
<p>Some of Russia's neighbours are US allies (for example Estonia and Latvia), US politicians are concerned that Russia might act against them. This would either result in War with Russia, or the US abandoning its Allies which would seriously harm US influence in the World.</p>
<p>Also, Russia and the US have mutually exclusive aims in the Syrian Civil War. The US wants to remove Assad, Russia wants to keep him in power. The US accuses Russia of specifically bombing non-Islamist rebels and civilians, thus committing war crimes.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are current allegations and indications that Russia might have interfered in the last Presidential Election of the USA and might do the same in other Western elections.
There is also the whole mess of the ties to Russia of President Trump and members of his administration. Some US politicians are scared that Russia might have blackmailing material against President Trump, or even that he might be conspiring with them.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Russia is the main country defying the US right now and is alleged to have meddled in their elections.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are an undemocratic kleptocracy where a tiny number of really rich people own almost everything, control the media, and also have access to the second largest nuclear arsenal.  Putin wants to reunite the Soviet Union and because of economic sanctions, the economy is tanking and they fear the public will turn on them regardless of media control.  Thus it is critical that they have the sanctions lifted, especially because it affected the production of oil (their only real source of revenue) and consequently the ability to make sustained investments into the military.  To get the sanctions lifted they essentially started a cyber war involving groundbreaking use of misinformation, which affected the election in the US, UK, and now is being used in Germany and other places in western Europe.  Also very possibly they are working with US kleptocrats (rich people whose goal is to concentrate wealth into the hands of very few by pushing risk onto the public and rewards onto themselves) to entrench power through the use of controlled media and threats to democratic institutions - namely gerrymandering, voter suppression, and turning normal citizens against each other instead of the kleptocracy.  You will find that politicians who focus on wealth inequality are the ones most vocal about Russia and Trump, because in the end it is about cementing a world order where 1% of  people own 95% of the wealth, which is actually happening with the full support of the working poor thanks to Russia-like media manipulation and race-baiting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right now, it's politically useful for Democrats to talk up Russia as a threat which is why we're hearing a lot about it right now.</p>
<p>More generally, Russia has historically been an adversary to US policy and the current administration wants to project their power in places like Ukraine and Syria.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that in 2012, President Obama mocked Governor Romney for stating that Russia was a threat saying that, &quot;the 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.&quot;  Four years later, talking about Russia as a threat is useful to Democrats given President Trump's positive comments on Russia and Putin and (alleged) Russian efforts against Clinton.  So, Russia is &quot;such a huge threat&quot; because it's politically useful.</p>
<p>I think that's why <strong>US politicians</strong> consider Russia such a huge threat right now.  Other people seem to have gone the route of answering &quot;Why is Russia such a huge threat&quot; which I think is a more interesting question than one where the answer is basically, &quot;politicians will always be doing things to advance themselves and attaching themselves to whatever is in the news now&quot;.</p>
<p>And there's plenty of good reading for that.  Russia is corrupt, it wants to be powerful even though the world has passed it by, it thinks the world should give it deference given its size and (former) military might, it has designs toward reclaiming some lost territory, and it wants to be a major player in the world that gets consulted on things.  But it's just not that important. . .unless it does something nutty.  So, it has the potential to go a bit nutty to try and regain some of its former glory.</p>
<p>I mean, the world has passed it by as China becomes important to the world, India becomes more important, Latin America gets better, the EU becomes important, etc.  What's Russia good for?  Oil and gas?  Only until greener energy starts replacing fossil fuels.  Russia's military might?  Waning.  The US, China, and Saudi Arabia outspend Russia and the UK, India, and France come close.</p>
<p>In some ways, Russia is this dying country that didn't change after the Cold War.  It's corrupt. Its exports are basically just raw materials like oil, gas, coal, aluminum, and iron.  It didn't invest in its future.  But it does have nukes, it does have oil and gas that the world is currently addicted to, and seemingly little to lose being a bit of a bully.</p>
<p>That's not a great, stable, happy mix.  Like, China isn't a threat because they like our money.  Yea, they can push a bit - especially over uninhabited islands where the death toll would be thousands of rocks!  More seriously, China certainly has ambitions and such, but they're growing nicely, benefiting a lot from trade, and see their economy strengthening by being part of the normal, stable world.  That makes a country only willing to go so far.  China has invested enough in its future that, ultimately, it isn't really threatening.  They'd rather invest in educating their citizens, buying US companies, selling Americans televisions and cell phones, etc.  China is <strong>way</strong> more likely to be threatening economically - like trying to keep Google below a certain marketshare in China or turning a blind eye to intellectual property infringement by their own firms.  And that can be a problem, but it doesn't really come with a huge body count.</p>
<p>Russia doesn't have that integration and path.  What's Russia's future?  Hoping that they can still sell oil and gas to the West in 2075?  A lack of a future combined with a feeling that the world should be giving you more isn't a stable mix.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>WALL OF TEXT INCOMING, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED</p>
<p>First: Because the US doesn't know how powerful Russia is.</p>
<p>The &quot;election hack&quot; was just the newest in a long list of russian interference in international affairs in recent years. Russia seems to be VERY keen in its cyber warfare, and the US simply doesn't know HOW keen, but they are getting success after success while the NSA and CIA are repeatedly humiliated (Snowden, Wikileaks). Russia, by all means, doesn't come even near to the global superpower the USSR was in its prime, but the US doesn't know HOW powerful they are right now. Ukraine seems to indicate the Russian Army is experimenting with new strategies and heavy integration of drones and cyber attacks in warfare, even with their economy falling apart. Also, nukes. Loads of nukes.</p>
<p>Second: The cultural threat.</p>
<p>After the collapse of the USSR, the US worked to create an unipolar world where &quot;&quot;&quot;american values&quot;&quot;&quot; ruled international relations - representative democracy, arbitration of conflicts by international entities like the UN/EU, free trade, free movement of individuals, etc. Russia, for a lot of reasons (revanchism, nationalism) is throwing these rules to the wind. They just barreled into Georgia and Ukraine with little care for international law, and are repeteadly threatening Scandinavia and the Baltics. Russia is actively trying to convince the world the american model of international relations has failed, and it seems to be working. Trump, Le Pen, Erdogan, Farage... the populists are gaining power around the world, always with the same discourse: globalization has failed. Again, we don't know to wich extent Russia is behind this, but the damage is already showing with the cracks in the EU and OTAN. </p>
<p>Third: Russia is getting desperate.</p>
<p>The Russian economy is falling apart with the sanctions and collapsing prices of gas and oil. They are losing the little economical and political weight they had, and since russian government almost literally belongs to a circle of corrupt gas and oil magnates, this is reflecting directly in their pockets. So nationalism is on the rise, Putin is stepping up its anti-western rhetoric and they are pouring even more money on the military. When all you have is a hammer and all that. This could end VERY badly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Russia is a threat in the sense that they can (and probably want to) challenge US hegemony in the world theater, and increasingly are able to. </p>
<p>They are a 'historical' enemy in that Russia is the main remnant of the USSR. </p>
<p>Nukes. </p>
<p>Due to the fact that they are they are still the 'de-facto' USSR they have the ability to reignite old ties and alliances they had before the collapse in terms of influence in certain parts of the world, which the US doesn't want. </p>
<p>They are still a major threat to Europe in the sense that they are not friendly with western Europe and are a huge military power that could potentially damage US allies in Western (and Eastern) Europe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
