		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to previous comments, the entire North Sea used to be <em>above</em> sea level, up until around 5,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The area is known in archaeology as Doggerland.  The Thames, Rhine, Seine, Meuse, and Scheldt all confluenced there, making it a massive river delta, a very lush fertile valley.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine clay, the prevalent soil type in that area, is incredibly fertile. Initially it is indeed salty and can only be used as meadows, but over the years rainfalls flushes the salt out and the land can be used to grow crops.</p>
<p>The quality of soil depends on the size of the particles that form the soil. Loosely speaking, smaller is better (actually medium size is best) and clay is small (still very good). Smaller grain size allows for more nutrients and water to be stored and available for plants. Also being below level has quite a few advantages as it guarantees that there's always sufficient water available. Wheat for instance is affected quite badly if there's a lack of water in certain critical stages of its life cycle.</p>
<p>This is especially obvious when compared to the land prevalent in the rest of the Netherlands which is mostly Geest. The term Geest is derived from Low Saxon and means <em>dry</em> or <em>empty</em> (devoid of plant life) and is <em>much</em> less fertile.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A thing that several of the other comments are missing is that most land that is now below sealevel was not actually reclaimed from the sea.</p>
<p>These have been swamplands or rather peat bogs for centuries. They would have been around sea level or above and protected by rows of dunes. Floods would have still happened, but that resulted in the deposit of marine or river clay.</p>
<p>In later stages the inhabatants started using these fertile lands for agriculture by draining off water. This resulted in the ground sinking &quot;inklinking&quot; by as many as 3 meters.</p>
<p>That gradually icreased the risk of floods, prompting to people to surround the land by dykes. These are most of the &quot;polders&quot; you see today.</p>
<p>Yet another type of polder - the &quot;droogmakerij&quot; - was land reclaimed from lakes or even later the sea. This started off by building dykes and a surrounding canal. Next the lake was pumped dry by using windmills or steam pumps. Next up were smaller canals inside the droogmakerij to maintain the water level. Schiphol airport is inside a droogmakerij and they are characterized by a square and larger scale layout of infrastructure.</p>
<p>These lakes were mostly man-made. After initially cultivating the land, the dried up peat &quot;turf&quot; proved to be a good fuel. So much of the soil was dug up that large lakes emerged, sometimes threatening or even swallowing villages.</p>
<p>If you fly over Holland you will still see several of these lakes and for some the &quot;ribs&quot; where the peat was dug out and dried can still be seen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you go to the NL, try to get to the <a href="http://www.nieuwlanderfgoed.nl/english" target="_blank">Nieuw Land Study Centre and Museum</a>. It looks particularly at the largest project, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuiderzee" target="_blank">Zuiderzee reclamation project</a>. They have a wonderful exhibit on this, and it was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zuiderzee_Works" target="_blank">a very long process</a> running from 1919 through 1986 with the polder recovery starting in 30s after the closure of the Zuiderzee. Note that the area was effectively a sea being fed by freshwater from various rivers, opening out in the North Sea. Once enclosed, the freshwater would start to displace the salt water. The sea-bed was sediment/clay. Much of it, the former soil of the surrounding that had been flushed down over the years.</p>
<ol>
<li>Enclose the recovered land</li>
<li>Drain it of sea water</li>
<li>Install drainage canals and pipes - the salt at this point is being slowly washed away by the freshwater, both from the rivers and the rain.</li>
<li>Aerial sowing of reeds (tolerates the salty soil, further evaporates the water, reduces weed growth and conditions the land)</li>
<li>Burning of the reeds, ploughing (with some very serious equipment) and planting of rapeseed</li>
<li>Cycle through various grains, wheat, barley and then oats to further condition the soil</li>
</ol>
<p>Now you have good arable land. You just need a lot of time and serious commitment. Now as someone else notes, the land is designed to be &quot;sacrificial&quot; in case of flooding. Roads and settlements are placed on slightly raised areas  so the farm land can be flooded to the depth of a metre or two without destroying roads and homes.</p>
