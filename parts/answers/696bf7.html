		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Supreme Court discusses this rationale in every exclusionary case. </p>
<p>The first thing to keep in mind is that the Constitution does not require an exclusionary rule. But for the 4th Amendment to have any value it must have some remedy or mechanism of enforcement. </p>
<p>Suing the officials for an illegal search is always an option. But the cards are stacked against the defendant, who is probably already busy defending himself in a criminal trial. Further, agents of the state are a big target to take on for a private individual. If private citizens are left with the sole burden of enforcing an important Constitutional right, that right may effectively disappear. </p>
<p>The alternative, and the one the Court considered most likely to deter illegal searches, is to cut off the reward. An illegal search practice = inadmissible. </p>
<p>BUT, since the Constitution does not require the exclusionary rule, and since it more often than not lets a guilty person go when applied, the rule is only to be applied when the deterrent effect outweighs the cost to society. </p>
<p>Therefore, in a case where, for example, an officer made a legitimate mistake of law, or a clerical error prompted him to act in a way that turned out illegal, the exclusionary rule has little deterrent effect and the evidence should be admitted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the evidence was obtained illegally, there's good cause to suspect that it's been tampered with otherwise, or processed incorrectly, or perhaps not even valid evidence to the crime in the first place.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is that if the officer was willing to break the law to get the evidence, who's to say they weren't willing to break the law and fake the evidence? This all follows from the idea that it's better to let a guilty person walk free than to put an innocent person in jail - and if you disagree with that, imagine if you're the innocent person. No, really, think it through, for a few hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it can create the issue of law enforcement basically going &quot;eh, it's worth it&quot;, deciding that a conviction is worth the fines or whatever penalties come from ignoring proper procedure to obtain evidence if it's going to be valid. Especially since law enforcement has a hard time getting prosecuted to begin with. It's there to ensure that due process is adhered to.</p>
<p>It's the same rationale as shady companies doing something that would still be profitable even after they get hit by a fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/law180 provides a good answer. Another factor to consider, assuming you are not talking about a civil remedy is that the very law enforcement officials who just violated the Constitution would then be responsible for prosecuting themselves. So under your question Officer Adam decides to do an illegal search because he's really really sure that criminal Bob has heroin in his house. Officer Adam finds heroin and takes the evidence to prosecuter Charlene. Charlene is now expected to file charges against both Officer Adam and criminal Bob, because both of them broke the law? As a practical matter prosecutor Charlene is unlikely to vigorously pursue charges against officer Adam,  and even if she did neither judge Denise nor the jury members Ed, Elmer, Elizabeth, Ellen, and so on would probably convict him.</p>
<p>Meaning that in the absence of the exclusionary rule there is nothing to prevent the government from willfully violating constitutional rights. And Rights are meaningless if they don't apply to everyone, but there's just no way a jury is going to convict a police officer for violating a child rapists' rights  if corners are cut to obtain a conviction. Because of that we must suffer the bad of letting criminals go in order to preserve the greater good of rights that have meaning, because the next time a corner  is cut it might not be for someone as &quot;obviously bad&quot; as a child rapist but is instead someone who for example says bad things about the president online. Do we want the world to be one heading down that slippery slope? it is a hard rule, but it keeps our police at least marginally honest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers here seem to be focused on the United States, but for those interested, illegally obtained evidence can be submitted in several jurisdictions.</p>
<p>In the UK for example, illegally obtained evidence only need be excluded where it would preclude the notion of a fair trial (s78(1) Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984). This allows the judge to assess the evidence before the trial begins, and provides him with the ability to exclude illegally obtained evidence on consideration of a fair trial.</p>
<p>More recently, UK courts have held that illegal actions by state agents such as the police may invalidate the prosecution of an individual. Specifically, in cases of entrapment, courts have held that undercover police officers entrapping individuals can constitute an abuse of process, allowing the judge to declare a stay of proceedings, see R v Loosely [2001]. I believe the UK approach is similar to the approach taken in Canada.</p>
<p>On your second point, UK courts haven't shown particular interest in prosecuting individual officers for illegal searches or obtaining evidence illegally as English courts generally pay due deference to the police in their efforts in fighting crime. UK courts seem to recognise that undercover operations and slightly off-the-books practices are becoming increasingly important in combatting terrorism and organised crime, and as long as there is process which prevents the prosecution of defendants where there has been an abuse of process, courts are happy to let the police take the initiative on counter-crime tactics (mostly).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
