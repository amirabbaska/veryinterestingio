		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple considerations here.</p>
<p>For one, the US is largely geographically isolated from the world's geopolitical hot spots. In the 20th century, that was Europe. These past 20 years, the Middle East. In this century, it may well become Asia.</p>
<p>As a result of lessons learned from WW2, the US has maintained that it's best defense is to keep forces and the capability to keep forces overseas.</p>
<p>That means a Navy that can deliver men and materiel overseas and the ability to defend them from submarines and aircraft. That means an Air Force that has hundreds of aerial refueling tankers and strategic airlift transports (e.g., the US has over 400 tankers and 220 strategic transports - the rest of NATO nations combined have a grand total of around 40 dedicated tankers and 20 strategic transports).</p>
<p>But on the other end, you need bases for said troops and materiel to be put at. Hence nations come into agreement with the US to station troops in their nation.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, these aren't imposed on the host nations - not now, anyways. Nations must sign a Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) for the US to station troops. A SOFA states the legal rights of US troops in host nation - for instance, a SOFA in the UAE woild bar US troops from being subject to local Sharia laws we disagree with.</p>
<p>You'll note too that the four nations with the most US troops overseas are Germany, South Korea, Japan, and Italy. Three of those four are the vanquished Axis foes of WW2. As a result of various treaties to end the war, those nations were occupied by US and Allied forces, which is how many of these bases came into US hands. Heck, the UK still has British Forces Germany - a contingent of 5000 that aren't due to depart until 2020, a full 75 years after the war ended!</p>
<p>In addition to economic and political benefits of US troops stationed overseas (a lot of developing nations get money poured in from it, and it's a source of employment for locals too), South Korea is a good example of another reason nations may want us.</p>
<p>By keeping US troops in the country and along the DMZ, any attack by North Korea will inevitably kill Americans. That guarantees the US would respond. These tripwire forces are a big reason Poland and other Eastern European nations are more than happy to station US troops there, even as Western Europe is less happy about them.</p>
<p>I want to add too that the US has <strong>simultaneous</strong> defense treaties with NATO and Japan, South Korea, Australia, etc. A war with North Korea does not absolve the US of fulfilling it's defense treaty with Europe if they get in a fight with Russia. As thus, the US prefers to keep forces overseas to stop it from getting to a fight in the first place.</p>
<p>Finally, European and Asian militaries benefit from reciprocal agreements. Not only do those nations get to train directly with their American counterparts, but they have agreements to use US bases in the US.</p>
<p>That's right, we have foreign troops stationed in the US. Did you know that the German Air Force has squadrons stationed in the US at Holloman AFB in New Mexico and NAS Pensacola in Florida?</p>
<p>Hell, did you know that tiny Singapore - yes, Singapore - has FOUR Air Force squadrons stationed in the US.</p>
<p>The vast airspace and land we have allows a lot of smaller nations to train. And they get the benefit of a US alliance? It's a no brainer for a lot of nations </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said about host countries benefiting economically and having a certain amount of protection and the US benefiting by being able to have a decentralized military, there's also a historical component. </p>
<p>The US has a relatively large presence in countries like Germany, Italy, Japan, and Korea. What do these countries have in common? The US has been involved in wars with all of them. After WWII, they set up bases in Germany. Selflessly to help rebuild it after a terrible war. Selfishly, I presume, to ensure that another disgruntled German didn't write a book about his life and rile up the working class. Germany was also a strategic border to maintain with the Iron curtain during the Cold War. Korea was another country during the Cold War that the US didn't want to lose more than the 38th parallel to communism. </p>
<p>All of the countries mentioned weren't in a great position to tell the US that they didn't want them there when the US started forming bases. Fortunately, the US seems to be doing mostly right by all of these countries 50+ years later. They aren't forcing political change or establishing figure head leaders. They seem to save that for countries they don't don't plan on occupying long term</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not like they just come and say &quot;We'll build a base here&quot;, they're usually invited by that country.</p>
<p>I'm Lithuanian. Our constitution says that foreign militaries can't set up their bases here. What happens instead is that we build our own military bases (using their money) and then invite their soldiers to train together with ours. </p>
<p>We get high class, well equipped soldiers and in exchange they get to watch Russia from up close. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of theses answers answered the why not the how.</p>
<p>Former solder in Germany here.  The Stattus of Forces agreement (SOFA) is the actual piece of paper that allows the US to have a base in another country (that we are not currently at war with).  Usually the US sells weapons or rents the land.  Also in the SOFA are agreements about how many local people the military must hire.  We had janitors that were German, soldiers only cleaned floors in secured areas.  Most of the gate grass were also local.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it is worth noting that our bases aren't static. Things do change. For example, our agreements with Japan now call for us to reduce our Marine presence in Okinawa. If I remember correctly, the reduction there will lead to us instead having those Marines in Hawaii, Guam, and Australia as well as the continental U.S.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
