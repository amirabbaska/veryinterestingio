		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well any theory that predicts a non-zero vacuum energy also predicts that the vacuum itself has a complex non-trivial structure.  Like the vacuum of quantum electrodynamics for example.  It can fluctuate, it can interact, it can become polarized.</p>
<p>It is also worth pointing out that from this perspective the vacuum isn't &quot;nothing&quot; but rather the situation where all quantum fields are in their lowest energy state.   These vacuum states of fields have both energy and fluctuations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science never really answers why questions. It just answers how questions. The short answer is there's no such thing as nothing and we can't create it either or at least we've never observed anything like that.</p>
<p>It's not entirely obvious that vacuum fluctuations or space itself are a thing independent of matter. Empty space might not make sense without matter configurations from which to emerge and vacuum fluctuations might not occur without matter. Sean Carroll had a nice paper about quiet vacuum.</p>
<p>It's also not clear if we're talking about the cosmological constant or quantum vacuum here. Ofc they might or might not turn out to be the same thing. I'm sure someone will eventually collect their Nobel for coming up with an interesting explanation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
