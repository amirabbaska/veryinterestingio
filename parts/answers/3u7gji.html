		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the olden days, when Norman French became popular among the upper classes, speaking in French around someone who didn't know the language was considered rude.  So they'd say, &quot;pardon my French&quot; to excuse their discourteous behaviour.  Now we do the same, only the 'french' is mostly foul language.  </p>
<p><strong><em>edit:  because this guy (Durendal_et_Joyeuse) is losing his mind, and because he knows more than me, the text below is taken from his posts:</em></strong></p>
<p>&quot;This is absolutely not true, and I'm astonished that nearly 300 people have upvoted this.</p>
<p>Edit: Holy hell. Now close to 600. This is such a wild distortion and misunderstanding of history, it makes my balls feel like they're receding into my body.</p>
<p>Edit 2: From my response below:</p>
<p>Let's set aside the fact that there's not one credible source to verify this point about Norman French. The logic itself is wholly unsustainable. The Norman Conquest introduced a new elite culture and language to England, and the thought of the Normans or their cultural sympathizers apologizing to anyone for their language is completely absurd. Theirs was the elite culture. Theirs was the elite language. They did not possess the 21st-century sensibilities that would compel us to seek cultural intelligibility, or that would compel us to exercise our modern type of civility and concern for another person's social comforts.&quot;  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the early 19th century, intellectuals and those well-traveled would often drop French words into the conversation to show how clever they were. They would then point out that the word they had just used was French, often to embarrass someone nearby who was less fluent in the language.</p>
<p>To counter this, the less well-traveled (often poorer) people would, after swearing, loudly proclaim, towards  those that had previously used French in the conversation, &quot;Pardon <em>my</em> French.&quot;</p>
<p>The latter stuck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>At least one source[1] suggests that the phrase &quot;derives from a literal usage of the exclamation. In the 19th century, when English people used French expressions in conversation they often apologised for it - presumably because many of their listeners (then as now) wouldn't be familiar with the language&quot;. The definition cites an example from The Lady's Magazine, 1830:</p>
<p>Bless me, how fat you are grown! - absolutely as round as a ball: - you will soon be as embonpointâ€  (excuse my French) as your poor dear father, the major. Embonpoint is French for &quot;plumpness&quot;; state of being well-nourished.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of the top level comments here are way off base. While it may well be true that &quot;Pardon my French&quot; was first used commonly in conversation when the class of educated social elites dropped in French terms to show off, the question OP asked is, &quot;Why do people use it now or the purpose of covering over foul language?&quot;</p>
<p>The answer to this question is one of many examples of the etiquette of the Victorian age, which encouraged the upper classes to persist in keeping up appearances even in the face of undeniable evidence. In circumstances where a gentleman would utter a swear or curse in front of a lady, the phrase &quot;Pardon my French&quot; came to be the go-to apology. By saying this the gentleman was able to apologize for a faux pas and allow the lady to accept the apology without the implication by either party that the lady would know the swear word.  In effect, it gave those in a social situation the 'out' to acknowledge a misstep without digging deeper into what may have been socially dangerous territory. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
