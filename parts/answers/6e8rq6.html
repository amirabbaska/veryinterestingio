		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The internet actually is <em>decentralized</em> - in fact it was originally designed that way by the military to exist as a communication network that couldn't be compromised by bringing down any one node.</p>
<p>What they're talking about on Silicon Valley is moving from a <em>client-server</em> internet to a <em>peer-to-peer</em> internet.</p>
<p>Now what does that mean?  So in the current server-client world, when you click on a link on say, Reddit, your computer sends a request to Reddit's server asking for the content for that page.  The server then sends the content back to your computer, and your browser presents it on the screen.</p>
<p>What Silicon Valley is talking about is taking the server out of the equation.  Because of their magical compression algorithm, instead of a server, all of Reddit would be stored in pieces on the smartphones of individual users.  When you made a request, it would fetch the data from those smartphones instead of the server.</p>
<p>But honestly this is pretty far-fetched.  Even if there was some magical compression algorithm that could make the data-storage requirements realistic, there's no way a network of smartphones could do all the work currently done by servers.  The biggest limiting factors of smartphone use are bandwidth and battery life, and if your phone was serving requests all day and night it would eat up your bandwidth and your battery pretty quickly.</p>
<p>The most recent versions of Android for example have tried to limit how active apps can be in the background to save network and battery life, and this would be going really far in the opposite direction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In that show, they also show lots of shots of server farms, where there are thousands of rows of servers operating quietly in the dark.  His new company is trying to eliminate the needs for those thousands of servers.  And instead use available capacity on people's phones to store and serve up data.</p>
<p>The internet is decentralized, and technically any computer in anyone's house could act like a server, but practically speaking, most of today's internet data is stored in these server farms owned by companies and institutions like Google, Wikipedia, Amazon, etc.  It's done this way for speed and security reasons.  Richard is trying to make individual phones able to store little pieces of it using his magical compression.  </p>
<p>Footnote:  It doesn't actually have to make sense since it's just a premise for comedy writing.  It just has to sound like something revolutionary that would cause buzz in Silicon Valley.  So the fact that it is at all plausible is really just extra effort from the writers to make the show more entertaining for real engineers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two perspectives to decentralization - infrastructure and content.</p>
<p>In our present day internet, most of the content is hosted on a central server somewhere. So if you request reddit.com it asks the Reddit server for the webpage. If that server is down due to maintenance or attacks, you can't get the site. This is also prone to censorship (see Turkey for example).</p>
<p>However you could also host the site decentralized (look at IPFS or Storj for examples) so it is stored on multiple independent computers and when it gets requested, it gets pulled from whatever participating computer it's stored on. Now an attacker/government can't target a specific site and you don't have a single point of failure.</p>
<p>Infrastructure is a bit more complicated. You could argue it's decentralized but in reality most of it belongs to a few big companies. The wires, the backbones, the majority of servers. This makes users dependent and puts the power to the corporations.
A decentralized infrastructure would be independent connections like WiFi mesh networks. So if you want to connect to a server, instead of going through a hierarchical connection via your ISP you would connect to your neighbor, their neighbor, and so on till you're at your destination. However this would be horrible for the latency of the connection and won't work unless a large number of people join in. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The internet architecture is decentralized, but the services used are really not decentralized at all.</p>
<p>When you store your photos &quot;on the cloud&quot; you're really relying on Facebook, Google, Amazon, Imgur, or someone else to keep those photos for you.  If that service goes away, then bye bye your data.  This is not unprecedented.</p>
<p>If you had the magical compression algorithm that Silicon Valley has as its core conceit, then a lot of interesting things become possible.  Middle out encryption assumes that you can both highly compress something AND search it without an index, IIRC, which is quite frankly insane.  In theory you could store all your pictures in triplicate on other devices (why they focus on phones I have no idea, desktops are better) at a small cost.</p>
<p>Richard's idea already exists in the form of <a href="https://freenetproject.org/" target="_blank">https://freenetproject.org/</a> but freenet is slow as balls and has some major limitations.  If you took freenet and added middle out encryption it would be pretty awesome, both for publishing data and for privately backing it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
