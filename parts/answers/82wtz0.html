		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The gravitational field and electromagnetic field are not really on the same footing here.</p>
<p>The source of gravity is energy (the stress-energy tensor to be more accurate). Given a &quot;stress-energy distribution&quot; (which includes the mass distribution that is the source of the classical Newtonian gravitational field) the Einstein equation tells us the geometry of space time (it gives us the metric gÎ¼v which encodes the geometry, the way you measure lengths, angles, proper time along a worldline). In that curved spacetime you have effects like time dilation (you have them without gravity too, in flat Minkowski spacetime). So gravity affects a stopwatch we carry around. The electromagnetic field does not affect it directly (in the way that gravity in a way defines how much time passes), but it gravitates (ie causes some gravity) since it contributes to the stress energy tensor. So in that sense if you have something like a &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugelblitz_(astrophysics\)" target="_blank">kugelblitz</a>&quot; (the first example that comes to mind) it would contribute to the curvature of the region and consequently the gravity would affect clocks in the region.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question was asked a few years ago in a stackexchange <a href="https://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/100279/do-strong-magnetic-fields-cause-time-dilation" target="_blank">thread</a> </p>
<p>There's some equations and stuff that I doubt will format correctly in  a reddit post (so go follow the link if you're interested in that detail) but there is a very interesting quote from the thread  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So you can feed in the value of whatever charge you want and calculate the time dilation as a function of distance from the charged body. If you do this you'll discover something rather odd, the charge reverses the effect of the mass. The mass causes time to slow (relative to the observer at infinity) but adding charge (of either sign) makes the time speed up again  </p>
