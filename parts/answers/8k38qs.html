		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It wouldn't make a big difference.  Firstly, the UV spectrum only makes a small portion of all sunlight (removing ozone makes red curve turn slightly more to be like yellow curve in UV range.  You can even see the little dinky O^3 mark):</p>

<p>Secondly, based on how solar cells work, high energy photons give you the least &quot;bang for your buck&quot;.  Specifically, what you care about is total number of photons with energy greater than the bandgap.  All energy a photon has above the bandgap energy is assumed thermally lost and provides no extra power.  This leads to the Shockley-Quiessar limit where you basically just add up all photons above the cut-off and assume each one produces one electron-hole pair whose energy is the band-gap energy (i.e. all energy it had above that is lost).  However, at smaller wavelengths/higher energies, for the same intensity you have less photons (i..e you have less photons, each carrying more energy).  Thus:</p>

<p>If you're going to go after anything outside the visible you want to go after IR not UV.  Though, again, remember that all carriers are assumed to relax to the band-gap energy, so if you have a smaller band-gap you catch more photons, but each photon leaves the cell with less energy.  Each one gives you less power if the band-gap is smaller. This is the trade-off of the Shockley-Quiessar limit:</p>

<p>And looky-there. Silicon, with its bandgap of 1.1 eV is pretty perfect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, not really. </p>
<p>Some thermal systems might see tiny gains, but most solar cells either cannot use the uv wavelength or extract only a tiny amount of the energy from a UV spectrum photon.</p>
<p>Glass also absorbs a good bit of the UV radiation, preventing it from reaching the panels.</p>
<p>Furthermore, UV causes degradation of the photovoltaic substrate, especially in thin film cells..... Shortening panel life and reducing output (but probably not by very much hole vs no-hole).</p>
<p>So, no. No bonus energy from current solar infrastructure. Just cancer, poisoned beaches (from sunscreen), fading paint, and blisters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily with conventional cells, but I worked on a project about a year ago using thermal fluids and nanoparticle suspensions to capture inefficient photons and transfer them as heat, which both increases the efficiency of the cells (cooler=better) and captured lost heat to be stored and used. UV isn’t particularly efficient in most cells, and just ends up as waste heat, which in turn actually hurts the cell’s efficiency, but with something like what I described, it could have a positive impact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glass strongly absorbs the UV-B wavelengths that would be increased at ground level by an ozone hole and most solar panels have glass on them for protection from weather, bird poop, footballs and other hazards, so you wouldn't see any difference unless the panels were designed specifically for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
