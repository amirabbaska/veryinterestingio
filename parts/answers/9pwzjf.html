		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to our comparatively large body size, copper can be more dangerous for some organisms even adjusting for their small size, depending on how their bodies interact with copper, and depending on what form the copper is in.</p>
<p>Bacteria, for example, have a cell wall, which is destroyed by copper. Copper binds to atoms in their cell walls, ripping them out of their molecules and compromising the integrity of the cell wall. That is obviously not good for the bacteria and can quickly kill it. Copper can damage our own cells, of course, but without cell <em>walls</em> we're less susceptible and we have more tools to control the copper and keep it forms that aren't dangerous to our cells. Even if it did kill a cell or two, we wouldn't notice. Bacteria, on the other hand, only have that one cell!</p>
<p>Plants are similarly vulnerable since they also have cell walls. However, like us they have a lot of cells to lose.</p>
<p>Invertebrates are also very vulnerable to copper for an entirely different reasons. Mollusks and arthropods (so snails and bugs and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0b/KreeftbijDenOsse.jpg" target="_blank">giant ocean bugs</a>) rely on copper for carrying oxygen. Where us vertebrates use hemo<em>globin</em> which binds oxygen to iron atoms to ferry it around, they use hemo<em>cyanin</em>, which uses copper instead. Because they rely so heavily on copper, their bodies absorb copper quickly from their environment if that copper is biologically available (ie: they're not going to rip copper atoms off of a chunk of copper metal). It's hard to turn those absorption mechanisms off, though, so if you put too much copper into their environment, they suck up too much and get poisoned by it. So given a snail the size of a human AFAIK they would be killed by a smaller amount of copper than a human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My husband has Wilson’s disease, along with his sister.  This is a rare disease that causes copper to build up in your bloodstream if you do not take medication for it. His sister just had to get a liver transplant over it.  So it’s not deadly in some amounts but it will cause liver failure if it gets too high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is the old quote &quot;it's not the substance, it's the dose&quot; copper is slightly toxic but not enough in small doses to kill, small amounts of mercury ions are important to our body but obviously a lot will kill us. Even water, as Jumanji says-- </p>
<p>&quot;a little rain never hurt anybody&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;yeah? but a lot can kill you!&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
