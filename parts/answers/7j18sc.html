		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human cells can replace themselves, this is correct. But they need a scaffold to replace themselves ON for them to be in the right place. And the nature of that scaffold is why scars stick around forever.</p>
<p>Let's compare our bodies to a multi-floor brick building that King Kong or Cloverfield or Godzilla or something punches a big chunk out of.</p>
<p>You have a couple choices to do something about that building before the weather gets in and wrecks it worse. But a feasible one of them isn't a complete tear-down and rebuild using scaffolding and heavy construction to recreate the building properly. People have got to go on living in there and there's not enough free spending money around to do it.</p>
<p>So you patch that hole as best you can and maybe brick up the opening, and that's good enough for people to keep living in it. But it leaves a not-very-pretty gap in your building. It's functional even if some of the electrical stuff or elevators don't work due to the still missing area, and it looks ugly because you couldn't quite get everything perfect without bringing in super-expensive heavy machinery and shutting everything down, and the bricks don't match. So you're left with a serviceable building with ugly spots that you can't ever afford to make perfect-looking again.</p>
<p>Scarring's the same. The body doesn't have the ability to regenerate huge missing areas because it can't create scaffolding once you're out of the womb. All of the 'heavy equipment' necessary for it is no longer available. This wasn't critical enough of a skill for us to evolve as a species because enough of us survived and had kids even without it to take over the world. So the body goes with a &quot;walling off&quot; strategy without coming with a bunch of perfectly set-up scaffolding to build new clean supporting structures for the new cells to grow back into their perfect original shape. </p>
<p>And those wall-offs are dead 'hard' tissue that is permanently set into their walled-off shape and can't be replaced. Again, perfect-looking repairs weren't necessary to the survival of our species so we didn't evolve them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human cells don't replace themselves every 7 years.  Different cell types regenerate at different rates. </p>
<p>I believe that muscle cells replace themselves once every 10 years at birth, but this declines rapidly as you age.  By the time you die, only about half of your muscle cells have been replaced.</p>
<p>Your intestines are replaced every 4 days or so (the poor things). </p>
<p>Your pancreas beta cells are replaced every 60 days or so.</p>
<p>Your epidermal cells (outermost skin cells) are replaced every month.</p>
<p>Your liver cells are replaced every year or so.</p>
<p>Fat cells are replaced at the 7-8 year cycle rate that the urban legend dictates.</p>
<p>When you get a minor cut that does not puncture the entire epidermis, the injury will generally heal completely because there are epidermal cells underneath that grow outwards.  As the cells above are pushed upwards and outwards they will slough off revealing the newer epidermal cells beneath. The skin is as good as new after a month or so.</p>
<p>However a deeper wound heals differently.  The wound fills with blood, platelets and clotting agents to form a clot.  Next fibroblasts are attracted to the wound site and begin producing collagen.  The epidermis then tries to cover the wound site with skin cells (this can only happen if the wound remains moist - if the wound dries out, the healing process slows immensely which is one of the main reasons why bandaging a wound is so important).  Scar tissue forms by filling the wound with collagen.  Once the wound has healed, the collagen remains.</p>
<p>Over time, the collagen around the edge of the wound may slowly get replaced by neighboring cells, but if the wound is simply too large the regeneration of neighboring cells isn't fast enough to replace the nonfunctional tissue with functional cells.  Remember, the neighboring cells have to pull double duty.  In order for the scar to disappear, neighboring cells have to replace not only themselves but also their neighbors.  They can do this to a point, but it is ultimately limited.  So the body keeps the collagen in place which prevents the scar from disappearing entirely.  The scar isn't functional, but it is strong, tough tissue that holds itself together so its better than nothing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your scar-tissue is replaced as well. Basically your body can simply “forget“ what is scar tissue and how it originally was supposed to look like.
Luckily we have developed a mechanism that reduces scar tissue back after it has done it's job but it's not perfect and since, most often, the consequence of this “failiure“ is only a minor optical flaw the evolutionary pressure to improve that process is rather low.
Possible causes for the system “failing“ are most likely quite diverse but what can be said is: Replacing cells does not automatically restore the information of how the cells were arranged. </p>
<p>Edit: Forgot burn scars- i assume they work quite differently from scars caused by purely mechanical damage.
But the basic idea is always the same: replacing cells can also copy the “damaged/faulty“ tissue...the correction of what is copied needs to be done separately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that they don't replace themselves every 7 years.</p>
<p>While it's true that some cells are constantly replaced (e.g. the outer layers of your skin are continuously dying, falling off, and being replaced throughout your life), others are never replaced. Many of your cells (e.g. neurons, muscle cells) are the same ones you had when you were born or when you finished growing. This is why you can recover from a stab wound but not a brain injury - skin regrows quickly, but neurons never do.</p>
<p>I've heard the 7 years number before, usually in relation to specific cell types. I'm not a PhD in biology (did a minor with my BA and I'm a nursing student), but I'm calling urban legend on that number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Too much text here for your ELI5 answer, so here it is.
Scars are not cells, they are extracellular (outside cells) materials, mainly 'collagen' formed when more severe injury can not be healed by simple cell replication. Some scars fade slowly over many years (depending on severity and location) because that dense collagen is reabsorbed by cells and replaced by living tissue (cells) again.</p>
<p>*Note this is a gross oversimplification (ELI5) there are many, many extracellular proteins, collagen being the most important and prolific in scar formation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
