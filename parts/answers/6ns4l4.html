		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ozone isn't a permanent layer that has 'risen' higher than the oxygen. Ozone only 'lives' for about an hour, but it is constantly being replenished by the interaction of UV rays from the sun and atmospheric oxygen. A photon of UV hits an O^2 molecule and splits it in half, leaving two free oxygen atoms floating around. These readily bind with whole O^2 molecules, creating O^3. This absorption of UV is what makes the O^3 layer so important. </p>
<p>EDIT: I worded the last part poorly. Ozone itself is very good at absorbing high energy UV. Oxygen is good at absorbing lower energy UV. The photodisassociation of the oxygen is not part of the absorption process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ozone is found lower down in the atmosphere as well. You can even smell it. It is what produces the smell of lightning or other electric sparks. However ozone is very reactive and will quickly react with other elements. So even though ozone is heavier then oxygen you will usually not find it far from where it is being created. The reason there is a layer of ozone in the upper atmosphere is because oxygen will react with ultraviolet light to create ozone. And the upper atmosphere gets a lot of ultraviolet light from the Sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The O-zone layer contains about 10 parts per million (0.001%) ozone, the rest is other gases you find commonly in the atmosphere. The name makes it sound like its a band of just ozone (like what you get when you pour different density liquids into a glass and they seperate) when in reality its just normal atmosphere with a tiny bit more of o3 in it (caused by UV radiation). It just exists in higher concentrations than at lower levels because there is more UV radiation from the sun penetrating higher up which creates it, it then decays pretty quickly which is why its such a small quantity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's not that there isn't ozone near ground level because you're right it has a higher density.  It's that ozone is typically formed in the upper levels of the atomsphere due to O^2 reacting with free radicals of oxygen which are generally formed from the solar radiation that is constantly shining on Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have already replied to your question, but this is an important detail: even if a molecule is heavier than another per se, it doesn't mean the actual material composed by those molecules will have a higher density. H2O is a tiny molecule but water has a higher density than a vast majority of organic compounds like diethyl ether, methylamine, ethyl acetate... it all depends on the packing of the molecules.</p>
<p>Edit: on the other hand, with gases, you can guess their relative density by looking at the molecular weight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
