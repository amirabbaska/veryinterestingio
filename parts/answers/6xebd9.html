		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is actually already preparing for your alarm before it goes off, because it's been habituated to the stimulus.  But it's not really quite as accurate as you think.  Some days it's probably doing it +/- 15-30 minutes to the actual time.</p>
<p>The problem is, this process of waking up and preparing is kind of disjointed.  You drift in and out of sleep, and during that time, your ability to form memories and perceive the world is pretty skewed.</p>
<p>In other words, you could be starting to wake up 20 minutes before your alarm, but none of those brief moments of semi-consciousness make it into your memory.  It's only the very last one, which is then fully interrupted by your alarm (or you fully waking up on your own just before) that sticks in your mind.</p>
<p>Confirmation bias then kicks in, and you only really remember the times this happened.  Not all the times that it didn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While we may not be good at trying to figure out the exact hour and minute of the day, neurologically our brain is great at it, it just needs something to measure it off of for us to realize it. So you have an alarm that goes off at 5:38 every day. This isn't new information for your brain. It gets hardwired into it that at around 5:38, an alarm goes off and it's time to wake up. Your brain triggers specific mechanisms in order to prepare for waking up. Your brain also really doesn't enjoy the loud blaring alarm clock you have as it's jarring and sends it into a little panic, so, knowing that it's minutes before 5:38, your brain starts sending signals saying &quot;hey, that loud noise is going to go off any minute now, so we need to wake up before it does so it doesn't scare the crap out of me&quot; and thus, you wake up just before it goes off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All living beings experience what is known as &quot;circadian rhythm&quot;. These are patterns that occur in our thinking, breathing, etc from our daily cycle.</p>
<p>Your body is so used to waking up at that time that it just starts behaving like you are going to wake up on its own. Your heartrate and breathing will accelerate subconciously (amongst other things) which will cause you to respond by waking up.</p>
<p>The best example I can give is if you say feed your dog everyday at 5. Eventually your dog starts expecting to be fed at 5. Your body is like the dog.</p>
<p>This is why it is so disruptive to a person to not have a consistent schedule of sleeping and activity. Your body actually adjusts to these cycles making them easier for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What the other comments said can be correct, however, there is a simpler answer. </p>
<p>You do subconsciously realise the time at which you should be up, however the way you know what that time is, may not just be because you are subconsciously guessing the time, thinking that you should wake up now, 7 hours after you have gone to sleep. It may be because you subconsciously know the level of sunlight, or you wake up a certain period after some other stimulus goes off, e.g. you can hear the humming of your boiler or something like that and you have recognised that a few minutes after that you will have to wake up. </p>
<p>The reason you do not, or may not remember hearing the boiler, in our example, is because it's hard to remember anything when you are asleep you may just have subconsciously heard it. </p>
<p>You may have even woken up, checked the time, and fallen back to sleep knowing to wake up soon, and forgotten the memory of you waking up a bit before. A common thing that happens to me is, my mum wakes me up and tells me to do something, I apparently respond (this has happened about 3 times in the same day) and then fall back to sleep. After finally waking up I remember nothing of it, and get told off for not doing whatever she asked. </p>
<p>Adding a level of complexity to the last paragraph, I sometimes do remember falling back to sleep from getting woken up thinking I'm only going to sleep for a little bit, waking up a bit later, realising (consciously, but incorrectly) that I have no reason to get up now, and then falling back to sleep again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One morning I woke up 5 minutes before the alarm went off and I discovered that my alarm clock made a [relatively] loud &quot;click&quot; moments before the alarm would ring.</p>
