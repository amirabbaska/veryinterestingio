		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A sail is a lifting body, like a wing. As long as the sail is in the right position it will generate lift; or create lower air pressure on the outside of the sail than the inside. When this happens the sail will, like an airplane wing, move towards the low pressure side. This creates movement, just like it does in an airplane. </p>
<p>The reason the sailboat moves forward instead of moving towards the lifting side of the sail is that the sail is connected to the boat, and the boat is in water, and the water has much more resistance than the air. So, the shape of the hull transfers the lifting force of the sail and turns it into forward motion. </p>
<p>So, a sail is basically an airplane wing that's vertical instead of horizontal, and the sailboat hull is the tool that transforms the sideways pull of the sail into forward motion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forces_on_sails" target="_blank">Ideally this is explained with force vectors - from above.</a>   Which is technically not ELI5, imo.</p>
<p>IN short - as is noted, the sail acts like (is) a wing, as air moves across it it generates LIFT ( a force).  This is NOT the same as being &quot;pushed on&quot; by the wind, as many people think how it works.</p>
<p>The Lift (force) of the wing is perpendicular ( right angle) to the wing, and a portion of this force is in the forward direction of the sailboat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say your car is facing (and being pushed) East, but you want to go North.</p>
<p>You can turn your steering wheel to your left, which is North in this case. Your car will turn, and its existing speed/momentum will carry it North. </p>
<p>In fact, if you turn just a <em>little bit North</em>, that force pushing you to the East will continue to speed you up. If you were facing completely North it wouldn't have any effect since it would try to push your tires sideways. But if you compromise you can travel Northeast, while you're being pushed East.</p>
<p>The part of the picture you're missing is that boats have a &quot;grip&quot; on the water that lets them convert a force (or momentum) in one direction to another direction. It's much like car tires which roll forwards, but don't slide sideways. This has to do with their hull design.</p>
<p>So the sail itself, despite all the complexities, is <strong>not</strong> pulling them forwards. It's mostly pushing them sideways. But the hull converts that into forward motion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you asking specifically about how &quot;square&quot; sails work, rather than about how sails work in general?</p>
<p>If so, then the important thing to understand is that square sails are not kept perpendicular to the direction the ship is moving in all the time. That's just their center position, which might be used if the ship is sailing directly downwind. However, if the ship is sailing across the wind, the sailors will rotate the horizontal beams the sails are attached to (the &quot;yards&quot;) around the masts so that the sail is at an angle to the wind, generating forwards thrust. <a href="https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/6e/11/f5/6e11f56313294ef7a3cc350a075fc38b.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a photo I googled up of a square rigged ship with its sails quite clearly angled.</a> The wind is clearly coming from the other side of that ship.</p>
<p>A lot of nautical jargon from the age of sail (which we'd probably think of as &quot;pirate talk&quot; these days) had to do with the specific details of how to manipulate the sails of a ship. Each rope and each part of each sail and mast had a specific name, so a captain could order the sailors to adjust the sails exactly how he wanted them.</p>
<p>For example, to rotate the sails the way I described above, each yard has a line running from each of its ends towards the rear of the ship (either on the deck or, for the upper yards, on a mast further back). Those lines ares called the &quot;braces&quot;. Each one will have its name qualified by the side of the ship it's on and the yard it's attached to. So a specific one would be called something like the &quot;starboard main top brace&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i'm probably wrong on a lot of this, but my amateur understanding from sailing is that sailboats all have what's called &quot;keel&quot; (on smaller boats it is removable and usually called a &quot;centerboard&quot;)  - this is essentially a part of the boat that extends below the waterline to a significant degree. it's not as tall as the sail is, it's probably usually about 1/4 of that height.</p>
<p>what happens is the wind pushes on the sail, which is attached to the mast, which is attached to the boat, and makes the boat tilt away from the wind. but the keel in the water resists this tilt due to the weight of the water acting upon on it. Since the force being applied to your now unbalanced craft must be vented somehow, this results in lateral motion (with relation to the wind)  of the entire boat. </p>
<p>since you've also got a &quot;bow&quot; (front) and a &quot;stern&quot; (back) on your craft, you're making it easier for the boat to go laterally in one direction than the other (ie, &quot;forwards&quot;). stick a rudder that can move back and forth on your stern and now you can steer the thing.</p>
<p>you can sail with the wind behind you, but you won't go as fast as you can when sailing &quot;sideways&quot; in what is essentially using the boat (sail/mast/keel system) as a <em>lever</em> to amplify the power of the wind. of course, you cannot sail directly into the wind, and so much of the skill in sailing is figuring out how to arrange your course (in a zig-zag) such that you can arrive at a location that might be  upwind of your starting point. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
