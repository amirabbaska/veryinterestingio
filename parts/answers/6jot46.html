<p>Every time we remember something we &quot;corrupt&quot; it just a little bit by reviewing it through our mind's eye. Each time you remember a car accident, we distort it a little bit at a time. Scientifically speaking, humans don't really &quot;remember&quot; things. We encode what we perceive, and while you might consider that a semantic distinction, it isn't. Human's have very limited attention spans that forced our brain to learn shortcuts to to maximize what we can perceive and cutting out as much 'noise' as possible. My previous sentence had a redundant 'to' that probably went unnoticed because you aren't really <em>reading</em>, you're basically engaging in pattern recognition. This extends to other aspects of memory as well. We encode what we think is important, distorting that information in the process, and we can't ever tell it's happening without an outside informant.</p>
<p>Often you aren't able to recall much at all, but if you sit in a familiar place, or hear a song all these memories associated with that setting can come flooding back to you, even decades later. Scientists aren't even sure how things are forgotten or if they're just integrating into the subconscious personality, just testing these kinds of things is incredibly difficult, but we have some accurate research that points to the depths of human memory...</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945208703423?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">piece of research</a> (I can't find any without the paywall, so apologies to those without a university account) done on synthesia. </p>
<p>It was essentially a test to see if there were any correlation between colors associated with letters among synthetics (people whose sensory inputs get scrambled, taste color, hear textures etc.), and there wasn't any correlation among any group except one...</p>
<p>Among synaesthetics born in the 1970's there was a massive portion of people that had identical colors associated with their letters. This generation had all grown up with Fisher Price <a href="https://i.imgur.com/LwTMkET.png" target="_blank">refrigerator magnets</a> as infants. </p>
<p>So how deep does memory go? Where does memory end and personality begin? When do we really &quot;forget&quot; things, if we forget at all? </p>
<p>Our brains are constantly building and rewiring and re-associating with all of our experiences, and it makes memory so <em>so</em> complicated that we simply don't have accurate answers to these questions right now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple question, not a simple answer. And it's not an either/or like you posit. </p>
<p>First, background. There are different types of memory.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Declarative (explicit) - these are factual memories we can explicitly recall. Further broken down into semantic (facts) and episodic (events)</p>
</li>
<li>Nondeclarative (implicit) - what we remember only in our actions.  This is broken into 4 groups: procedural skills (motor, perceptual, cognitive), priming (perceptual, semantic), conditioning, and nonassociative (habituation, sensitization). </li>
</ol>
<p>ok, next step. There's the natural decay of memory due to aging. Then there is losing memory due to physical trauma (bonked on the head) and then there is losing memory due to disease (alzheimers).  These later two are legit lost and never to be retrieved b/c the part of the brain required for that type of memory is gone b/c of surgery or other means. </p>
<p>For the natural decay of memory, it's also complicated. I think you're talking about memory retention and retrieval, rather than encoding and storage of memory. Is this right?  Because how memories are converted from working memory into long-term memory does have an impact on retention &amp; retrieval. For example,  if someone is in a heightened emotional state it can make it easier to encode the memory and also make it easier to recall if the person is primed. </p>
<p>Good times, right? </p>
<p>And then there are times our brain weirds out and we get deja vu and jamais vu situations. Something corrupts the retrieval of those memories and you get a sensation that &quot;this has happened before&quot; (deja vu) or in a familiar situation (like standing in your living room) you get the sensation of &quot;this doesn't feel familiar&quot;. </p>
<p>So, yeah, these are just some weird ways memory works or doesn't. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I studied psychology we learned that we never &quot;lose&quot; memories. Over time it is just harder for our brain to retrieve memories. The way memory works can be strange. When we think about a memory, we are remembering the thought of it, and the less we think of it the harder it is to remember. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alzheimer's research has some pretty cool insights into these kinds of questions. Most of what I learned neuroscience undergrad suggested that alzheimer's was the result of memories decaying by way of brain cell death. In other words, a deficit in storage or, as its also called, consolidation.</p>
<p>But some recent mouse studies indicate that alzheimer's can be explained by a deficit in <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v531/n7595/abs/nature17172.html" target="_blank">retrieval</a> rather than consolidation deficits. In other words, a deficit in the ability to recall memories rather than losing the memories themselves. </p>
<p>They show this by using optogenetics to directly reactivate a group of neurons involved in a memory that could no longer be activated by normal recall mechanisms. When the neurons were directly activated, the mouse recalled the otherwise-forgotten memory.</p>
<p>That isn't to say this is the only way that alzheimer's could work. But it does expand the possibilities I was taught in undergrad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's 3 am here so I'll be quick as someone else in day light will explain more. You could start by researching theories of forgetting. Both examples you've listed have been supported with evidence from a whole array of techniques. However, there are a lot of controls when it comes to memory. Your definition of &quot;begin to lose&quot; potentially may refer to ageing which can be an effect of disease caused by volumes of certain parts of the brain decreasing. Memory is very complicated, I hope this helps as no one else has responded. Good luck and good night. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
