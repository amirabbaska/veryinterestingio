		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>6 characters with the possibilities to have letters and numbers gives a total of 36^6 possibilities, or 2176782336 possibilities. If we use 7 characters it becomes 78364164096 possibilities. If we start using words and numbers, the amount of possibilities is a lot smaller. For example gfycat only uses combinations of words, which becomes very limited and has to add more words or characters to the URL in order to keep up with the amount of posts. </p>
<p>*imgur also makes a difference between upper and lower case letters, increasing the amount of possibilities to 62^6 (56800235584) or 62^7 ( 3.5216146e+12). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Six characters, if you allow upper case letters, lower case letters, and numbers, can represent 62^6 possibilities:  26^6 for upper case letters, plus 26^6 for lower case letters, plus 10^6 for numbers.</p>
<p>62^6 is 56,800,235,584, or just over 56 billion.  So with just six characters, you can link to 56 billion different images.</p>
<p>Add another character to make it 7, and you can represent 62^7 different images.  That's 3,521,614,606,208 or 3.5 <strong>trillion</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
