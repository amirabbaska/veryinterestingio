		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the MSDS of <a href="http://fileserve.newporthigh.co.uk/Manuals/Volume%207%20of%208/Buckingham%20Pools/16.%20HtH%20Calcium%20Hypochlorite%20tablets.pdf" target="_blank">HTH</a>, the source of chlorine for the disinfectant is calcium hypochlorite. It also contains some calcium hydroxide and calcium carbonate to keep the pH above 7 which prevents the creation and release of poisonous chlorine gas. I couldn't find any information on Clarity as a pool disinfectant. However, it is likely that the Clarity brand contained <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichloroisocyanuric_acid" target="_blank">Dichlor</a> which is an acid based pool disinfectant (pKa = \~6 for the non-chlorinated isocyanuric acid - dicloroisocyanuric acid will definitely be much more acidic). Mixing the acid pool disinfectant with the calcium hypochlorite produced green chlorine gas, which you observed, and a lot of heat.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT 1: Are you sure Clarity is specifically a pool disinfectant? I did some more digging and found a general peroxide disinfectant called <a href="http://www.peroxychem.com/chemistries/peracetic-acid/products/clarity" target="_blank">Clarity</a>. Peroxides also react with hypochlorites to generate heat but oxygen gas instead. This also removes the chlorine source giving dissolved chloride. I'm now unsure how the chlorine gas (which it what you seem to describe) is produced.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Clarity is most likely trichlor or dichlor which produces chlorine gas and a lot of heat when mixed with hypochlorites. This seems to be a very explosive reaction. see this <a href="https://www.chemaxx.com/pool_chemical_explosion5.htm" target="_blank">video</a> posted by u/Vew below.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on a guess I made deeper in the thread after some further research. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9irdom/what_could_have_caused_a_violent_reaction_between/e6m0wij/" target="_blank">https://old.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9irdom/what_could_have_caused_a_violent_reaction_between/e6m0wij/</a></p>
<p>You made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_trichloride" target="_blank">trichloramine</a>.  It is an oil that will sink to the bottom of the bucket.  It is a primary explosive that when shocked or heated will detonate violently (the person who discovered it lost some fingers on his hand).</p>
<p>The~~ <a href="https://cameochemicals.noaa.gov/chemical/9131" target="_blank">TRICHLORO-S-TRIAZINETRIONE </a> oops~~  <a href="http://phoenixproductsco.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Sodium-Dichlor-0030.pdf" target="_blank">Dichlor</a> in one mixture was acidified and as you can read from that link that acidification produces trichloramine.  Other commentators have noted the source of the acid.  You made it even more efficient as you added more sources of chlorine which increase the yield of the NCl3 production.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
