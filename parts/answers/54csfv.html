		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The entire premise of your question is <em>very</em> controversial in the field of academic linguistics. The biggest problem is that it's very difficult to put any idea of &quot;complexity&quot; on a solid methodological footing. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_complexity" target="_blank">The Wikipedia article on this topic</a> highlights some of these difficulties. Simply put there is a wealth of linguistic diversity, but it's not easy to see how you can meaningfully try and rank them according to some idea of complexity. Most modern languages can express the same words, concepts, and ideas, just in different ways. Different languages use different strategies to achieve complexity. Some work more by sticking different word pieces together (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agglutinative_language" target="_blank">agglutinative languages</a>), some use prepositions to tie words together (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isolating_language" target="_blank">isolating languages</a>), others make abundant use of different endings to convey information (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusional_language" target="_blank">inflected languages</a>). Most languages make use of all of these strategies to various extents. Moreover, this distinction is far from the only axis along which languages differ. </p>
<p>The only cases where the argument of reduced complexity is easier to make is for pidgin and creole languages. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin" target="_blank">pidgin</a> is a simplified language that usually arises when speakers of foreign languages try to find a common means to communicate. Slave societies are a common example where such a situation arose. These languages do indeed seem to have rather reduced expressive powers, hampered by a large degree of ambiguities. Related to pidgin languages are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creole_language" target="_blank">creoles</a>, which you can think of as the more mature version of a language arising out of a pidgin. However, in the case of creoles, it becomes much more difficult to argue that they are less complex than older languages. The biggest drawbacks of creoles are in terms of e.g. vocabulary for specialized terms. However, these short-comings are usually temporary and do not reflect an intrinsic inferiority in the respective languages.  For example, deficiencies in vocabulary can very quickly be plugged by adapting the necessary terms from other languages. In fact, virtually every single language in the world has taken advantage of such a strategy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Language complexity isn't really a thing. There is no such thing as a scale from less complex to more complex. Every language is equally effective, with <em>very</em> slight variation for circumstances important to the culture in question. </p>
<p>Some languages like English have up to 3 onset consonants, a diphthong, and 5 coda consonants (ur-example: strengths). Others, like Hawaiian, have only one onset consonant and one vowel.  Still other allow for triphthongs (Vietnamese), consonant nucleii (Berber), and other even more &quot;complex&quot; phonological constructions. </p>
<p>Some languages have purely isolating word formations (English and Chinese), where you have very few things ever appended to a word, everything is communicated through position. Other languages express the same concepts with lots and lots of affixes. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yup'ik: kaipiallrulliniuk<br />
English: The two of them were apparently really hungry. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some languages have no gender system whatsoever (English, Chinese, Persian), others have upwards of 24 different genders (Fulfulde)</p>
<p>In general, whenever you encounter a langage that is lacking in some form of &quot;complexity&quot; it picks it up by being more &quot;complex&quot; in some other dimension. There really is no such thing as one language being more &quot;complex&quot; than another. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple related notions that maybe someone more knowledgeable than I can speak on:</p>
<p>1) How does population literacy and communication network affect complexity of the kinds of ideas regularly dispersed?</p>
<p>2) What measures of language complexity are fair, if any? Vocabulary? </p>
<p>3) can anyone speak on complexity of ideas? For example, Greek sources are usually richer than their contemporaries, no? People like sophocles changed/invented new narrative structures and ways of telling stories, no?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>hi, I'm a linguist! <a href="https://global.oup.com/academic/product/measuring-grammatical-complexity-9780199685301?cc=cz&amp;lang=en&amp;" target="_blank">this book</a>, which Ive read some chapters from, has information on potential methods for measuring grammatical complexity.</p>
<p>as for the specific question: I've heard of studies that show a correlation between languages spoken among small communities (think 70-120 people) and relative syntactic or semantic complexity, however there is no reason to currently believe that any ancient language is more complex than any current language. generally speaking, we have the same cognitive faculties, so there should not be any significant difference in language complexity.</p>
<p>also, one potential way to measure complexity might be in &quot;information density&quot;, a measurement borrowed from Information Theory, related to Entropy, which has been used in:</p>
<p>Piantadosi, S.T., Tily, H. and Gibson, E., 2011. Word lengths are optimized for efficient communication. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 108(9), pp.3526-3529.</p>
<p>Jaeger, T.F. and Levy, R.P., 2006. Speakers optimize information density through syntactic reduction. In Advances in neural information processing systems (pp. 849-856).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
