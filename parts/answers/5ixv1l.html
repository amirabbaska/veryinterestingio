		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum mechanics divides particles into two types that obey different rules, fermions and bosons. Supersymmetry claims that, for every particle species, there is a partner species such that, of the two, one is a boson and the other's a fermion. If this is true, electrons (which are fermions) are partnered with selectrons (which would be bosons), and photons (which are bosons) are partnered with photinos (which would be fermions). In physics, &quot;symmetries&quot; are things that don't change the laws of physics, the idea being that, if you swap all particles with their partner species, the interactions are unchanged. (Well, not quite unchanged; the details depend on particle masses, and these undiscovered partners must have a lot more mass or we'd have found them by now.) But supersymmetry is the only unconfirmed symmetry nature can have, given the constraints of quantum mechanics and relativity.</p>
<p>Particles and their supersymmetric partners have similar interactions with the Higgs field. There's a technical problem with the theory of Higgs bosons that can be easily solved if high-mass supersymmetric partners exist. And some attempts to explain gravity in the same terms as other forces in nature require supersymmetry to work. Supergravity is one such approach; another is string theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
