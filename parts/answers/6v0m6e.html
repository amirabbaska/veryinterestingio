		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chief Mate here.  There aren't a lot of details regarding this incident yet, so it's pretty hard to make an educated guess about the specifics that led to the collision.  I did read that the collision occurred in the Malacca Strait, which is an incredibly busy vessel traffic area.  Definitely in the top 5 on the planet.  The tanker was making 10 knots, which probably puts it in compliance with Rule 6 in the Collision Regulations; safe speed.  Prior to the collision, the destroyer lost steering, but it was repaired before the accident.  No details on how long the steering wasn't functional, but in that situation the destroyer would be considered a vessel &quot;not under command&quot;, and would have the right of way over just about any other vessel on the water.  Both vessels had checked into a traffic separation scheme, which is basically a highway for controlling flows of vessel traffic.  They were being monitored by the appropriate marine traffic services.  The collision happened at around 0524, which means the watchkeeper on the tanker was most likely the Chief Mate, but given the area they were navigating in, there's a good possibility the Captain was on the bridge as well.  I'm not a navy guy, so I don't know who would've been in charge of the watch on the destroyer.</p>
<p>Now, there's a lot to consider when assessing the risk of collision.  A lot more than anyone would realize who hasn't worked in the industry before.  Yes, there is a lot of navigational equipment (compass, radar, ARPA, AIS, ECS/ECDIS) available to us to try to properly determine that risk.  All of these can fail though. For example, your gryo compass might be feeding the heading information to your radar and AIS.  If someone hasn't checked for compass error, your heading and course-over-ground could be significantly comprised, as well as the true vectors of the vessels you're monitoring.  Or maybe it's dark and there's heavy rain.  That can render a 10cm radar virtually useless for accurate target identification.  In high traffic areas VHF communication isn't always the best idea.  In fact there's areas of the world were VHF communication for passing arrangements is forbidden.  I could ramble on about this even more than I already have, but it's 5am here, and I kinda want to get some sleep.  I'll just finish off with saying that if both vessel involved in the collision were being monitored by MTS, then their movents up to the accident have most likely been recorded.  You'll know who was at fault soon enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the best answer without regard to equipment failures, sabotage, or ineptitude has to deal with the fact that large ships cannot easily turn.</p>
<p>Go to Lowes. Load up a flatbed cart with 500lbs of concrete. Now you can move that cart through the store. It is hard to get moving but once you do you can even maneuver it through the aisles and around obstacle. However it takes a long time to stop. There are no brakes. Further you have to plan your turns well ahead of time to account for the change in inertia (help I don't actually know anything about physics). </p>
<p>So the simplest answer to why large ships can't simply turn away from each other is that it takes a long time to stop or turn something that heavy. And they don't have brakes.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There can be a lot of factors.</p>
<p>When two ships are on collision course, they both have to be alert. According to laws at sea, this (of course) has to be stopped. The ship with the other vessel on it's port side (left) has to wait for the other ship to pass or manoeuvre around it's backside to avoid crashing. Typically they communicate over a VHF radio, as to be clear who does what. But as we humans are programmed, mistakes happen.
It can be slow reaction time from both ships, which can result in collision (huge ships take some time and distance to steer either left or right, even to come to a complete stop or setting the engine in reverse). So the captains and officers on the Bridge must keep their eyes open at all times, especially in ports and seas with heavy traffic (China and Suez Channel for example). (I know your question is in open water but you get the idea)
It can be weather conditions as well. In heavy fog, ships must rely on their GPS systems (most ships and companies use this, to locate nearby vessels). They also have to send sound signals as to locate themselves to others, and tell which way they are steering their ship. But it's like driving on a highway in heavy rain, the view is very limited, which as well can cause confusion and collisions.</p>
<p>A lot of factors plays a part in collision, whether it is human error or mechanical disfunction it does happen. I hope this answers your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pure and utter incompetence. US naval vessels have equipment specifically designed to avoid this. Two incidents of this caliber within a year is completely unacceptable. What's worse, I doubt anyone responsible for this mistake on any high command level will lose their job. The low-level officers will have their careers destroyed. Not to say that it shouldn't but, the buck will stop very low on the totem pole. </p>
