<p>It depends on the particular hospital and program you are using, but you absolutely can have contact between donor and recipient if both agree to it.  The initial contact is organized through the transplant center, so that neither side feels &quot;obligated&quot; to talk to the other if they don't want to.  If both agree, then it is off to the races.</p>
<p>Some people choose not to, though.  You have to go through <em>a lot</em> of psychological testing to donate because they want to ensure that you aren't going to be upset if the recipient doesn't live their life in a way you feel is &quot;befitting&quot; the gift you gave them.  Recipients may not want that kind of pressure, or they may not want to talk to them out of guilt or a sense of debt.</p>
<p>It is a really personal decision and I can totally understand why people may not want to be contacted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't much upside and a lot of downside to knowing.  An organ donor might feel the recipient owes them, or the family of a deceased donor might try to forge an inappropriate relationship.  They could chastise the owner for not taking care of their gift as well as they might, or feel the donation was meaningless if they person died anyway.  It is better to make sure everyone has become comfortable with the new situation before contact is made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also has a lot to do with HIPAA (healthcare privacy laws) and PHI (protected health information). </p>
<p>Even though you may have gotten an organ from someone, or gave an organ to someone - you do not get to know who they are because of the above laws. This would mean the hospital is sharing protected information. You can however sign consents to then be able to share that information. </p>
<p>I do know at times we can be very vague about situations. Example - “your kidney came from a young adult”. If you were told “your kidney came from a 33 year old male” you may be able to do enough research and find out who that is. A simple search could reveal the day you got a kidney, was the same day a 33 year old male died in a car accident in your area. The less the hospitals share, the better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both the donor family and recipient have to agree to communication. Sometimes it takes a while for the donor family to be ready.
Most recipients want to thank their donor family immediately by know grieving takes time. </p>
<p>I was lucky and was a living donor recipient as my aunt was my donor. Got to see her last week. It was fun. Coming up on my 9th liverversary in September! </p>
