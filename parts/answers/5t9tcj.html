		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The butchers will remove the fat before grinding the meat and add it back in at whatever ratio they need. My butcher will usually only go up to 40/60 but we go way back so he gives me 50/50. It's good to have friends in the business. </p>
<p>*since people are messaging me the same question I figured I would answer here. The highest ratio I have tried is 70/20. Slightly too soft for my preference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure about exact percentages, but it's done by weight.  I worked for a butcher and the fat trimmings from other cuts of meat were kept in a huge bin. They would buy huge boxes of frozen beef and you would take out 80lbs of that and then use your own 20lbs of fat trimmings and then you combine the two in the grinding process to get your 80%.  But they also buy both from the distributor in big 50lb boxes. (Either beef trimmings or fat trimmings) then all you do is combine it into your desired percentage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I use to work in a meat department and when we ground the 85% from all of the butchers trim, we had a little quality control device of sorts. </p>
<p>It basically cooked a measured amount of beef from the batch, about a half a dollar sized dollop worth.</p>
<p>The fat drains into a test tube and the lines on the tube indicated the amount of fat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked as a meat cutter for a few years.</p>
<p>We ground our own meat daily, so we would do a round of ground chuck, and a rounf of ground round.</p>
<p>For ground chuck we would do two things - take the steaks that were expiring for sale that day, and add them to some primal chuck cuts (front shoulder.)  We would then add in trimmings from the previous days steak trim we kept in a tub in the fridge overnight.  </p>
<p>For ground round, we would take straight peeled knuckles from the back hip area, and add in the same trimmings.  We would run 85/15 for chuck, and 80/20 for round.  We added less fat to the chuck, as we were also putting in steaks with fat included, plus the chuck cuts themselves have fat throughout.  So, the 15 or 20 was the added amount, not necessarily the amount you were getting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My butcher does math and then uses a scale. </p>
<p>A bit of information on the process.  Our grocery store gets beef in two ways.  One is a tube of ground beef, the other is vacuum sealed primal cuts.  From your primals you get items like a sizzler steaks, rib steaks, spencer steaks, bottom round roasts, et cetera.  In order to get these from the primal, we use an item like a band saw or a knife to cut them into smaller parts than the slaughterhouse sends us.  During this process we'll trim fat and bone from the meat and put it in a big plastic bin.  Now we buy beef by the case, but that case's prize is set by it's weight, so trimming trims from our margins too.  Because we have a meat grinder, however, we can buy tubes of grinds at 83/17 instead of 80/20, and then just add the extra 2% in trim.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
