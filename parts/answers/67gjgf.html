		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>E = mc^(2) does not represent your total energy. It's the total energy of a free particle (or system of particles) in a reference frame where the total momentum of the system is zero.</p>
<p>If you're at rest in a Newtonian gravitational potential well V, your total energy is E = mc^(2) + V.</p>
<p>Changing V does not change <em>your</em> mass at all. However V is not a property of <em>you</em>, it's a property of the entire Earth-you system. And changing your location relative to the source of the potential changes the potential energy of the system as a whole.</p>
<p>If you were to write down the mass of the entire system, that's simply equivalent to the total energy in a reference frame where the total momentum is zero. So the total mass of the system is given by</p>
<p>M<em><em>tot</em></em>^(2) = (M<em><em>planet</em></em> + m<em><em>you</em></em> + V)^(2), (c = 1).</p>
<p>The potential energy of interaction between you and the planet contributes to the mass of the <strong>system as a whole</strong>. Although if you just consider the system to be you, and the planet to be external, then V is treated like an external potential, and it doesn't affect your mass, but you're not a free particle in this system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>E_0 = mc^2 represents your <em>rest</em> energy, the energy stored in rest mass (the mass you have when completely still). It does NOT include any kinetic energy. </p>
<p>The full formula for massed and massless particles, with motion, would be:</p>
<p>E^2 = ( mc^2 )^2 + ( pc )^2, where p is your momentum.</p>
<p>The formula for momentum is p = mv for objects with mass, or more accurately p = γmv. γ here is the lorentz factor: 1/sqrt(1- v^2 / c^2 ), which only becomes relevant at very high speeds. There's also p = h / λ, where h is the planck constant and λ is wavelength, which also counts for massless particles.</p>
<p>Here's also another formula for massed particles that our physics curriculum preferred:</p>
<p>E = γmc^2</p>
<p>If we're not dealing with relativistic speeds, you could probably use the classical formula for kinetic energy instead, and get:</p>
<p>E = mc^2 + 0.5<em>m</em>v^2</p>
<p>Which seems to be giving me approx. equal answers until we get to v&gt;0.4c, which is when it's about 1% off. v = 0.68c is when it gets to be 10% off, and v=0.94c is when it gets 50% off target.</p>
<p>Ninja edit:</p>
<p>TL;DR the total energy is the rest energy, E_0, plus the kinetic energy, E_k</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The system which is gaining potential energy isn't merely you, but you and the Earth.  Assuming the elevator is using terrestrial power it's just potential energy changing from the form of chemical or nuclear energy to gravatational potential energy so the energy and mass of the system remain constant.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, you were made of rubber and stretched out so as to gain potential energy contained entirely in your body, your mass would actually increase as a result.</p>
<p>This guy gives a really good explanation of mass and potential energy: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKzgpt4HBU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gSKzgpt4HBU</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>E=mc^2 for the closed system. You. The energy contained within your mass.</p>
<p>You at the top of an elevator have exactly the same E=mc^2 because E=mc^2 gives no shits about anything other than you.</p>
<p>The potential energy is entirely down to you and the earth. Both things. It's the potential energy between you and the Earth. Not you on your own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I (somehow) understand what people are saying here, I question whether or not the person on the elevator has actually gained any potential energy at all. Wouldn't you only gain potential energy, via being elevated, if you were elevated away from a resting state? Unless I fling myself off the elevator, my potential energy would stay the same as me standing on the roof, where I would have the same resting state as me on the ground (minutely different from being at a higher elevation, as I understand).  </p>
<p>TLDR: You don't gain potential energy by standing at a higher elevation, right?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
