		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The air isn't 100% clean. Microscopic particles are all around you at all times. You can see this by using a strong flashlight in a dark room. These particles consist of anything from human skin cells (which we shed daily), pollen, small human hair, microscopic space dust dust coming from space and even the roads around your house as cars break down the surface over time and that creates dust. All this enters your house when you walk inside, through vents or windows etc. and eventually settles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carried in to a building on people and their clothing, or entrained in air that infiltrates into the building. No normal buildings are air-tight, there is air moving in &amp; an equal flow rate moving out, all the time. Carried in on air supplied intentionally for ventilation; clean room ventilation systems are complex and have several stages of filtration. Some places require you to wear a CSI disposable suit and shower on the way in.</p>
<p>If you want to keep dust  down, the answer is a positive pressure ventilation system, so that filtered air is supplied and more air leaks out than leaks in. There was a study done years ago ( I can't quote a source, I don't recall where I read it) examining various energy saving heating systems. Positive pressure ventilation with heat recovery was effective <em>IF</em> you included savings in cleaning labour (vacuum cleaning) and materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
