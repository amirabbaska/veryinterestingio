<p>They reuse the still after it is drawn once. If they need another angle the original still is used for reference. These stools are larger than the frame and you can move them with the shot to get different backgrounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For TV Japanese animation (anime) there is a set hierarchy for animation since they need to crank out a half-hour animation episode every WEEK, a much tighter production cycle than movies which can take years to fully animate.</p>
<p>Before the animation starts, character models are provided by a specialized character designer. These feature extremely detailed images of each character from all angles and highlight certain accessories that the character might carry. When you buy art books for a series, they will generally contain the original character designs from these character designers. This is generally done before production so that all animators can be consistent with designs.</p>
<p>On the directing side, a very roughly drawn storybook will detail all the animated parts in the episode. This is passed to the production side which will convert the storybook into an animated episode.</p>
<p>The animation director will assign certain parts of the storybook to key animators . The &quot;key&quot; means keyframes which are the beginning and ends of transitions in animation. These animators will draw in images of the major events in the episode.</p>
<p>Once the keyframes are done, the work goes to in-between animators (most junior position) that fill in the all the animation transitions between the keyframes.</p>
<p>Along all the steps, the results are checked over the production staff. However, since there is a great deal of time pressure, not all of the mistakes can be fixed.</p>
<p>Because there are so many people involved, the quality of the animation can be quite variable. Certain animation studios are known for high standards while others can be rather sloppy.</p>
<p>If you want to see more about how it works, you should watch Shirobako, an anime about making anime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It is amazing! First all the artists incredible draftspeople
Check out James Baxter - WTF?!
<a href="https://youtu.be/WcydhJ-_eu0" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/WcydhJ-_eu0</a></p>
<p>So they have a supervisor who designs the character (and each character prolly has its own supervisor) - and goes over all the “key drawings” to make sure things are “on model” for the character...
(For example Aladdin was glen Keane and the genie was Eric Goldberg - Jasmine was Mark Hen (I think))</p>
<p>The supervisors release things like model sheets
<a href="https://www.google.ca/search?q=disney+model+sheet&amp;rlz=1CDGOYI_enCA683CA685&amp;hl=en-US&amp;tbm=isch&amp;prmd=isvn&amp;source=lnms&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj7xY35s8rbAhVC2IMKHUQ3DDYQ_AUIESgB&amp;biw=414&amp;bih=660&amp;dpr=3" target="_blank">model sheets</a> </p>
<p>That’s also why Disney has a specific “Style” - all the characters in all the movies kinda look similar - same with studio Gibli in Japan / the consistent style means the artists already have a head start - because they draw in that style.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, Disney and other animation studios have trained professionals who all use a master style sheet for reference.</p>
<p>A studio can have hundreds of animators, but not each animator is expected to be able to work on anything that needs to be done. The project will be delegated into smaller teams and the art director(s) will make sure everything that each group produces matches stylistically. One group of animators may be responsible for specific characters, while another may be responsible for another set of characters. Other groups may work on animals or vehicles or environments, etc. Of course, the amount of delegation will vary with how big the studio is.</p>
<p>A good art director will monitor the production to make sure the the end product looks cohesive and consistent, but sometimes even the best studios will have inconsistencies. A good example is the character Jumba in Lilo and Stitch. The size of the Jumba’s head shifts very noticeably towards the end of the film. This was due to an entire sequence where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqh-kEPYr5s" target="_blank">Stitch hijacks a 747 and flys it through skyscrapers</a> having to be cut. The film was due to release in the summer of 2002, but was deep into production before 9/11. (There is also another section where Jumba fires a gun at Stitch, which got poor feedback from test-screening). Disney couldn’t include these segments into film, but they didn’t have enough time to reanimate those sections of the movie and the sections were significant to the story so they aren’t able to cut it out entirely. They ended up outsourcing the reanimating job to a studio in Korea, which handled the material fairly well, but didn’t quite match up to everything Disney produced in-house.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
