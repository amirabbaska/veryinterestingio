		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your phone can turn off the flow of electricity from the charge port to the battery just like the millions of other transistors inside can shut off flow of current to represent a '0'. In their simplest form, a transistor acts like an electronic valve. There isn't a direct wire. In fact you couldn't use a direct wire, it would damage the battery to simply connect it to a constant 5 volts. Even when charging normally, the circuits inside the phone are constantly varying the voltage and current flow to the battery so that it charges most effectively without wearing out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there are several ways that a cell phone could prevent itself from charging from a given charger. I don't know the specifics of Apple technology, so I'm not sure which method is being applied, but here are the two most likely scenarios:</p>
<p>1) The Apple charger digitally communicates with the phone. This would require some sort of microcontroller in the charger, and the communication would likely be some sort of embedded systems communications protocol like I2C or SPI. This approach could help with battery life / charging efficiency, or more likely, it's just a cash grab (because most companies put the smart charging technology in the phone and their phones are charger-agnostic).</p>
<p>2) Your charger isn't providing enough amperage. The USB standard dictates 5V of potential, but the amperage can vary. My Samsung phone gives me an error saying that charging isn't optimized if I use an off-brand charger with limited amperage output. When I buy a third party charger (e.g. a car cigarette lighter USB), I make sure that it's rated for at least 2A. Then it charges just fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s little bit more complicated than “flowing energy”.</p>
<p>If you have an USB charger, it will have 4 wires.
5 Volts, data+, data- and Ground. 5V and Ground are the two wires completing the power circuit, like battery + and -. Since a charger does not need digital communication, the two data lines are used to identify the charger capabilities by setting these at a specific voltage defined by Apple. Indicating if it’s a 1 Ampere charger (iPhone) or a 2A (iPad) or any different.</p>
<p>Once you plug in the phone it detects the signals and determines if everything is correct.  </p>
<ul>
<li>is it a genuine accessory/cable.</li>
<li>Is it 5 Volts?  </li>
<li>Is it a USB Host?</li>
<li>Is it a charger?</li>
<li>Can it provide enough ampere.
Charge!</li>
</ul>
<p>Then it starts charging the battery at the rate the phone wants, or the maximum the charger can supply.</p>
<p>Simply put, for the phones perspective, the only thing separating genuine Apple chargers from fake ones is the identification voltages on the data signals, and the quality of the 5V regulation. </p>
<p>Apple also put some chips in the Lightning plug that do some authentication if the cable is genuine and some basic power quality test. Once the cable is approved it does not play part in charging anymore, besides being a wire.</p>
<p>If the charger does not have a USB type A socket, this authentication chip will be inside the charger, and can be a fake one as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
