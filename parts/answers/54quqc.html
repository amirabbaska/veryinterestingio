		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems like this question was already fairly well answered but I'd like to add to what /u/blipsman said a bit. </p>
<p>Most congressional races are lightly contested if contested at all. Meaning that very often incumbents have such a substantial lead, through name recognition and having an established track record, that their opponent doesn't stand much of a chance. Beyond that, it's not unusual for a strong incumbent to run entirely unopposed simply because any real challenger that would enter the race knows better than to take on a strong incumbent and instead will look for a weaker incumbent in another district or wait until a strong one is nearing retirement. </p>
<p>What's amazing to me is that congress, as a whole, has an incredibly abysmal approval rating and has for a long time (I don't know the exact numbers but it usually hovers in the high teens and low 20's). Americans overwhelmingly feel congress does a poor job but they usually like THEIR congressmen. This is partially because of what the incumbent has done for their own district or state but that's also part of the problem. Congressmen largely look out for their own electorate to the detriment of the nation as a whole because it gets them reelected. So what people dislike is OTHER congressmen acting selfishly for their districts and neglecting the good of the nation but when it comes to their own district or state people have no complaints.</p>
<p>That, IMO, is why congressional elections aren't covered nearly as much. Short of a recent scandal, major policy misstep, or shift in local political philosophy, people love their districts and states incumbent politicians and those incumbents are almost guaranteed to win anyway so why bother covering it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this can be attributed to a few things:</p>
<p>1) Media incompetence
The media can't even cover meaningful issues on the 2 candidates due to eventually run for President; now imagine them trying to craft a meaningful dialogue about THOUSANDS of candidate, many of whom have 1/10000 of a history in the spotlight as our current candidates. Can you even name 10 topics that each candidate is passionate about? How about 10 things they are for, 10 things they are against, and 10 things they are promising to fix (specifically; i.e. no &quot;JOBS!&quot; answer) Despite 24/7 coverage of news, not a single outlet talks at all, in any detail, about actual policies, plans, and initiatives that the candidates want to carry out. It's kind of mind-numbing. Furthermore, with how much &quot;garbage&quot; news is out there (I.e. Buzzfeed articles with 0% validity, stupid memes, clickbait websites that don't have any facts/only opinions stated as facts, etc) it's really quite hard to determine where some of these stories even come from. Lastly, with the death of local newspapers en masse, we just don't have as much local coverage of... well, anything.</p>
<p>2) Public ignorance.
See the above post. There are people who believe in Flat Earth theory. There are people who believe that all Republicans are inherently evil, and that all Democrats are inherently imbeciles. There are people who believe things simply because they can, despite no factual evidence of any kind. Consider how regularly our candidates flop on their opinions on a weekly basis, on camera, only to deny a stance they've held for years. Most people are simply unable/unwilling to keep up with all the lies, deception, and misinformation from 2 people; imagine trying to convince people to keep up with dozens of local candidates! Want to test the theory? Ask people about the following things, and see if any light bulbs pop off:</p>
<p>Trans-Pacific Partnership</p>
<p>Ecuador and Chevron</p>
<p>Automation</p>
<p>Aleppo</p>
<p>Berta Caceres</p>
<p>John Ashe</p>
<p>Scotland Estates</p>
<p>The Crimea Penninsula</p>
<p>You probably won't get a lot of light bulbs. By the same token, try the following Buzzwords:</p>
<p>Rosie O'Donnell</p>
<p>Clinton Foundation</p>
<p>Border Wall</p>
<p>China</p>
<p>Email server</p>
<p>ISIS</p>
<p>Benghazi</p>
<p>etc</p>
<p>The difference between what people THINK matters, and what actually matters is pretty staggering, and yet I'd be willing to bet that at least 7/10 Americans can't tell me much, if anything, about the top column.</p>
<p>3) Voter apathy.
Many voters simply haven't heard of their local candidates. You can attribute this to #1 and 2 technically, but even moreso, it's because many local candidates have never been heard of or made any effort to be discovered before election season. Could you name your local school's superintendent, or any of their policies? How about some initiatives from your Mayor? Who is on City Council where you live? Most people can't name that, and in many cases, these are the folks who (ultimately) end up becoming governors, representatives, senators, etc. </p>
<p>4) Decline of debate quality
There was a time, believe it or not, when the debate actually seemed like a debate. People who were articulate actually were able to win elections solely for SOUNDING educated. Nowadays, the &quot;Debates&quot;, if you can even call them that, are just pissing contests that come off a lot like &quot;NO I DIDN'T!&quot;, &quot;YES YOU DID!&quot;, &quot;NUH UH!&quot;, &quot;UH HUH!&quot;. Did you learn anything about your candidates in the last 6 debates? Do you feel like they answered questions well, or discussed their proposed policies and plans? Do you feel they stayed on subject, were moderated well, and were concise and to the point? No? Neither did anyone else.</p>
<p>5) The Two Party System
Imagine if you knew that you were neither a Democrat, nor a Republican, yet also knew there would be no additional option to select. In my opinion, this contributed largely to #3, as people weren't being represented, and as such started going &quot;Well, I'm CLOSER to being a Democrat than a Republic, so I'll just vote &quot;D&quot; down the board. This problem has been further exacerbated by the willful neglect of third party candidates, such as Stein, Johnson, etc, by the media and political system. Furthermore, the combined lobbying efforts of these two parties can practically bury any attempt to breach into the field by simply buying more media time, more experts, etc to ensure that aspiring candidates are unseen, unheard, and unknown.</p>
<p>It's a messy problem that has arisen over decades of keeping voters uninformed and out of the loop. It's funny because transparency was a large issue many decades ago, but with the age of the internet, you would have expected that to have dissipated. Alas, instead of using it to inform ourselves, the 'net just becomes saturated with even more garbage, making it even more off-putting to really dig up dirt on your candidates accurately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're not national.  So it's going to be covered by local news, not national outlets to much of an extent.  If there's 140 seats up for election, even if they gave it as much time as one presidential race, each individual race would receive 1/140th of the attention.  Congressional races are more important than the presidential, in most cases.  And in most things <strong>you</strong> probably care about, state and local elections are even more important.  Your state legislature controls a lot of shit in your area and if you live in a big city, your city councilpeople do, too.</p>
<p>But, of course, those won't receive as much attention, either.  It's on you to get out there and find out about the issues and the candidates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The do get coverage, but there are a few reasons why they don't get as much national coverage...</p>
<p>1) Very few races are actually competitive. Between gerrymandering of House districts and states' entrenched political slants, maybe 50 of the 470 Congressional seats are actually races of any kind.</p>
<p>2) The races that are actual races, all that matters is the local voters. So here in Illinois, there is a lot of coverage of the Mark Kirk/Tammy Duckworth race for Senate because it's a close race with the incumbent behind in the polls.</p>
<p>3) TRUMP. His constant antics are distracting the media away from everything else, even the more substantive issues of the presidential election. For example, this AM more coverage is going to Trump calling a former Miss Universe fat/Miss Piggy than analysis of the different plans to create jobs presented in the debate last night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an example of a 'non race'</p>
<p>Gregory Meeks, voted the most corrupt congressman in America, (he took a $40,000 bribe and seems to have lost funds that were raised for Haitian earthquake survivors) has a job for life. He has a group of core supporters in Jamaica and Hollis, Queens (Democrat in NYC) who will vote for him unless he does something horrendous. Often he runs unopposed as the Republicans don't bother to field a candidate due to gerrymandering and NY's high barrier to entry. </p>
<p>So, I can talk to my friends, family and neighbors about what a corrupt clown this guy is till I am blue in the face, but I need to wait for this guy to retire or die before there is even a small chance for meaningful change in my Congressional district.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
