<p>Stretching your question further, <a href="http://schools.birdville.k12.tx.us/cms/lib2/TX01000797/Centricity/Domain/912/ChemLessons/Lessons/Phases%20and%20Changes/image022.jpg" target="_blank">reducing the ambient pressure</a> will also marginally increase the melting temperature. (Or greatly increasing pressure, but then you won't get the familiar type of ice crystals.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This phenomenon is called freezing point depression, and for lower concentrations of the solute, it happens independently of the properties of the solute in question. So, the answer to your question would be no, because this process happens as long as something is dissolved in the water, regardless of what that substance is (again, for lower concentrations).</p>
<p>A way to explain it is that when the solvent is freezing, and the molecules join the solid phase and leave the liquid phase, there is a smaller volume of liquid in which the solute is dissolved, so the entropy of the solute decreases, regardless of what that solute is, since at lower concentrations the interactions derived from the solute's properties are negligible.</p>
<p>Now, the solution's freezing point CAN increase if you go above a certain solute concentration, because then the interaction between solute particles becomes relevant. Consider then a solute that is miscible in water and, when in its pure state, has a higher freezing point than the solvent (such as acetic acid, with a freezing point of 16,6°C / 61,9°F). At lower concentrations, freezing point depression will be observed, but at some concentration, the solution's freezing point will increase. The freezing point of an acetic acid solution, depending on the concentration of acetic acid, looks something like <a href="https://archives.library.illinois.edu/erec/University%20Archives/1505050/Organic/OrgLab/PhaseDiagrams/diagram.gif" target="_blank">this</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there are any. Such a substance would have to increase the chemical potential of the liquid phase, which is not possible by the normal rules of colligative properties.</p>
<p>There are substances that can increase the rate of water freezing, for example <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_ice-nucleation_proteins" target="_blank">certain proteins</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>assuming all other conditions are the same, short answer, no. </p>
<p>Longer answer, the reason salts or other disolvants lower the freezing point is that it interrupts the formation of ice crystals (somewhat of a simplification). </p>
<p>However if you mix water wig something that has a higher freezing/melting point than pure DI water, and can mix i to the crystal structure of water, then it could potentially raise the melting point. It would need to be water soluble, and a liquid in base form most likely,  or it would cause the same issue as other materials. But i cant think of anything off hand that has similar enough behavior to water for this to be possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
