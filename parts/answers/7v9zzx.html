		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that has a large amount of CO2 dissolved in solution is essentially carbonic acid.  H2O + CO2 =&gt;  H2CO3 which dissolves into HCO3-  and H+ which makes it acidic.  Drinking said solution quickly means an increased exposure to this acid which is painful.</p>
<p>Edit: Others are saying that the carbon dioxide bubbles coming out of solution while being drunk are abrasive to the throat and that is what causes the pain! Sorry about my first statement, I always thought that it was painful due to the acidity!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Explained like you're 5:  Because the bubbles actually make small amounts of burn-y acids in your throat. More bubbles, more burn.</p>
<p>Edit: I've read the rules, thanks! My response  was meant to have some humor while still being &quot;layman's terms&quot;. If you have an explanation that someone without more than a cursory knowledge of chemistry could comprehend, by all means, post it.</p>
<p>Edit 2: some grammatical stuff</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Comments about acidity are incorrect. Soda water is about as acidic as apple juice, which doesn’t burn like soda does. Soda burns because CO2 activates pain receptors in your mouth and nose similar to mustard and horseradish, although not to quite the same extent.</p>
