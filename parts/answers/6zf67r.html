		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, we're actually not. That is to say, the scientists aren't focusing on that. Neil deGrasse Tyson said it best: &quot;No, I don't think Mars is a suitable plan B. I want us to go to Mars, yes, but we're not going to be able to flee Earth FOR Mars, and you know why? Because once we have the technology to terraform and make Mars like Earth, we'll have the technology to simply make Earth like Earth again.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also a numbers game.  Suppose we found more space here on earth for more people.. now.. where do you get the food for all of them, where do  you get trees to build them houses or to make toilet paper for all their bums?  What do you do with all their waste?  More people = more of a burden on the planet as a whole, we cannot keep adding people because we are already at a point where we are using resources up faster than they can be replaced.  Our population numbers have already driven thousands of other species to extinction in the last 100 years...</p>
<p>We cannot keep adding people here.. we need to find other places elsewhere or figure out how to control our numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would say that we're NOT very focused on it overall, given NASA's relative budget.  But a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What if the Earth is destroyed or rendered uninhabitable?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learning for the sake of learning!  Don't you want to know if life existed outside earth?  Don't you want to see what it's like to step onto another goddamn planet?  Not everyone feels this way but I think that human curiosity should be spoken to.</p>
</li>
<li>We could achieve other goals in the process, even in the short term.  Many, many everyday technologies were developed in the process of working toward space exploration, and a task as daunting as Mars colonization would demand quite a few man-made miracles.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having two houses is better than having one house.</p>
<p>If all you do is improve and renovate the house you live in now (Earth) you are still homeless if a disaster totally ruins your house (epidemic, climate, something else) and being &quot;planet homeless&quot; means you as a species are dead.</p>
<p>If you have a crappy second home in a cave way over there (Mars), when your nice home gets purged by Hurricane Irma you still have somewhere from which to begin to recover.</p>
<p>That's only one reason but the one you seem most interested in, I think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
