<p>Last year, physicists observed a neutron star collision that caused a gravitational wave and a burst of gamma rays to be detected at nearly the exact same time, proving that they travel at the same speed, c.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking about the experimental evidence, then there's astronomical evidence as u/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/xYaldabaoth" target="_blank">xYaldabaoth</a> pointed out.</p>
<p>If you're asking for mathematical proof, then one can show that the gravitational waves follow from the Einstein equations for gravity in a low intensity field regime. In that regime, the equation literally is a &quot;wave equation&quot; and the parameter indicating the speed is exactly the speed of light. Or more correctly, the wave equation describing light waves and the wave equation describing gravitational waves possess the same speed parameter, which we call the &quot;speed of light&quot; but probably should more appropriately be named the &quot;Einstein constant&quot; or something like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
