<p>To sum up the article (correct me if I'm wrong), it's basically about the complexity of the material and how many surfaces there are.</p>
<p>Cloth is made up of lots of fibers all woven together, so there are a lot of air-cloth surfaces in there. So when light hits the cloth, it gets bounced all about in lots of directions, and not a lot of it gets all the way through to the other side.</p>
<p>When the cloth gets wet, all those little fibers swell up and stick to each other, so instead of the many surfaces you had before, you now have almost a big block of one material, with only a front surface and back surface. So the light can go straight through.</p>
<p>It also helps that water makes clothing stick to your skin. Usually clothing hangs kind of loose, so there's a good air cushion between it and your skin. So the color of your skin doesn't really get through. But when the clothes are wet, they cling right on to your skin, allowing it to show.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The same thing happens to cotton fibers. They're fluffy, and the water pins down the fluff, which lets you see through the holes in the weave. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
