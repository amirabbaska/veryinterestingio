<p>Does your work have a therapeutic end goal or is it just basic research?</p>
<p>Is P53's mode of action well understood?</p>
<p>What do you think of the potential for CRISPR  and related technologies for treating cancer by selectively targeting sequences of DNA, if that's not too far outside the scope of your work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! In a tissue engineering course I took last spring we were shown the results from an experiment that looked at the impact on longevity in mice when repressing, as well as over-expressing p53. </p>
<p>Without the gene the mice were prone to develop tumors, but an over-expression of p53 also lowered life expectancy, possibly because it caused otherwise healthy cells to undergo apoptosis. Did you see the same results in your studies with mice? If not, do you have a hypothesis as to why?</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this question is answered in the report you linked, but I had some trouble opening the .pdf.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Is it possible that whales and other large animals have another mechanism to explain the paradox, such as multiple copies of pRb or CD95?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello Vinny,</p>
<p>Do the 20 extra P53 genes mean that elephants are even less likely to have tumors? Is it a 20x correlation?</p>
<p>Also, if this is why elephants avoid cancers, what's the explanation for whales? Is there the possibility that late sea mammals have their own genetic cocktail for avoiding cancer that we could combine with the P53 research you're doing?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
