		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With videos you can select preffered audience and target demographics better.</p>
<p>Also facebook has reported 135% increase on clicks on videos versus pics advertising webpages so it might be people thinking they are gaming the system and not understanding why they are clicked on more.</p>
<p>If anyone has a better answer listen to them. I just did a quick google search</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Facebook’s algorithm allegedly prioritizes video over other types of content, so if you post a video, it’s more likely to show up on people’s news feeds than if you post a text, link or image. People try to take advantage of this by posting a video of an image so they can get more likes and comments than they would if they just posted the image itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Facebook sometimes run pre-roll ads on videos, some of the money from these ads can go to the creator. Also I believe Facebook algorithms prefer videos to photos and photos to text posts so more people will see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
