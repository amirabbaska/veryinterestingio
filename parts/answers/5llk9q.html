		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several of the explanations here are wrong.  Beware!</p>
<p>:)</p>
<p>As Tesla kept saying and saying, <em>it wasn't radio.   It had nothing to do with radio.   The inverse-square law did not apply, because radio waves weren't being sent from an antenna.</em>  He wasn't using his giant Tesla coil in radio-transmitter mode.  He wasn't broadcasting his waves into outer space like Marconi did.  Anyone insisting differently, they're simply wrong, and remain clueless about Tesla's actual plans.</p>
<p>But, they're wrong for good reason.  It's because Tesla kept secrets.  Today we know quite a bit because Tesla did give many details in a private 1916 legal deposition (Marconi radio court case,) but that wasn't published until 75 years later.  Much else being said about Tesla's wireless system was either uninformed speculation, or was taking Tesla's furtive and semi-misleading comments about secret inventions as being complete explanations. Before 1992 you had to go to the Tesla Museum if you wanted to know the truth.  Instead, most authors just made s&amp;'t up about Tesla.  Or, they lifted their information from earlier books which made s&amp;'t up about Tesla.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, all this wrong speculation ended up in books.  And if books clearly state Tesla's wireless plan, it must be true?  And it's even more true when many books say the same thing?  Nope.   That's pure BS.   It's &quot;game of telephone&quot; where books repeat earlier books with distortion, and the info in earlier books came from even earlier ones.  And the original info was speculation to begin with!   Instead, read original Tesla docs with Tesla's actual statements (which remained inside the Beograd Tesla Museum until finally published by<br />

<hr />
<p>Ok ok, <em>WHAT WAS TESLA'S PLAN?</em>    It was very simple:  make a conductive path all the way up to the top of the sky, to the conductive ionosphere layer.  Then power the ionosphere with a fifty million volts power supply, as if the entire sky was one giant plate of a capacitor.  The ground serves as the other plate.  The sky-plasma was his power-line, with the Earth being the return conductor.  Giant tesla-coils with 100 megavolts on the upper terminal would create the vertical &quot;plasma tower&quot; to conduct current to the sky itself.  They'd also supply power to every Tesla-type power-receiver on Earth.</p>
<p>Very cool idea: we're in the gap of Tesla's giant capacitor, the size of Earth's atmosphere.  It's as if all of human society was placed inside a microwave oven operating at low frequency.   Hold up a fluorescent tube, and it glows wirelessly, anywhere on Earth.   (Well, his planned power level wasn't high enough for that.  Tube-lamps would need a few yards of vertical antenna and a small coil before it would glow wirelessly.)   One engineering paper in the 1980s estimated that such a system would consume a millon watts entirely in wasted energy, but these losses would be constant.  That means 10 megawatt system would be 90% efficient, while a 100MW system would be 99% efficient.  Note that large power grids tend to be under 70% efficient &lt;edit, wrong might be more like 94%&gt;</p>
<p>Only one problem.   HOW THE EFF DOES SOMEONE MAKE CONNECTION TO THE IONOSPHERE?  Carbon-fiber space-elevators?!!!  Tesla said he would &quot;break down the atmosphere&quot; between his tower-electrode and the conductive layers far above.   So, a lightning bolt.   Only needs to be 30KM tall.  Roughly.</p>
<p>So, all the Tesla-skeptics were never able to properly scoff at his wireless-power system.   Tesla had them all gnashing and frothing about inverse-square falloff and near-zero efficiency, when his system actually wasn't using radio waves at all.  It was an invisible power line, an odd type of beamed-power using plasma.   </p>
<p>They should have been scoffing about Tesla's ability to create the 30KM vertical spark needed for his system to work.  Well, spark, or a glow-discharge.</p>

</ul>
<p>From the above diagram with the glass tube, we see that Tesla's system was based on conducted currents in glowing air, not on radio waves.  Those current paths would glow at night.  It was only &quot;wireless&quot; in the way that neon signs are &quot;filament-less.&quot;  In modern words, Tesla was going to use tens of kilometers of glowing plasma as his power grid.</p>
<p>Interesting trivia: when Tesla was discussing this in an interview, the reporter said why not just guide your lightning discharge up to the sky using ultraviolet spotlights.  Tesla changed the subject!   Decades later Tesla said that the UV spotlights placed atop Tesla Coils were his first goal, but he then tested it and found that the discharge-length remained far too short.  He abandoned the carbon-arc searchlights, and instead discovered another method which he claimed was successful, and he'd fully tested it on his giant coils at Colorado Springs.  A side-effect would be to make the entire sky above the transmitter glow like a vast Aurora.</p>
<p>He never said what this method was.   Later he changed his mind about making it public, because he said it had major weapons possibilities.  It could &quot;render uninhabitable&quot; any selected spot on Earth.   &quot;It would be like giving a knife to an infant.&quot;   Whatever was the trick was, or, whichever way Tesla was fooling himself, he took the secret to his grave.</p>
<p>Therefore, don't laugh about Tesla's system being &quot;too inefficient,&quot; or because &quot;Tesla didn't even know about inverse-square law.&quot;   That's just ignorant.   Instead, laugh at Tesla for suggesting that he'd actually excited the Earth's entire ionosphere using a vertical gas-breakdown path many tens of KM tall   ...late at night out in Colorado, so nobody would see the sky-glow aurora effects it created.</p>
<p><em>I saw that I would be able to transmit power provided I could construct a certain apparatus -- and I have, as I will show you later. I have constructed and patented a form of apparatus which, with a moderate elevation of a few hundred feet, can break the air stratum down. You will then see something like an aurora borealis across the sky, and the energy will go to the distant place. ...I came to the conviction that it would be ultimately possible, without any elevated antenna --- with very small elevation --- to break down the upper stratum of the air and transmit the current by conduction.</em> -N. Tesla 1916 </p>
<p>Well, one thing's certain.   Tesla was exactly right in insisting that, it wasn't radio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People here keep referencing the tesla coil as his method of wireless power transfer. While partly true that was not his complete idea for low loss wireless power transmission across large distances. Most Tesla's ideas involved constructive resonance through a medium. </p>
<p>Tesla's idea was to use the earth and atmosphere as a medium. He believed that he could use the earth itself as a conductor by taking advantage of resonant frequencies and using the atmosphere itself as to complete the circuit. Essentially people would put a wire into the ground and a second &quot;antenna&quot; up into the air and they could power their home without wires connecting to a grid from his power station towers. </p>
<p>Wikipedia has a nice, imho, simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_power_transfer" target="_blank">eli5 explaination</a> I will leave here: </p>
<p>&quot;The theory included driving alternating current pulses into the Earth at its resonant frequency from a grounded Tesla coil working against an elevated capacitance to make the potential of the Earth oscillate. Tesla thought this would allowing alternating current to be received with a similar capacitive antenna tuned to resonance it at any point on Earth with very little power loss.[116][117][118] His observations also led him to believe a high voltage used in a coil at an elevation of a few hundred feet would &quot;break the air stratum down&quot;, eliminating the need for miles of cable hanging on balloons to create his atmospheric return circuit.[119][120] Tesla would go on the next year to propose a &quot;World Wireless System&quot; that was to broadcast both information and power worldwide[121][122] and attempted in 1901 to construct a large high-voltage wireless power station, now called the Wardenclyffe Tower, at Shoreham, New York. By 1904 investment dried up and the facility was never completed.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make current (flowing electrons) in a wire, you need a magnetic field moving across that wire (you can also have the field stay pit, and move the wire, relative motion is the key). </p>
<p>Magnetic field do not travel very well though. They dissapate very quickly the further you go.  An electromagnetic wave, on the other hand, will travel much further. The electric part of the wave reinforces the magnetic, and vice versa. </p>
<p>The key problem, is that the power of the wave drops off with distance. Given a transmitter of a fixed amount of power, say 100 watts, at 1 meter from the transmitter, that 100 watts is divided across a sphere that has a surface area of ( 4 <em> pi </em> r^2 ) call it 12 square meters. At 2 meters you have 48 square meters to divide the 100 watts. At 3 you have almost 120 square meters of surface are to 'fill' with the same amount of power output.</p>
<p>Tesla thought you could overcome this drop off by using resonance. If the field vibrated at the same frequency as the earth/atmosphere system, the transmission efficiency would be greatly enhanced. As far as anyone is aware, he was not able to make this work on a large scale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tesla believed that a spherical conductor (i.e. The Earth), can support <em>surface waves</em>.  They look a little <a href="http://www.teslaradio.com/pages/compare_files/image029.gif" target="_blank">like this</a>.  They hug around the outer surface of a conductor, and in the case of the Earth would continually diffract around it.    Surface waves (also called creeping waves, ground waves, Sommerfield-Zenneck waves) do exist.</p>
<p>He thought he could transfer power around the Earth using these waves - exciting them using his Tesla coil.  It would create a standing wave around the Earth -the waves would be emitted from his transmitter, go around the Earth, converge at the anti-pode, and then come back.  If you know anything about standing waves, they are caused by a transmitted and reflected wave, which is what would happen here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Tesla coil when Tesla was building them, wasn't about generating lightning, the lightning was an unwanted side effect of his transmitting coil.  A Tesla coil is like a swing, but with electromagnetic fields instead of mass, gravity and a pendulum.  Energy is pumped into the coil at its resonant frequency, and like a swing set,  swings further and further as you add energy at its resonant frequency.  These swings of the electromagnetic energy sends out electromagnetic waves through the air.  Tesla coils are very efficient at generating electromagnetic waves.</p>
<p>Back in Tesla's day, electricity in the home was all about lighting.  There weren't many home appliances and industry mainly still used diesel, steam or water for powering their machinery.  With fluorescent lighting, energy put into the tube causes it to emit uv radiation.  That radiation hits the white phosphorus coating in the inside of the tube and is absorbed and re-emitted as visible light.  In the electromagnetic field given off by a Tesla coil, the tube will also give off light.  Tesla wanted to build absurdly large Tesla coils to light up fluorescent tubes at huge distances instead of running wires from the generating station to homes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
