		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about the difference between the filament of a light bulb being at about 2550 Celsius vs your entire house being that temperature. Obviously that is the difference between business as usual and your entire house burning, melting, and exploding at the same time.</p>
<p>That very high temperature at CERN was in a very small area for a very brief period of time. The total amount of energy was fairly small, just very concentrated at that instant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Same idea here, just because that was the highest temperature doesn’t mean there was much heat. That temperature was for so little time and in so small a spot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason a campfire doesn't burn the forest down.</p>
<p>There is a very little hot stuff, and a whole lot of cold stuff, which dilutes the heat before it can do any damage.  It is likely the CERN experiment only heated a handful of subatomic particles to the temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trick is to heat up a tiny amount of mass. this is first of way easier, since you need less energy to heat it up. And secondly, deals with the problem of dispersing the heat after. </p>
<p>So for this experiment, they basically heated up only a couple of particles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because it's a tiny tiny tiny amount of matter that's at that temperature.  the overall energy involved is far less than the energy made when you click your fingers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
