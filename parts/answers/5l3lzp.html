		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that on average the poles do get less solar radiation than equatorial regions, but they still get quite a bit. </p>
<p>Wikipedia has a decently good description of the effect of the Earth's geometry on the variation in solar radiation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_irradiance#Top_of_the_atmosphere" target="_blank">here</a>. The key result is summarized <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/78/Insolation.png" target="_blank">in this diagram</a>. The top panel shows the total irradiance at the top of the atmosphere and the bottom shows how much light actually makes it to the surface. Now the top panel shows that the fact that the poles are always more angled away from the Earth-Sun axis, they get less power on average than the equatorial regions.</p>
<p>Still, to see if solar power is feasible in the arctic we should look at the bottom panel to get some real numbers. The second map shows that if on average you get about 200W/m^2 in say Brazil or the south US and about 100W/m^2 in some arctic regions. Now even 100W/m^2 is not <em>that</em> little. Moreover, these are yearly averages and as you point out in the case of the arctic, all of the radiation is concentrated during the summer. As a result, the actual numbers for the total irradiance during the summer would be even closer for say northern Canada and the the south US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, solar power is effective in the arctic summers. But the catch is that in the summers, northern latitudes don't need electricity. </p>
<p>Further south (but still above the equator,) solar power is golden. In the summer when it's hottest, you also get the most electricity for air conditioning and other daily demands. </p>
<p>But when you go further north, during the summers it might be between 60-80 degrees--the sort of day where you just open your door and use neither heat not cooling. </p>
<p>I live in southeast Alaska. I dearly want to install solar panels because my house is south-facing and gets blasted by sun. But I stop myself and do the math. </p>
<p>In the winters, I use $350/month in electricity to heat my home. But if I were to install solar panels on my roof (the half that gets sun at least) I would rake in $20-30 worth of solar power. Conversely, in the summer, my electric bills are ~$80, and solar power would generate $100+. So... When I don't NEED power, it's in abundance, and when I do need it, the sun provides less than 1/10th of what I use.</p>
<p>It just doesn't math out. Maybe in 10+ years the price of solar will come down enough to make this economical regardless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sunlight is 24/7 but the sun moves in a circle around the sky. You would need tracking panels to take full advantage of it. On Dec 22, the sun is 23.5 degrees above the horizon all day long. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's less about the slant of the earth and more about the slant of the panel. If you keep it flat to the ground it won't get much power, but normally you make it face the sun. That said, the angle will mean it has more atmosphere to go through, so more light will be blocked. I'm not sure how big an effect that would make. In any case, the cost of building them in such a faraway place and sending the electricity so far will offset any gains. And it will be worthless in the Arctic winter, which is when you'd actually need power that far north.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kinda a different question, but how does solar panel work in Canada with the snow? You'd have to brush off the panels, but you can't really fully wipe them off. How much does snow stick to them? And how does the snow that you can't wipe off easily affect the power generation?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
