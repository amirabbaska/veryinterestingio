		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kids have the &quot;benefit&quot; of their immune system still being in &quot;oh shit everything is trying to kill me&quot; mode, while adult immune systems have (generally) relaxed into &quot;been there, done that, all part of the routine&quot; mode. It takes a bit longer to get the &quot;machinery&quot; fired up again to respond to something new, and by the time the immune response kicks in, the virus has had more time to multiply and infect new cells than it would have had in a child whose system was ready to hit the ground running</p>
<p><strong>edit</strong>: yes, this is a big oversimplification, and i just wanted to clarify that this isn't the <em>only</em> factor at work. another reason chickenpox is more dangerous for adults is that adults are more susceptible to various conditions by default - like pneumonia or encephalitis. your body is a big organic machine (you're really just a brain driving it around, after all); parts will wear out over time, gunk collects in places you can't clean out, and upsetting your body's balance can cause opportunistic pathogens to really thrive. it's rarely <em>just the chickenpox</em> causing all of the problems. short of system failure, most of the annoying symptoms (inflammation, swelling, fever, blisters) are actually your immune system's way of fighting off the infection by &quot;sending in more troops.&quot; in adults, these &quot;troops&quot; can start getting in the way of normal functioning.</p>
<p>if you like metaphors: think of how annoying it is when somebody sets off a fire alarm and you have to evacuate, or if, due to a bomb threat, you have to wait outside while your building is combed for potential explosives. &quot;good guys&quot; preventing you from getting to your desk and getting your job done. same idea, except it's your immune system's &quot;good guys&quot; and the &quot;job&quot; is keeping your body functioning normally</p>
<p><strong>edit 2:</strong> from a post below: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;An overzealous response in adults is responsible for causing more extensive cell damage and a more severe manifestation (especially in the lung) in primary infection than that seen in children.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>from Murray</p>
<p><strong>edit 3:</strong> the adult immune system has plenty of resources, just not the right ones, in this case. it's ready to respond to threats it recognizes, and sends those resources to attempt to tackle the problem. they do it predictably badly - imagine sending in a thousand hostage negotiator to talk down an IED while you scramble to get together a bomb squad, because that's all you've got</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very short version: the immune system slows down, just like other parts of the body</p>
<p>Imagine the immune system as an actual elderly person (we'll call him Bob), &amp; the disease like a burglar (Jack). Bob can't hear or see as well as he used to, so he doesn't realize someone has broken into his house, because his eyes are going and his hearing is fading. So, poor ol' Bob doesn't notice Jack until Jack has already stolen half the living room. Now Bob's not going to just let Jack get away with it... Bob's going to knock that young punk out. But, uh oh! Bob's arthritis has been flaring, &amp; all that mall walking hasn't done a darn thing to increase his strength...not to mention his reflexes are more turtle-like than cat-like.</p>
<p>Bob's a fighter, though! He's still not going to let Jack get away this. So, he clenches his fist and gives Jack a mighty wallop. Jack laughs a little, &amp; continues on toward the silverware drawer. Bob hits him again. And again. And again. Bob finally has to grab a bat (steroids) to get Jack out of the house. Bob stands breathless, one hand on his side, &amp; sore from the physical exertion... He'll certainly need a few weeks to recover from this endeavor. But victory is his!  Or is it?</p>
<p>Jack's partner Mike (another foreign invader) was waiting in the car. Mike doesn't care that Jack got his butt kicked, &amp; he sure isn't scared of an old man. Mike creeps in, &amp; while Bob has wandered off to bed, Mike starts cleaning out the rest of the 1st floor. Then the 2nd. Bob, even more slowed down (in detection and response), doesn't start fighting Mike until dang near the whole house has been emptied, and is lucky he had enough fight in him to save the clothes off his own back. Good thing there were only two burglars!</p>
<p>Now imagine that Bob had also had any of the medical conditions that become more frequent as age progresses... heart disease, diabetes, cancers, etc. Bob would have had to use everything in him just to fight off Jack (&amp; may still not have won), &amp; would have nothing left for Mike. </p>
<p>Throw all of that together, and that's why most diseases are more dangerous in the elderly (and immuno-compromised).</p>
<p>Edit: The principle still applies for children vs young adult, albeit in a different way. Immune systems lose efficacy as the body ages. Yes, the non- ELI5 answer is cytokine storm (for most...few odd balls that have other variables that influence the impact on a particular age group). In the &quot;Bob&quot; scenario form:</p>
<p>Jack has entered Bob's house, and is immediately noticed by Bob's grandson Timmy. Timmy screams bloody murder, stomps his feet, and then gives Jack a quick swift in the shin. Enough for Jack to high-tail it out of there. However, Timmy's mom Alice is across the street, and she too notices something amiss...and goes into mega-mom protect mode. She knows she has to stop this intruder, &amp; will throw everything in her arsenal at him. Alice reaches deep into every YMCA self-defense class she ever took, grabs a double-barrel shotgun, &amp; a hand grenade and UNLEASHES HER FURY!  Jack is annihilated, but Alice is left bruised (that shotgun has a kick), exhausted, and dizzy (grenade explosion blew her eardrum). Not only has she managed to hurt herself with her drama-queen reaction, but she has weakened  her ability to fight off Mike. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two diseases that represent good examples here are tuberculosis (TB) and chicken pox. In general, your immune system is pretty strong as a child, although it is still learning the ropes. At these ages, it is generally able to fight off things like TB or chickenpox. TB is tricky though. The bacteria responsible for it hide out in the lungs, where the immune system isn't as strong. Furthermore, it forms a shell that hides the bacteria (this is why they do chest x-rays to confirm if you have had TB - the shells show up as speckles in the lungs). Over time, some of these shells break down and a few bacteria test your immune system. Once you get older though, your immune system begins to deteriorate. By the time you hit ~90 and a few TB get out, you can no longer deal with them and you get an infection that gets out of hand quickly. </p>
<p>Chicken pox does much the same thing. It starts out by targeting your skin, but also pokes around in other organs, usually with little effect. If it gets to your nerves though, it settles down and goes dormant; again in a place where the immune system doesn't look much. Science isn't quite sure <em>exactly</em> why it reactivates, but one factor is, like TB, your immune system gets too weak to fight off the occasional infection. When this happens, the virus travels down your nerves to the skin those nerves are touching, forming a more painful rash since it is directly integrated into your nerves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this will be lost in the shuffle and the top comment did kinda touch on it, but it's similar to why H1N1 (Swine flu) wrecks young, otherwise healthy adults. The actual reason you get sick in this instance is the actual varicella virus (AKA chicken pox), but because of the robust immune response an adult can generate that a child generally doesn't. Basically, your immune system goes full guns blazing and releases a lot of things called cytokines and various other inflammatory / killer cells that end up damaging your healthy cells while it tries to kill the ones that have been infected.
FYI, the chicken pox can decimate a child as well. They can have inflammation of the brain (a VERY serious and possible permanently damaging complication) and some very serious secondary pneumonias. That's why we vaccinate!
Immunology is pretty complicated and we're only just scratching the surface. If you want a more detailed explanation, there's some great textbooks and review books that go into it!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you example (chicken pox) is actually not a standard answer.</p>
<p>most diseases are worse as you age because your body isn't in tip-top shape anymore. A healthy young body with a robust immune system is like a well-funded military full of young people - basically, invaders try, but get beat down. As you age, cells are not in tip-top shape, damage accumulates, energy isn't as available, resources aren't as high-functioning... like a military that has been slowly de-funded and whose ranks are ageing. can't do the same job.</p>
<p>chicken pox is actually a different story... no matter when you initially get the virus, you will get actually get chicken pox first, young or old. shingles, which is categorically a worse situation, only happens to people who have the virus re-emerge from being dormant in their spinal fluid, and often this happens because of other body stresses trigger it (like chronic emotional stress, other diseases, or age-related declines). </p>
<p>shingles is like Sauron... it gets beat down initially, but then retreats Mordor (your spine) to bide his time, and stress is like the one ring that can bring him back</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
