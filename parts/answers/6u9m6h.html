		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question. For starters numbers are an abstraction. In reality, things just are. There is no number, because there are no category of things that can be repeated. No apple is truly the same as another and therefore a person cannot have more than one of anything. The real world is infinite in its complexity. </p>
<p>However, the human mind is not. The human mind is simple and must make assumptions and estimations to get along. The human mind considers an apple and another apple and doesn't see their infinitly distinct reality. The mind sees an abstract simplified token - just an apple and another apple. Two apples. </p>
<p>This is a kind of magic. Representing several things as though it was a modified version of one thing, frees up the mind to do so much. It allows us to store large amounts of information <em>outside</em> of our bodies. </p>
<p>The simple human mind can only really conceive of about 3-6 things at once. If a person without counting is asked which group is larger and is shown two groups, one with 33 apples, and another with 31, is extremely difficult to tell. But with numbers a person can count. They can set aside the reality of the apples and use several kinds of abstract representation to tell how many there are. They can arrange the apples into groups of three - which can be easily identified - and use their fingers outstretched to represent their place in counting each group. This is storing information outside of oneself. </p>
<p>This is a <strong>profound</strong> transformation. It can be shown that numbers are a kind of representative logic. Adding the ability to store information outside the human body transforms humans from just an animal into <em>Turing complete</em>. Turing machines can
Solve any problem that is computable given enough time. </p>
<p>To the extent that we are right that one thing is like another thing, abstraction and counting save us a lot of brainpower. It's a kind of compression. When we use numbers to represent things, we discover that there are certain logical properties that can rearrange these groups (numbers) in ways that are more understandable without affecting their accuracy or changing the number at all. For instance, three groups of 10 apples is the same as 30 apples. Multiplying doesn't do anything to the groups but it does make a simpler token to represent it in our memory (30 as opposed to 3 sets of 10). </p>
<p>These conceptual simplifications let us represent other relationships we discover. Like the fact that planets (from the Greek for <em>wanderer</em>) seem to look like stars that moves throughout the sky. By putting numbers on how much they move we can compare this that are hard to directly observe - just like the large groups of apples. And we can store that information outside of our minds so we can compare it over long periods of time. </p>
<p>Comparing these numbers lets us discover patterns that describe how the planets behave like Newton's equations of motion and gravitation. What's more, they let us predict how they will behave. </p>
<p>There is a lot more to say and I think the most interesting and readable author on the subject is Bertrand Russell in his book <a href="https://youtu.be/GC8sJDQ6h0o" target="_blank">introduction to mathematical philosophy</a> </p>
<p>Listen to the first chapter for a fantastic answer to your question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer your question in 2 parts: first, what are numbers? In one sense, numbers like &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;3.5&quot; etc are labels we've given to properties we see. Like words, they describe a feature of something that is interesting, but instead of answering &quot;what colour is that&quot; or &quot;what is that made of&quot;, they answer &quot;how many are there&quot;, &quot;what is its speed&quot; etc. In that sense, they are a natural result of our observation. </p>
<p>Mathematically speaking, you can &quot;define&quot; numbers in a very rigourous sense(eg using something called the Peano Axioms to define natural numbers- skipping the details for Eli5 but it's very interesting, so let me know if you want more details), but it's still based on what we observed about the world. </p>
<p>The thing that gives math its predictive power(how mathematicians can come up with an idea well before it is observed in reality, or use math to describe what's going on) is because &quot;the next step&quot; follows logically from the one before it, in a sense. Because the universe works according to a set of rules, it is possible to work out new &quot;potential&quot; rules before we observe them- it's like someone coming up with the word &quot;tree&quot; without ever having seen a tree before, simply because the rest of the language had predictive power. Then, when they find a tree for the first time, they realize it fits perfectly the definition already given. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Somethings are dependent on other things, so learning to count them properly gives us an idea of how they work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Proposition:  The universe has an unchanging set of rules that describe how it operates.</p>
<p>We generally accept this proposition and have put a great deal of thought and effort into trying to find different ways to identify and describe these rules.</p>
<p>Everything from religion, to philosophy, to math, is an attempt to determine what the rules of the universe are.  While you won't get general agreement about this the reality is that no serious time is devoted to these other methods.  No one waits with bated breath for the next religious pronouncement out of the Vatican about the nature of the universe, no one is thrilled when a famed philosopher puts out a new work on the origins of life.  We do however do this for mathematics.</p>
<p>Right now math appears to be an accurate representation of how the universe operates.  It wasn't the first attempt, it may not be the last, but it is a very successful one so far.</p>
<p>And so my argument would be that it isn't that &quot;numbers do a good job of explaining the universe&quot; but rather &quot;numbers are how the universe operates and thus numbers are the natural language with which to describe that operation&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
