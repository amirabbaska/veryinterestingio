		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As your question has seemingly been answered I'm just gonna toss in a fun fact and point out that even a subcritical mass can undergo a chain reaction if the neutrons created in decays, instead of leaving the mass, are reflected back towards it.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both the first US (Trinity) and first Soviet (RDS-1) tests successfully used solid plutonium cores - both density and shape are important, along with a neutron source to initiate a greater chain reaction in the brief window before the &quot;critical mass&quot; blows itself apart. So, yes it's a bit of a misnomer when applied to nuclear weapons.            </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Then he does some math and finds everyone else will be fine, but he will die. Then u watch him melt from radiation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When i studied this decades and decades ago, &quot;neutron flux&quot; was the trigger to a self-sustaining nuclear reaction.  My loose remeberance is &quot;slow neutron density in fissile material.&quot;  (That was for power plants, however, weaponry may be different.) When the material compresses, the mass DOES remain the same, but the neutron flux increases as the slow neutrons are packed into a steadily decreasing space.  my 2 cents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
