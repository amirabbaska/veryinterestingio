		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know because pi is an irrational number. More to the point, we know it is not a rational number.</p>
<p>(warning, math ahead)</p>
<p>A rational number is one that can be represented as a ratio of two integers. For any repeating or terminating decimal out there, you can do a little math to express it as a ratio. </p>
<p>With a terminating decimal, it is pretty easy:</p>
<p>0.123 = 123/1000</p>
<p>Repeating decimals require a little algebra:</p>
<p>n = 0.123123...</p>
<p>1000n = 123.123123...</p>
<p>1000n - n = 999n = 123</p>
<p>n = 123/999 = 41/333</p>
<p>What does this have to do with pi? It means that either a) pi can be expressed as a ratio of two integers, or b) pi cannot be represented as a terminating or repeating decimal. If we can show there is no way to express pi as a ratio, the only remaining possibility is a nonrepeating decimal.</p>
<p>In 1761, this is exactly what Johann Heinrich Lambert did. Unfortunately, his proof, and others like it, require advanced math we'd rather not get into. Lucky for us, the proof that √2 is irrational is pretty straight forward:</p>
<p>assume a and b exist, such that a/b = √2, and a and b have no common factors</p>
<p>a^2 / b^2 = 2</p>
<p>a^2 = 2 * b^2</p>
<p>therefore a is even, and there exist a k such that a = 2k</p>
<p>(2 <em> k)^2 = 2 </em> b^2</p>
<p>4 <em> k^2 = 2 </em> b^2</p>
<p>2 * k^2 =  b^2</p>
<p>therefore b is also even</p>
<p>However, we assumed a and b had no common factors, so they cannot both be even. This contradicts our original assumption, which proves it must be false. There are no such number a and b, which means √2 cannot be represented as a repeating decimal and must be irrational.</p>
<p>EDIT:  By popular demand</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>rational numbers are the result of dividing one integer by another</li>
<li>the decimal places of a rational number either end, or repeat</li>
<li>you can show that pi (or e or √2) cannot be the result of dividing one integer by another</li>
<li>therefore, those numbers are not rational and do not end</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Supposedly, the first person to prove the existence of irrational numbers (by the &quot;square root of 2&quot; proof that appears several times in this thread) was Hippasus of Metapontum.  He was a Pythagorean, a group of cult-like philosophers and mathematicians who believed many crazy things (like, for example, that lentils were sacred).  One of their now-obviously-wrong beliefs was that all numbers could be written as the ratio of two integers.  </p>
<p>It's said that on a sea voyage, Hippasus began doodling on papyrus or whatever the heck ancient Greeks did their mathematical scribblings on, and in doing so, inadvertently proved that the square root of two could not be rational.  After sharing his discovery with his fellow Pythagoreans and shattering their worldview, they repaid him for his discovery by drowning him then and there.</p>
<p>This is known as the first irrational murder in known history.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possible to prove this. It's easier with another irrational number, the square root of 2. Let's assume that it's rational. This means it can be written as a fraction (a/b) where the integers a and b have no factors in common (other than 1). Both a and b can be huge numbers, it doesn't matter for this.</p>
<p>sqrt(2) = a/b</p>
<p>2 = a^2 / b^2</p>
<p>2 * b^2 = a^2</p>
<p>So a^2 has a factor of 2 in it. The only way this can happen is if a has a factor of 2 in it, which means there is some some integer c were</p>
<p>a = 2*c</p>
<p>2 <em> b^2 = (2</em>c)^2 = 4 * c^2</p>
<p>b^2 = 2 * c^2</p>
<p>So, like we did for a, this means that b has a factor of 2, so for some integer d</p>
<p>b = 2*d</p>
<p>Going back to the start</p>
<p>sqrt(2) = a/b = 2c/2d = c/d</p>
<p>Obviously we could keep repeating this. This shows that the initial assumption was wrong, and there is no way to express sqrt(2) as a fraction. The only other choice is that sqrt(2) is irrational.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not exactly a 5-year-old explanation, but hopefully someone who has seen high school trigonometry/calculus can get the gist of it.</p>
<p>We know pi is irrational (i.e. it isn't of the form a/b where a and b are whole numbers) because it was proved by Lambert in the 18th century; there are now many proofs known.  The proof is conceptually harder than the proof that sqrt(2) is irrational, so I disagree with others who have used that as their main example: the extra concept you need is that of limits.  However, if you are OK with basic calculus, the ideas are not super advanced.  What it comes down to is that we know how to approximate pi with rational numbers, but the nature of that approximation means that pi itself must be irrational.</p>
<p>pi is the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, but that definition isn't how mathematicians typically work with pi.  If you want to understand the properties of a number, it's better to have some way of approaching it that is based on a formula involving whole numbers.  For example, pi is the smallest positive number x such that sin(x/2)=1.  This is useful because sin(x) has a nice series expansion:</p>
<p>sin(x) = x - (x^3) /3! + (x^5) /5! - (x^7) /7! + ...</p>
<p>What this means is if you plug in some value for x into that sum, and calculate just the first n terms, as n gets larger, you'll get a better and better approximation to sin(x).  So pi/2 is a number that you can plug into this formula and get closer and closer to 1.  The important thing is that we're expressing everything in terms of rational functions (everything you can get from x and whole numbers by adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing).</p>
<p>You can also get approximations to pi itself of this form.  There are other kinds of approximation as well, such as continued fraction expansions, but the concept is basically the same: you approximate the true function f(x) by a sequence of functions f1(x), f2(x), ... where each function is built out of x and whole numbers by applying basic arithmetic operations, and the way to get the next function from the previous functions is predictable and easy to describe.</p>
<p>OK, so you know how to approximate pi by rationals, or you know it's approximated by solutions to rational equations.  How does this help you show it's irrational?  The basic idea is the following: if you make a sequence of rational approximations to a rational number, one of two things happens: either you hit the number you are trying to approximate exactly, or your approximations are 'bad' in the sense that if the number you want is x/y and your approximation is a_n/b_n, then |x/y - a_n/b_n| is at least 1/yb_n, or to put it another way, the sequence |b_n(x/y)-a_n| is bounded away from zero (regardless of what x/y is).  So if you can show that you never hit the limit exactly, but your approximations are 'too good', then the limit has to be irrational.  (Or to put it another way: if you know the limit is rational, e.g. sin(pi/2)=1, then you can't have been making rational approximations to it, so the number you put in must have been irrational.)  This kind of approximation idea is often hiding in the details of the proof, but it's usually there in some form.</p>
<p>As a final remark: this isn't a recipe for proving your favourite number is irrational; simply having some sequence of rational approximations for your number isn't enough.  It requires some special insight into the number in question to find the kind of approximations that are 'too good', and in general it's very hard to tell if a number is irrational or not.  For instance, we know that pi and e are irrational (transcendental, even), but we don't even know if pi + e is rational.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pi is derived from dividing the distance around a circle (circumference) by the distance across the circle (diameter). </p>
<p>If we take other shapes and do the same (divide distance around the object by distance across), we will get the following results:</p>
<p>Each side length = 1, each shape is regular (equal angles, equal sides)</p>
<p>Square (4 sides):
distance around = 4
distance across = 1.414.
4÷1.414 = 2.82</p>
<p>Hexagon (6 sides)
distance around = 6
distance across = 2
6÷2 = 3</p>
<p>Octagon  (8 sides)
Distance around = 8
Distance across = 2.414
8÷2.613 = 3.06</p>
<p>Decagon (10 sides)
Distance around = 10
Distance across = 3.236
10÷3.236 = 3.09</p>
<p>Notice the more sides a shape has, the closer the answer is to 3.14? By the time we get to a hundred sided shape, we already have the first three digits of pi written out:</p>
<p>100-gon (100 sides)
Distance around = 100
Distance across = 31.82
100÷31.82 = 3.14</p>
<p>If we had a million sided shape, its answer would be a good approximation of pi, but not as accurate as a billion sided shape, which is not as accurate as a trillion sided shape, etc, etc. Think of a circle as an infinitely sided shape, we cannot reach its infinite sides, so we cannot also reach pi, 3.415926. . .</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
