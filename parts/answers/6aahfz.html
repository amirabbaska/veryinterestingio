		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A grand jury hears the available evidence and decides if it's even plausible that a conviction can be reached.   They then decide if it's worth going forward with a prosecution &amp; deeper investigation.</p>
<p>They don't decide decide guilt, they just decide if it makes sense to issue a formal indictment or whether the proceedings should be dropped because they'd be a waste of everyone's time &amp; do nothing but harass the defendant. .</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The grand jury subpoenas show that a grand jury has been assembled to consider potential criminal charges. This is significant because it tells us that the justice department is pursuing criminal charges. </p>
<p>The subpoena itself just requires people to show up to testify before the grand jury. Grand juries are assembled in secret and they cannot talk about the cases presented to them. But when people reveal they have been subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury, it reveals the fact that a grand jury has been assembled.</p>
<p>As another commenter had said, grand juries do not determine guilt or innocence, only whether there is probably cause to charge someone with a crime. The Fifth Amendment to the US constitution requires convening a grand jury before charging someone for a capital or other infamous crime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a response I posted earlier to a question in reference to the CNN article about this:</p>
<p>The issue is that these subpoenas may or may not compel testimony that creates links from Flynn's personal contacts with Russian officials to potential instruction from Trump himself for Flynn to do so, at which point the proverbial can of worms would go from slightly open to the worms eating Trump's shit.</p>
<p>We likely won't know what these witnesses testify to, due to grand jury secrecy, but it has the potential to be very bad for Trump or to be inconsequential for him. (That testimony being inconsequential for Trump would not in and of itself vindicate him. It would simply mean that there was no evidence against him in that testimony.)</p>
<p>I suspect that even if they reveal that they were aware of Flynn being instructed by Trump to collide with Russia, that would be considered hearsay if/when it ever reaches trial. </p>
<p>If they testify to the grand jury that Flynn said he was instructed by Trump, Flynn would then be subpoenaed (likely to happen anyway - The target of an investigation is frequently the last person subpoenaed by a grand jury.), and his testimony, at that point, could potentially be damaging to Trump. </p>
<p>It COULD generate more leads for the grand jury to follow, and aside from that, the acknowledgment that a grand jury exists signifies that law enforcement officials at the FBI and DOJ believe a crime has been committed. </p>
<p>So yes, any excitement is likely premature, but this does mark an evolution in the overall investigation of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what was already said, the fact a federal prosecutor has decided to convene a grand jury shows </p>
<p>1) They have decided they have enough evidence for the prosecution of the case </p>
<p>2) The evidence in question (business records from associates of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn) could reveal a network of evidence beyond Flynn. </p>
<p>3) If other individuals or organizations appear on the records associated with Flynn acting as a foreign agent, the grand jury can decide to expand the scope of the subpoena to include such entities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1.) federal grand juries are composed of citizens from the district in which they are convened, just like trial juries.</p>
<p>2.) federal grand juries sit for many weeks and have dozens of cases brought before them.</p>
<p>3.) a grand jury subpoena carries the full authority of the united states and failure to comply is contempt, and results in u.s. marshals dragging you before the grand jury.</p>
<p>4.) if a grand jury is being used to gather evidence, a federal prosecutor believes there is a good possibility of conviction.  they do not waste the grand jury's time on bullshit.</p>
<p>5.) a grand jury subpoena can be used to demand documents or testimony.  </p>
<p>6.) grand juries involve only the witness, prosecutor, and grand jury.  no judge is involved, nor is there any defense counsel (what is there to defend? there are no charges yet, just an investigation)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
