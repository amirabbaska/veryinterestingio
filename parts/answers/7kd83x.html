		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;paragon of cutting materials&quot;, as it is known to some, is called tungsten carbide. It isn't necessarily the hardest material we know of but it is the cheapest/best material for cutting due to its abrasion and temperature resistance, and relatively easy processing. Tungsten carbide has an advantage to other materials in that it can be sintered,[Link 1]
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintering" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sintering</a>). This allows it to be formed into many useful shapes for cutting in a relatively cheap process. If you pause the video in your post, you can see the cutter being used has what appears to be triangle cutters with large holes. The holes are for mounting, so they are replaceable, and the triangle shape makes it so each insert has 3 cutting edges, increasing the life of the insert. <a href="https://sc01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1phgvKpXXXXaLXVXXq6xXFXXXZ/CNC-turning-inserts-tungsten-carbide-drill-bit.jpg_350x350.jpg" target="_blank">WC Insert</a>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hardness of drill bits is a result of an involved heat treatment process, not something that is normally present in the material.</p>
<p>Note that drilling items like steel plates, using too high a drill speed, will cause excessive heat from friction, and this rapidly softens the drill bit.</p>
<p>The bits are usually milled from blank bars which have been carefully <em>Annealed</em> at the factor and thus have maximum softness.</p>
<p>Annealed material can be milled, with some extra precautions, using tools of that very same material, that have been subsequently hardened by heat treatment. In the annealed state it is only slightly harder than normal structural steels.</p>
<p>However it's industry standard these days to use milling tools made out of tungsten carbide which is an extremely hard, heat resistant ceramic material. These last much longer in nearly all metal cutting applications except drilling because of their extreme wear resistance, including the making of cutting tools.</p>
<p>Generally the bit is started by carving the rough shape of the bit from round bar stock.</p>
<p>The rough bit is then Heat Treated by soaking at red heat for an hour or more, then quenching in oil which rapidly cools the material, causing a chance in crystal grain structure.  Then, the bit undergoes a careful tempering process at mild heat which optimizes it's hardness and toughness. </p>
<p>Once the bit has been heat treated, it is precision ground and sharpened using diamond coated abrasives wheels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I do this for a living. Drill bits we make are made on a 6 axis CNC grinding machine. The flutes are cut with a diamond compound grinding wheel for carbide bits.</p>
<p>I cant speak for the rest of the industry but we do not make drill bits with other drill bits.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon steel can be softened and hardened by thermal treatment.</p>
<p>When you heat it to a dull red and let it cool slowly, it becomes relatively soft, that process is called &quot;annealing&quot;. If you heat it and then plunge it suddenly into a cold liquid, like water or oil, it will become much harder.</p>
<p>For materials that cannot be annealed, like tungsten carbide, they use diamond tools. Crush diamond to a fine powder, press that powder into the surface of a steel disk, and that disk can be used to cut any material, since diamond is the hardest material there is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally a question related to my area of study!</p>
<p>I work in metal cutting research. There are a few common materials that drills and other metal cutting tools are made out of; drills are only one kind of metal cutting tool and the following info applies generally to any kind of cutting tool. Material hardness is the key property here that decides what you need to shape a given material, which relates directly to the ability of a material to survive abrasion. Abrasion is what happens when you take two materials and rub them against each other under high load. To shape something, you want one material to give (wear away) and the other to keep it's shape. Generally, when you need to cut or shape a material using physical processes, you need to use a material that is much harder than the material you want to shape.</p>
<p>The most common materials for non-industrial metal cutting tools are &quot;tool&quot; grade steels like high carbon steels and high speed steels, and these are the easiest to shape because there are lots of harder materials you can make grinding wheels out of to shape them. &quot;Tool&quot; grade materials can be heat treated to be very hard and abrasion resistant, which allows these materials to maintain a cutting edge when cutting other softer metals. Generally these are made into &quot;blanks&quot; which are just rods. If I want to make a 10 mm diameter drill, I start with a 10 mm rod blank, which are then shaped using grinding machines which can be manual or computer controlled to turn a plain old rod into a complex drill shape. The abrasive wheels used on the grinding machines could be aluminum oxide, silicon carbide, or cubic-boron nitride (c-BN). Each of these abrasive materials has a much higher hardness then high speed steel, which allows it to shape the already very hard high speed steel without the wheels wearing out too quickly. On the hardness vickers scale (HV), Aluminum oxide has a hardness that is about twice as high as high speed steel, silicon carbide is about 4 times harder, and c-BN is 5 times harder. Aluminum oxide is the cheapest and will wear out the fastest so it's good for low volume grinding, for example a home drill sharpener, and c-BN is far more expensive but experiences barely any wear at all, so it's more appropriate for high volume like drill (metal cutting tool) manufacturing companies.</p>
<p>Now in an industrial setting, a manufacturer may be using a drill to drill holes in an engine on a production line where they drill millions of holes per year. Here they want drills to last as long as possible, so more advanced materials are called for that will hold a functioning cutting edge for longer. Tungsten carbide (WC) is by far the most common material for metal cutting tools in industrial settings, but others such as poly-crystalline diamond (PCD), ceramics, and c-BN are also used. Tungsten carbide is about as hard as aluminum oxide, so you wouldn't have much luck trying to shape WC with an aluminum oxide wheel; it'd be like trying to saw a piece of wood with a saw with a saw blade made out of wood. As others have said, tungsten carbide is a sintered material, so you can get most of the way to a final shape by sintering, but finishing the cutting edge on tools by grinding is usually required. Any sort of round WC tooling like drills and mills are made from WC rod blanks just like HSS. In these cases, WC is already incredibly hard, so you need something even harder and just about the only thing that works is the hardest material known to man, diamond. Diamond grit wheels are used to effectively grind tungsten carbide, which is essentially small particles of diamond embedded into some other &quot;binder&quot; material (lots of different materials are used for binders) to form a wheel. Each grain of diamond acts as a small cutting edge to cut through the tungsten carbide, and when that edge starts to dull/wear out, the force on the grain becomes high enough to physically remove it from the wheel, revealing brand new sharp grains below it that continue to cut. The binder plays a very big role in how much force it takes to remove grains.</p>
<p>So I mentioned above that poly-crystalline diamond tools are sometimes used, and there is nothing harder than diamond, so how would you shape a PCD tool? In these cases, diamond can be used to shape them but there are other methods as well, like electrical errosion (millions of tiny electrical arcs per second to slowly erode/vaporize material).</p>
<p>If you are interested, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGobkwFivyU" target="_blank">this video</a> shows a common industrial CNC grinding machine which takes rod blanks of tungsten carbide and uses diamond abrasive wheels to shape them.</p>
<p>This topic is a deep hole. For example, did you know that for a simple drill, the rate of metal deformation at the tip of the drill as it cuts is 1000 times more aggressive than the deformation that takes place in the casing of a high explosive when it detonates?</p>
<p>Happy to answer questions!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
