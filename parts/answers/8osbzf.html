		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sucrose is considered “clean” and has no aftertaste (clean meaning it only activates sweet receptors). Other sweeteners activate both sweet and bitter receptors. However, because artificial sweeteners are so powerful, they quickly overwhelm the sweet receptors. The bitter receptors still scale up though with greater mass for longer. That is why aspartame you consume is actually mostly filler ingredients, because otherwise you would be overwhelmed by the bitterness. </p>
<p>Edit: If you are particularly affected by/don’t like an artificial sweetener feel free to avoid it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have many different kinds of taste receptors on your tongue: sweet, salty, bitter, and umami. Artificial sweeteners are designed to bind to the sweet receptor, but  a lot of the time they also bind a little bit to the the bitter receptor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regular sugar also has an aftertaste, but it doesn't last as long as artificial sweeteners. The reason is that artificial sweeteners are hundreds of times sweeter than table sugar. The chemicals take much longer to release from your taste buds than regular sugar, so the aftertaste lasts longer and is more distinct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
