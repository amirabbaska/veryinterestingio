		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a matter of how much momentum you transfer. For photons with momentum p0, you transfer a unit p0 of momentum to a sail that absorbs that photon. But if you use a reflective sail, the conservation of momentum requires that the sail is is pushed back by 2p0. Since the force the sail gets can be written as F = dp/dt, you get more propulsion when the sail reflects the light rather than absorbing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What would be better, grabbing as many of these as you can, so they push you around, or grabbing as many of these as you can and then throwing them back in the direction they came from?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The solar sail is not absorbing the light energy of the photon, but rather the momentum.</p>
<p>When two objects collide (sail and photon) more energy is transferred if they bounce apart rather than sticking together.  You can think of it in two steps: lets say you jump off of a table and then jump.  In the first part, you transfer energy into the floor by your impact; and in the second part you transfer more energy into the floor when you push off to jump.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>the goal is to absorb the small amount of energy in a photon.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the goal of solar panels. They absorb the photons' energy, and put it into the wires. </p>
<p>For solar sails, we are concerned with momentum, not energy. Photons have momentum, btw. No mass, just momentum. </p>
<p>The amount of momentum transfered to a sail (if it absorbs all of the photons) is the energy in the light divided by the speed of light. If you get the photons to reflect completely, you then get to double that. </p>
<p>So that's the answer- making them reflective is nearly twice as efficient. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're absorbing their kinetic energy. Which is best absorbed by reflecting them.</p>
<p>Like a sailing boat, the clothe reflects/re-directs the wind to get the energy from it.
absorbing the energy would be like a sailing boat with a windmill</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
