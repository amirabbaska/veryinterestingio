		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here in Germany, they have devices for TV ratings, but radio listener numbers are estimated via telephone interviews, in which people are asked which stations they regularly listen to.</p>
<p>Since the dates for these are well-known (similar to sweep months in US TV), private radio stations will often try and push their brand awareness during those times by running all kinds of stunts and media campaigns in order to get people to remember their names. (A common gimmick, e.g., is randomly calling numbers in the area, and if the people answer the phone by directly saying the station's name, they'll win a prize.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I only see partial or outdated answers here. </p>
<p>Back in the day people would volunteer to fill out journals of what they listened to, when they listened to it, and so on. These were incredibly inaccurate because people could just say &quot;I love Rush Limbaugh&quot; and they'd say they listen to him even if they only catch him once per week. They also might not account for things like when they're at the dentist office or the mall, so that data (which is very important) wouldn't be accounted for. But it was really the most accurate way at the time. This is how Arbitron measured ratings from the 1960s until 2000+</p>
<p>Along with the journals, they would also do phone questionaries. Calling people and asking them what they listen to. Clearly this is very inaccurate, not to mention you're only getting data from people who are willing to sit on the phone and answer boring questions.</p>
<p>The most accurate way, and the way Arbitron (Now Nielsen Audio) does it is a device called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_People_Meter" target="_blank">Portable People Meter</a>. To ELI5, radio stations (and TV for that matter) broadcast an inaudible code along with their normal audio broadcast. The PPM is designed to read that code and every night when the meter is docked, the information is sent to Nielsen Audio. History has shown that the PPM shows <em>significantly</em> different results from the diaries, thus being the most accurate way of calculating the ratings. It should also be noted that this type of device also picks up <strong>all</strong> media consumed while walking through the mall, subway station, restaurants, and so on.</p>
<p>Edit: The PPM also has movement detection so they can tell if you're wearing it all day or if you're just setting it down in front of a radio and leaving for work. They really try and cover all bases in order to get the most accurate ratings.</p>
<p>Edit: Source: I'm a radio nerd and also participated in the PPM for years</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great answers in here, but a couple of missteps. Probably too late but here goes. </p>
<p>For one, as mentioned below, PPM is only used in the US in around the Top 50 markets (cities and metropolitan areas). Everywhere else still uses the diary method mentioned here.</p>
<p>And PPM is still severely flawed. For instance, News/Talk stations and morning radio personality shows (and some softer music stations) started tanking in the ratings when PPM was unveiled. It was later reveled that Arbitron (at the time) knew that the encoded signal the meters pick up was only broadcasted when someone was talking. So any pauses in conversation or quiet speech did not register as listening. </p>
<p>To combat this, many stations in PPM markets invested in something called Voltaire that amplified the encoded ratings meter signal.</p>
<p>Also, if you play a TV clip, say of an awards show from the night before on your radio show, the signal that talks to the TV ratings meter and will cancel out the signal that talks to the radio ratings meter.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is determined by Nielsen who measure TV audiences and certain digital audiences as well. Nielsen is the largest media measurement company and purchased Arbitron about 3 years ago. Arbitron used to focus measurement on radios. Using complex statistical models, Nielsen recruits a sample. Participants (panelists) who agree to participate are provided a Personal People Meter (PPM) to wear. Its a small device about the size of a 1990s/early 200s beeper/pager and can pick up audio in any environment (car, home, stores, elevators). In order to be rated, the source (radio station) must encode their broadcast with a signal that is picked up by the PPM.  The PPM sends its data to Nielsen's measurement headquarters in Florida where algorithms are used to match the data collected to signals.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the internet-enabled world, where each of us have some form of advertising attached to our names, the &quot;call-in&quot; components of shows can be useful metrics. </p>
<p>Even if you don't win anything, or even get to speak to a live person, the act of calling in gives them your phone number, which can be linked to other information.</p>
<p>It's only one source of data, but it can provide important feedback, for example, if one station gets twice as many listeners on the nielsen ratings, and also sees twice as many callers, then it's a pretty sure bet that they get twice the listeners. On the other hand, if a station seems to have very few listeners, but gets many call-ins, it could be said that they may have a very loyal or niche audience.</p>
<p>Similarly, the promotional advertisements (&quot;bring in this code 'ILOVERADIO' to mattress-mart for a 10% discount&quot;), are another gauging tool. If only one station does it, it only tells them how many listeners they have that were interested in impulse-buying a mattress that day, but if a media company does it with several of their stations at the same time, using different promo codes, then they can compare the numbers for each station.</p>
<p>They can also use this information to say, for example, &quot;75% of people who listen to '99.5' also listen to '103.5', but of these 75%, only 10% listen to '88.5'&quot;, which is important when figuring out how to place advertisements. Remember that in most cities, only a small handful of companies own most of the radio stations, so even when you change the channel, you may still be listening to a station of the same company. They want to keep you on their &quot;property,&quot; even if you decide you want to listen to a different song.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
