		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I think what you're stumbling over is that on land, when you compact dirt, you are squeezing <em>air</em> out of it. If you press down on loose soil with your hand or a heavy weight, it will become compressed. What's happening there is the air is being squeezed out of the spaces between the dirt particles, which makes the dirt more compact.</p>
<p>Now on the sea floor, there is no air between the particles of dirt. So you're wondering, why doesn't the dirt feel &quot;solid&quot; like if you compact dirt at the surface? It's because at the bottom of the ocean, what's between the dirt particles is <em>water</em>. Now water is different from air, in that it is relatively incompressible - you need a tremendous pressure difference to change the volume of water even slightly. So, even though there's massive pressure from the water above, there is an equal pressure from the water between the dirt particles, which keeps them separate. The water can't get &quot;squeezed out&quot; from between the other dirt particles because the water between the particles exerts an equal force with the column of water above it. Water, unlike air, is able to &quot;resist&quot; being compressed.</p>
<p>Lastly, take the octopus in your example. Why doesn't the octopus get squished at the bottom of the ocean? Well if you went to the bottom of the ocean, your lungs would get crushed, because the air inside your lungs can't resist the massive water pressure all around you. Actually, as a land animal, you have lots of air inside your body, and all of those spaces would get crushed as the air rapidly compresses.</p>
<p>But octopuses and other animals that live at the sea floor don't have air in their bodies. They have water in all of the spaces in their body. Since water is incompressible, the water inside their body exerts an equal force with the water outside, so they don't get crushed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just in case you still don't understand it (I had to read several comments to understand why), here is my flavor of explanation that may work for you.</p>
<p>Imagine two gigantic cylinders. Now fill one with water. There will be tons of pressure placed on the cylinder containing the water. Now add enough sand to fill the bottom 5-10% of the cylinder. We now have an ocean simulation. The pressure is still on the cylinder in this case. The sand (or any particulate of your choosing, really) is basically &quot;suspended&quot; in water at the bottom. Water is smaller than the sediment. The immense pressure will <em>force</em> the water into and inbetween every particle. It is only when it meets the impermeable glass at the bottom that it can not be forced anywhere else.</p>
<p>Now take your other cylinder which is currently empty. This time, add the sand first. Now add a layer of indestructible plastic-wrap on top of that sand. Now add your water. What you will see here is compressed sand. Instead of the water being able to permeate the sand and push on each particle from all sides, it is only able to push on the plastic wrap which then pushes on the sand from one side.</p>
<p>If this didn't quite work, I can probably find a few other ways to explain it. Just ask!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fill up a bucket of water. Put your hand in the water all the way to the bottom of the bucket, you can feel the hydrostatic pressure but is the same in all directions, I.e. Hydrostatic. Now set the whole bucket on top of your hand. Now that is the anisotropic stress (more in one direction than another) you were thinking about and it smashes your hand. It doesn't matter if you are talking about a compressible solid, liquid, or gas, the only thing that matters is if the force is equal in all directions or not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure acts on an object in all directions perpendicular to its surface. So every grain of dust or sand at the bottom of the ocean will feel the pressure pushing it <em>inwards</em> and not pushing it <em>down</em>. </p>
<p>At some depth there will be bedrock that the water can't get under, and that will feel the pressure from above only, with the full weight of the ocean pushing down on it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify: the water colum does compress/make the dirt denser, but only the layers which are not penetrated by the water. For example if you were to drain out all the water of a lake, and cover the entire basin with a water tight material, and refill it with the original water body, all the dirt would be compressed.  As others have pointed out, pressure distributes evenly, as long as the water can &quot;seep through&quot;.  The imcompressibility of the water is not important : even above water (i.e the earth surface)  you have an atmosphere of gas pushing down (about the &quot;same&quot; as 10 m under water) on the dirt you are walking on, but it is still possible to move grains of sand with a piece of hair. This would not be possible if the weight of the air column was acting the only downwards on the sand particles, but because the air is all around/penetrating between the grains if sand, it is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
