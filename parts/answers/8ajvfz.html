		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suicides usually aren't really &quot;news&quot; unless the person is famous. Shootings are usually more newsworthy. If there's a murderer on the loose in your city, that's probably something the public should be aware of. And a mass shooting is definitely news. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The news doesn't report suicides because one person dying alone isn't usually newsworthy.  Also, in many cases, it is unclear immediately whether a suicide has occurred.  They might handwave about copycats, but whenever a suicide is particularly interesting, it gets reported.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Experts warn against reporting both suicides and homicides for similar reasons.</p>
<p>Why do news agencies heed one warning and not the other? Simple answer is that homicides get much higher ratings than suicides.</p>
<p>News is big business. Honestly I think many major news outlets do a pretty incredible job considering their profit-motivations. It's far, far less than ideal, but it could be <em>so much worse</em> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Should news agencies also stop reporting on terrorism because it might encourage copycats? Suicide only involves the perpetrator, there's no reason to report it. A mass shooting involves the deaths and injuries of many innocent people. That's something worth reporting. I want to know when mass shootings happen. Why wouldn't you?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
