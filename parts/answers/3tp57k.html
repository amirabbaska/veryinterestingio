		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About 10-20 microns.</p>
<p><a href="http://quarksandcoffee.com/index.php/2015/07/13/how-much-would-the-oceans-drop-if-all-the-fish-etc-vanished/" target="_blank">I did the math on this before</a> for fish (~3 microns drop). Fish account for about 1-2 billion tonnes of biomass in the oceans, while all ocean life accounts for 5-10 billion tonnes of biomass. That's a factor of 5 bigger - so the 3 micron drop for fish can be bumped up to 15 microns for all life. </p>
<p>Visualized another way, if you took all of the life in the ocean and spread it out into a very thin paste extending over the surface of the oceans, that paste wouldn't even be as thick as a hair. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question is actually significantly more complex than just removing the volume or mass of life within the oceans. Ocean sediments cover the majority of the ocean floor, sediment depths depend on the sediment source. Pelagic sediments, which cover nearly all the ocean floor are predominately made up of the small shells of calcareous or siliceous organisms. </p>
<p>These shells accumulate over time to produce significant depth. So if the oceans were always devoid of live you would have lost a very significant contribution to the sedimentary depth of our oceans. I did some back of the envelope math in response to /u/VeryLittle 's comment but conservatively, if the oceans were never to have supported life you would have globally lost about <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/3tp57k/how_much_shallower_would_the_oceans_be_if_they/cx81xn7" target="_blank">65m worth of sediments</a>. Which would further drop the sea level. </p>
<p>Those calculations assume that we have never had life in the oceans. However, if the oceans were lifeless for lets say the past 1000 years we would globally have at least 1 cm less of biogenic pelagic sediments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This will probably be buried at the bottom, but you should check out xkcd's article on <a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/33/" target="_blank">Sea level displacements due to ships and other oceanic element</a></p>
<p>The short answer is <em>approximately</em> 6 microns, but only for about 12 hours, as sea level rises will bring it back to the starting level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another way to look at it is to say that the living organisms are made up of the water and suspended nutrients that were already there. So from that POV, if the life hadn't formed in the first place, the surface level wouldn't be any different. The molecules would just be drifting freely rather than being organized into dolphins and shrimp.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be almost the same.  Molecules that the life consumed to grow are still in the oceans not consumed.  It's mostly a zero sum game, mind you density changes through chemical reactions, which would be negligible.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
