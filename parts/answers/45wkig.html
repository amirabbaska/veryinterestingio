		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geologist here! If im not mistaken, there is a project that just restarted with the intent to drill into the mantle (<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/quest-to-drill-into-earth-s-mantle-restarts-1.18921" target="_blank">http://www.nature.com/news/quest-to-drill-into-earth-s-mantle-restarts-1.18921</a>). The problem with drilling deep isnt the technology, it has to do with the Earth itself...So the Earth has a couple of layers: the Crust (5-40km), mantle (~3000km), outer core (2250km) and inner core (~1250km). The crust is rigid and thin, perfect for drilling through. But the mantle on the other hand is like putty, extremely hot and maleable, but not fluid (think of it like an extremely viscous silly putty that will melt your face off). So when you drill through it, the hole just reseals itself. I dunno if we have a drill bit that is strong enough to withstand the temperatures and pressures, but the mantle just doesnt like to have holes punched in it.</p>
<p>Heres a good image of the Earth's layers with thicknesses: <a href="http://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/earth_layers_nasa.png" target="_blank">http://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/earth_layers_nasa.png</a></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading somewhere about a plan to make a sphere of pure tungsten and putting something radioactive inside (like plutonium). Tungsten has the highest melting point of all metals, which means it would be the hottest achievable temperature with a metal before melting and losing shape. The decay of the plutonium inside would heat the sphere from inside. The hot sphere of tungsten would then melt its way down all the way through the mantle and possible into the core. Then scientists could track it by measuring waves generated by earthquakes, thus giving them a better idea of the composition of the inner earth.  </p>
<p>Does anyone know if this is feasible? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to a sort of recent geologist's proposal (A Modest Proposal, similar to an older satirical peice of work) Technically, you could use a very powerful thermonuclear bomb or an amount of TNT proportional to that nuclear bomb to create a very large opening in the earth's crust down to the liquid mantle. Before the hole closes, you pour down 200,000 tons of molten iron? into the opening and along with it you can send whatever you want within a small capsule, as long as it is heat resistent. I believe the capsule has a maximum size of a football, but that is for reaching the core. Maybe if you use more metal then you can probably make a capsule that can enclose humans in a one way trip. Also, the proposal said the capsule would make minute vibrations which would communcate data on surrounding environment, which is kind of interesting in of itself. Not that it is practical, but according to the proposal it breaks no laws of physics, other than maybe the possibility of dumping 200,000 tons of metal simultaneously. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The deepest hole we've already dug that you could fall down would be a mining shaft.  The deepest I can find is the South Deep Twinshaft, which says it's a 3km single drop shaft.  <em>EDIT:</em> <em>/u/lovethebacon</em> <em>let</em> <em>me</em> <em>know</em> <em>it's</em> <em>actually</em> <em>Moab</em> <em>Khotsong</em> <em>at</em> <em>3.1</em> <em>km</em> <em>deep</em></p>
<p>However, we don't normally try to go as deep as possible with a single shaft because ore reserves aren't defined far enough down to justify continuing a shaft, the amount of cable and weight used for the cages is restrictive, and the cost of extending a shaft that's already in place is usually more than building a new shaft from existing mine workings at the bottom of the first. That all said, the deepest we could make a hole with our current technology would still bottom out around 4km, which is the deepest mine in the world.</p>
<p>We can only get down that far with current technology for 2 reasons: </p>
<p>1) the heat in the ground becomes excessive and it gets too hot for people to be able to work in without refrigeration. Refrigeration is common in use in South African mines that go this deep, and since this is a single hole and not complex mine workings that require more refrigeration the more likely problem is,</p>
<p>2) the ground pressure increases the deeper you go, until you reach a point where rock bursts (violent fracture of rock to relieve excessive pressure) are common.  We have ways to deal with rock bursts to make these areas safe, but the deeper you go the more common and violent the rock bursts are, until we'd eventually reach a depth where deaths were an every day occurrence, and the project would be cancelled.</p>
<p>There are a few other problems such as dewatering, broken rock removal, transportation to and from the working face, and location selection for best geology that would make a single shaft like this a very complicated problem, but solutions for all of those things do exist that I'm assuming we're using.</p>
<p>Oh, and for how long, I found some information on free falling in skydiving (in imperial units... damn USA, just switch over already) that says after about 12 seconds a person is at terminal velocity of about 174 ft/sec and has fallen 1,483 ft already.  Converting to 53 m/s and 452m, falling down 4km would take about 79 seconds... if they didn't bounce around off the sides of the shaft... which they almost certainly would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
