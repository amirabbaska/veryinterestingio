		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something I did with my 5 year old daughter:</p>
<p>We took an ice cube tray and filled it with water. We put in in the freezer and talked about how it was going to get cold, and I asked her what she thought would happen.</p>
<p>Then we took the ice out and put it in a pan on the stove. We talked about how it was going to warm up, and I asked what she thought would happen.</p>
<p>When it was all liquid, we talked about how it was still getting warmer. What will happen next.</p>
<p>And when the pan was dry, we talked about where the water went.</p>
<p>A few days later she is asking what are clouds. So we talked about where the water in the pot had gone. I asked her what she thought would happen when the water cooled down.</p>
<p>She said &quot;it will be a liquid again,&quot; and just then it started raining. So I asked her what she thought would happen if it got really cold. Ice, snow.</p>
<p>Having a curious kid is fun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's lots of water that hangs out in the air. It's very spread out and in very, very small little bits. Some stuff is really good at attracting these little bits of water and collecting them. One thing that does this is a surface that's really cold, like a chilly glass.</p>
<p>Water has an easier time of hanging out in the air when it's warmer, so when the chilly glass makes the air around it colder, the water in the air has a hard time staying in the air and sticks to the glass instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can find water in the air. It's called humidity or moisture.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;BUT WATER IS A LIQUID!!&quot;</strong> Kinda, water prefers to be in the liquid state but a small percentage goes to the air, this percentage depends mostly on the temperature. Hot environment can hold more water in the air and Cold ones don't hold up to as much water. </p>
<p><strong>Are you serious?! This happens?</strong>&quot; Yes. Actually how to clothes dry up in the sun? The shirts don't heat up to 100ºC / 212ºF. The sun just heats up the air around the shirt and the water mixes up with the air. Removing it from the shirt to the air.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT HAS THIS TO DO WITH CONDENSATION?!&quot;</strong> Well, hot environment hold more water than cold ones. So what happens when he pass from hot air to cold air? Well, the cold air can't hold up as much water and the water starts to leave the air and forms droplets.</p>
<p>Usually this happens in walls or cold surfaces like Mirrors or windows because the hot air is touching there and getting colder. </p>
<p>Any doubts or further explanation PM me, I'm a chem engineer so I'm at ease with the matter.</p>
<p>EDIT: Forgot the &quot;r&quot; in shirt.......... sorry</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is made up of tiny little pieces called molecules, and when those molecules are warm and excited they dance so hard that they fly up into the air. It’s like an invisible dance party happening all around us. But if those excited, dancing molecules become cold by, for example, touching a cold window, they stop dancing and grab onto each other like people do when they get cold. They become liquid water again until they warm up, let go of each other, and dance up into the air again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
