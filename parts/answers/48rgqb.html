		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers are in the right direction but ultimately incorrect here. All the seats are tested for a very specific set of conditions, including seat up and table in the upright position. The seats pass or fail based on how much bodily damage they do, so adding more things that increase bodily damage, such as being farther away from hitting the seat in front of you or having a tray table down or a bag in your lap, cause you to make the test conditions not applicable anymore and cause a dramatic decrease in the survivability of a crash situation. </p>
<p>And yes, the test conditions are only applicable in the times of flight that are most likely to crash, taxi, takeoff, turbulence and landing. In those situations, you prepare for crash situations by removing all items blocking emergency exit, put your seat in the tested position and fasten your seatbelt. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're most likely to have some sort of accident during takeoff and landing. This is also why your tray tables have to be up and you can't have laptops during these times: ease of evacuation. If your seat is back, and something happens and the plane needs to be evacuated quickly, you just made it harder for the person behind you to get out.</p>
<p>Edit: I've gotten this message lots of times, and as has been beautifully explained, your window thing has to be up so, in the event of an emergency, emergency personnel can see into the plane/you can see a fire, should there be one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aerospace Seat Engineer here...The reason passengers are asked to put their seats upright or in the TTOL (Taxi, Take Off and Landing) position is because the seat has been engineered, tested (dynamic and static) and certified in this position and only in this position. TTOL is the most structurally sound position the seat can offer in the advent of an emergency.  A few degrees off of the TTOL position can greatly affect effectiveness of seat safety devices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Why do you need to put your seat in the upright position and stow that footrest?
</strong>
Because in cattleclass, a reclined seat infront of you is going to slow you down from evacuating, and seats are also tested in the upright position (which is why First Class Passengers have to do it too). A reclined seat also makes it difficult for the person behind to get into the brace position.</p>
<p>Footrests? Well those things will take your ankle clean off during a crash. </p>
<p>Bonus answers:</p>
<p><strong>Why do you stow your personal belongings?</strong>
Because they become missiles if the plane crashes or hits extreme turbulence.</p>
<p><strong>Why do they dim the lights when landing/taking-off at night?</strong>
Because if something goes wrong and you need to evacuate, your eyes do not have to re-adjust to the outside light.</p>
<p><strong>Why do they open the windows before landing/taking-off?</strong>
Because the crew need to be able to ascertain quickly if there is a fire outside, and on which side, and also emergency crews need to be able to see inside.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your seats need to be upright so the people behind you have unimpeded access to exit their rows in the event of an emergency. I know it's not much space, but it can be if one seat sticks out further than the others.</p>
<p>The tray table must be up for the same reason, and so it doesn't cut you in half in the event of a sudden stop.</p>
<p>The windows are sometimes required to be up so the F/A can see if there's smoke. Visibility. Usually only regional carriers require this, and then only a few.</p>
<p>Pro-tip: Unless you're sleeping on an overnight international flight, there's no need to recline your seat. Just don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
