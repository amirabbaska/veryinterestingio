		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I recall reading an analysis of this phenomenon many years ago in scientific american. The shower head does generate airflow, but also in a hot shower the warm air goes out over the top, sucking in cold air at floor level, causing the curtain to blow in. </p>
<p>I tried to find it again, but failed. Instead, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/" target="_blank">here</a> is a modern equivalent analysis of the airflow using a finite element simulation - it seems comprehensive enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As people have pointed out it's a combination of the <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kybBoxBAOkE/U18FXdCTlJI/AAAAAAAABV0/p1y6rQr24hs/s1600/the+shower+curtain+effect+explained.jpg" target="_blank">Bernoulli effect and (when available) thermal dynamics</a> of air being warmed by the shower droplets. But the reason for my comment is your second point: <em>how to prevent it</em>.</p>
<p>One thing is to get weights or in the case of a metallic bathtub magnets and place them on the sides of the tub with the curtain between the surface and the magnet. This will reduce the effect, especially if you can get them at both corners and the middle rim of the tub as well.</p>
<p>Some shower curtains have these weights/magnets <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CkxSQJRO1AY/U7qDB9CTG7I/AAAAAAAABnU/sm6bhCGZVZ8/s1600/magnetic+shower+curtain+has+magnets+embedded.jpg" target="_blank">built in</a>, while others have <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9cfUx4t_Zt4/VLHE4bXr3wI/AAAAAAAACJI/Y8GTzf0naAU/s1600/heavy-weights-for-shower-curtain-bottom.jpg" target="_blank">suction cups</a> at the bottom. Alternatively you can also buy kits that allow you alter your current curtain with <a href="https://ourhumbleabodeblog.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/master-bathroom-shower-curtain-hooks.jpg?w=399&amp;h=600" target="_blank">hook and latch</a> anchors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Hopefully Wikipedia is an allowed source (I'm too lazy to check the sidebar on mobile) but it's not necessarily a determined cause yet.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-does-the-shower-curta/</a></p>
<p>This article though does provide one likely cause, backed up by fluid simulations and a pretty graphic.  Basically the flow of water forms a vortex of low pressure that sucks the curtain in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hot water heats the air in the shower, it rises over the top of the curtain. Cold air comes in from below and pushes the curtain in to replace it. Everyone has told you this already, but no one said to leave a small gap between the curtain and the wall to allow the cold air in. This will prevent the phenomenon from happening. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is more than one correct answer to this question. In short, the main reason is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli's_principle" target="_blank">Bernoulli's principle</a>, which states that an increase in flow rate of a fluid corresponds with a decrease in pressure. The water flowing on the inside of the shower causes the air to flow, as both are fluids. This decreases the pressure inside the shower curtain relative to the outside, which contains still air. Thus, the pressure is greater outside the curtain than inside, causing it to move inward. This works for water at any temperature, but the effect is amplified at higher temperatures because the hot air moves upward allowing cold are to enter from the bottom, where the curtain is able to move freely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
