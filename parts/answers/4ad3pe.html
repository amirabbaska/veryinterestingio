		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like deciding whether to cut a pizza in 8, 10, or 12 slices. So the U.S. is a large pizza cut into 12 slices and Britain is a medium pizza cut into 8 slices. Each individual slice might be larger on the British pizza, but all the slices together are more on the American pizza.</p>
<p>The percent in change in value over time is more important that the absolute numbers at a specific time. Each country can decide how much currency to issue, and that will impact its value. Is the pizza growing or shrinking, vs. is it getting cut into more or fewer slices.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Currency value isn't based on how good or bad a country is, but how many people buy and sell that currency every day. Currency is like any other good, and it's value is controlled by the market forces of supply and demand.</p>
<p>If you want to buy a good in Britain, you have to pay in Pounds. That means that if I'm an American looking to buy something made in Britain, I have to find someone British who wants to buy something American and trade money with them. There are people who's whole job is buying and selling money.</p>
<p>If Americans want to buy 10 million pounds every day and the British want to buy 10 million dollars, then the trade is pretty straightforward. You might ask for two dollars for your pound, but then 5 million pounds don't get traded, and those buyers have to offer a better price - they'd bid maybe 1.5 dollars per pound and hope more Americans try to buy.</p>
<p>The reason the Pound is worth so much is because of that trade balance. When you go to market, that's what people need to bid to be the ones who get the pounds that are available to trade that day. In practice, these prices are set by bidders from all over the world buying and selling all kinds of currency, but the basic market forces are still the same - if Britain started to import more goods, the Pound would go down a bit in value because Britons would be buying more foreign currencies. When Britain exports services or the Pound is used as an investment currency and lots of people are buying it, the value goes up.
Like with all goods, the total supply also influences the price. Because there are relatively few Pounds, they're hard to come by, so their rarity drives the price. That isn't the only factor that goes into pricing.</p>
<p>This system was engineered to stabilize industry and currency values by lowering the cost of production in countries with high imports. The idea is that if your country is routinely importing a lot and rarely exporting, you'll be buying a lot of foreign currency and every day those imports will get more expensive until local goods are cheaper again. On average, this means that a good should cost about the same anywhere - that is, a pint in London should cost the same number of US Dollars as a pint in New York because they use the same factors of production. In practice, banking transactions are often a high-level trade which can support trade imbalances in other areas, particularly in 'safe haven' currencies. No joke, <a href="http://www.economist.com/content/big-mac-index" target="_blank">the Big Mac is used as the standard to evaluate currency trade health</a>. Most notably, the Swiss Franc is considered to be strongly overvalued, as it's purchasing power within Switzerland is well below it's price. For example, a Big Mac costs $4.93 USD on average to buy in America, but because of the overvaluation you would have to spend $6.44 USD to buy enough Swiss Francs to buy a Swiss Big Mac. The Pound is considered undervalued at the moment because it would only cost $4.22 USD to buy a Big Mac in Birmingham, meaning that it would be profitable for American traders to do more business with Britain.</p>
<p>So, you should expect the Pound to go back up in value relative to the US Dollar at some point in the near future. Currently, it's purchasing power denotes that it can buy more things in Britain than it's equivalent value of US Dollars could at home. It's value is a product of trade balances, quantity available, and Britain's place in the global banking and investment world, as well as what Britons value it at at home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h2>STORY ONE</h2>
<p>Suppose there are two kingdoms, next door to one another. The first kingdom uses <strong>Orangreds</strong> as currency. The second uses <strong>Periwinkles</strong>. Suppose you live in the first kingdom: what does a loaf of bread cost you? Well: that depends on many things - it depends on how much grain there is, how competitive the bakers are, what the cost-of-living is (how much people of the kingdom have to pay in taxes, etc.).</p>
<p>But let's say that a loaf of bread usually costs about 3 Orangereds. And because you're close to the border, you notice that your neighbours only pay <em>2</em> Periwinkles for their loaves of bread. Are they getting a better deal than you?</p>
<p>There's only one way to find out: you walk over the border and go to a baker. He won't accept your Orangereds, so you go to a moneychanger. The moneychanger offers to change your Orangereds for Periwinkles, but to get 2 Periwinkles... he wants to charge you 3 Orangereds... plus a commission of 0.5 Orangereds, for his trouble. Damn: your bread's no cheaper in the second kingdom than the first - in fact, it's more expensive! It doesn't matter that a loaf of bread &quot;only&quot; costs 2 Periwinkles when it costs 3 Orangereds, because each individual Periwinkle is worth more than each individual Orangered. But people in the first kingdom (assuming that they're equally affluent, on the hole) have <em>more</em> Orangereds than their neighbours have Periwinkles, which compensates it exactly.</p>
<p>In the same way, it doesn't matter that a British pound is worth the same as about $1.40 USD or about 150 Japanese Yen or whatever else you measure it against: it's a completely arbritrary number. However, as we'll see in the second story, it's the way that the values of the currencies change relative to one another that matter:</p>
<h2>STORY TWO</h2>
<p>The king of your kingdom is mad, they say. He's building huge statues of himself in every village, and he's bankrupting himself by doing so. At first, he just tried <em>printing more Orangered coins</em> in his mint (he's the king, after all) to pay the masons, but as they got richer and richer they started charging him more and more (after all: they didn't <em>need</em> the money so much now that they were wealthy, so they put up their prices), and the rich masons started buying more luxury goods, like cakes, making the bakers richer too (so <em>they</em> put their prices up as well!), all of which made each individual Orangered worth less in the eyes of the people. Nowadays, people who drop a single Orangered on the street don't even bend down to pick it up! Not like when you were young! (This is called &quot;inflation&quot;, by the way, but it's caused by <em>lots</em> of different things: not just mad kings!)</p>
<p>So the king tried a new strategy: he raised the taxes. Now, instead of having to pay him 1 Orangered out of every 10 that you earn, you have to pay him <em>2</em> Orangereds out of every 10 that you earn. It worked, at first, and the king started gathering lots of money to pay the masons to keep putting up the statues... but the people aren't happy. With more of their income going to the king, there's had to be some belt-tightening, especially among the people who were poorer to begin with. You've heard tell of people who've gotten so sick of it that they've moved to the next kingdom over to start their lives anew, so you decide it's time to give it a go.</p>
<p>You sell your house for 10,000 Orangereds and trek across the border, looking for the moneychanger you met the other year: he was trading 3 Orangereds to 2 Periwinkles (for a commission), which sounds like a pretty good deal nowadays: anything to get away from the mad king and his expensive statue-building habit. But when you find the moneychanger, he's not upholding that deal any more. With so many people emigrating to his land and trading-in their Orangereds, he has more Orangereds than he knows what to do with! Nobody's buying them from him, so he's reluctant to buy them himself! He offers you just 1,500 Periwinkles for your 10,000 Orangereds, and you feel thoroughly robbed. What went wrong?</p>
<p>What you're seeing here is the value of currencies fluctuate <em>relative to one another</em>, which happens all the time. When there are just two countries, it's very simple to see the cause-and-effect for them: the mad king's spending spree causing inflation and his new tax policy causing emigration is a clear cause for this particular spike, for example! But when they are hundreds of countries, the knock-on effects are immense. Everything stays pretty-well in check, because any disbalances &quot;fix themselves&quot; as investors buy and sell currencies and invest in particular countries (so you'll never be able to make a profit by selling Orangereds to buy Periwinkles, selling Periwinkles to buy Bitcoins, then selling the Bitcoins to buy Orangreds - at least, not all in the same afternoon!). But it's complex.</p>
<p>In our real world, for example, an earthquake in India might cause foreign investors to cancel plans to buy stock in affected Indian companies, resulting in the value of the Rupee to fall relative to other currencies. Perhaps this'll cause some Australian companies to switch their suppliers from the Bangladeshi ones that they were using to their Indian counterparts, because the exchange rate now makes it cheaper for them to do so: this results in a glut of Australian dollars pouring into India that would previously have gone into Bangladesh, resulting in the Bangladeshi Taka falling in value and the Rupee stabilising. What <em>actually changed</em> here? For most people: absolutely nothing... but if you happen to be a trader working across the India/Bangladesh border, it might make a huge difference to you!</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr: Relative differences are relative; their absolute differences make no difference. Currency fluctuations are complex, but it's the fluctuations (the relative changes) that people invest in, not the values (the absolute numbers).</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Value of currency is relative, and doesn't really mean much. A quick Google tells me that in 2015 the average UK salary was roughly £27,000, the average US salary was roughly $44,000, and the dollar was worth on average £0.65. If you apply that exchange rate to those salaries, they come out pretty much the same, meaning that the average wage was worth the same amount, but the Americans got more individual units of currency. Both are worth the same in the international market, and both probably have pretty much the same buying power in their respective countries. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
