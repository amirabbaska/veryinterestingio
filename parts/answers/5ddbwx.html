		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a retired professor of physiology. As others have noted, desert animals, like all terrestrial animals, have a water loss problem but even worse due to high ambient heat and low humidity. In part, the defense is behavioral, seeking shade or commonly to burrow, remain there during the heat of the day and forage at night. Owls evolved to dominate this population.</p>
<p>The other elements of water loss defense are the same in little mammals as they are in people, but more extreme. Their skins are very tightly knit leading to low water permeability and have relatively low blood flow. Internally, a counter current mechanism in the relatively long snout permits them to recover a good bit of water in their exhaled breath that we short-snouted, flat faced people do not. Camels have long snouts for the same reason. Finally, their kidneys are built of nephrons, urine producing units, whose structure and cellular structure though another counter-current mechanism to recover much more water from the urine stream. To put this in numbers, humans well-adapted to water stress can produce a urine with up to 1200 mOsmoles of solute per liter. By comparison, the desert kangaroo rat can do twice as well, producing a urine twice as concentrated as that, 2400 mOsmolar. Their water intake comes from the same sources as any critter. Moisture in food (even 'dry' seeds contain about 7% water), liquid water such as dew and rain water, and the water of respiration, formed along with carbon dioxide, as food molecules are oxidized in our cells to produce ATP that powers just about all cellular reactions, either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Finally, to illustrate an even more extreme water retention mechanism, we have bird 'lime', the white component of bird droppings. In their physiology, nitrogen wastes are turned into guanine rather than urea. After their nephrons pull out the water, the guanine crystallizes to a solid. Bird piss rocks. Guano deposits of bird waste was a major source of agricultural fixed nitrogen until the Haber process for converting atmospheric nitrogen to ammonia which revolutionized agriculture and led to the explosion of the human population as the food supply exploded to feed it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Aerobic metabolism converts carbohydrates and lipids to carbon dioxide and water. In larger animals or those with poor water retention, this water must be supplemented by dietary water from food or directly ingested water. Small animals, especially rodents, birds, and other animals that have high metabolic rates relative to their size, can maintain adequate water uptake with just metabolic or metabolic+dietary water. </p>
<p>Edit: I wanted to add that water conservation is a big part of what makes this a viable strategy - a lot of energy in desert animals goes to running hyper-efficient kidneys, making it easier to survive on only metabolic/dietary water inputs. I'm sure there's other adaptations too, maybe a proper rodent ecophysiologist can chime in...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback on this question:
How come animals don't get sick from drinking out of mud puddles?  I'm thinking of antelopes and gazelles, savannah animals drinking out of crocodile-infested water.  If I drank that mud I'd be barfing nonstop for days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Morning dew and snow are also sources of fresh water. An animal so small doesnt require a very large amount of water on a daily basis. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water sources are usually nearby, not miles away. Also, during rainfalls, water collects on leaves and rocks and other structures. When people water their lawns, water collects. Most water comes from our food. And some animals (cats, desert animals) have kidneys that produce very concentrated urine to keep more water in body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
