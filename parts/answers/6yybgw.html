		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been a pastor for 16 years.  I have an undergrad degree in social work and purposefully worked in an area that served poorer communities for 8 of those years where I made less than $25k per year plus a small parsonage. The vast majority of people who work as ministers don't make much money at all and many denominations require a graduate degree. Now days I serve a church in a much wealthier area and make a middle class wage but our church still spends about 25% of our gross income on helping the poor and homeless. Most pastors work 60+ hours a week and don't make much money. This is pretty typical in my experience for most ministers and churches. Just like teachers or social workers we don't go into this work for money. I've do it because we love it. </p>
<p>Those ministers who you see on tv who have jets and make millions of dollars are probably less than 1%. I think they're scoundrels who manipulate people with fear and promises of future wealth if they just give in faith. They use all kinds of schemes - selling &quot;blessed&quot; handkerchiefs, tickets to healing rallies etc. It's a bunch of nonsense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no &quot;apart from collection plates.&quot; That is literally where the money is coming from.</p>
<p>I once saw a video of a woman calling in to The 700 Club. She said, even though she'd given more than half the recommended tithe for the last several months, her financial situation still hadn't improved, as the purveryors of the prosperity gospel claimed that it would. </p>
<p>She said she couldn't afford to pay her rent, or to buy food for her kids. I could be imagining this part, but I seem to recall her also suggesting that her boyfriend was even becoming violent, and the money problems were the trigger.</p>
<p>Pat Robertson told her the problem was she was not giving enough. She should be giving more of her money to his organization.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ones who live in luxury are mismanaging church funds. Basically all of the money comes from church members donating weekly or monthly. Many churches preach and pressure along the lines that if you donate 10% of your income and do good deeds great unexpected things will happen. </p>
<p>With that being said we go to a large church with great programs and facilities. They have a full staff and band and put on a really good service every weekend. The head pastor drives an old SUV and is a regular guy. This church is very transparent about their budget and how the money is being spent and they don't pressure for donations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They also often sell books, self-help DVDs, that sort of thing.  They have a captive audience of people who believe they HAVE to be there every week and so can advertise and solicit them constantly.  Imagine if you were required to be at the mall every weekend.  You'd spend so much fucking money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one here has really answered the question for most &quot;rich&quot; pastors. the majority of the wealthy pastors are writers of books, magazines, or they run conferences, or church literature, or non-church donation based funding.</p>
<p>Joel Osteen is worth millions based on books. My understanding is he doesn't even take a salary from the church.(not to defend him). People like Rick Warren is open that he donates 90% of his annual income from is writing to charity/church/christian causes. He doesn't take a salary from the church.</p>
<p>These people are incredibly dynamic, engaging personalities. They are the .1% in their field. Not all are the televangelists that get the bad press.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
