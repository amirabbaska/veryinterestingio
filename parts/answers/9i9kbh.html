		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Netflix has a pretty interesting youtube channel and blog from their data team. They have systems that build out advertisements and they track every action on the website/app. With this data they also have very advanced data pipelines that allow their data scientists to unpack the actions performed by users against what they forecasted before launch. </p>
<p>My simple assumption would be: </p>
<p>cost to make show + advertising costs - (lifetime value effect for customer persona* x audience size) = ROI for the show</p>
<p>*Shows could also can be used to limit churn for targeted audience persona. Like if netflix lost &quot;Friends&quot; they would have to find 3-4 shows to bring on to appease those viewers. </p>
<p>I also assume that these numbers are calculated before the show is started. So they might assume that the customer segment they made the show for will love this and if it doesn't reach the audience acceptance then it loses money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
