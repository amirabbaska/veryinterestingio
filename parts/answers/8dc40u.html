		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they don't have the neurological capacity to understand what is going on.</p>
<p>In other words, their brain only gas enough power to decide it wants to land on you (for your sweet sweat or whatever) and to make the calculations to dodge you when you swipe at them.</p>
<p>That doesn't leave enough space for them to think about how dangerous you are. It's like they have no memory </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their survival is based upon swarm tactics.  Huge numbers, low survival rates, and short lifespans.  It's sorta like asking why bacteria choose to live in the way where you can wipe out millions of them by washing your hands.  It is entirely driven by &quot;eat and reproduce before I die.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a very viable tactic, and the reason why insects (particularly ants) are so successful.  Well, other than the breeding with the ants because that's a bit specialized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have already answered this question, but here's a relevant study that was recently released in 2018 concerning swatting at mosquitoes: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/science/swatting-mosquitoes.html" target="_blank">Swatting at Mosquitoes May Help
You Avoid Bites, Even if You Miss. When a feeding situation isn’t favorable, a mosquito can switch preferences, and it may learn to associate your scent with avoiding your incoming hand.</a></p>
<p>The article goes into Unethical Life Pro Tips area, stating, &quot;If there are mosquitoes around and you’re shooing them away (and you’re mean) you could encourage your friend to talk a lot and move around and sweat, and they’ll probably avoid you and go to your friend.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Flies see the world <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-41284065" target="_blank">moving slower</a> than we would (because they move quicker and thats how their brains developed) and have more time to react.
