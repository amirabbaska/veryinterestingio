		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even pure water absorbs and scatters light so you could not see the bottom of the
Marianas Trench (10,994 m depth). The amount of sunlight in the ocean decreases exponentially from the surface.  The <em>extinction coefficient</em> varies with colors (wavelength) with the blues penetrating the deepest to a few hundred meters.  So even if you had the brightest floodlights in the Marianas Trench and perfectly <del>clear</del> pure water (the open ocean is pretty close except for the salinity),  you can't see anything more than a few hundred meters away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been swimming in open ocean in the Pacific, hundreds of miles from the nearest piece of land. The water was remarkably clear and unusually calm. Charted depth was around 7000 meters. I went underwater and looked down. All I saw were the sun's rays going down about a hundred feet or so, where it just faded to black. Quite an amazing sight.</p>
<p>I think a better question would be how deep could you go while looking up and still see light from the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In pure water, only 1% of light with a wavelength of 400nm (violet) is left after traveling 78.8m through the water. For light with a wavelength of 650nm (red), 1% is left after traveling through 14.5m. </p>
<p>With a depth of 10,994m, you would have approximately 9.2x10^-278 % of the violet light that started the journey and 3.9x10^-1515 % of the red light.</p>
<p>This also assumes no scattering of the light and absolutely pure water. </p>
<p>In other words: no. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an interesting bit of information.  While water doesn't have the optical properties to do what you've asked, optical fiber does.  Today's optical fibers are so pure that if the water were replaced with fiber, you would be able to see all the way to the bottom of Marianas trench.

<p>Which I think is a similar question.  Suffice it to say, achieving the energy required to penetrate that much water is... problematic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
