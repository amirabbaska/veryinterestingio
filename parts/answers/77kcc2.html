		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's be a bit more specific and talk about gentle rains with maybe a bit of thunder in the distance while you're inside or under shelter. There's a big number of things that contribute.</p>
<p>First, the <em>soft white noise</em>. A gentle rain creates tons of mildly distracting pleasant white noise. This helps reduce stress. </p>
<p>It <em>amplifies positive feelings of comfort, shelter and safety</em>. You don't get these positive feelings when you're outside doing stuff in it, you get them when they're not drenching you. So there's a bigger difference between INSIDE (where you're comfortable) and OUTSIDE (where you wouldn't be), so you notice that you're in a positive state a bit more. And this contrast can be bigger if there's thunder off in the distance somewhere. And such rains comes when it's usually comfortably humid and cool, rather than sticky and too hot. </p>
<p>Gentle rains are tied to an emotional state of calmness too because they're <em>associated with a history of calm activities and &quot;me time&quot;</em>, relaxing and not working. The last time there was a day like this you pampered yourself a little with a good book on a comfortable couch... so you look forward to the next time. </p>
<p>Rain <em>symbolizes renewal and cleanliness</em>. It's a positive source of growth for plants and it often produces a nice clean smell as it washes dust away. So there's a mental association with a few positives there.</p>
<p>And for those of us who live in temperate zones, this type of pleasant rain means it's not snowing and there are leaves on the trees... and so it's what most of us consider to be <em>the better time of the year</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Less fomo: it's socially acceptable and expected to get cozy when it rains. Guilt free cozying without missing out on the coolest party ever or other socializing because there's a good chance everyone else is just getting cozy too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on where you are.  If you're at home, and it's also cold out, you turn on the heat and some lights, grab a sweater or a blanket, and bam, you're feeling cozy.  Because those things make you feel warmer.  If you're outside, you pull up your hoodie or get under an umbrella, maybe stand close with someone else under that umbrella, and bam, cozy!  Imagine being outside in the rain, no coat, no umbrella, no somebody, no warm...no cozy!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a ton of activities that require good weather. You feel compelled to get things done while the weather allows for it. The lawn needs some mowing. You haven't visited that cute little ice cream stand in a long time, now is a great opportunity. Or maybe you should work out bit?</p>
<p>If it's raining however, you are limited to mostly indoor activities and there you can only do so much. Could as well get comfy, read a book and have a tea. Nothing else to do anyway. Coziness ensues</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
