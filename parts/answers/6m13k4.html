		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a link between kidney damage and burns- it can be fatal and/or cause renal failure. Burns and tissue damage flood your flowing blood with &quot;exploded&quot; cells, infection, dirt, general debris and gunk. The kidneys filter the blood of ions and water, and this mixture of  &quot;gunk&quot; can damage kidneys.
I am not a medical doctor- I only studied biomedical science so speak with your own doctor about this but it may be that you have some scarring and damage to your kidneys.
