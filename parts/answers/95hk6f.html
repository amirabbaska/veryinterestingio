		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pixels on a screen work with RGB (Red Green Blue) because they emit light and as such can create the entire colour spectrum by changing the intensity of one single colour.</p>
<p>This is sort of how a printer works except since it's printed the colours don't emit light but <strong>reflect</strong> light and to create a colour by reflecting you need the colour to absorb all wavelengths except the colour you're trying to get.</p>
<p>This is why printers work with CMYK (Cyan Magenta Yellow Black*)It is with these specific colours in the intensity collaboration we can achieve the full colour spectrum on paper.</p>
<p><em>*The K stands for blacK because they didn't want to confuse people by making them think it stood for Blue or Brown</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual color spectrum goes from ~350 nm to ~750 nm.</p>
<p>However, the way you see is via 'cones' that have their maximum gain at center wavelengths ~475, ~550, ~700 (blue, green, red). So if I shine a light with a wavelength of ~515, you're actually seeing a dim blue light at the same time you see a dim green light - and you interpolate that it's somewhere between blue and green.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, you'd see the exact same color if I shone two dim lights - one @ 475 nm and the other at @ 550 nm. Your eye can't tell the difference between the two colors and the one color in the center.</p>
<p>As a result, it makes sense when projecting light to just match the emitters to our eyes. Because you're 'faking' the intermediary colors anyway, you might as well fake them with the same parameters as the eyes that will perceive them.</p>
<p>However, when you're dealing with reflective light, you can't really do this all that effectively. If you tried to 'paint' individual pixels to mimic the RGB approach of monitors, you end up with something like: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism#/media/File:VanGogh_1887_Selbstbildnis.jpg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointillism#/media/File:VanGogh_1887_Selbstbildnis.jpg</a></p>
<p>Instead, what we do is mix colors togethers and generate the true colors - and then let our eyes interpret them as they do any true color. When you're mixing colors togethers, it's far easier to work with roughly equal sized frequency bands in the color spectrum rather than trying to match the lopsided nature of human visual perception.</p>
<p>Note: This also means that what appears true-to-life to us on our monitors will often appear bizarre to other animals with different color perception.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because cyan is a primary color.</p>
<p>There are 3 (subtractive -or painting) primary colors: cyan, yellow and magenta. So, for printing where you need to be able to mix inks to produce as many shades as possible, using primary color inks gets you the best range possible with the fewest separate inks.</p>
<p>Because cyan is bluish, and magenta is reddish, when teaching young children, the primary colors, are often called blue, yellow and red to keep the names simple. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
