<p>What to do</p>
<p>We are trying to compare what happens to the temperature of milky tea when you add the milk at the beginning or at the end of a wait.</p>
<p>So make 2 identical cups of tea and pour a measured amount of milk into the first at the beginning of the experiment.</p>
<p>Wait 15 minutes then add the milk to the second cup of tea and measure the temperature of both cups.</p>
<p>What may happen</p>
<p>You should find that once you add the milk to the second cup, the cup which you added the milk to first is the warmest.</p>
<p>Below you can see a graph of the temperature of the tea against time made with a mutilated electronic thermometer plugged into a computer. You can see that the tea which has milk added first cools down more slowly than the tea with no milk in it. So when you add the milk to the second cup of tea it ends up colder.</p>
<p>EDIT: The source here is better and was measured, not theoretical. BTW, this source doesn't account for the tea bag heat retention, so someone smarter than I am can figure that part out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Be The Scientist! Make 2 cups of tea at the same time and pour the milk differently.  Let us know the result </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat diffusion is fueled by the temperature difference (temperature gradient), which is higher for hot water in air than hot water+milk in air. So you lose more heat in the same space of time in case of hotter material.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction#Fourier.27s_law" target="_blank">Fourier's Law</a> of thermal conduction explains it with equations.<br />
So - case A is better for you.  </p>
<p>EDIT:<br />
/u/Warlizard gave a very nice answer, try and give it a read!<br />
Also:<br />
Yes, as many redditors mentioned, there are many more things to consider if we want to look more deeply into the problem, as: heat convection (as /u/Karnaugh_Map calculated and arrived at Rayleigh numbers of about 30 million, which would make convection dominant), heat radiation (which is very small in this case), surface change due to the addition of milk, change of viscosity and wetting, shape of the mug, etc.<br />
It mostly still comes to the conclusion that the smaller temperature difference the slower cooling, so the conclusions match.<br />
Thanks to all for great insight and curiosity!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this is just an academic question; it seems like you actually want an answer for the practical application.</p>
<p>You seem to be ignoring steeping time/temperature. In Case A you are actually steeping the tea for 3 minutes in the boiled water. In Case B are you putting the teabag back into the water-milk mixture to steep for 3 minutes? I would assume so, otherwise you are getting really weak tea in Case B.</p>
<p>In any case, if you drop the temperature of the water(+milk) in Case B, you are steeping the tea in cooler water. If you are talking about black tea (I assume this because I'm not really familiar with milk being added to other kinds), then you should be steeping it in the boiled water, so Case A is preferable.</p>
<p>Note that this is completely ignoring your question about the overall coolness of the cup of tea, but I think your primary concern should be yielding a properly brewed/steeped cup of tea, and then dealing with the milk and drinking temperature. Bottom line (IMO), brewing/steeping temperature is much more important than how to get to a comfortable drinking temperature. i.e. why would you want to drink something at a comfortable temperature if the drink isn't made properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After. </p>
<p>The tea is hotter before you add the milk, which means that the temperature difference between the tea and the surrounding air is a bit higher. And the hotter something is compared to the surrounding air, the faster it will lose heat. So the tea will lose more heat faster before adding the milk.</p>
<p>Consider this example: if you added enough cold milk to make your tea room-temperature right away, would it continue to cool down after? No, because it is already the same temperature as the surrounding air (temperature differential = 0 degrees). Meanwhile, if you let your tea cool down normally to room temperature and THEN added cold milk, your tea would actually become colder than room temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
