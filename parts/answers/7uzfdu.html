		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two competing hypotheses here, and both of them try to explain why the Moon's crust is thicker on the far side than the near side.</p>
<p>While /u/Obsdian_Cultist already explained one of them, there are two big problems it. First, you have to have a Moon formation scenario that's &quot;just-so&quot;: two proto-moons need to form, and they need to have a differential velocity low enough to make a soft impact. That's not very parsimonious. Second, you'd also expect to see a sharp transition in composition between the area where the moons collided vs. the area where they didn't...and we don't see that.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2020" target="_blank">The alternative hypothesis</a> doesn't suffer from either of these problems. It's based on a couple things we already know to be true:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When the Moon formed, it was 20x closer to our planet. The Earth would have taken up 40° in the Moon's sky.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The tidal lock would have happened very quickly, in less than 100 days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recently-impacted Earth would be very, very hot. It would have cooled from 10,000 K down to 2,000 K over 2000 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That means the near side of the Moon facing the Earth would be so heavily irradiated that it would be about half that temperature, cooling from 5,000 K down to 1,000 K over 2000 years.</p>
</li>
<li>The far side of the Moon, meanwhile, would have cooled much more quickly than the Earth, since the Moon is much smaller and the far side is exposed to just space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, bear in mind that anything above about 2500K is hot enough to have a pretty substantial rock atmosphere - literally silicates in vapor form suspended above hot lava. That's going to form a rock vapor wind from near side to far side, and the rock vapor can condense out on the far side where it's cold. The result is that over a thousand years you get a build-up of thicker crust on the far side than the near side.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Within a couple months of forming, the Moon became tidally locked, and was subjected to a huge, hot 10,000 K Earth hovering in its sky. That provides enough energy to vaporize rock from the near side and deposit it on the cold far side, making a thicker crust on the far side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s thought that when Theia, (A Mars sized body that hit the earth), hit the earth, it created a debris field around our planet. And when the planet was healing, the debris field coellesced into 2 different Natural Satelites. One was smaller than the other, and they shared the same orbit. However, one was going slightly faster than the other, and eventually caught up to its sibling and “Softly” Collided with its far side, creating a layer of crust several dozen kilometers thicker than the crust on the other side of the satellite. Thus, while the moon was molten and still quite hot, only the closer side had seas of lava. As that side had a thinner crust, while the other side had a thicker crust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
