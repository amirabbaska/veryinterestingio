		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I live it is hilly and temperate. The sheep and cows will come down from the tops of the hills when bad weather is due more often than not. So if you see them grazing on top of the hills it's going to be fine for a while.<br />
I wonder how the behaviour changes in flat places like Australia where the grazing is mostly all on the same level?<br />
Obviously I know not all of Australia is flat, but when you see the massive ranches, there aren't many hills around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
