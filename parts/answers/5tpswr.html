		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bicyclists are in fact held to the same rules of the road in regards to all other moving vehicles.  You must stop at stop signs and yield right of way, they must signal properly and they must stay as far right as possible in the appropriate lane.  </p>
<p>They're held to a slightly different standard because they are more vulnerable to injury or death, not having a reinforced metal chassis around them.  But they are by no means exempt from traffic laws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They also have a low top speed, but will attempt to drive on the road shoulder when possible, to allow other vehicles to pass when safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cyclists are held to the same standards. Here are some things that cyclists are prohibited from doing:</p>
<p>-Riding the wrong way down a one way street.</p>
<p>-Running stop signs</p>
<p>-Running red lights</p>
<p>In the U.S., 0.9% of all trips made by vehicle are done by cyclists. Few cyclists on the road means few opportunities for traffic enforcement. In my city, there are areas where 15% of the traffic is bicycles. More cyclists get ticketed there than anywhere else in the city. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cyclists usually bike in cities or suburbs where minimum speed limits are rare (at least in cities where I've lived). Speed minimums typically exist on freeways, where bicycles are usually forbidden anyway. </p>
<p>And, as you said, it's usually very easy to pass a bicycle. Even on a one lane road there is often a shoulder which gives enough room for the bicycle to move over, allowing the vehicle to pass. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
