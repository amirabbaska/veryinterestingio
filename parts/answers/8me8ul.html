		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>911 is always a local call.  You dial 911 and it goes to your nearest emergency call center.  The operator there relies on the information you give them for the location of the emergency.  If no address is given, they can do a lot to track down the location, since the incoming call was local.  </p>
<p>When 911 was first implemented, landlines were the thing, and emergency operators were provided with a database to match a phone number to the address (like a phone book did, but this database also included the unlisted numbers).  Local phone providers were also required to set up a contact point for the local emergency center, so blocked numbers could be identified and the location of the emergency found.</p>
<p>Then, mobile phones became big, and in the early 2000's, U.S. legislation required cellular service providers to implement a system to route a 911 call to the emergency call center closest to the tower serving the call.  This same legislation required providers and phone manufacturers to implement technology enabling them to calculate the location of the handset in case of an emergency call.</p>
<p>However, these systems aren't perfect, and they're slower, so operators rely on the location given to them by the caller if they have the option.</p>
<p>Obviously, swatters can't actually dial 911 - it would go to their own local emergency center instead of the one they want to mobilize.  So instead they dial a direct number for the call center they want.  Because their phone is usually not in the area that center covers, the automatic systems to track down a location fail.  This leaves the emergency operator no option but to send units to the address the caller provided.</p>
<p>A swatter may take further steps to hide their location, such as using a spoofing service, but that is really only useful to forestall investigation after the event.  </p>
<p>Source:  I worked in tech support for a major mobile provider at the time the legislation passed and was implemented throughout the industry.</p>
<p>Edit: Just re-read OP's question &amp; realized misunderstood, &amp; so didn't address it at all. Oh well. Somebody thought it was useful. I'll leave it.
To answer OP's question,<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/31/us/swatting-legal-ramifications/index.html" target="_blank">the legal system isn't set up to handle it yet.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if anyone has touched on the “arrested and charged” portion yet. 1- it’s uncommon for someone who accidentally calls 911 to get charged with misuse of 911 unless they repeatedly do it and refuse to take steps remedy the problem. 2- Prank 911 (people who are local to the 911 call center) do get charged, because it’s a bonafide misuse of 911 and ties up emergency lines and first responders. 3- SWATers get charged less  often because they are generally not local to the 911 call center. While they are identified regularly by law enforcement- the problem is location. Generally- prosecutors will issue a local warrant for someone, but will not extradite that warrant (nationwide extradition is quite expensive). That means that if someone in NYC SWATs a person in Sacramento, CA prosecutors might issue a warrant only enforceable in CA. So if the dude from NYC ever goes to CA and gets contacted by the 5-0 he would be charged, otherwise he never answers for the crime. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a cop and a certified dispatcher. I had to cover dispatch often enough. If a landline is entered into our 911 system, we have the exact address. Cell phones are trickier. We can ping the location, but it takes some time and it's not 100% precise. The longer I could keep someone on the phone, the more accurate I could ping their location.</p>
<p>There are probably more accurate systems out there than what I worked with. But there are probably less sophisticated ones, or no systems in place at all. It all depends on whatever budget that particular agency has to work with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former 911 operator here.</p>
<p>When you call us from a landline, we get something called ANI/ALI (Automated Number ID and Automated Location ID, which was originally invented for billing purposes, fun fact). The ANI/ALI data is tied to your billing address and is managed at the phone company. It's different from caller ID and is much, much harder to spoof since it's not generated on-the-fly like caller ID is.</p>
<p>When you call us from a VoIP phone, our ANI/ALI data we get may not be accurate, since not every VoIP provider actually verifies the subscriber's information. SWATters know this, and exploit it. They set their target's address as their subscriber address and it rings into the target's local 911 center.</p>
<p>Cell phones only provide us with the physical location of the tower it came in on, a directional bearing, and most of the time coordinates that may be wildly inaccurate or spot-on, depending on a wide range of conditions.</p>
<p>If someone's life is in immediate danger, I can call a special number at the phone company and get the phone pinged. This gives me the most recent coordinates that were logged, in addition to a billing address if available. It's not something we take lightly and I can count on one hand the number of times I've had to do it.</p>
<p>The entire center I work at has only had 2 false SWAT calls since 1996. It's a big issue when it happens, but it doesn't happen often. If I get a call that sounds fake, I still dispatch it as received. Stress affects people differently, and someone might just be in shock when it's a real emergency.</p>
<p>SWATters may also use something called a TDD (telecommunications device for the deaf) that is like a rudimentary texting system. That way, they can avoid having to speak, which means less chance of them getting caught through voice analysis.</p>
<p>Our infrastructure is incredibly old and most centers don't even support true text-to-911, let alone encrypted radio communications. SWATters use high-tech methods to fool our low-tech equipment.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> They use VoIP and spoof their address. Our equipment is old as shit and that helps them, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
