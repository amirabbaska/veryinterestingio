		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There can be a lot of factors. The chemical makeup of the water, the salinity, the current flow, pollution level, all of those can have a bearing on how much anything that sinks deteriorates. </p>
<p>For an extreme example, look at the wreck of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasa_(ship\)" target="_blank">Vasa</a>. </p>
<p>That was a ship that went down in the 17th century and was recovered in the 1960s, in <em>astonishingly</em> good condition considering it was a wooden ship that had been underwater for nearly three hundred and fifty years. Again it depends on the conditions at the particular site. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First there isn't much organic material there for life to deteriorate. Then the surroundings are dark, cold,  and salty this means organisms that do grow there grow slowly. Chemical degradation is also slowed in the cold and dark (even with salt) and thus you end with what you see now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ten thousand feet down there is no light and very little oxygen in the cold cold water. Very deep wrecks are remarkably well preserved, the colder the water.</p>
<p>Vasa was pretty deep in cold water too if I remember well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ship, and its planes, were made by people who knew about salt water corrosion and designed things to resist it.  Paints in particular were selected for their life under salt exposure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
