The downstream effects are poorly understood, and could be anything from nothing, to interfering with hormone cycles and metabolism, to causing cell death, or to affecting DNA replication and repair, depending on the type and size of the plastic particle. Here's an NIH article on how they (and other substances like drugs) can affect your hormones (endocrine system): <a href="https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/index.cfm" target="_blank">https://www.niehs.nih.gov/health/topics/agents/endocrine/index.cfm</a>           </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
