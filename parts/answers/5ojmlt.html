		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yay, I can answer this!  I was a court reporter for three years after doing two years at a college to get a certificate for captioning and court reporting.  </p>
<p>The machine that court reporters/stenographers use is called a stenotype.  The keyboard of a stenotype is blank, but <a href="http://www.acrdepos.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/StenoKeyLayout.png" target="_blank">this is what all the keys represent on it</a>.  Multiple keys are pressed at a time, sort of like playing a chord on a piano.  Honestly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stenotype" target="_blank">Wikipedia article</a> does a way better job of explaining it than I will.</p>
<p>Before we had computer-aided transcription (CAT) software, reporters could either transcribe that code themselves into written English or re-dictate it at a slower, averaged speed for a typist to type up for them.  If a readback was asked for during testimony, the court reporter would have to go back through a ream of paper that their code was printed onto as they wrote and read back the steno code as English.  This is why CAT software is great.  The stenotype connects directly to your computer, and your steno is translated real time into your software, making it much faster to turn around a transcript or do a readback.  The firm that I worked for could provide what we just called &quot;realtime&quot; to lawyers who wanted to be able to review the transcript as it was being written, and we could broadcast it to their laptops as the questioning was happening, which meant that we had to be incredibly accurate and do a lot of editing on the fly; although, a realtime transcript is never as accurate as a completed one.</p>
<p>Court reporters aren't perfect, though.  Sometimes they can be asked for a read back of the testimony, and they won't have it.  I only know of a few court reporters who would feel comfortable working without multiple audio back ups being recorded while they are writing, and most will listen to these again while they edit a transcript after the fact.  </p>
<p>I guess I haven't really answered the question yet.  Because you press multiple keys down on a stenotype at once, you can write entire words, phrases, or sentences with one movement.  A program that teaches court reporting will use a certain theory for what the best combination of keys are for certain things, but once you've been at it for a bit, your steno code definitely becomes your own since you can customize it to how you like to write.  You can define a combination of strokes to come up as anything you'd like in your transcript using the CAT software, including things like paragraph breaks, formatting, stuff like that.  So, say you work a lot in a court setting, you can press a certain combination of keys and it'll bring up &quot;Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,&quot; which is a very common phrase in court cases, allowing you to keep up.</p>
<p>I believe that most programs require a 225 WPM typing speed to graduate.  225 WPM is a decent speed, but when people get excited they can easily break 300 WPM, so constant practice and improvement is key to being a court reporter.  If you're very fast and very accurate, you can do things like realtime, or you can move into captioning live broadcasts.  Anytime you watch the news, sports, anything live with closed captioning, you're watching a stenographer at work, likely in their living room or office at home.</p>
<p>TL;DR: One movement creates entire words, phrases, or sentences that are directly translated to a computer-aided transcription software on a computer, allowing for instant read back of the testimony.  Generally court reporters must
write at a minimum of 225 WPM.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Court reporter chiming in here!</p>
<p>As other commenters have mentioned, we are writing by syllable and sound rather than letters.  We use a lot of short forms that can be whole words or phrases.  </p>
<p>Take the word hello, for instance.  On a regular keyboard you would make 5 different key strokes (one for each letter).  On a stenographic keyboard you'd break that down by syllable, which would look like HEL / LO.  You go from 5 keystrokes to 2. </p>
<p>Any other questions, feel free to ask!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
