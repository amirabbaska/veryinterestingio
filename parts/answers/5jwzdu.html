		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Internet sites like Facebook promote content that gets people to react.  This is called engagement, and it generally means to advertisers that people are actually looking at the screen.</p>
<p>Content that causes people to react is often content that is very polarizing, but isn't necessarily very true.  For instance, an outrageous lie about a politician will get the people who hate that politician to comment out of anger for the terrible things that the lie claims, and people who support that politician will comment in support of that politician and argue that the whole article is a lie.</p>
<p>In that scenario, Facebook wins, because it's advertisers see that people are actively participating and paying attention to the things that are being displayed on Facebook, so their ads are being paid attention to. </p>
<p>More people are getting more of their news from Facebook instead of from other normal media sources, and Facebook promotes news that is likely going to get you to actively react than it is news that is likely going to inform you of the truth.  This is different than traditional media which aimed to get you to watch, so tried to be sensational, but didn't try to enrage you to engage you. </p>
<p>Another big thing is that traditional news media has some semblance of a reputation still.  While it's not always a good reputation, people still talk about Fox News or CNN and make judgments about them.  News promoted on Facebook can be absolutely completely false, written by someone with a fake name, hosted anonymously under the name of a fake online newspaper for the sole purpose of spreading misinformation, and nobody can be held accountable for it because nobody knows who wrote it. </p>
<p>This isn't something that people would have stumbled across so much in the past, but Facebook's algorithms actually encourage this sort of thing to bubble up to the top, and even without the algorithm's help, they still get shared around in social circles on their own. I could make a quick website on some anonymous platform claiming to be the &quot;New England Journal of Environmental Science&quot; and make bold claims about the reality of climate change, and new information about how increasing CO2 emissions is actually our only hope of saving the planet.  </p>
<p>If I do a good enough job of hitting the right notes in an article like that, a lot of people will share it and engage with it.  Deniers will use it as an opportunity to show how the mainstream media is trying to lie to us about climate change.  Informed people will try to discredit it.  Hipsters will share it around ironically because it is ridiculous, and it will get reach.  Facebook will start to promote it as actual news, and it will be to Facebook's benefit because it will encourage more people to share, and encourage more people to respond for or against it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add a non-US viewpoint:</p>
<p>Websites that present opinions as news or official statements have been around forever. There are virtually infinite sites that give out medical advice, lifestyle guides, fitness guides, fashion advice... that appear as though they were written by professionals, but on closer examination turn out to be the work of marketing firms, con artists and other unscrupulous individuals looking for an easy paycheck. </p>
<p>Sites like that usually have a profit motive behind them (some kind of product or service they sell) but when monetizing online adverts became easy, the shift towards articles that get as much traffic as possible (instead of sales) was inevitable. It started with celebrities, gossip and the like, but quickly switched to economics (10 unbelievable reasons banks hate this guy!) and politics.</p>
<p>The reason &quot;fake news&quot; are discussed now is because of the possibility that they had an effect on the recent American election.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The excellent <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/12/02/504155809/episode-739-finding-the-fake-news-king" target="_blank">Planet Money</a> did an episode on this recently. It's absolutely worth a listen, they actually track down and interview a fake news writer, and it's only eighteen minutes long.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>This election cycle there were a bunch of people writing super sensational made up news articles. Then they would post it on a website for a fake newspaper, like DenverGuardian.com or some such, complete with local weather and AP articles. When shared on social media like facebook those articles would blow up and get millions of shares (hopefully). The fake news writer would then reap the benefit of the ad revenue from their fake newspaper website. Listen to that podcast, it's fascinating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people these days are now getting their news from the internet/social media. There is very little to no vetting of what gets attention- which led to many (not all, but a lot of the viral ones) fake news stories going viral. Clickbait headlines tend to generate clicks/shares, which means people will make more clickbait, because it works.</p>
<p>People's trust is at an all time low, so they've been going to these alternative sources. Which is an issue when a source publishes articles that say (actual examples) that Hillary is a demon, or Obama is a Muslim. They're objectively false, but tend to get a lot of shares because it fits a certain narrative.</p>
<p>In the US, we generally take the stance that you shouldn't mess with news, because of the 1st amendment.There's been pressure on FB/google etc to start curating these, because it's become fairly clear that just being true isn't enough to win out. These articles tend to gain far more traction than ones that are nuanced. It's obviously not great if people are basing their voting on a bad (and very manipulable) source of info.</p>
<p>edit: I should mention that i kept this as brief as possible, so there's some more context/examples i didn't go into. Feel free to ask questions,though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
