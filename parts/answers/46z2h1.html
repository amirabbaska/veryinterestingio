		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Just like right now there were some monstrously large things in the Cretacious era oceans. However I would like to remind you that the Blue Whale that currently swimming happily in current times is thought to be the largest animal ever to live. So just because there were some large fish does not mean you would catch them. <br><br>The quite boring answer is you would probably just catch some slightly odd looking fish.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A better choice might be to visit the 19th Century before fish stocks were starting to be depleted. Imagine Atlantic Salmon, cod and striped bass fisheries on the East Coast. Untapped Marlin fishing the world over. In Ohio smallmouth bass were so plentiful in Lake Erie that they were commercially fished. Bass were also commercially fished for in Buckeye and Indian lakes in Ohio. Walleye were not only commercially fished in Lake Erie but Walleye and Sauger were also commercially fished in the Ohio and Muskingum Rivers. All the great lakes were amazing fisheries with gigantic lake trout (possibly reaching 100 pounds), pike and muskies that would stagger the modern imagination. <br><br>Additionally one wouldn't have to keep their eyes open for predatory dinosaurs in the 19th Century.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>For an average place on earth, the answer is probably a couple thousand years ago. Here is an illustration of biodiversity on earth (estimate): <a href="http://priweb.org/globalchange/images/bioloss/massext.jpg" target="_blank">http://priweb.org/globalchange/images/bioloss/massext.jpg</a><br><br>And here is an illustration of biomass: <a href="https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-779d2d12f4b1821d70ffe12dfbb85aa1?convert_to_webp=true" target="_blank">https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-779d2d12f4b1821d70ffe12dfbb85aa1?convert_to_webp=true</a><br><br>Both are generally increasing. However we are now in the middle of a human-caused mass extinction, and many species of fish are decimated in numbers. I think the best bet would be somewhere late enough for nature to have recovered from the last ice age but early enough that mankind wasn't fishing on a large scale. Of course you might find it more interesting to have a chance at catching an exotic now extinct animal and go further back in time, but the diversity or biomass would probably not be greater.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">
