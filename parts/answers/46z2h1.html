However I would like to remind you that the Blue Whale that currently swimming happily in current times is thought to be the largest animal ever to live. So just because there were some large fish does not mean you would catch them. <br><br>The quite boring answer is you would probably just catch some slightly odd looking fish.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A better choice might be to visit the 19th Century before fish stocks were starting to be depleted. Imagine Atlantic Salmon, cod and striped bass fisheries on the East Coast. Untapped Marlin fishing the world over. In Ohio smallmouth bass were so plentiful in Lake Erie that they were commercially fished. Bass were also commercially fished for in Buckeye and Indian lakes in Ohio. Walleye were not only commercially fished in Lake Erie but Walleye and Sauger were also commercially fished in the Ohio and Muskingum Rivers. All the great lakes were amazing fisheries with gigantic lake trout (possibly reaching 100 pounds), pike and muskies that would stagger the modern imagination. <br><br>Additionally one wouldn't have to keep their eyes open for predatory dinosaurs in the 19th Century.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>For an average place on earth, the answer is probably a couple thousand years ago. Here is an illustration of biodiversity on earth (estimate): <a href="http://priweb.org/globalchange/images/bioloss/massext.jpg" target="_blank">http://priweb.org/globalchange/images/bioloss/massext.jpg</a><br><br>And here is an illustration of biomass: <a href="https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-779d2d12f4b1821d70ffe12dfbb85aa1?convert_to_webp=true" target="_blank">https://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-779d2d12f4b1821d70ffe12dfbb85aa1?convert_to_webp=true</a><br><br>Both are generally increasing. However we are now in the middle of a human-caused mass extinction, and many species of fish are decimated in numbers. I think the best bet would be somewhere late enough for nature to have recovered from the last ice age but early enough that mankind wasn't fishing on a large scale. Of course you might find it more interesting to have a chance at catching an exotic now extinct animal and go further back in time, but the diversity or biomass would probably not be greater.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I watched a very interesting documentary on the Spinosaurus, in which the scientists were trying to discover how such a large carnivore survived in an area which was full of large carnivores and few herbivores. By studying the Spino's webbed feet, they realized it evolved to walk on muddy lake and river bottoms, and paddle quickly in the water.. It's main food source being large, pre historic fish. It was fascinating.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>To offer an answer that's not simply &quot;ehrmagerd merglerdahn!,&quot; or just tossing out the biggest animal X from time Y, I would suggest checking out the streams of Greenland 375 million years ago.  Here, you would find <em>Tiktaalik</em>, a fish that pushed the boundaries of what defines a fish and what defines a tetrapod (four-legged land animals, like amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals).<br><br>&gt;Tiktaalik generally had the characteristics of a lobe-finned fish, but with <strong>front fins featuring</strong> arm-like skeletal structures more akin to those of a crocodile, including <strong>a shoulder, elbow, and wrist</strong>. The fossil discovered in 2004 did not include the rear fins and tail. It had rows of sharp teeth of a predator fish, and its neck could move independently of its body, which is not common in other fish. The animal had a flat skull resembling a crocodile's; eyes on top of its head, suggesting that it spent a lot of time looking up; a neck and ribs similar to those of tetrapods, with the ribs being used to support its body and aid in breathing via <strong>lungs</strong>; well developed jaws suitable for catching prey; and <strong>a small gill slit called a spiracle that, in more derived animals, became an ear</strong>.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiktaalik#Paleobiology" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a><br><br>I think this has so much more cool factor than giant animal X, Y, or Z.  But that's just me.  Giant sharks are still fun.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There were definitely big fish back then but more interesting are the exotic looking ones. Rhinconichthys is one of my favourite. Early fish of that period of note includue the Elopoides, and Flindersicthys species. I also find some of the later fish of the era quite cool too. Definitely go to your local library and see if they have any illustrated guides. Dinasours get all the glory but these fish really showcase evolution in action. You may be like me and be so enamored that you decide to study them full time!<br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Fish have been around an incredibly long time, so most of what you catch would be familiar.  In most cases, differences would be minor and superficial.<br><br>However, it would depend where in the world you went fishing.  Then, like now, there are regional and ecological differences in various areas.  There were freshwater species in the rivers and lakes, and then salt water species in the oceans.<br><br>&quot;Eon&quot; refers roughly to a billion years or more, and fish didn't exist before about 500 million years ago, so the answer to which &quot;eon&quot; would be best for fishing is this one - the <em>only</em> eon for fishing.  <br><br>But if you want to know more broadly what would be the best time, probably the Jurassic period - the continents were so arranged that there was a lot of wet, humid area, lots of shallow inland bays and coastal shallows.<br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
