		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a part of your brain that paralyzes you when you fall asleep. It blocks every signal that your brain tries to send to your muscles. That part is unsynced or damaged in people who sleepwalk.</p>
<p>Oftentimes the person is also able to look around, espond to stimuli and do complex tasks like talking or making themselves a sandwich or even driving. There's a special condition in the same vein that causes the sleeping person to attempt to beat the shit out of their sleeping partner. That's an indication of brain degeneration.</p>
<p>This is during the dreaming part of sleep called REM, where your brain is very very active and able to do complex tasks. </p>
