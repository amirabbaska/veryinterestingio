		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not aware of a disease that exclusively affects rods, but retinitis pigmentosa is a progressive disease that generally affects rods <em>first</em>, and then cones later on. The loss of rod activity while cones remain functional results in an eventual complete loss of night vision, as well as a loss of peripheral vision. So basically you can't see at all in the dark, and when you can see, it's like you're looking through a straw (literal tunnel vision). And then you lose your cone cell activity and are rendered totally blind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Congenital stationary night blindness has a number of variants, some of which are what you are requesting. It is from birth, non progressive and demonstrates an absence of rod function.</p>
<p>Another comment mentioned RP and I agree it's not quite what you want but also close.</p>
<p>Losing/not having rods does not affect central vision and colour intensity at all, it affects low light and to an extent peripheral vision, hence the name night blindness (nyctalopia if you want to be fancy)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rods use a light-sensitive pigment called &quot;rhodopsin&quot;. The production of this pigment requires vitamin A. Thus, if you have a vitamin A deficiency, your rods cannot make enough rhodopsin and will lose function. Cone cells are unaffected by this since their photopigments don't require vitamin A. This means that a vitamin A deficiency results in night blindness (the inability to see in very dark conditions), but normal vision otherwise, including intact color vision.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>intensity/value perception in color-vision conditions (i.e. 'not dark') is mediated mostly by the long and medium (L/M) wavelength-sensitive cones, and slightly by the short (S) cones. Rods are more-or-less useless when there's enough light for the cones to work, they are completely washed out because they're too sensitive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
