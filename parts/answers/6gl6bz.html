		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Songwriters are unimaginative. They use the same stupid chord progressions and scales and rhythms over and over and over and over again. </p>
<p>The energy of a song is largely independent of the scale/harmony, so that's no barrier. Key doesn't matter because you just shift one song or the other up or down until the two songs match. And because we all use the same stupid scales, the chords often barely matter as well. The melody from All Star is mostly pentatonic which means it works with <em>virtually any</em> typical Western chord progression. </p>
<p>There's a reason this is done with mostly pop songs and not, say, King of Limbs-era Radiohead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will try to explain this as basic as I can, even though my native tongue is not english, and my musical education was in a different language, so bear that in mind if some terms are wrong.</p>
<p>BPM or Beats per minute, indicate how fast the song goes. I.e: 60 bpm means you clap once per second. If the BPM is 120, that means 2 claps per second. That means when one second has passed, you have had time to clap twice.</p>
<p>Some of the songs you mentioned you have seen being mashed up are almost identical, if not truly identical in bpm. If there is a variation in one of the songs, the artist/person behind the mashup simply uses an in-built feature in his digital audio workstation (any music manipulating software) to drag and stretch the vocals from All Star so that it &quot;matches&quot; the BPM of the song it's being used on. That's why you will sometimes hear that the vocals can feel a little &quot;slowed down&quot; at some parts in most mashups, or even a tad faster than the original All Star. They do this to synchronize the music track + the vocals, so they don't seem off. (i.e the chorus starting one second too early, or too slow)</p>
<p>If the vocals are of a different musical key, they will often use a pitch tool (that changes the frequenzy, meaning how high or low the note is) so that it matches the musical key of the song the vocals are being put on.</p>
<p>As mentioned before in this thread, most modern pop-musicians use incredibly similar &quot;patterns&quot; when choosing chords for their songs. There is actually a way they come up with these patterns, and that involves the Circle of fifths, but I'm not going into details of that right now. It is simply a guideline for musicians for finding corresponding chords (Meaning &quot;which chord would fit nicely after this one? What would sound good, and what would sound horrendous?&quot;. This is not something every musician follows, but most western pop-music is heavily based on this. Some songs that use this is &quot;Smoke on the Water -Deep Purple&quot;, &quot;Black Night - Ritchie Blackmoore.) </p>
<p>So to conclude, the vocals from All Star and &lt;insert song from another band, with removed lyrics here&gt; do not ALWAYS match up. But because of the already similar patterns in chords, melody and song-structure (Example: Intro &gt; Riff &gt; Verse &gt; chorus &gt; verse &gt; solo &gt; riff &gt; outro), it requires little to no effort to put the corresponding pieces from each song into others that sound similar. That means it does not necessarily &quot;line up perfect&quot; just by dragging the vocals over on the other song. Some job is required, but with songs like All Star, this work is reduced to a minimum, due to repetitive patterns.</p>
<p>I hope this made sense. I am mostly autodidact when it comes to music, but I studied music for 3 years at my old college, so I might be able to answer any followup-questions if this was somehow unclear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rhythm is written using fractions.  It is divided up into segments called &quot;bars&quot; or &quot;measures&quot;.  Each of these bars contains a certain number of beats - 3 or 4, usually - and these beats are divided up into smaller pieces to make rhythm.  When people mash up songs together, the rhythms will coincide based on the relationship of the fractions that they represent.  Think of finding lowest common multiples or divisors in mathematics.  This is how the rhythms match up.</p>
<p>On the other side of things is the melody and harmonies.  The melodies and harmonies are written using notes that fall on a repeating scale.  There are 12 notes in a scale and no other notes are possible (usually).  While you can use any of the 12 notes on the scale however you like, only certain combinations will make pleasant music.  So, typical music falls into either minor or major &quot;keys&quot; that are basically just a general vibe of the music based in specific combinations and orders of notes.  If two pieces of music are in minor keys or are in major keys, the melody and harmony can be shifted up or down in scale to match.  Sometimes minor and major keys jive well together too, but that's not a given.</p>
<p>So, by matching up sets of 4's or 3's, keys (if both major or both minor or they jive well) and by shifting the keys to match, any mashup can be made to sound compatible.  Sounding nice is a different story and a matter of art, you might say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If someone were to drag &quot;All Star&quot; into an audio editing program along with another song and call it done, it probably wouldn't fit together in a way that's pleasing to most people.  If it did, then they probably just share the same key, tempo and form.</p>
<p>Most of the time it won't naturally fit.  Someone conforms them by lining up the time and matching the key, plus many other edits. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're talking about pop songs, I've found that around 80 - 90% of the progressions used are some variation of C - G - Am - F. It might be starting from another chord, for example Am - F - C - G, or F - C - G - Am, but it the same kind of sound. Additionally the G is often swapped out for an E for an edgier sound. For example Am - F - C - E, or F - C - E - Am. This allows for a huge amount of mashups if you can match similar songs up and change the keys </p>
<p>The songs might appear in different keys, in which case you would have to transpose (move) one of the until they were in the same key. The progression C - G - Am - F could also sound like G - D - Em - C. This is the same progression just in a different key, meaning the relationship between the chords is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
