		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physiologist here, who has spent well over a decade of studying the neurophysiology of a sensory system (auditory).  </p>
<p>Think of it this way:  Your senses have evolved to help you survive (detect food sources, see predators, etc).  </p>
<p>We tend to think that our senses are there to continually provide us information about our surroundings.  That's true, in a sense, but they are really there (and are biologically designed) to detect <strong>changes</strong> in our surroundings.  </p>
<p>Continuous sensory stimuli (like constant wind blowing through trees) is a distraction.  What you want to be able to sense is, for example, the sound of a crack that might be a lion stepping on a stick as he is stalking you.  </p>
<p>All sensory systems are designed to fatigue to continuous sensory stimuli.  As a sound/sensation/taste/color/visual pattern/etc persists in time, it tends to fade into the background.  The reason is that the circuitry in the brain that processes this information isn't designed to process the same information over and over - it's designed to find and cause your to react to <strong>changes in this background information that represents a change in your environment</strong>.  </p>
<p>Taste (gustation) is the same as all other sensory systems.  The biggest effect you'll experience is when something new is introduced - that effect, though, wears off quickly as your sensory system acclimates to this stimulus and resets itself to be able to find/react to a new stimulus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
