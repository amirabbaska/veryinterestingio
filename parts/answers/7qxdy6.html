After that, the antimatter they make exists for only a very brief moment before annihilating again. Progress has been made in containing the antimatter in a magnetic field, though this is extremely difficult. I believe the record so far was achieved a few years back at CERN. Something along the lines of about 16 minutes. Most antimatter though is in existence for fractions of a second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can get some anti-matter, like positrons (anti-electrons) from the beta decays of radioactive elements.  Making things like anti-protons is a bit more complicated though.  You can accelerate protons up to an energy of around 7 GeV and them slam them into a block of pretty much anything (but dense things work best).  Sometimes an incident protons will interact with a proton in the block to create 3 protons + an anti-proton, which all fly out the back of the block.  Since protons and anti-protons have opposite electric charges, you can separate them from each other easily using a magnetic field.  You have to make sure everything behind the block is held in very high vacuum so that the anti-protons don't hit air molecules and annihilate. </p>
<p>Once you have the anti-protons separated, you can guide them into a beam and put them in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Storage_ring" target="_blank">storage ring</a> until you need them.  The storage ring is basically a circular vacuum pipe with magnetic fields in it to guide the anti-protons around an orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because anti matter isn’t some magic mirror universe particle, it’s just a particle that has the opposite composition. It can be directly studied the same way any other particle can be, except that anti matter annihilates on contact with regular matter, so you need strong magnetic fields to suspend/slow it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
