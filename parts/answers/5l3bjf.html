		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two questions if you do not mind.<br />
Scientists are sometimes known for not communicating their science to the none-scientific community too well. How would you suggest scientists communicate their science better to get more people interested in science?
Secondly, I am currently applying for volcanology PhD's and wonder how much doing a specific PhD would confine me to that specialty in the future? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
