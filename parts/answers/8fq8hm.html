<p>For the age to be only minutes, time would have had to stop minutes after the big bang.  That would mean a black hole that formed minutes after the big bang.  There are theories that these so called &quot;primordial&quot; black holes exist, no proof yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Yeah okay Boblor...the universe is filled with trillions of other galaxies we can't see because we drifted too far apart......riiigghhttt&quot;</p>
<p>Leads me to wonder how much stuff we missed</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, there are such places (relative to our frame of reference). However, we can't see them because the universe was not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoupling\_\(cosmology\)" target="_blank">transparent</a> until about 400 thousand years after the big bang, or the universe was expanding faster than the speed of light at the time.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit: I probably mistook the question. My answer talks about the appearance of the universe due to the time it takes for photons to reach us. But time dilation is to do with relativistic effects such as matter moving relative to each other in actual space, or regions of high gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Minutes is actually quite a tricky timescale - primordial black holes could conceivably have formed before that, around 1 second after the big bang. About 3 minutes to 20 minutes in, the universe is cool enough for nucleons (protons, neutrons) to form, and dense enough to fuse them into heavier elements, but it's still opaque to light. After 20 mins, it's no longer dense enough to support fusion, but remains opaque for basically the next 377,000 years.</p>
<p>Why am I going on about opacity? Well, to get something that is still, subjectively, minutes after the big bang, we need something travelling at so close to lightspeed that it basically has to be a massless particle, but they're all being absorbed and reemitted, so I don't think they cut it.</p>
<p>The only thing I can think of is to assume primordial black holes exist, and have a photons orbit at the event horizon without being eaten until the black hole evaporates slightly after the 377,000 year mark, then it can begin its timeless journey across the newly transparent universe. With luck, it wouldn't hit anything, and would still be flying now, a particle whose perspective has the big bang mere minutes ago.</p>
<p>Edit: the Cosmic Microwave Background, the earliest photons we're aware of, are the legacy of the process that made the universe transparent at 377000 years in - neutral atoms forming rather than plasma. The neutral atoms were still carrying a lot of energy, which they shed as photons in what must have been an incredible show. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Big Bang isn't like an explosion at one point in space. Instead, it happened everywhere at the same time. You could maybe say &quot;everywhere&quot; was all at one point then, but it's unclear how physics works in that situation. Distant galaxies are moving away because space itself is expanding, not because they were flung away by an explosion.</p>
<p>There are places where, if you were able to observe light from them, you would see them as they were when the universe was only minutes old. But you can't say that they really are only a few minutes old now. Also, due to conditions at the time you can't observe them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
