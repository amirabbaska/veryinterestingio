		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of sad that OP and top voted comments make such a huge, and erroneous, assumption. Namely, that the Masters wanted to do such a thing, but were unable to.</p>
<p>What's even more troubling is that OP doesn't even recognize his cultural bias. &quot;Photorealism&quot; simply did not exist in DaVinci's time, because, and i'll put this as plainly as possible, photography did not exist then.</p>
<p>In fact it was decades after its invention that photography was able to achieve the level of detail that traditional artists could. So why would anyone even <em>think</em> to create a work that mimics a medium that did not even exist?</p>
<p>Third major point: OP needs to study past masters more. There is detail and beauty in renaissance art that has not been equaled today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because photography had not been invented. All the images you linked to are directly inspired by, or copies of, photographs. They literally could not exist without the invention of photography. </p>
<p>Also, a word on &quot;realism&quot;; Photorealist paintings depend on the invention of photography, they're, as it were, &quot;representations of representations&quot;. </p>
<p>But (and this is a concept that Reddit can't seem to get its head around) <em>the camera sees things differently than the human eye does</em>, even an extremely HD digital camera. The images that you linked to do not look &quot;realistic&quot; so much as they look &quot;photographic&quot;. We're all used to looking at photographs, so they inform what we think realism is. </p>
<p>But think about the way that you <em>actually</em> look at things. You look at things with a constantly moving head and stereoscopic vision, not with a unified field and a static, one-eyed point of view. You look at things briefly, focusing in on a few details, and filter out the rest. The human eye does not see things the same way a camera lens does. The focusing is different, the depth of field is different. Even colours look different. </p>
<p>So what I'm saying is, some paintings of the past, for instance, some of the Impressionist paintings, are, in their own way, actually <em>more</em> realistic than modern photographic images, in that they sum up a fleeting glance, which is how we actually tend to look at things. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Superior tools is a big part of the equation. Oil paint back in the day had a lot of imperfections- the pigment available was tainted with other compounds, the oil wasn't pure either, the pigment wasn't ground evenly, the pigments available were limited, etc. Paint today is so much more industrial. Quality control his higher. Same can be said of brushes. The availability of fibers and the quality control within them is much higher now than would have been an option historically.</p>
<p>The big different is in sourcing. Historically painters had to either paint from sight or from memory, both of which are quite limited. Photographers today can work from ultra high resolution digital photography, blown up larger than their painting so they can better see details. Some of these painters will also use prints or projections on the canvas to help them lay down the basic elements in exact, perfect 1:1 proportion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contemporary artists have a lot of advantages over classical artists. They have a better variety of tools and media, like airbrush, and higher quality paint. They have an additional 500 years of art history to work from, during which other artists have done a lot of work and developed a lot of new techniques. Also, they have photos to work from, and aren't constrained to live subjects. So, they can spend a lot of time looking at that reflection up close and seeing exactly what the shapes and colors are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These artists took a photo and then they copied the photo. The old masters didn't have that ability, but that doesn't mean they weren't able to paint realistically. Look up the art of William-Adolphe Bouguereau. He may not have come up with perfectly photorealistic work but he got pretty friggin' close.</p>
