		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI15: This process is osmosis. Basically the cells of the slug contain a salt water solution, and pouring salt on the snail will raise the concentration of the salt water outside of the cells. Cell membranes are a semi-permiable membrane, which means only water can cross it. The concentrations of the inside and outside solutions want to be the same, so water will passively leave the cell, diluting the outside solution, while the inside of the cell loses water and shrinks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are in a hypertonic solution and then osmosis is occurring to balance the salt concentration inside and outside the slug.  The cells basically deflate to nothing and die because of the concentration imbalance can never be corrected before the slug dies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I ask a follow up question?   Do snails/slugs know not to move over salt?  for example if I was to create a circle out of salt and put a snail in the middle, would it act like a prison?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
