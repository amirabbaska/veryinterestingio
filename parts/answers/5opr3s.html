		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is a rank-2 tensor field while E&amp;M is rank-1. This is why the photon has spin-1 and the hypothetical graviton has spin-2. So EM radiation can carry no less than one unit of angular momentum, while gravitational radiation can carry no less than two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of the reason is that there are no dipole oscillations in gravity. To move a mass back and forth you have to push it with another mass, and that second mass has exactly the opposite dipole motion because it's experiencing equal and opposite forces, so the total dipole movement is always zero. Electricity doesn't have this feature because you can push on charged objects with neutral objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bonus question:</p>
<p>Was it obvious to scientist that you could measure gravitational waves with quadropule oscillation, or was it something that was figured out much after the existance of the waves were theorized?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
