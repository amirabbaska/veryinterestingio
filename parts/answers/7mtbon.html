<p>I'm just going to throw out that it probably depends a lot on diet. People who file their teeth and eat a lot of sugar will be a lot more vulnerable to acid-producing bacteria than people who don't eat a lot of sugar. For example, in Inuit cultures (IIRC) women would strip leather straps with their incisors and that lead to characteristic wearing down in the front teeth. However, high Arctic diets have traditionally been low in refined grains and sugars and moreso comprised of animal and marine protein sources. In that kind of context it's easy to see that while the vulnerability of the teeth may have been increased by wear, sugar-eating bacteria that we traditionally associate with tooth damage and dental disease are probably less likely to have as much as an impact in that population compared to other populations. </p>
<p>Dental wear varies by culture because (moreso in the past) people used their teeth as tools in different ways (perhaps not intentional filing, but using teeth as tools is usually how characteristic wear patterns occur in different cultures). However, as far as I know the greatest increases in dental disease came with the rise of agriculture and the transition from hunting-gathering to grain-based diets (due both to increased carbohydrate consumption and likely also malnutrition due to reduced dietary complexity and poorer immune reaponses as a result). Dietary disease is still very present in the world today and periodontitis has actually increased in prevalence in the modern era due to smoking, the use of birth control, and high-sugar diets despite other advances in dental technology. People nowadays eat a TON of refined sugars compared to people in the past (though I believe the addition of flouride to drinking water has helped tremendously). So it's kind of relative; people who file their teeth and expose the dentine make their teeth more vulnerable to erosion and bacterial attack but they may have low rates compared to a smoker who eats a high sugar diet and lives in a place without flouride added to the water. I think it depends, but technically scraping enamel away should make a person's teeth more vulnerable to the agents of disease (understanding how those agents of disease interact with a person will determine who has &quot;greater&quot; rates of disease moreso than the state of their teeth, because worn teeth does not automatically equate to pathology).</p>
