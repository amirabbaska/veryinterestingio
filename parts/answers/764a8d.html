		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you’re asking how exponentiation is defined on irrational numbers, it’s just what you might expect. For any irrational number, there’s only one value that makes the function continuous, or smooth, and that’s what it’s defined to be.
To calculate it, what you said works. However, there isn’t even a very clean algorithm to compute nth roots. Since these don’t tend to be rational either, they must be approximated as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a pure maths point of view we might the number 2^pi as the limit of a sequence of approximations. For example we could take the sequence
2^3, 2^3.1, 2^3.14, ...
Where each number in the sequence is a rational power of 2. I don't know how a calculator solves these problems (it's almost definitely more efficient than doing this) but that is one way of defining what the number is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We simply declare the function x^(y) to be continuous in each variable separately. So if you want to compute x^(e) for some fixed <em>x</em>, then find your favorite sequence r<em><em>n</em></em> of rational numbers that converges to <em>e</em>. The sequence x^(r<em><em>n</em></em>) is then perfectly well-defined, and we simply declare its limit to be x^(e).</p>
<p>This is all possible by the least upper bound property of real numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other posters are telling you what they know, which is a definition-by-continuity of irrational powering; but this doesn't answer your question, which is how real calculators actually (approximately) compute the answer.  I was going to speculate that natural-log computations and the Taylor series for e^x are used, which could work, but that's not quite how it's done.  Fortunately somebody on Quora seems to know what he's talking about and provides a <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-do-pocket-calculators-calculate-exponents" target="_blank">short explanation</a> with reference; a form of approximation by rational functions, Padé approximation, is used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
