		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a fair middling temperature where most cooking can occur at a decent pace without the outside burning too fast. Long ago they'd just say &quot;cook it at a moderate flame&quot;, and had to keep that fire going just right, before the invention of oven temperature regulators that let you &quot;set it and forget it&quot; for a few hours.</p>
<p>But, more importantly, it's right around the middle of the temperature range you want for a good use of the Maillard reaction: that's what gives things that beautiful golden brown. Too low and you can forget about a crispy skin or decent looking cookies... too high and while the reaction happens by the time the middle's cooked it's gone way past golden and into worthless charcoal exteriors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source: owned and ran restaurants for 30+ years.</p>
<p>Its a cookbook temp for homeowners that mostly works. Harry and Harriette Homeowner get scairt when cooking food sizzles at them.
Plus they don't have the air make up and extraction power a commercial kitchen has.</p>
<p>In a pro kitchen the fryers are at 350° only to blanch the fries, they are cooked at 375° and higher. The flatop usually runs at 400°, the ovens at 450° and the salamander is 6-700° The only things that run low are aldo shams (the overnight ovens) and of course a stew or chili is slow simmered.</p>
<p>Everything u/torpedoguy put down is correct as well but if we ran mostly at 350° you would never get your meal.</p>
<p>You can go well above 350° in most cases but you have to be in the kitchen actually cooking for it to go well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve heard that back before fine temperature controllers were a thing in home ovens, they had a “high - medium- low” dial much like a burner does today, and “medium” roughly corresponded to 350 when they converted all of the older cookbook recipes for newer cookbooks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
