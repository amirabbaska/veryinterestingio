		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answer with an emphasis on Christianity. It's important to note that for Christianity, and I believe for all three, usury is banned, not &quot;charging interest on loans.&quot; The definition of usury is the key question.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Islam still does not permit charging interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Judaism it was permitted to charge interest to outsiders, at least. More complete answers have been given.</p>
</li>
<li>Christianity specifically says no usury. This was interpreted as &quot;no interest&quot; up until the Reformation. Not sure if this only applied to fellow  Christians, but since nearly everyone was nominally Christian, the effect was a total ban in Europe.<br />
After the Reformation, Protestant theologians questioned many Catholic doctrines, to eventually include the definition of usury. Where before it was interpreted as charging any interest, it was now interpreted as charging excessive interest. This allowed Christians to loan money to each other and charge interest. This did not happen immediately, but it did happen over time.<br />
Additionally, most Protestant states eventually began to separate church and state to avoid the issues they saw with the previous system under Catholicism and to protect the many new shades of theology that were coming into being under the freedom Protestantism gave the individual believer to read and think about scripture themselves. This meant that religious law was less likely to be state law, and so the question of what amount of interest was excessive became more and more a question of personal conscience, rather than of law.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a note, a previous commenter named the secular Renaissance as the reason for the changing rules. This is incorrect, though the Reformation and the Renaissance occupy similar points in time, often resulting in effects of the Reformation being attributed to the Renaissance, which is more in vogue with society today.</p>
<p>Also, it was under the old definition that Jews developed a reputation as moneylenders. Their rules allowed charging interest to Christians, and Christians seeking loans could only get them from Jews (because without interest, no Christian had incentive to lend to others). Jewish bankers/moneylenders became an important part of the economy, albeit a popular reviled one, as bankers often are.  This system extended past the actual Reformation - see the fact that the Jewish stereotype still existed when Shakespeare was writing - but over time the new interpretation of usury did take hold across Christianity, and it did so as a result of the Reformation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers below stating that charging interest in Islam is still prohibited are not full answers. </p>
<p>Specifically, Islam prohibits “ربا” (riba). It translates more or less to “usury,” but people have never agreed exactly what it constitutes. Today, Muslims generally agree that “riba” means interest, and that interest is therefore prohibited, but that’s not always been the case, and there are still scholars that disagree. More broadly, “riba” means something like unjust gains, and charging interest can be considered one form of unjust gains.</p>
<p>As evidence to the fact that there is no definitive meaning of “riba” and there never has been, the second Rashidun Caliph, who lived from 584 to 644 C.E., is quoted as having said:
&quot;There are three things. If God's Messenger had explained them clearly, it would have been dearer to me than the world and what it contains: kalalah, riba, and khilafah.&quot; </p>
<p>The first term refers to inheritance for individuals without heirs. The last word means Caliphate, which in the simplest, broadest definition is an Islamic polity ruled by a Caliph. As one might envision, none of these are very easy to concepts define or tackle, which is why “riba” is included among them. They have always confused people and caused debate, and continue to do so. (E.g., ISIS or Da’ish claims it is a Caliphate, but most people disagree.) </p>
<p>Lastly, as has been mentioned elsewhere in the comments, there are Islamic banks today that differ in the way they loan money to people. They don’t technically charge interest. In effect, however, they charge interest. They just give it a different name and set up repayment agreements a little bit differently than we’re used to. </p>
<p>So in sum, it’s not totally clear that Islam prohibits interest, but people today broadly agree, as a matter of consensus, that it does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Islam still doesn't allow interest. </p>
<p>In an Islamic mortgage, the bank buys the house at the agreed price from the seller. The bank then immediately sells it to the person who is actually buying it for higher than the agreed price, to be paid in smaller amounts, often each month as in a normal mortgage. In that way, the bank is getting an extra payment for having put up the big amount of money to make the purchase, but is not getting interest on a loan: it is getting the price of the house as agreed between seller and buyer, but in parts rather than all at once.
EDIT: not an expert on the detail. Please direct follow-ups to your local middle eastern bank. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not quite that extreme -- notably the Old Testament only said not to charge interest to the poor, or within the Jewish community. This left Jews free to charge interest to others.</p>
<p>It became more permissible over time, as the definition of usury moved from &quot;charging any interest&quot; to &quot;charging an unfair amount of interest.&quot;</p>
<p>It is still not acceptable under Islamic law, though, not even today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Western World's view on interest changed during the reneissance, when loans were used for production rather than consumption as had been the case in the past. There's the practical reality that it is very difficult for a modern economy to exist without lending. Without interest lending cannot exist on a wide scale. I have no incentive to loan a stranger 100 dollars, if the best case scenario is I get my money back, and the worst case scenario is I lose some or all of my money, if the debtor fails to pay me back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
