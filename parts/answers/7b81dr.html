In the case of stuff like &quot;canned air&quot;, it's nothing but propellant) is a liquid because its under pressure.  It's warm enough to turn into a gas (vaporize), but the pressure keeps it a liquid.</p>
<p>When you spray it out of the can, it is no longer under pressure, so it wants to turn into a gas.</p>
<p>Changing from a liquid into a gas takes energy, so it grabs that energy in the form of heat from the can, making it colder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seems that a lot of people missed the point of the question.  The main reason is that heat transfer from your hand into the liquid increases by shaking the can (due to mixing and forced convection), which makes it seem colder as it is drawing heat from your hand faster. If you try it with a can at skin temperature then it won't seem to become colder.</p>
<p>This is due to heat transfer being proportional to both temperature difference, and a heat transfer coefficient. And shaking increases the heat transfer coefficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a liquid vaporises into a gas, there's an interaction involving a thing called 'latent heat'. </p>
<p>Pretty much what happens is that when the liquid trys to turn into a gas, it needs an extra bump of energy to push it over the line.</p>
<p>For example, when boiling water, you can heat it up to 100 degrees, and then start boiling it. You'll find that the water is 100 degrees, and the steam will be too.</p>
<p>But what caused the water to change into steam if the temperature is still the same?
This is where the extra energy required to cause the phase change comes into play. So in the case of the kettle, the energy is coming from the heat generated by the boiling element.</p>
<p>For the aluminium can the heat for the 'boiling' comes from its surroundings (because its turning into a gas at below ambient temperature).
So it effectively feels like its sucking heat out of the air.</p>
<p>I probably should note that this is more relevant to the coolness felt when spraying an aluminium can.</p>
<p>In terms of shaking one, aluminium is a great heat conductor, so you'll find that the temperature of the can is about the same as the temperature of your room, but because it transfers heat so well, it feels colder than your room.</p>
<p>If you left the can in a place that had a temperature close to your body temperature, you'd find that the can wouldn't feel cold any more.</p>
<p>The shaking of the can helps the heat transfer from your hand to the liquid inside, as your hand heats the aluminium, shaking the liquid (which hasn't been heated yet) absorbs some of the heat from the aluminium.</p>
<p>If you hold and shake the can for a long enough time you'll find that it will no longer be cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the answers below are focusing on spraying from the can, but your question is specifically about shaking, not spraying.</p>
<p>The can does not get any colder when you shake it.  However, it may <em>feel</em> colder because the liquid inside the can is at room temperature, which is a lower temperature than your body.  Shaking the can will allow the liquid to cool the interior surface of the can.  Since the can is metal and metal is an excellent thermal conductor, shaking the can is an extremely effective way of ensuring that heat is continually drawn from your hand into the liquid.  Thus, the temperature of your hand is drawn down towards room temperature more quickly.</p>
<p>Shaking the can effectively acts as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_cooling" target="_blank">liquid cooling system</a> where the metal skin of the can acts as a passive <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_exchanger" target="_blank">heat exchanger</a>, removing the heat from your hand away and transferring it evenly throughout the liquid inside the can.  It works in much the same was as the liquid cooling system in your vehicle does, albeit with a shake instead of a pump.</p>
<p>A similar effect can be felt if you place your hand on one side of a metal object at room temperature and then poor room temperature water over the other side of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shaking only vs spraying then shaking. </p>
<p>Shaking only feels colder because when you first grab the can you heat up the can and the stuff inside with your hand locally. When you shake the can you mix up the stuff on the inside and it is no longer locally warmer (it is now well mixed) so it feels colder. This is the same as wind, but wind doesnt make outside colder it just removes the hot air bubble around you.</p>
<p>Spraying and then shaking makes the can really cold because inside the can there is gas and liquid. When you spray some of that gas leaves. That gas was applying a pressure on the liquid to keep it from turning into a gas. Now that the liquid can turn into a gas it draws heat from its surroundings. This will happen on its own and shaking will speed up the process making the can feel cold quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
