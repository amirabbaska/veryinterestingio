		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of talk of arthropods and such, with some good references, but that's kind of missing several important factors.  It's easy to intuitively think of raindrops hitting small organisms as being equivalent to cinder blocks falling from the sky and hitting us, but that's not how it plays out.</p>
<p><a href="http://wxguys.ssec.wisc.edu/2013/09/10/how-fast-do-raindrops-fall/" target="_blank">Raindrops are not moving very fast, nor are they heavy</a>.  For a raindrop to be considered a raindrop it has to be between roughly .5mm - 6mm (about the size of a fly at the largest).  A big raindrop has a terminal velocity of about 10 m/s (20 mph), with smaller drops down closer to 0.9 m/s (2 mph).  That's basically to say that there isn't much energy in any given raindrop to do a lot of damage with.</p>
<p>Another part is that smaller creatures are quite strong and tough as a result of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law" target="_blank">Square-cube Law</a>.  This is why an ant or a spider is proportionally so strong and an element of this is why a mouse generally won't fall fast enough to get seriously injured whereas a horse or an elephant will splash from a long fall.  Also why a raindrop falling on a shrew or a butterfly isn't the equivalent of a cinder-block falling on a human.</p>
<p>Raindrops can certainly hinder small organisms, but that tends to be more an issue of surface tension, heat loss, splashing and water flow, and things like that rather than the actual impact of the water droplet.</p>
<p>For many flying organisms <em>fog</em> (and, to a certain degree, drizzle) is actually  much more difficult thing to deal with as the tiny water droplets are suspended in the air and they accumulate on the surface of the flying organism, adding a lot of weight.  This is why you usually don't get mosquitoes buzzing about when it's foggy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/39zo4v/comment/cs83p61" target="_blank">This was actually posted on r/askscience a few years ago. Here was the top reply:</a></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered what happens to mosquitoes in the rain? A raindrop is, like, 50 times heavier than those little suckers. So getting hit by one has gotta hurt, right?</p>
<p>Well, not so much. Because researchers at Georgia Tech have found that the bugs are so light, speeding water drops simply brush them aside, without imparting much force. The results appear in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. [Andrew K. Dickerson et al., &quot;Mosquitoes survive raindrop collisions by virtue of their low mass&quot;]</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that precipitation can be a real pain for lots of winged critters. Bats expend twice as much energy flying through a storm as in clear skies. But what about bugs no bigger than the raindrops themselves?</p>
<p>Researchers used high-speed video to watch mosquitoes wingin’ in the rain—well, through a spray of mist in the lab. They saw that when a skeeter and a water droplet meet, the insect basically hitches a ride for a bit before peeling away off unharmed.</p>
<p>So the bugs go with the flow and offer little resistance. And the drop slows only slightly, keeping its kinetic energy rather than blasting the bug. So for storm-trooping skeeters, resistance is not only futile. It’s all wet.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physics doesn't scale up and down like you think.</p>
<p>Elephants are the biggest land animals. Have you ever seen one jump? Elephants are heavy enough that they could do serious damage to their bodies by falling a few feet.</p>
<p>In a similar vein to this, think of a beetle falling off a skyscaper. Does it hurt to hit the ground? Maybe... but they just weigh nothing, so tiny creatures like this have very little to fear from heights. Even at their terminal velocity (the fastest speed they can fall with wind resistance), they may not have enough inertia to do damage to their body. We've all tried to slap a fly out of the air-- it must be like getting hit by a freight train for that fly, right? Not really. We are surprised to see them fly off, unphased. This is also part of the reason why toddlers bounce, and adults break things-- adults have four times the mass behind them when they crash into something or fall off their bike.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's tempting to think about this question in terms of scaling raindrops up to the size of excersize-ball sized water balloons, and &quot;wouldn't it hurt if...?&quot; but this is simply the wrong approach to the problem.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it hurts them at all.  You can fling a bug or ant across the room, the equivalent of us falling off the Grand Canyon or jumping out of an airplane without a parachute, and yet they land and continue about their business.</p>
<p>A bit off topic, but this has always fascinated me.  Hurricane Camille hit our area back in 1969.  It's been said that it was the highest saturation of rain ever recorded.  That birds and other animals outside drowned b/c they were unable to breath through the massive sheets of rain coming down.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:
There, rainfall was so heavy that reports were received of birds drowning in trees, cows floating down the Hatt Creek and of survivors having to cup hands around their mouth and nose in order to breathe through the deluge.
So much rain fell in such a short time in Nelson County that, according to the National Weather Service at the time, it was 'the probable maximum rainfall which meteorologists compute to be theoretically possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is what kills me about the old scale tests in mythbusters I mean they understood some science and they never masqueraded as full-fledged scientists, however the scale tests always counted on &quot;well we threw this scale car at the wall at 30mph and it didn't break, so that means a full size car made of the same material will do the same&quot;. </p>
<p>Or &quot;we tried to start an avalanche on our scale test using a megaphone, which to scale would have been the size of half the mountain, now oddly enough we can't replicate the scale test with a real mountain and the same sized megaphone from before&quot;. </p>
<p>Anytime a scale test was involved my brain checked out and drove off for the rest of the episode because they would crutch everything on the idea that everything scales uniformly regardless of stress, energy, resistance, terminal velocity, mass. It just devolved into pseudo science. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
