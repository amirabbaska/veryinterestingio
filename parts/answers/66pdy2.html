<p>Yes, there are several viruses that will result in the common cold, the most common being rhinovirus. The fact that there are multiple viruses that can give you the disease is NOT the major reason that you can get the cold more than once, since you can be infected by the same virus, like rhinovirus, many times in your life. This is because the virus mutates very quickly. </p>
<p>When human cells in your human body replicate, they have to create an exact copy of your DNA. Your cells do this very, very efficiently and effectively because there are <em>many</em> methods of fixing mistakes in your DNA. When viruses replicate their DNA/RNA, which is the part that they inject into you so you get sick, they (usually) <em>do not</em> have any way to fix mistakes in that DNA/RNA. </p>
<p>These mistakes in DNA/RNA lead to proteins (little parts in cells that actually do work) that have slightly different shapes. After infection with rhinovirus for the first time, our immune system will be trained to recognize the very specific shapes of the proteins that come from this virus. However, since the virus can mutate so quickly, the second time that you're infected by rhinovirus, the proteins from the virus will probably be a different shape than last time so your immune system can no longer fight it off effectively. </p>
<p>Edit: If anyone has specific questions, I'll literally be sitting here all day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine your body is a train station, with millions of viruses, bacteria and germs coming and going every day. Well when your body caught Mr. Common Cold writing on the bathroom walls, it kicked them out and put up a picture. If your body sees Mr. Common Cold again. He will immediately get kicked out. </p>
<p>But Mr. Common Cold has a trick up his sleeve. He loves to wear disguises. So, he throws on a fake mustache and walks into the train station, and proceeds to pee off the balcony. </p>
<p>It doesn't matter how many times the train guards throw him out, because he will just put on a new disguise and come back.</p>
<p>P.S. I know this has been answered pretty well before i posted this, I just hate that its called ELI5 and it is never explained like the person is actually 5. So i fixed that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say you've got a bully at school. They say something mean to you and it hurts your feelings. Eventually, you sort of get over it after the bully gives you the same insult 5 days in a row. Then the next week, they give you a <em>different</em> insult. You weren't expecting it and it hurts your feelings just like before. Then after a while, multiple bullies are giving you new insults every week and each time you hear it for the first time, it affects you.</p>
<p>Viruses are like the bullies, they quickly adapt as they evolve to hide from your immune system. In that sense, vaccines are like a friend that comes along and says, &quot;Hey! You look like you've been working out. Keep it up!&quot; So when the bully tries to insult you by calling you &quot;weak&quot; it has no effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shortest answer, there is no such thing as &quot;A Cold&quot;.  </p>
<p>There are lots of different viruses that can make you sick.  </p>
<p>&quot;A cold&quot; is just a catch all term we use to describe the collective symptoms you get.  One of several common minor, non-influenza viruses made you sick?  Now you have a runny nose, sneezing and couching?  Ok, cool.  It's &quot;the cold&quot;.  </p>
<p>But, if you can't use one vaccination for all of them, why can the same medicines cure all of them?</p>
<p>They can't.  Medicine doesn't kill the cold virus itself.  </p>
<p>You just have to sit and wait for your body to kill it on its own. </p>
<p>What medicine CAN do is</p>
<p>A. Mask the symptoms so you don't feel like you have a cold (advil, dayqui)</p>
<p>B. Boost your immune system so your body can fight it better (coldeeze, etc)  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We still get sick because we're fighting a tiny war that's lasted millions of years. Our bodies have developed defences to the virus, and as it does, the virus develops defences or ways to counter the immune system. </p>
<p>First, the virus attacks in numbers. The first line immune response will catch a lot of them, but viruses make it through anyway. Even though a few may attack a single cell, it only takes 1 viral 'molecule' to completely destroy a cell and release hundreds or thousands more of itself by consuming the cell's resources and making copies, then destroying the cell. </p>
<p>First they get inside with a fake molecule marker that makes the cell thing it's taking nutrients in. Once inside, it is sent to a place where it is soaked in acid to break it down. It softens up and releases parts of itself that destroy this acid chamber that would kill it. Then it's free to float. It finds one of the cell's motor proteins and uses it to travel around. It will slowly try to get to the center of the cell. The cell itself has counters, including it's own little immune system that looks for antibodies attached to the viral molecules, but some manage to slip by. In some cases, before the cell is completely taken over, it will send a signal to the outside for white blood cells to destroy it, killing it, and the virus. </p>
<p>Along with that, once the threat it detected, the body floods the blood with antibodies, may destroy nearby cells in an area to prevent further infection by killing off potential infected before they can get out of control, and white blood cells rush to the area. Ultimately, damage is still done, the virus multiplies, and makes it's way out when you cough or sneeze, free to infect others. It's an overall success once it leaves with more than it started with, even if the rest in your body ultimately get destroyed and you heal. </p>
<p>The fact you can heal and fight it means your body is already prepared for it. </p>
