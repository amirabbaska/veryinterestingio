		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Interesting question. I published a paper on this a couple of years ago, so I'll try and summarize what we found (and bear in mind that other opinions may vary!). Basically, the overarching factor for fish in the deep seas is scarcity of food. As a result, there's a selective pressure towards extreme efficiency in swimming mode. As you go deeper, the fish community changes composition towards longer and more eel-like species - we proved this with data, and you can see the same trend within families. As active &quot;hunting&quot; predation becomes difficult if the ability to accelerate quickly to capture prey is impaired by this morphology, other adaptations to improve success in ambush encounters like the &quot;snaggle-toothed&quot; mouths or voluminous stomachs, or improve odds of escape like being very spiny or being armored, start to make sense. We proposed that this explains some of the macro patterns in fish diversity, such as the absense of sharks from abyssal waters due to the inherent &quot;sharkiness&quot; of their body plan, while their cousins the chimeras, with their whippy tails and spiny fins but similar biochemsitry, are found deeper. If you look at data from seamounts, you do see more characteristically &quot;fishy&quot; shaped fish, like roughies and alfonsinos, at depth, but the greater trophic flux from the surface to the deep which the mount provides probably explains this.<br><br>Edit: Ok, by popular demand I've uploaded a pre-print <a href="https://pdf.yt/d/p07zU9T1tpyOLiio" target="_blank">here</a>. Ironically, I can't access the published version of my own paper as the institute I work for now doesn't have a subscription. Down with the traditional publishing model, etc.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I work with deep sea ROVs (remotely operated vehicles).  IMHO, most of the fish look like normal fish, but with larger eyes and other minor in appearance but major in usefulness differences.  Like tripod fish, normal fish with longer fins that they balance on.  I think part of the problem is that the strange, but often rarely observed fish get the most media play and attention.  The vast majority of what we see are things like cusk eels.  Not the most visually exciting fish...</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The sheer amount of people saying they are ugly because nothing can see them is mind boggling. Guys, a humans perception of a certain fishes appearance doesn't matter at all to the fish, it has no concept of conventional attractiveness.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Many of the pictures you see on google about deep sea fishes are actually that of the fish AFTER they rapidly surfaced (depressurized) it. Not surprisingly, they are going to look very distended. Their bodies were not made to hold up in such low pressures. <br><br><br>As for symmetry, part of the reason for that is that in the deep there is much less requirement for moving around fast and thus streamlined bodies are less selected for.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>We identify what things are supposed to look like based upon what is familiar to us. Surface fish come in a wide variety of weird shapes and sizes too, many of which aren't actually symmetrical, but we're used to them, and in our minds we identify fish as looking like that. <br><br>They're more colorful than deep sea fish (many of which are actually quite symmetrical themselves), as they've evolved to use color as a means of attracting mates, warning off predators, or creating camouflage. In the deep sea, there isn't enough light to see normal color patterns, so the creatures there are often drab or transparent, replacing the usual displays of color with bio-luminosity.<br><br>Additionally, other factors in the deep-sea environment, such as increased pressures, have undoubtedly contributed to the development of creatures with different shapes and body structures than what we're used to seeing at the surface. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
