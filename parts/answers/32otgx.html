		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Answering this in the spirit it was asked,  an atom is empty to about 13 orders of magnitude.  That's pretty empty to be sure.   If a hydrogen atom were the size of the earth,  a proton would still only be about 200 meters across.</p>
<p>That is still nothing compared to the universe.  The universe is empty past 20 orders of magnitude.   Our best estimates show about 1.1e57 cubic meters of stuff, keeping it all at its current density as compared to 2.7e37 cubic lightyears of space in the observable universe.  There is fewer than 5 atoms of &quot;stuff&quot; for each cubic meter of space in the observable universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to ask for clarification from some of the physicists here on this question.</p>
<p>What exactly does it mean for a space to be &quot;empty&quot;?  We can try to measure the ratio of mass to volume of things, but even with its black holes and neutron stars, it's pretty obvious that the universe is less dense than an atom of a given isotope of, say, lead (right?).  What makes any given spot in space &quot;empty&quot;?  What about virtual particles?  Interstellar medium?  The electron cloud?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the answers use the fallback 'universe made up of atoms, so it must be less dense than an atom&quot;.</p>
<p>But the universe has neutron stars, and black holes.  This seems to violate the hypothesis given above (presumably the 'made up of atoms' part).</p>
<p>So what is the density of a neutron star compared to an atom?  several dozens of orders of magnitude higher?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe, almost by definition.  Consider that the universe is made of atoms.  If it were packed as densely as possible, with no space between the outermost electron shell of one atom and that of the next, then the universe would have exactly the same 'space to stuff' ratio as the average atom.  Since it isn't (vacuum of space and all that), it must have more space per unit matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers in the thread atoms aren't really empty. Due to the probabilistic nature of electron distribution the atom outside of the nucleus can be viewed as a very low density electron cloud, as opposed to empty. Electrons aren't little balls flying in circles around a nucleus unfortunately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
