		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are slower in terms of burst speed yes, but we evolved a different traveling method that was overall more advantageous. Humans are the best long distance runners for our size by FAR. Early hunters could use our more advanced communication and intelligence to keep track of prey as it kept sprinting, exhausting itself. We, on the other hand, can go at a slower speed, but at a very steady rate for HOURS, something most other species are almost incapable of. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are essentially terminators. Imagine running from something that's trying to hunt you down, you spring at top speed away and fantastic - they can't keep up! So you run a bit more for safety and stop to rest up, but before you're fully recovered, the predator comes back into view. You run away, but you're slower now that you were so you get even less time to recover, and every time you try to get something to drink there's more of the predators kind blocking your way. This carries on for days, because you're strong, but ultimately there was only going to be one outcome.</p>
<p>We don't need to be fast. We've got fantastic cooling and efficient use of energy. We will be there when you fall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We aren't that great at sprinting. But we're able to track a fast animal for hours, when the animal is already exhausted and unable to run more. </p>
<p>And our main strength is in our capability to work together and improvise. That's why you live in a house, use electricity and talk with people around the world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well most of our evolution had us on all fours, so there are all sorts of problems now that we stand up straight. Lower back pain and GI problems are a couple examples.</p>
<p>Like other people in the thread are saying though, we did land in sort of a golden spot with our evolution in that we are amazing fucking hunters. Humans can basically walk after anything, and if that anything doesn't open enough distance that their tracks disappear behind them faster than we can follow, they are basically fucked. Assuming the hunter knows how to track, that is... I couldn't do this.</p>
<p>There is an 18(?) mile human vs horse-and-rider footrace that humans often win, to put things in perspective. Lots of fast animals are pretty rubbish over long distances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
