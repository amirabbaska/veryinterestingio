		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the most plausible explanation is that the capsaicin activates irritant receptors which stimulate the dilator naris muscle. This expands the nasal airways, reducing airway resistance and thus...improves airflow.</p>
<p>Capsaicin has been shown to do this experimentally (though the only study I found was when it was given intravenously, rather than inhaled, though the effect was still on pulmonary irritant receptors). Next time you have a stuffy nose, try sniffing it in front of a mirror and see if your nose flares slightly.</p>
<p>The additional mucous production is likely counterproductive to decongestion, but is effective in trapping and expelling unwanted irritants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the typical drugs used as decongestant is pseudoephedrine, that is an analogous of adrenaline. When you eat capsaicin the pain induces your body to release adrenaline, which helps you to breathe.</p>
<p>It's the same mechanism that explains how sex, alone or together, helps to breath.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
