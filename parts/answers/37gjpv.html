After sexually reproducing, this jellyfish can revert back to the immature polyp stage (back into a “child”). The jellyfish can still die due to predation, but aging is not a problem for it. The exact mechanism for this is not yet well understood.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physiologist here, my dissertation is on the physiology of aging (specifically telomeres) in a long-lived bird species.</p>
<p>I think another way to think about the question is: <em>Why do organisms age?</em> - from an evolutionary perspective. This helps explain why 1000yo eukaryotes aren't prolific. Others have covered the biologically immortal species, so I won't talk about those...but also look up hydra, which don't age if they reproduce asexually, but once they start reproducing sexually they do! </p>
<p>Darwin (1859) suggested that lifespan, like other species traits, should be affected by selective pressures. Three major evolutionary theories of why aging exists: 1) the theory of programmed death, 2), the antagonistic pleiotropy theory of aging, and 3) the mutation accumulation theory of aging. These theories are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and it is likely that the reality of aging that we observe in nature is an aggregate of two or more of these theories (Kirkwood and Austad 2000).</p>
<p>The programmed death theory states aging (and death) evolved to replace less fit individuals in a population with younger ones with more reproductive potential (Weismann 1891). There is, however, limited evidence of senescence directly linked to population mortality in the wild, and natural mortality is likely linked to extrinsic factors like predation, infection or environmental
hazards (Kirkwood and Austad 2000). There are no known evolutionary mechanisms that could yield such a result, so though the theory was foundation for later hypotheses, it could likely be &quot;relegated to the dustbin of old ideas.&quot;</p>
<p>The power of natural selection declines with age once reproduction begins (Medawar 1952). Therefore, genes that results in a loss of fitness early in life, particularly before reproduction, are under strong negative natural selection and genes that have negative effects later in life face little selective pressure.  Genes can be both adaptive at early age and hazardous at older ages, or pleiotropic genes. Rose and
Charlesworth (1980) demonstrated the presence of these genes in <em>D. melanogaster.</em></p>
<p>The programmed death theory was elaborated as the “Disposable Soma” theory by Kirkwood, where individuals must balance the allocation of resources between germ and somatic cell lines. Aging occurs as a result of the accumulation of damage during life, and though maintenance and repair mechanisms have evolved, they cannot mitigate the damage, resulting in aging (Kirkwood and Austad 2000). This theory also suggests that the variation of lifespan for individuals within a species could be a result of variable maintenance systems. Under the accumulation theory of aging, the free-radical theory of aging, proposes that reactive oxygen species (ROS), produced in stress and metabolism lead to damage in both DNA and cellular material. The mitochondrial theory and telomere theory of aging also exist under the umbrella of the accumulation theory.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is that this is not a good thing for natural selection.  A species that lives for 1000 years fails to evolve for 1000 years while everything around it is slowly becoming better adapted to its environment.  Since we cannot significantly change our genes during life, death and aging are a necessary part of the development of life historically.</p>
<p>If there was, for some reason, a strong selective advantage to a long life you would see it evolve.  In fact our unusual life spans probably are a result of natural selection. After we developed language, cultural knowledge became an important survival factor, and only the old can remember things that don't happen very often.  Older women who are no longer reproducing are great at raising the children of others.  This is almost certainly the explanation for menopause.</p>
<p>But living for ages and ages?  It just has no selective advantages at all.  in fact it is counterproductive from the perspective of a gene.  It's actually a great example of how evolution cares primarily about <em>genes</em> and not the happiness or well-being of the individual organisms that transmit those genes from one generation to the next. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several things going on here:</p>
<p>First, some animals <em>can</em> live thousands of years.  In particular, there's the famous immortal jellyfish, and some corals and sponges are thought to live thousands of years.   </p>
<p>Second, we don't really have a clue how long many species live.  I would not be the least bit surprised to find that some other marine invertebrates, for example, could live thousands of years.  We know many can live hundreds of years. For example, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ming_%28clam%29" target="_blank">ming clam</a> was 500 years old, and <a href="http://fishbull.noaa.gov/1014/19ebertf.pdf" target="_blank">sea urchins</a> can exceed 100 - 200 years old.   But for most animals we'd never know it unless we actually stuck one in an aquarium and watched it for a thousand years, because most animals don't come with handy tree rings for dating.  Lobsters can also likely live more than a hundred years, and may live longer than that.  I rather suspect there are plenty of species out there that could live indefinitely.</p>
<p>This brings us back around to the question of &quot;why doesn't everything just live forever&quot;.  The answer is that most things get killed by something or other.  If you look at species known to have long lifespans, they are all usually pretty likely to live to old age in the first place, provided they make it to adulthood.  Tortoises and clams have hard shells, animals in deep or cold waters have few predators, whales are <em>huge</em>, big lobsters are too big to be eaten by most fish, etc.  Adaptations allowing older age actually benefit these creatures, because they are likely to live long enough to get to use those adaptations in the first place.  Contrast this with mice and insects and little fish, and things like that.  These animals have a pretty much 100% chance of getting eaten by something or dying for some other reason before they make it to a few years old.  There's no selection pressure for adaptations allowing them to live longer, because none would ever live long enough to use those adaptations.  So they live fast and die young.  </p>
<p>I'd argue that, on the whole, animals are a whole lot easier to kill than trees, and that's why they tend to have shorter lifespans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
