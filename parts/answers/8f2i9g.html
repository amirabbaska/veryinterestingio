		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, Fat is the answer.  </p>
<p>If you're having coffee and sugar then there is a major discrepancy between that and cappuccino.  </p>
<p>Cappuccino is espresso, steamed milk foam,and hot milk.  Combining sugar into that and the fatty milk masks the sweet flavor to make it smooth. </p>
<p>Coffee and sugar is just that. </p>
<p>A similar experience can be found if you have normal ice cream vs shaved ice and flavor syrup.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wonder the same thing. I don't drink coffee but how is a can of coke or a frappucino with cream and syrup &quot;normal&quot; compared to home brewed tea with a lot of sugar? I can't stand that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the 31g of sugar in a bottled Frappuccino is in the form of milk sugar, which does not really contribute to the sweetness factor just like plain milk doesn't taste sweet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cappuccinos are made with espresso, not coffee. Regular coffee is much less bitter and is much easier to mask the flavor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
