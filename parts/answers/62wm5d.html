		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So here are my thoughts:</p>
<p>Cloaks are incredibly versatile and depending on the material construction, can be tailored for a variety of uses in many different types of weather.  </p>
<p>In addition, I would imagine that they are cheaper to manufacture than regular coats because of the simple geometry and also easier to fit multiple body types.</p>
<p>Sure, most people think that cloaks are somewhat archaic, but I am sure you can make them fashionable.  So what gives?  Why are coats so much more popular in modern times?  Is it simply a fashion thing or are there a ton of practical benefits to modern coats that I am forgetting?</p>
<p>You cannot even conceal a dagger easily with a modern coat... what gives?!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is something I actually read up on a few weeks back. It has to do with textile technology of the times and the limitations of it with respect to rain. </p>
<p>Basically it starts with water proof fabric, or the lack there of. I won't go into the various off shoots like the Innuit animal derived ones and stick to cloaks. During cloaks popularity in the Victorian era, they were usually made from something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oilcloth" target="_blank">oilcloth</a> or oilskin fabric. It was very tightly woven and treated to make it water proof, but when they sewed it to make clothing, the seams were not water proof. So we had to have multiple layers of clothing so that the seems were never exposed. This is similar to how shingles on a roof work, each protecting it's neighbor. </p>
<p>This resulted in the long duster type cloaks but with an additional material covering the shoulders and neckline like overcoats or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulster_coat" target="_blank">ulster coats</a>. Think 'Sherlock Holmes' </p>
<p>People were aware of rubbers natural water repellent properties but it was fragile and tore easily because natural rubber is quite soft. Eventually we discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulcanization" target="_blank">vulcanized rubber</a>, where it was treated with sulfur and heated and pressed to make it stiff, hard, and very tough. At that point we could make much lighter and simpler garments like rain coats and because we did not need to worry about the seams or needle holes, it was no longer necessary to layer the clothing and use of cloaks and ulster coats or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverness_cape" target="_blank">Iverness capes</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cloaks are great for walking or riding horseback, particularly in rain or winter.  Alas, in today's motor vehicles, sweeping your rain covered cloak into the seat as you sit down isn't quite so smooth a move as sweeping it with your leg as you mount your horse.</p>
<p>Bring back the horse as transportation, and the cloak won't be far behind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cloaks <em>are</em> very warm... Unless you need your arms for anything. If you want to carry a backpack or shoulder bag, you have to wear it under your cloak, which just looks odd. </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, I wish cloaks were in fashion as well... But sleeves are nice for keeping your clothing from twisting around when you don't want it to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
