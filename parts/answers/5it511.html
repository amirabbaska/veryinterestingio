Even more correct your finger is not a finger but ?illions of atoms not quite touching eachother. In fact, if all the empty space in our bodies was removed we would be less than a grain of salt in size.  </p>

<p>Edit2: Well, this blew up.. I must be off to work but before I go I just wanted to post one of the replies explaining much better than I could ever hope to.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>That's a bit misleading even for a five-year-old (who is not literally a five-year-old).<br />
The proper way to explain it is saying that what we consider as &quot;touch&quot; doesn't mean the same thing in small scale because of the structure of matter, but we can still define &quot;touch&quot; in a way that makes sense as a &quot;hard contact between objects&quot; even in situations where there's always some &quot;void&quot; between objects.<br />
An actual explanation would get in more complicated territory because it involves looking at the forces present on the interface between two objects as a function of range. The popular misconception is that &quot;touch&quot; is all about electromagnetic interaction between objects, but that's not really true - at certain range, there is usually an attractive electric force (van der Waals force, for example), which animals like geckos and insects and spiders use to adhere to surfaces.<br />
Then there's typically a point where the force is zero - the attractive force and repulsive force balance each other out. This is often used as the meaningful boundary of &quot;touch&quot; in everyday world - this is the point where the pressure between two macroscopic objects starts to increase.<br />
As the objects are pushed further forwards, the electric repulsive force rapidly increases, which is what is responsible for the pressure on the interface at this point. Increasing the pressure means the objects get a bit closer, until the electric repulsion is again balanced.<br />
However, this doesn't mean you can push objects towards closer and closer. There is another sharp increase in the repulsive force as you reach a very small distance between the individual particles of the objects. And it turns out that this increased repulsive force is not produced by the electric fields of the electrons of the atoms, but rather by the Pauli exclusion principle which states that only one matter-particle can occupy a certain point in space at any given time (to be more accurate, two or more fermions can't have the same quantum state within a quantum system simultaneously).<br />
This means that there really is a distance where we can say the atoms are &quot;touching&quot; because they can't really get closer to each other after they hit the distance where the Pauli exclusion principle kicks in. If you try to push them more together the force just increases further.<br />
Or, alternatively, you increase the pressure so much that the atomic nuclei no longer have individual electrons and instead you're dealing with plasma on the interface. Which, unless you have something to contain it, will promptly escape from between the objects.<br />
And if you can apply even more pressure to the plasma you can get the atomic nuclei so close to each other that they really do touch - but at that point it becomes energetically more favourable for them to fuse together into heavier elements, so the original nuclei no longer exist...  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's the thing. &quot;Touch&quot; in the submolecular realm, is not real! While touch is a real thing we macroscopic things experience, that's because it's an artifact of 1) how microscopic particles interact with each other and 2) how our macroscopic pieces work.</p>
<p>Firstly, you need to know that no 2 microscopic particles are EVER touching. In fact, the smallest of them don't even have SIZE, just location, energy, and thus mass. Quarks, electrons, etc. come in their own masses, with some quarks being SUPER massive compared to electrons, but they're all the same size - zero. But then, if protons have size, and are made of 3 quarks, HOW can this be? Well you see, when these quarks bind together, they never actually get close to each other. They kinda zip through randomly within the proton, always bound to each other via the Strong Nuclear force. This force acts like a set of springs holding the quarks together. They can move around in relation to each other, but if they get too far or close, they'll always get pushed or pulled back into place. All of the areas where the quarks could be at any given time define the proton, and this gives it size.</p>
<p>You may also know that atoms are mostly empty space. Compared to the size of the nucleus, there's a HUGE amount of distance between it and the electron cloud...and between it isn't really entirely EMPTY space, but that's a lesson for another time.</p>
<p>However, here's the next important step - the electrons are attracted to the nucleus, since it has an opposing charge, but want to be in the place with the lowest energy possible, so they fall into the electron orbitals, which always consist of 2 electrons with opposite spins - this is because no 2 electrons in the universe want to be identical to any other electron. Therefore, it must ALWAYS have a different location or spin. But, like the proton, the electron orbitals exists in such a way that the electrons could be anywhere within them...or EVERYWHERE. So, by having the two in the same orbital, but with opposite spins (which isn't really SPINNING, it's just a property of microscopic particles), they're still not touching. This and more is facilitated by the most IMPORTANT fundamental force to this topic - the electromagnetic force.</p>
<p>Just as the electromagnetic force keeps two electrons apart, and in their proper place at a small scale, it can have effects on a larger scale if the conditions are right. For example, if you have a ferrous metal, where things line up just right, you get a magnet. The magnet does neat things, like push away other magnets, or stick to the other end. It even sticks to non-magnetic, magnefiable metals. And that's the important bit - two magnets can repel each other...just like two electrons, all due to them sharing the same charge.</p>
<p>So ask yourself - if atoms are mostly empty space, why do I not fall through my chair? The answer is the electromagnetic force. Every atom in my body is repelling each other atom nearby...not touching ANYTHING, but repelling each other nonetheless. As a result, I am effectively floating fractions of a nanometer above my chair. I am suspended, as if a magnet with the south face is beneath me, facing my south face. This is the EXACT same force as what holds those magnets up, but on a much, much smaller scale.</p>
<p>The only reason I experience the sensation of touch is because every atom in my body that its being pushed on by my chair is pushing upon atoms nearby, without touching them, and this chain extends so on and so forth, meaning that all my cells get deformed and moved by sitting, and that results in an electrical signal sent to my brain, creating the sensation of the fictional experience of &quot;touch&quot;.</p>
<p>TL;DR Nothing actually touches anything, it's all an illusion, and you don't go through things because of, essentially, super-small-scale magnetism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is probably an annoying answer, but on the scale you're asking about, there is no concept of &quot;touching&quot;.   Nothing ever touches anything else because they either can't or they can overlap.  But as we colloquially understand what it means for one thing to touch another, that simply doesn't exist on this scale.</p>
<p>Similarly, there is no such thing as a fingertip.  If you take a ball and look at it, there's a clearly defined boundary between &quot;ball&quot; and &quot;not ball&quot;.  In reality, this distinction isn't clearly defined.  You can't point to a location in space and say &quot;Aha, this is part of the ball&quot;.  If you were to magically focus in on one piece of surface of the ball, you'd find a fuzzy, ill-defined surface where you wouldn't be able to discern where the ball starts and stop.</p>
<p>So an ELI5 answer is:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no such thing as touching.</li>
<li>There is no such thing as fingertip.</li>
<li>As you and I know it, in a classical model of the atom, your fingers never touch, but this is OK because two things don't need to be in physical contact to influence each other.  Think of magnets.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends how you define touch! Matter is not at all what you think it is. The atoms of your fingertips get close enough to cause interactions with each other, like imparting pressure and temperature changes, maybe even trade electrons, but no the atomic nuclei never actually touch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your fingertips are actually touching.  Although there is space left between the atoms of your fingers, the forces between them prevent your fingers from moving any closer together.  That's what touching <em>is</em>.  It may seem strange that there is still space between touching objects since it doesn't appear that way, but objects don't <em>appear</em> to be made out of atoms, either.  Touching really exists, it's just &quot;made out of&quot; balanced electrostatic forces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
