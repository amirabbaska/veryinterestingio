		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astronomer here! We don't have a telescope that can see the lunar rovers or flag. The resolution require would have to come from a telescope the size of a football stadium. </p>
<p>But lunar rovers have been photographed by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/apollo-sites.html" target="_blank">http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/LRO/news/apollo-sites.html</a></p>
<p>edit: Here I will do the math: </p>
<p>The lunar rovers and lander are a few meters across but instead of getting just a pixel on the camera lets aim for a few pixels. So lets try to get the resolution for one meter at the Earth-Moon distance (typically 384,000km)</p>
<p>tan(theta) ~ theta (if theta is very small as it is here) = 1m/(384,000,000m) = 2.6x10^-9 radians. </p>
<p>Angular_Resolution (in radians) = 1.22 x wavelength/Telescope_Diameter</p>
<p>Telescope_Diameter = 1.22 x wavelength/(Angular_Resolution)  = 1.22*(500x10^-9 m)/( 2.6x10^-9) = 234 meters</p>
<p>[I used a wavelength of 500nanometers as a rough estimate if you used blue light at 400nm a smaller telescope would suffice, the 1.22 comes from the optics and I won't explain the derivation of the formula here]</p>
<p>So you'd need a telescope about 230 meters in size to see with some clarity anything we left on the Moon from the Earth. There is a way around this and that is to use interferometry (combining light from multiple telescopes separated by a large distance to mimic the resolution of a telescope the size of the large distance) but that has yet to be done with optical telescopes separated by hundreds of meters. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
