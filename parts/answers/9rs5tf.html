Given this it seems likely a substance tested on  mice that failed would work in humans, the problem is human testing is far more difficult than mouse testing not only due to ethics but also you cant engineer a human to have diseases you want to test. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there is a massive misconception that studying animals with a low match to humans couldn't reveal useful medical information.  </p>
<p>All the simple medical solutions have been discovered.  Medical and biological research today are focusing on the very fine details.  In many organisms we are now studying the effect of one gene at a time.  In many cases we have the exact same gene in humans, and so having access to a rodent for these studies is vital to get a grasp on all the functions a single gene could have.</p>
<p>The days of trying out a 100 medications on a rodent to test for success is fading into the past.  A single PhD student could do research on around 10000 rats to explore the function of a single gene, with lower cost than any other method.</p>
<p>When ever it is possible, researchers will go to an even more simple organism.  This allows them to reduce the number of variables that can affect the study.  And quite often allows them to do more research in shorter time frame, due to the general shorter life cycle of these organisms.  Once they have enough information they can scale up the research to a more complex organism to test for any additional information.</p>
<p>This is tough work, with hours spent sleeping in the lab while experiments are being conducted.  Waking up every 15 minutes for 72 hours to take readings, etc.  And no, there are no mattresses or bunks.</p>
<p>Some references that can paint an even better picture:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question! Here's my take:</p>
<p>Animal testing focuses on 2 things - safety and efficacy. Your concern is that testing in mice might not reveal the efficacy of treatments that work in humans but not mice. However, the regulatory bodies are more concerned about ensuring the safety of a treatment, even if it might come at the expense of not discovering efficacy. This is why testing in animals is required before testing in humans. </p>
<p>Your concern is valid, but there's is currently no easy way to address it ethically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
