		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human blood has very little smell to it, even someone else's in a test tube when your own nose isn't bleeding. I've handled blood samples from the Emergency Room that had the distinct smell alcohol in them, but ordinary blood samples have little scent to them at all.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order for you to detect a scent, a chemical molecule has to come into contact with the sensory receptors in the nose. The chemicals ultimately have to be able to be absorbed into the receptor cell membranes, and they can be airborne or already dissolved in liquid when they meet the receptors. These receptors are located in a specific part of the nasal cavity, very high up. So, if the blood is coming from an area of the nasal cavity that does not allow it to come into contact with these receptors, you don’t detect the scent. If the blood or any other substance becomes dispersed and meets the receptors, you would then be able to detect the scent. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
