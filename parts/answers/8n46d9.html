		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time, those foods are <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasteurization" target="_blank">pasteurized</a>, and breaking the seal halts that effect. In the case of very high sodium products like soy sauce, however, I have no idea why they have that warning, or if they bother pasteurizing it at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main thing is that the air that is introduced contains small amounts of microorganisms, which will infect the contents.</p>
<p>In some rarer situations there's also at the the case of oxygen being introduced when previously it was vacuum sealed or filled with something generally inert like nitrogen. Theoretically (I'm not sure how common it occurs in reality with regards to sealed food; probably irrelevant compared to issues like proper cooking/pasteurization and contamination) it's possible that a microorganism in spore form could return to life now that it has oxygen to breathe (for the microorganisms that need oxygen in the first place).</p>
<p>In addition, introducing oxygen/air to a previously oxygen-free environment could cause other spoilage as well such as oxidation, even if there wasn't any microorganisms to worry about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does anyone know about soy sauce? The bottle says to keep refrigerated but when I go to an asian restaurant the soy sauce is left on the table. It would save me some room in my fridge if I could just put it in the pantry. I buy big bottles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oxygen.  Think of how the Egyptian mummies only really started decaying after archaeologists broke the seal and air got in.  Or if you've ever wrapped a piece of meat and failed to cover all of it, you can see the decay on the part that was exposed to the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
