		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you take a close look at your fingers, you’ll notice that there are very small ridges on them. Everyone has a slight difference between the heights of these ridges, the distances between them, and all the empty spaces or unique points of these ridges.
When you use a biometric system to record and use a fingerprint scanner, you often have two systems: an Optical and a Capacitor scanner.
Optical scanners work by shining a bright LED light over the finger placed for scanning, and takes what is essentially a digital photograph of the finger print. The ridges closest to the scanner will reflect the most light, and the depths and curves will usually reflect less. The scanner records these “images” and sends the data to a computer that calculates the depths and distances between ridges, that are again, unique to (almost) everyone.
The second type of scanner, a capacitor scanner, is more commonly found in phones and various tablets, and is more commonly known. These work by using a capacitor that stores a current, and another computer that measures these currents. When you place your finger over a plate where the capacitor is working, the ridges closest to the plate will affect the conductivity of the capacitor, whereas the air in the ridges between will leave it relatively the same as before the finger was placed. A computer records these changes, and because each distance and curve between ridges are different, the recorded difference will be different. This is how your electrical “fingerprint” is recorded!</p>
<p>Edit: I didn’t expect this to blow up so much! In regards to all the interesting questions, I will get to them as soon as I can, and read up on the topic to make sure I’m not spouting none sense. I’m currently slammed at work, but I will make time to answer you all. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
