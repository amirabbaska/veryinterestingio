		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/the-source-of-europes-mild-climate" target="_blank">paper</a> disputes the claim that the Gulf Stream is largely responsible (although their climate models indicate that it does have an effect, especially for <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/Libraries/images/20066110140_866.jpg" target="_blank">Norway</a>).</p>
<p>Instead they attribute the warmth of Europe compared to America as the result of air currents. Wind flows from west to east in the northern hemisphere, and as it flows across America, it crosses the Rocky Mountains. As the air is pushed over the Rockies, it is compressed vertically and expands horizontally, but because of the conservation of angular momentum, it develops a <a href="http://www.americanscientist.org/Libraries/images/20066110455_866.jpg" target="_blank">clockwise spin</a>. This spin diverts it to the south as it moves across America and then swings it north as it crosses the Atlantic, delivering warm air to Europe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The association of palm trees with tropical climates is somewhat inaccurate, as they are native to and/or can survive other climates as well - desert, humid subtropical, Mediterranean (which is the name of a type of climate seen in coastal California as well as in Nice.) </p>
<p>Along the eastern coast of the US, palms are native all the way to North Carolina, and inland up to Oklahoma. Only a small part of Florida -- the Keys, the Everglades, and the Miami and Naples metro areas -- has a tropical climate. The rest of the state and the Southeast are humid subtropical. No part of California has a tropical climate.</p>
<p>The tropical tip of Florida is in plant hardiness zone 10, but there are various palm species that can survive up to plant hardiness zone 7 and beyond. You can find them planted and surviving year-round (with care) in places as far inland as Missouri and Illinois and as far north on the coasts as New York and British Columbia.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
