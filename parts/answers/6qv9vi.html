		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want to find particles which decay by emission of protons and neutrons, you don't want to look at very heavy nuclei (large N + Z). Instead you want to look at nuclei with extreme N/Z ratios (large |N - Z|). If you go to the extremes of |N - Z|, you reach the <em>driplines</em>, where the outermost nucleons are not bound to the core of the nucleus. This is the point where the separation energy (the energy it takes to remove a single nucleon) goes negative, and it becomes favorable for the extra nucleon to simply &quot;drip&quot; off of the core. You'll see a stark difference between the <em>bound</em> nuclei which decay via beta emission (lifetimes around milliseconds), and <em>unbound</em> nuclei which decay by nucleon emission (lifetimes around 10^(-21) seconds).</p>
<p>To understand why these decays happen where they do, you have to understand how they happen. Alpha decay happens when an alpha particle tunnels out of the nuclear potential well. Alpha particles are extremely tightly-bound nuclei, so they're a very favorable cluster to emit in a decay process. Above a certain point (lead-208), the alpha separation energy becomes negative, so all nuclei above that point are in principle unstable to alpha decay (although some may primarily decay via beta or spontaneous fission).</p>
<p>Beta decay occurs for slightly unbalanced N/Z ratios, because it allows for protons to be turned into neutrons and vice versa. If you plot the ground state energies of a group of nuclei with the same mass number, you get a plot which looks like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258388038/figure/fig6/AS:320549642358797@1453436398292/Representation-of-the-energies-of-the-A76-isobars-The-single-beta-decay-b-green.png" target="_blank">this</a>. It looks like a parabola with one or two species near the bottom, with the lowest energy. The ones near the bottom are the most stable, so all others along the chain will beta decay towards the bottom of the &quot;valley&quot;.</p>
<p>So now you understand what alpha and beta decays are, so you can hopefully see why extremely heavy nuclei would be able to do them.</p>
<p>The next thing to understand is why they <em>don't</em> emit single nucleons. As I mentioned before, nucleon emission happens beyond the driplines. Experimentally, the proton and neutron driplines are only known for relatively light elements. So for very heavy nuclei we don't yet know where the driplines are, and all of the heavy nuclei we have observed so far are within the driplines, so we don't observe any of them decaying by nucleon emission.</p>
<p>Since the alpha particle is so tightly-bound, it's a much more favorable particle to emit than a single nucleon. So for heavy nuclei, the alpha separation energy is negative but the nucleon separation energies are positive. The alpha particle also has spin 0 whereas nucleons have spin 1/2. So alpha decays can occur without changing the angular momentum of the daughter nucleus, which makes the decay more &quot;willing&quot; to occur.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
