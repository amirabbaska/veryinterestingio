		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Alright, so here's what I know. I could be wrong. I have hunted for years, and have harvested several deer. There coat seems thin when you look at it, but when you actually feel it, you realize that its very tight. It's not like cat fur, but more like that of a red heeler. So what I get from that, is that their hair holds in heat very well.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Deer have a higher body temperature than humans do.  We are a species suited more for life in a temperate climate, and have a lower body temperature as a result. You would be surprised how much difference having an average body temp of 104F can make for a deer!<br><br>In addition, deer not only have two layers of fur (as already mentioned), but they can also fluff that fur up when they get cold.  The fur standing up traps heat closer to the body, enabling them to conserve what they produce.<br><br>Deer also have a rumen, which is part of their multi-chambered stomach and acts like a big fermentation vat.  As the food they've chewed ferments in the rumen, the cellulose gets stripped out by beneficial bacteria that help the deer to digest plant matter.  This process creates a lot of heat, keeping the deer warm.<br><br>Other posters mentioned deers' legs, and how they have keratin so they don't get cold.  Deer feet do get cold, sometimes they lift up one foot to warm it, or even limp a little.  If their feet get really cold they lie down and put their feet under themselves to warm up.<br><br>Deer also have the advantage of being adapted to living outside.  Conditions seem much less harsh when your body has adapted to them.  This is why 30F in the fall seems so much colder than 30F in the spring.  <br><br>As for other animals, it's just variations on this theme.  Animals like birds often have to shiver to keep their body temperature up, and some fish basically sleep at the bottom of ponds, moving very slowly, until spring comes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Deer have a few advantages that humans do not, we have clothing. First a deer a layer of fat around their organs and under their skin, that acts as insulation layer. <br><br>Their winter fur, is actually two layers, an outer layer that's made of hollow hairs, and forms a dense weather resistant layer, and an inner layer that's like goose down, and traps a layer of warm air close to the body. <br><br>Effectively their fur is like a outer weather resistant jacket, and a wool sweater on the inside.<br><br><a href="https://www1.maine.gov/ifw/hunting_trapping/pdfs/deer_yards.pdf" target="_blank">https://www1.maine.gov/ifw/hunting_trapping/pdfs/deer_yards.pdf</a></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Even a short fur can trap quite some air, but ruminants have another huge advantage: The food fermenting in their stomachs gives off a LOT of heat. They're basically a wandering compost pile. It's much more efficient to have bacteria produce the heat while digesting your food for you, than using your own muscles (or brown fat, but adult humans don't have much of that left).<br>Ruminants can even somewhat regulate the internal furnace by going for more cellulose-rich fodder in winter, produces more heat. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">
