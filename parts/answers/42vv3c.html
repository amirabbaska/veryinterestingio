		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Deer have a higher body temperature than humans do.  We are a species suited more for life in a temperate climate, and have a lower body temperature as a result. You would be surprised how much difference having an average body temp of 104F can make for a deer!<br><br>In addition, deer not only have two layers of fur (as already mentioned), but they can also fluff that fur up when they get cold.  The fur standing up traps heat closer to the body, enabling them to conserve what they produce.<br><br>Deer also have a rumen, which is part of their multi-chambered stomach and acts like a big fermentation vat.  As the food they've chewed ferments in the rumen, the cellulose gets stripped out by beneficial bacteria that help the deer to digest plant matter.  This process creates a lot of heat, keeping the deer warm.<br><br>Other posters mentioned deers' legs, and how they have keratin so they don't get cold.  Deer feet do get cold, sometimes they lift up one foot to warm it, or even limp a little.  If their feet get really cold they lie down and put their feet under themselves to warm up.<br><br>Deer also have the advantage of being adapted to living outside.  Conditions seem much less harsh when your body has adapted to them.  This is why 30F in the fall seems so much colder than 30F in the spring.  <br><br>As for other animals, it's just variations on this theme.  Animals like birds often have to shiver to keep their body temperature up, and some fish basically sleep at the bottom of ponds, moving very slowly, until spring comes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Humans are good at getting rid of heat.  We had to be, because where we adapted in Africa was very hot. Humans, when hunting, generally just outran their prey until the prey dropped from exhaustion. We are the best long-distance runners on the planet.  We have lots of exposed skin, well developed lungs and sweat glands, and the ability to shed lots of heat by having major blood vessels close to the skin to radiate.<br><br>We ended up growing large brains to use tools and solve problems and talk to each other and remember stuff.  These brains are very expensive. Not in terms of money, but in terms of the resources that they use up. It takes a lot of energy and heat and blood flow and food and water to run a big brain in a human. Deer don't have big brains, so they don't have to have all those resources going to run them. This allows them to use the resources to keep their other organs warm and alive.  (In humans, it was an evolutionary advantage to have a big, problem solving brain, but in other animals, it isn't worth the cost in resources, so they never developed them.)<br><br>So humans don't do as well as, say, a deer, in an outdoor cold environment where you don't need to use your brain very much.  Say a place like Eastern Oregon where those ranchers are holed up right now.  ;)</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Some good answers concerning deer. I'm an avid hunter including deer so let me add a few things about their behavior.
<br>
<br>When it gets real cold they will bed down in low lying area like swamp. This gives them shelter like surrounding cattails, brush, etc. and staying low helps them keep out of the wind. While they don't necessarily partner up per say they will huddle if necessary, especially foes with fawns and yearlings.
<br>
<br>If it stays real cold for prolonged periods they will get up and move around to warm up. Deer also love pine trees for their overhanging branches to block out the wind and their flat empty space surrounding the trunk provides plenty of area to lay and bed down. Don't quote me on this, but I've always been told the fallen pine needles also provide a bed of insulation.
<br>
<br>Many animals like deer are crepuscular which means they're most active real early in the morning and right before dark. It doesn't mean they're never active in the day or night rather they're most active at those times. That to say this, that during winter on a real sunny day the deer can build up additional heat by basically sun tanning. They'll stretch out and just soak up the sun. Rabbits do this on sunny winter days quite often even though they're mostly nocturnally active. It's called &quot;sunning&quot;. Google rabbits + sunning to see the critters stretched out.
<br>
<br>Believe it or not the main keys to staying in the cold are staying dry and staying out of the wind. Deer are pretty darn good at both.
<br>
<br>Edit: Thanks to the reply that pointed out the word is crepuscular, not diurnal. I've been using the wrong word for a long time. Doh!</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Larger animals have lower Surface area / volume ratio and therefore can insulate better relative to a smaller animal. This explains why animals tend to be larger as you move north in latitude. Also known as Bergmann's Law. Animals will be stockier with shorter limbs and rounder to minimize exposed surface area (Allen's Rule).<br><br>Various other survival strategies are in play such as adding solutes to allow blood to supercool (drop below freezing without solidifying as in the Arctic ground squirrel). Heartbeat can be lowered to such a degree to save energy. Some toads can freeze solid and thaw out come spring. Concurrent blood flow as mentioned. Also down is a more effective insulator than any synthetic one we have available. Insulating feather/ fur surrounded by longer more water resistant fur/feathers can effectively create and insulated air bubble around the animal. Air is a very effective insulator if you can trap it.<br><br>Don't forget migration south with birds. Also small rodents can take advantage of microclimates. For example there is usually a void beneth snowpacks that is consistently above freezing. Shelter construction in beavers/ various rodents. Burying below the frost line. <br><br>Humans don't have many physiological wintering adaptations as we mastered shelter building as a survival strategy. Shelter construction predates our species. You could always build an igloo or some kind of shelter and you'd survive just fine ;)</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I don't think anyone had directly mentioned molecular changes to the cell themselves yet.  When the temperature starts to drop,  the deers cells respond to the cold by incorporating more colesterol into the cell membrane.  This lowers the melting point and prevents freezing damage.  THere are many changes at the cellular level to various structures, but they take time.  When a person goes inside to where it's warm then outside to the cold, then back inside, there is not sufficient time to adjust.  When a deer slowly experiences falling temperatures over several months the cells have time to respond and become better suited to the cold.  The colesterol example is just one of many changes, but along with metabolic changes, fat stores, and efficient fur, it is easier to see how many animals survive in the winters.   <br><br><br>Sorry for typos or poop format,  responding from my phone</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Many organisms go through &quot;mini hibernation&quot;  cycles throughout a day or short span of days. <br><br>This is called torpor. Torpor is essentially a shortened version of hibernation. During torpor, an organism is able to consciously slow down their metabolic rate and lower their core temperature. <br><br>With this ability, organisms can go days or weeks without needing to eat. It allows for organisms to survive a food shortage, as well as colder temperatures. Mammals like Mice and squirrels do this, as well as many marsupials. Small birds are notorious for this. <br><br>There is also a function for opposite weather. Some animals go into a state of torpor called aestivation. This happens to animals like marsupials in the middle of the Australian summer.<br><br>Torpor is used to describe hibernation in smaller bouts. Animals hibernating are like ones in torpor, but because it lasts so long, large fat stores are required to maintain atp. <br><br>We humans do not have the ability to consciously slow down our metabolic rate or lower our core temperature.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The short answer that seems to be missing in this thread is: Deer and all animals that have fur have a winter coat. As the temperature drops they grow more fur. A fine undercoat and and thicker, longer hair. Google &quot;cows freezing to death in  blizzard before their winter coats had a chance to grow in&quot;. Even your dog will have a winter coat. Ever notice how they shed in the spring. Also you would be amazed at just how fur deer have in the winter. If you see them in the spring when they are shedding, the amount of fur is astounding. Also the part about deer putting on fat for winter is a little off base. Deer eat grass. You have to eat huge amounts of cellulose to be able to make fat. (a bit of oversimplification, but basically correct.)</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>For deer, it's actually because their fur is hollow. If you take a piece of their fur and bend it, it kinks, unlike human hair where it simply bends. I know that is true for deer, but I believe other animals just have adapted to the climate in countless ways.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Fur is only 1 type of insulator at an animals disposal and it's main purpose is to keep the animal dry.
