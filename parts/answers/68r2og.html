		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was already realized by Torricelli in 1644. He estimated the atmosphere to be about 50 miles high, from the measurement of twilight. First measurements of the atmospheric pressure on mountains were performed by Blaise Pascal.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is fairly easy to extrapolate the lack of air in space by the rapidly decreasing amount of air available to breathe and feed into your engine the higher that you fly an airplane.</p>
<p>Even people climbing the highest mountains can become seriously ill due to simple lack of sufficient air to breathe at that altitude.</p>
<p>In fact, that is in many ways what defines space: a lack of sufficient air to fly an airplane thorough. Orbital mechanics are efficient motions unlocked by going high enough to avoid the friction of pushing the air out of the way in order to move.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if we hadn't figured out that space was airless way before we were actually shooting things into space, remember that we didn't start with putting people in rockets and shooting those rockets into space. Before that exciting moment, we were sending animals into space, and before than, we were sending craft with nothing but sensors that could tell us what it was like up there. Generally, major achievements don't happen all at once, they are built up to step by step.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How did humanity physically discover that space has no breathable atmosphere?</p>
<p>By the time we had high altitude balloon tests and jumps in the 1950's, we were aware of the vacuum of space to an extent and were testing experimental space suit technology with the US Air Force. They were concerned for the safety of pilots who had to eject at more and more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird" target="_blank">extreme heights</a> as aviation technology progressed. </p>
<p>They were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-altitude_military_parachuting" target="_blank">HALO jumps</a> of a sort, and we discovered never-before-recorded effects of high altitude, low atmosphere environments. Temperature, radiation, chemical composition, thickness, none of this was available to scientific bodies prior. </p>
<p>It was called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Excelsior" target="_blank">Project Excelsior</a>&quot; and, had NASA bore their advice to heart concerning 100% oxygen environments, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_1" target="_blank">Apollo I</a> disaster would not have occurred. They may not have 100% escaped the atmosphere, but their findings paved the way for the technology that made the Saturn V series possible.</p>
<p>How did we know about the vacuum of space before that? As primitive as it sounds, dogs and primates were launched into space via rocket to verify conditions before the human attempts that followed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laika" target="_blank">Laika the dog</a>, for example. On-board sensors (SUPER  basic computers by today's standards) recorded vital signs and conditions within and exterior to capsules after launch.</p>
<p>And finally, before that we could postulate and hypothesize about what space is made of, but had no practical way to verify it outside of mathematics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
