		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> ... except the galactic orbit takes about 250 million years, so the last time the earth was on the other side of the galaxy was when the dinosaurs were doing whatever it is they do. I wouldn't count on humans surviving that long. </p>
<p>But if you want a different sky, you don't have to wait that long! There are different nebulae and stuff popping up all the time - supernova are bright and leave remnants in the sky that have been observed and recorded for centuries by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SN_1054#Historical_records" target="_blank">Chinese astronomers</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_Supernova" target="_blank">Europeans</a>, and possibly even <a href="http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/archeo/outside/chaco/nebula.html" target="_blank">Native Americans!</a></p>
<p>On timescales a little bit longer than human lifetimes, the constellations shift! The stars in the visible constellations are all at different distances, have different brightnesses, <a href="http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit1/Images/uma_50K.gif" target="_blank">and are moving relative to the earth and each other,</a> changing constellations over thousands of years! For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txJH8RlIoXQ" target="_blank">Ursa major, the big dipper, might someday be renamed Ursa saber, the big ass knife!</a></p>
</li>

<p><a href="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Leo_2.gif" target="_blank">Leo, the lion, used to look like Leo, the sorta fucked up lion!</a></p>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Orion_2.gif" target="_blank">Orion, the hunter, when viewed over thousands of years, becomes Orion, the disco dancer!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>My favorite fact though, is that Polaris wasn't always the north star! Due to the motion of stars and the precession of earth's axis, the star Thuban (alpha Draconis in the constellation Draco) was the closest to the pole around the time the pyramids were built. <a href="http://www.soulsofdistortion.nl/images/Star%20alignment%20Great%20Pyramid.gif" target="_blank">The northern shaft in the Great Pyramid may therefore point toward Thuban's position in the sky at the time the pyramid was built,</a> allowing astronomers to calculate the age of the pyramids with <a href="http://jha.sagepub.com/content/32/26/S1.extract" target="_blank">significant precision!</a> If confirmed, this bit of astronomy can inform modern archaeology and Egyptology! Of course, there's an obvious way to challenge this interpretation - over thousands of years, pretty much any line of site will have a star on it. Maybe Thuban is a coincidence? </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have some questions on this.</p>
<p>If the whole galaxy rotated at the same speed, we wouldn't see any difference, so the stars have to be going at different speeds (im aware this difference is not as significant a you would expect because of dark matter)... correct?</p>
<p>As I understand it, the actual orbit around the galaxy is one thing, but the arms spin faster? I guess they are traveling density waves... is this correct?</p>
<p>If so, how does the density wave work?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If I understand your question - that we are going to move to a new point in our galaxy and will therefore have a new vantage point to view stuff in our galaxy, then No (largely).</p>
<p>The is because the rest of the galaxy is revolving too.  With the same angular velocity as us (more or less).  So we're always going to be in the same local neighborhood because that local neighborhood is moving right along with us.  </p>
<p>Imagine the galaxy as a record (or a DVD I suppose.  Whippersnappers...).  Draw a couple of stars on its surface.  Spin the disk.  Everything stays in the same spot relative to one another.</p>
<p>Galaxies revolve more-or-less like a disk, not like a planetary system (where the stuff near the center, like Mercury, is whipping around Sol several orders a magnitude more times than something out at the further reaches, like Neptune).  We're not sure why exactly as standard newtonian physics says it shouldn't.  So we call the reason Dark Matter or Dark Energy.</p>
<p>Whatever is opposite of us on the other side of the (currently) impenetrable galactic core will always be on the other side.</p>
<p>If you just mean things will change over time, then Yes.  The galaxy doesn't revolve like a perfect disk and different elements have slightly different angular velocities.  So yes, there are gradual changes over time.  But it's not like we're going to revolve right out of the [Alpha Quadrant]

<p>Edit:  Thank you for the edumakaction.  Seems the popsci description of &quot;galaxies spin like disks&quot; isn't entirely accurate.  Big surprise =P</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
