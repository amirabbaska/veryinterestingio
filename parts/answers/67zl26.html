		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Coolness often rests in detachment - a character isn't affected by their surroundings or showing much emotion. Smoking allows a character an opportunity to exhibit this detachment in a way many activities can't. Eating is noisy, both in visuals and sound. Walking generally puts the focus on the surroundings, rather than the character, and involves a lot of movement. Smoking is much more reserved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoking is very &quot;analog&quot;. You have fire, smoke, caustic smells, so it suggests the character in question is sort of unpretentious, down to earth. It also has a long history with society, so regardless of its actual nature, it does have a pedigree of sorts. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Smoking is hazardous to your health, but a character who smokes clearly doesn't care for such sensibilities. This is related to coolness-as-detachment - it's a mild, relatively clean way of showing that the character does not feel obligated to respect a common societal norm.</p>
</li>
<li>Smoking lets the audience connect with the character during otherwise uncrowded scenes. If a character is smoking, the viewer doesn't need to constantly wonder where the scene is going or what they are supposed to be paying attention to. In such scenes, the cigarette means the character is relaxing, clearing their mind in solitude. Without the cigarette, the mental state of the character is less clear.</li>
</ul>
<p>As an aside, I am sometimes  jealous of smokers from time to time, because if a smoker goes outside and just feels the night air for a bit, takes a few minutes to themselves, then no one questions them. If I do the same, then people are looking out the window, asking you what you're doing out there, why are you outside, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple reasons in my mind as someone who is starting now to work on feature films. </p>
<p>Firstly, cigarettes are relatable and have been around forever. So even if we may know they are bad we can still see them as something that the &quot;bad guy&quot; has been doing in movies forever! And a lot of times the good guy too. Cigarettes are more widely known and relatable than vaping, though some movies are now using that too. Relatabilitty to a character is key whether they are good or bad. And this plays into the next part...</p>
<p>Smoking allows insight into a character and can often be a flaw despite it looking &quot;cool&quot;. For example of a bad guy, let's imagine Grimsrud from &quot;Fargo&quot;. He is a bad dude and his demeanor, his silence and his smoking clues is in on this almost immediately. As a matter of fact I believe Steve buscemis character even mentions the smoking and asks to roll up a window. So smoking is a negative, silence is a negative, and being a silent smoker who is a behmouth of a person is a negative. Right away we know he is out villain. Now imagine a good guy who smokes like McClane in &quot;Die Hard&quot;. This guy is our hero and a total badass. Now, the smoking does lend itself to the feeling of a badass but also resonates with the audience as a character flaw. Here's this dude going through a rough patch and he's a smoker who becomes a hero. The smoking deepens our understanding of who he is without us being told. </p>
<p>Another reason it may be this way is to show antime period. &quot;Mad Men&quot; is the easy example here. People smoked everywhere back then! The show even deals with the early fallout for advertisers as research on cigarettes and health developed. And the characters think it's bullshit. This really helps sell us this time period and provides some irony. Here are advertisers working for lucky strike who think the cigarette health risks are bullshit. But we are in 2017 and we know better than them which gives us a bit more emotional investment. </p>
<p>Lastly, smoking just looks good on camera. Whispy smoke=cinema good. Flammable things=gold. Hazy rooms that create nice pillars of light=wet dreams for directors and cinematographers. It just lends itself to looking great on camera and because it looks great on camera we think it looks cool.</p>
<p>The last reality is that today smoking is bad and we know this. And things that are taboo or are wrong always look cool! Do any of us want to go blow up a hospital? No, but god did the joker look badass doing it! Do any of us want to rob a bank? No, but every time we watch a movie about it it sure looks fun! Taboo activities are fun and exciting to see because it allows us as normal folks to get a tiny little taste of what it might be like to be the &quot;bad guy&quot;. </p>
<p>I predict in another few decades (if vaping isn't halted by the FDA) that we will see a lot of movies start to use vaping in films. But the cigarettes won't vanish. Both will be in play. I myself have written a feature script (unproduced as of yet) that takes place 70+ years in the future where the American legal system had been revamped into a type of very strict law enforcement that dishes out eye for an eye punishment. My main character in the film vapes. Why? Because it is a flaw since he is not all good but also because in this world cigarettes have been outlawed and only vaping remains allowed as a safer alternative. So all at once it serves to demonstrate a character flaw, the world my characters live in, and provides us the same type of cinematography and aesthetic appearance that cigarettes would have. And likewise, one side character still sneaks real cigarettes from a stash he's amassed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of it is to highlight a character's rebelliousness and all that this represents. However, I believe that it is the cinematography of smoking which is what keeps it alive in movies. It's because burning things and smoke do cool visual things, more than &quot;this character is inhaling tobacco&quot;. Which is why you never see vaping. It also allows for nonverbal dialogue enhancers.</p>
<p>Smoking can affect the lighting in different ways. A lighter close to the face lights up a face in the dark. So can a slow drag on a cigarette. The smoke can obscure things and dance around in the light. </p>
<p>The actor has a prop that can say things that dialogue can't. Especially in close ups. Blowing smoke in someone's face shows contempt. Fidgeting with a cig can show stress or anxiety. A slow pull with a raised eyebrow shows contemplation. No character <em>needs</em> to smoke, disrupting dialogue to have a character take a smoke break won't happen for realism. Smoking just allows visual shorthand to a lot of cliches that smokers and nonsmokers understand without dialogue easier than other nonverbal cues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It provides a foil for dramatic acting. Taking drags and handling cigarettes gives actors another avenue of nonverbal expression in their scenes, and the pauses allow for a slower delivery with more gravitas without seeming unrealistic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It makes them look rebellious or unconcerned with themselves or what others think. That characteristic can have a certain type of attractiveness to some people.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
