		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine if we had a separate privatized road network where you need to pay to drive on it (sort of like a tollway but more of a global subscription).</p>
<p>You might think it's suspicious when I suggest it now, but let's say it passes popular opinion because it's <em>newly built</em> road that otherwise wouldn't have been built (therefore not affecting the &quot;normal&quot; road network.</p>
<p>You might think this is a good plan. It can help ease the congestion of the normal roads since there are now alternatives available for those who can afford it.</p>
<p>But in time, you start noticing things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed limits are being lowered on normal roads much more excessively than on paid roads. This could be done to urge/pester people into paying for the subscription.</li>
<li>Newly invented safety measures are implemented on the paid road system first, and will not be fully implemented (if at all) on the normal road network because the budget doesn't allow for it.</li>
<li>Car manufacturers start improving their cars in ways that adhere to paid road standards and become less applicable on the normal road. E.g. would you pay more for a car which has bluetooth connectivity to switch road lights on (paid roads feature) if you do not have a road subscription and there is no bluetooth system on norma roads? No? So that means that a notable subset of new cars that are released are irrelevant for you (or at least unjustifiably expensive). Unless you buy a subscription...</li>
<li>The company you want to find a job at needs someone who starts early, and quickly loses interest in those who do not have the paid road subscription. It's never said explicitly, but it's painfully obvious in the interviewer's posture and interest in the interview.</li>
<li>There is a new company that builds a road that is much safer to drive at high speeds and cheaper to build. However, because this new company is not yet a big player, they might never get picked up because the old road company only just reaches the government's minimum standards for road safety (but, by definition, just over the minimum quality is allowed)</li>
<li>The police is seemingly more helpful to catch reckless drivers on the paid roads. Speed camera's, however, are vastly more frequent on the unpaid roads. Again, this is never explicitly stated as a rule, but rather implied through the results of police actions.</li>
<li>During a particularly brutal election year, the current Rep/Dem government adjust the roads. Lanes are closed, speed limits are lowered, and it will take you hours to get to your destination. &quot;Coincidentally&quot;, the roads that are affected are the roads that lead towards the Dem/Rep conventions (the opposite party).</li>
<li>(edit: added by /u/FrogLeatherShoes, elaborated by me) Car manufacturers have to pay licensing fees to the road people to make the car compliant, preventing any new car manufacturers from entering the market. BMW can pay the $10,000 licensing fee per car easily. But a new startup will not be able to, because they can't run their business when everything they sell will have to be $10,000 more expensive to cover the licensing cost <em>that nets their own company not a single benefit</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many ways in which this system can be manipulated into urging people to pay for the subscription. Doesn't matter whether it's through making the unsubscribed version more shit (or improving it less than the paid version), preventing previously unknown companies from making the next breakthrough, or causing a divide between the subscribed and unsubscribed people (economically, employment, ...).</p>
<p>And once we get to a point where practically everyone has the road subscription, then <em>no one</em> gets the benefit from having a subscription anymore (since the paid roads are just as congested because everyone can drive anywhere again) <strong>but we are all still paying for the subscription nonetheless</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<p>This problem, and many like it, can be summed up like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>We make a separate option that's better, but more expensive. The main argument for having it is exclusivity (e.g. uncongested roads) which makes things nicer for those who can afford it.</li>
<li>Big business, however, is in it for the money. They are constantly trying to get more people to partake in the system, because more customers means more money.</li>
<li>As the percentage of people paying the extra increases, the company's profits increase. However, the original benefit (exclusivity and separation) moves out of sight because the majority of people are now all exclusive.</li>
<li>Once big business has completed its goal and convinced everyone to pay the extra, the exclusivity is completely gone. People have paid for years for something that has slowly slipped from them, and they didn't even realize it. Worse still, they can't even opt out of paying extra now, because everyone is doing it and it is now expected of you. Not paying the extra makes you the poor outcast.</li>
<li>Suddenly, everyone is locked in a system where they are all paying more, no one is getting any benefit from it anymore, but no one wants to leave out of fear for being ostracized or simply getting the short end of the stick at a point where they need it most.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically all big corporations that sell internet connectivity also sell cable tv. They also have their own streaming services that are not as good as netflix, primevideo or hbo. And by law these corporations must treat all traffic equally. In contrast cable tv is a huge dated mess with total lack of innovation and rising costs and amount of commercials. These big players want you to use cable. They want you to think cable is what you want. By adding bandwidth caps and making online video services worse they artificially make cable look better.</p>
<p>The thing is that when the equal traffic limitation is changed it allows the big corporations to fully control the internet as a market. They can choose who gets in and who gets out. And I'm not talking about people who use the internet. I'm talking about big and small businesses that use internet.</p>
<p>This means the internet  selling corporations can double dip. Or actually tripple dip. They can ask &quot;connection money&quot; from other businesses who use the internet. Amazon, google, hbo, netflix, reddit, foxnews, nascar... If you have a website you need to pay for it to be available to people. Then they can ask you to pay twice. First for your internet connection and then to get access to some other sites.</p>
<p>You may be thinking this sounds right? Surely they should not be forced to offer that service for the other corporations for free, right? The thing is it is not free. YOU pay for it. You pay for your access to google, netflix or whatever when you pay for your monthly fees. You pay it through the taxes because these companies have been given billions of money to build and update the infrastructure. Which they have not done. But they want more.</p>
<p>So those other businesses? Google and netflix buy their own server hardware so they can be connected by people like us who buy internet connections from the big internet providers like comcast, att, timewarner, verizon and such. It is not that netflix or such are being unreasonable by just trying to force comcast to play along. Netflix have even offered to pay and install their servers in comcast's server locations but comcast will not allow it. They want netflix to give them money while accepting worse terms.</p>
<p>So what happens is that tripple dipping I mentioned earlier. What it does it stagnates the market. Because the only way to compete is to own the network and essentially own the customers. Being a newcomer like netflix is literally impossible. Not only do you need to take a gigantic financial risk to pay for the connection fees, server hardware and content creation costs but you need to compete with one hand tied behind your back. Your customers get slower speeds, worse connectivity and have to worry about datacaps. All the while the comcast's own service can utilize the full bandwitdth and users don't need to worry about datacaps. At least in the beginning. It is impossible to compete against that. </p>
<p>And it is a huge untapped goldpot for the comcasts. How much can you ask from google, microsoft, sony, facebook etc for them to be accessible through internet? They can not afford to not pay! The profits are rediculous. All the same time you as a customer can be asked to pay more.</p>
<p>And it doesn't even end there. These comcasts want to be the big players. They don't like facebook and google selling ads. They want to track you and be the ad server facebook and google can only dream of being. You can try to avoid services like google and facebook if you don't like being tracked. But when it is your internet connection that is tracking you then the only way to opt out is to not use internet at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember when Facebook came around and we all switched from Myspace? Now imagine Myspace saw this threat and was able to throw around their (at the time) considerable clout and money, and ensure that anyone accessing Facebook would do so at a significantly slower speed than Myspace. Sure would make the switch less compelling, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>In short, net neutrality <del>combats</del>  protects &quot;free trade&quot; of an open internet. We choose the service we like / are better, not the one with enough money to ensure they're fastest.</p>
<p>Imgur is en vogue, Photobucket is not. Gmail is, AOL is not. Google is, askJeeves is not. Reddit is, SomethingAwful is not. You get the idea. We evolve. Net neutrality preserves our ability for a nobody to make a website that challenges the service of a somebody.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the many implications is the possible appearance of so called 'fast lanes'. Without net neutrality, ISPs (Internet Service Providers) could start prioritizing traffic however they desire.</p>
<p>They could slow down traffic to website they do not like while providing fast traffic to their 'partners'. This would like lead to deals where website providers would have to pay the ISPs for them to provide fast access to the site. While this would not be much of an issue for large companies like Google or Facebook, it would essentially shut out new competition as they might not be able to afford what is essentially extortion money.</p>
<p>And you as a consumer would only get fast access to websites that your ISP want you to go to, essentially leading into corporate censorship.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
