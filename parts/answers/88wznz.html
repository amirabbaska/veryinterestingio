		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you look at a rainbow what you see answers your question. A rainbow also contains IR (outer side) and UV light (inner side), you just dont see it. Its the same with a prism, it kinda just fades out.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.gadgetscience.com/wp-content/uploads/prism_light_on_wall.jpg" target="_blank">See this photo</a> (note the camera may contain some uv/ir filters) best example is to look a rainbow yourself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A rainbow is a good way to judge this,  but it does depend on light intensity.  You won't see the IR or UV levels when their relative intensity is less than the blue scatter background.  If you are unlucky enough to get a near IR laser in your eye you will see a red dot, but you would not see that frequency in the rainbow. </p>
<p>On the UV end you are more limited by what is absorbed by the rest of the eye,  but a sufficiently bright source could still be seen.  </p>
<p>The actually sensitivity of the rod and cone cells has been measured.  It drops off typically like 1/(wavelength - peak)^2 as you are further from the resonance, <a href="https://light-measurement.com/spectral-sensitivity-of-eye/" target="_blank">see this for more info</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get that rainbows are a good way to see it, but let me ask this a different way: If I had something like a flashlight that was able to emit any frequency of light and smoothly transition between them, would I see a quick cutoff (like a rainbow), or a slow fade out? Would the apparent saturation change, or only the brightness? Abouy how quickly would it dissapear if let's say it takes 10 seconds to fade from red to violet?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We had a powerful laser in grad school that could tune from 800nm to 900nm.  It put out &gt; 1W ,which is quite powerful. If it was green, it would have made a very bright spot that you couldn't directly look at, if you stuck an index card in the beam.  At 800nm, though, it would make a little red dot on the card.  What 'shade of red'?  Just plain old red, is how I would describe it. Not 'dark red' or 'maroon'.  The red you see when just the red sensors in you eye are stimulated. As you would tune it to 900nm, the hue would stay the same, but the spot would just get dimmer and dimmer. Even though the beam would burn a hole through your black tee-shirt if you weren't careful when bending over the table to adjust the optics.</p>
<p>Nd:Yag lasers at 1060nm are completely invisible, though, even for 10W on a white backstop in a dark room.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

I made a pair of goggles like these once, it's amazing to look through an extremely dark blue filter and see red.</p>
