<p>If we ate bacon for the first time, we'd get blown away by the taste no matter how it was cooked or where it's from - it's unique, delicious and memorable. After eating it every day for a month, we might develop a preference for how it's cooked (less crispy etc). After eating it for a year, we might start to prefer specific cuts of bacon or bacon from specific farms etc.</p>
<p>Movie effects that are 'groundbreaking' at the time won't hold up later because we'll have seen it over and over again in other movies since and we will notice the flaws that couldn't be noticed before.</p>
<p>Also, if you watched that effect originally as a kid, you've experienced a lot more life in general and you're more likely to scrutitise what you see in any context.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this.</p>
<p>There are some old games whose graphics at the time were &quot;amazingly realistic&quot; are now so &quot;bad and old&quot; that they are painful to look at.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some other games from the same time period are just fine to watch.</p>
<p>An example is Goldeneye 64 vs Super Mario 64, both great games from around the same time. Goldeneye is still generally fine, but the looks of the characters is pretty painful. Super Mario 64, you wouldn't even really notice much of an issue.</p>
<p>This is because Goldeneye was trying to have as realistic a look as it could at the time, meanwhile Super Mario was designed to have an art style. Neither of these is a bad choice, it's just that what counts as 'realistic' is always getting better and better (meaning that what used to count as realistic looks worse and worse), meanwhile an art style is always just an art style. It is today what it was back then.</p>
<p>Sure, if you remade Super Mario 64 in the modern age, you could make it look astounding and put the old version to shame...but since nobody really does that (HD release exceptions notwithstanding), the ongoing advancement of graphics quality is not as stark for them.</p>
<p>Movies are much the same with their effects. In this case, things can be drawn to 'the little details'. As our technology gets better, the special effects EITHER get cleaner (less random tiny details) or they get more complex (specifically chosen tiny details) but that complexity is designed to help focus you on the correct part of the screen. In either case, this draws attention to the tiny details of older effects that detract from that cleanliness or perfect chaos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What other people said about seeing it when you're young and not having better effects to compare them to both explain a lot.</p>
<p>But also, directors are not dumb. They know when some effects work and when they don't and can distract you from a bad effect when you watch it for the first time, especially when you're caught up in the story and characters. When you watch it again you already know what's going to happen and your eyes might tend to wander from the main action, and you start to notice things.</p>
<p>Look at this scene from Citizen Kane, which is like 70 years old. Watch is then read the rest of my comment:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/uNaDrnxp3L0?t=2m30s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/uNaDrnxp3L0?t=2m30s</a></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>My understanding was that this scene was not shot in a giant arena, and indeed on closer inspection it looks like the background seating is a painting or something, and the perspective of the stage curtains looks a little wrong. But if you saw this in a theater it would just work, because your attention is on the guy in the foreground and the people moving around onstage are just convincing enough to make you believe you're actually looking at a stage in a big arena.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Audience expectations.</p>
<p>Bear in mind, though, that movies are really intended to be seen once: the idea of having your own personal copy and watching it several times is relatively new, and not what movies were designed for. You wouldn't necessarily notice the imperfections, especially if you were distracted by the novelty of the effect.</p>
<p>If you were alive 100 years ago and watching a silent comedy in which bizarre things happen, you'd be too surprised by the bizarre things to notice much else. A man suddenly explodes, leaving nothing but a pile of clothes: you're too busy thinking, &quot;Wait -- what just happened?&quot; to notice the jump cut. But for us these days, that's pretty mundane: if you're used to watching all the various <em>Star Trek</em> series, movies and spin-offs, the idea of people suddenly disappearing is quite normal. Watch that old black-and-white movie now, and the effect is so unsurprising that you're more likely to notice the flaws.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some movie vfx look dated because of the way they were converted to consumer viewing formats.</p>
<p>The fx of movies filmed on 35mm film or even high resolution digital would still look amazing and real - if you watched them at the movie theater.</p>
<p>But when converting to consumer HD (up to 1080) digital media - the &quot;fake&quot; parts respond differently to the encoding process - producing a ghosting artifact around the cgi parts - making for a slightly different result between the &quot;real&quot; shot and the added fx. Enough to make the effects noticeably stand out of their surroundings.</p>
<p>The newer 4k digital format changes this - i've only seen a few movies in both 4k and older formats - but it looks like the problem is much reduced or even goes away entirely.</p>
<p>There are other reasons of course - but this in my experience is the major one. If you could find a 4k version of the 10 years old movie you were watching - most likely the vfx would look much closer to the theater experience (i.e. - realistic).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
