		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, bombs are powerful compared to what? I would argue that, at the end of the day the types of bombs used by most suicide bombers (there are notable examples) are not all that big.</p>
<p>If you look on places like Liveleak of video of suicide bombs strapped to people there are generally only a handful of casualties inside the same room as the bomber and the building is usually left standing. Compare this to a &quot;bomb&quot; in a car that can take out the Oklahoma city building and we are talking about really small charges.</p>
<p>So, one of the answers is that in cases where the bomb is small enough for this to work, people survive to talk about it. When the bomb is big enough that this doesn't work, then everyone dies and you don't know anyone tried to jump on the bomber in the first place.</p>
<p>We will only ever hear about this working cause the other dude got blown up. Plenty of suicide bombs would kill one or several people who jumped on top of them.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other reasons that bodies make good shields to blast injuries; we are almost all water, which makes an incredible shock dampener and can use a huge amount of heat energy turning into steam. The fact the you are presenting such a large surface area will &quot;direct&quot; the blast the other way, deflecting some of the compression wave (one of the several mechanisms of injury from blast injury.) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Explosives meant for use on humans kill in 2 main ways- the blast wave, which typically kills only within a very short range, and shrapnel, which maims out to a much larger distance.</p>
<p>In numbers: it takes about 45 psi of pressure in the blast wave to kill a person. For 1kg of TNT, the pressure wave at 1m is 100 psi, but rapidly peters out at 5m to 3 psi.</p>
<p>So by hugging a suicide bomber and immobilizing them, you both cushion the blast wave and hold them in place, letting others get to a safe distance. Even 1 meter makes a huge difference.</p>
<p>Shrapnel maims out to a much larger distance because it is essentially jagged metal bits flying through the air, and they lose energy by air resistance and when hitting something.</p>
<p>By hugging a suicide bomber, your body absorbs most of the shrapnel in a particular direction, protecting anyone behind it.</p>
<p>All this still depends on the relative power of the bomb. There are man-portable nuclear devices out there, and no amount of human sacrifice will stop a 10-20 ton TNT equivalent detonation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bombs that suicide bombers use can have shrapnel (like nails), to maximize the casualties - it's not just the shockwaves, it's the high speed bits of metal that gets you.</p>
<p>If one person gets in close, they absorb that shrapnel that would otherwise have gone out in an ever-increasing radius of destruction. They get super-dead, but the benefit is the lives of others.</p>
<p>If you look through Medal of Honor winners, you'll find soldiers that have thrown themselves on grenades, sacrificing themselves for the good of others. Same basic idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the type of bomb.  Improvised backpack bombs that's weigh up to 50 lbs don't have as much destructive yield as military grade bombs that's weigh 500lbs or more.  So one person taking the full brunt of an improvised bomb can absolutely absorb all the energy released and protect everyone else in the areas.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
