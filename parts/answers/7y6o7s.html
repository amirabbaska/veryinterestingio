		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Copied and pasted from a 2 year old Reddit post:</p>
<p>Here is what I got from this article</p>
<p>Breathing is very important. It is so important that your body is very sensitive to anything that may prevent you from breathing - and an easy way to prevent breathing is to choke.</p>
<p>When your throat thinks you are choking, it will cause your body to cough in order to try and push out whatever is blocking your breathing. When you cough, the air pressure from your coughing pushes up into where your tears come from. Normally, your tears drain down out of your eye socket and into your nose area, hence  you are not always crying. When you cough, it pushes the tears back up those tubes and out your eyes like crying.</p>
<p>At the same time, your throat tries to make itself more slippery, so whatever is stuck there can more easily be pushed out by the coughing reflex. The same system that makes your throat/mouth more watery also triggers your tear ducts to produce more tears.</p>
<p>TLDR Your body tried to make your mouth more wet to slip out what you are choking on. This also makes your tear ducts produce more tears. At the same time, the extra tears that would normally drain out of your eyes get pushed back up from the pressure of coughing and thus come out your eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if it has to do with crying being part of our surrender reflex.  Most humans instinctually want to stop hurting someone who is crying.  It would be a useful survival mechanism for your eyes to water reflexively if someone is squeezing your throat, even if mentally you don't feel like crying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
