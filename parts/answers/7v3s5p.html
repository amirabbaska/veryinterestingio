		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, yes. Your sweat receptors do not actually take into consideration the presence of liquids already on the skin.</p>
<p>Extended answer; </p>
<p>Sweating is mediated by head heat receptors (located in the hypothalamus) and skin-based peripheral heat receptors (located in, well, the skin). </p>
<p>The skin and head heat receptors together set the <em>set point</em> for thermoregulation in the hypothalamus. Core temperature is constantly compared to this set point via central heat receptors. If core temperature rises above it, no matter the source, those C-fibres will increase their firing rate and sweating will begin.^1</p>
<p>Now, sweating is a pretty simple cooling tool; the basic idea is to increase cooling by having water evaporate off of your skin efficiently (1 gram of water evaporation requires 2400kJ of energy!).</p>
<p>Once your heat-sensitive fibres begin to detect a heat increase, they will increase their firing rate. This will cause a sympathetic signal ending in acetylcholine release- which will stimulate eccrine glands all over the skin to begin sweating.</p>
<p>So you'll begin to sweat- and probably quite quickly, as animal tissue tends to conduct heat a lot more easily than water. The same physiological function is at work as would be if you were walking in a desert or a sauna or a bread oven (shout out to my boy Charles Blagden).</p>
<p>So, water on the skin or not, your sweat pores wouldn't stop excreting sweat- and if it's not having the desired cooling effect, assuming no medical interventions, they're not going to stop until a) you dehydrate or b) the water/your body cool down enough that sweating is no longer necessary.</p>
<p>It's the opposite of shivering, in a way. Both are body-temperature dependent thermoregulatory mechanisms. Just as you'd shiver if you sat down in an icy cold bath, you sweat if you're submerged in a hot one.</p>
<p>Another decent comparison is spending time in a sauna. The highly humid environment results in useless sweating- your skin gets wet, but it doesn't evaporate and you don't actually lose that much heat. That doesn't stop your body from producing sweat, however, it's why saunas (and hot tubs) can dehydrate you (or cook you, if they're warm enough; see the 2010 sauna championship death) if you spend too long in them.</p>
