		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two methods of learning words. The meaning-based method is used by childeren learning any language and adults learning new words in a language that they have a reasonable grasp of. New words are linked to the idea or object they represent. You think of that idea or object and the word will pop up in your mind. Adults learning words in a new language that they don't have a good grasp of yet will tend to use the word-based method. They will think of the idea or object, the word from their own language will come to mind and then they will try to remember the corresponding word in the other language. Normally once an adult has a sufficent grasp of the language they will automatically switch to the meaning based method. While speaking the other language they will no longer translate to their own language first. Only when they come up empty in the new language when thinking of an idea or object will the word from their own language pop up. </p>
<p>So to answer your question: initially they are stored differently, but with enough practice in the new language they are stored simmilarly. The only difference will be that a fluent multilingual person can have multiple words from the different languages connected to the same idea or object whereas a monoligual person will only have one word connected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm just starting to get into the science of bilingualism, but it seems to me that the vast majority of these answers are very wrong - some are quoting specific places where L1 is stored versus L2, which is misleading at best and flat-out wrong at worst, since language processing is distributed throughout the brain (with some specialized areas like Broca's and Wernicke's areas). From what I understand, there are some differences between adult L2 (and L3, etc.) acquisition and early childhood L1/L2 acquisition. Learning an L2 in adulthood is definitely harder, but the really difficult parts that are more affected by age of acquisition and are most 'different' neurally tend to be syntax and phonetics (not lexical/word knowledge, like OP is asking about). </p>
<p>In fact, most evidence seems to indicate that lexical items are generally stored in the similar way - it's generally believed that when retrieving a word, all languages are always 'on' and multilingual speakers have to select which language to use, which indicates that they are all stored in similar ways (since they all use the same pathway for access).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
