		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastics Engineer here- work regularly in the injection molding industry, as well as resin selection and evaluation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are basically 3 types of commercial plastic types out there. Thermoplastics, Thermosets, and Elastomers.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Like the post below somewhat worded. Thermoplastics can soften and be remolded when given enough thermal energy. The molecular bonds in the polymer allow them to become free flowing once again, and develop a new orientation during molding . Orientation is key in a plastic part retaining its shape under stress, as well as maintaining its physical properties.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Thermosets are your materials like rubber. They are heated to mold, but once they are &quot;cured&quot;, they cannot be re-heated to be processed. Its not just rubber that's thermoset, Melamine resin, polyurethane resin, and Polyester resin are thermoset as well. So in terms of recycling a thermoset cannot be recycled along with a thermoplastic. Their chemical and physical makeup are just not miscible.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Elastomers are defined as any material that can stretch up to 200% and rebound without losing its original shape. After stretching past that limit, it goes past its tensile yield point and you then have permanent damage to the molecular chains, as they are unable to pull back in to each other to retain its original orientation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Back to the original question. Not all thermoplastics are the same. there are MANY types that are commercially used for regular consumer products. such as PP, HDPE, LDPE, PS, PET, and many many others. These all have different chemical structures, so they need to be properly separated before processing back into pellets. So you cant re-process LDPE (Low Density Polyethylene)  and PS (Polystyrene). So there is a lot of effort and energy that goes into not only separating these plastics, but also determining what their thermal history is, as well as reprocessing them back into pellets.</p>
<p>Now when a plastic is used, lets say its a milk jug. Depending how long that milk jug has been out in the world, it will have a different thermal history, when compared to something that was JUST molded out of virgin plastic. UV light can act as a thermal agent that can accelerate molecular degradation due to the UV light physically cooking the Carbon-Carbon bonds in a polymer. This is why a white plastic part that's left outside will slowly yellow. The bonds and structure of the plastic is VERY SLOWLY cooking, hence why it starts to darken. SO, if you process a part that has a lot of thermal degradation, it inst going to process the same as a material that hasn't seen excessive heat. So you cant just blend these together and expect the same result. The more thermal degradation there is ( along side the many other types of degradation from regular use), the worse physical properties it will have.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Honestly i could go on and on about plastics all day, but I'm going to cut it here.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Not all plastics are alike, there are many factors that go into processing them together. Its not as simple as just chucking it into a grinder and re-molding it.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recycling machinery sales person here. What I do is work with different clients to try to find the right process to recycle their particular material stream. The biggest problem is simply contamination. You can wash a piece of plastic by hand and get it nice and clean pretty quick, but it's really difficult to properly clean 3 or 4 thousand pounds of plastic an hour. This contamination can be dirt, sand, grease, other unwanted plastics, aluminum foil, etc. Every material has different needs and some are just too difficult. </p>
<p>For example, Keurig K-cups are made of 4 or 5 separate layers of plastic that serve as an oxygen barrier. The problem is that it is basically impossible to separate these layers from each other. </p>
<p>Some plastics can only be cleaned with water and cleaning agents which gets extremely expensive and difficult with all of the water management and reclaim that needs to happen. Also, you need to get rid of all that water again before you extrude the recycled plastic because moisture is the enemy of extruders (machine that heats and re-melts the plastic.)</p>
<p>Some plastics, like the black agricultural film you see on fields can be up to 50% or more dirt and moisture! This is extremely difficult not only to shred (because all of that dirt wears your machine faster than anything else besides metal) but also to wash because of just the sheer amount of dirt. Also, once you get all of that dirt out, you need to again separate the dirt from the water and then find a way to dispose of the dirt because the problem is that it contains micro pieces of plastic that makes the dirt undesirable to farmers and the like.</p>
<p>Please ask me any questions you have about plastics recycling because it is my career and my passion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Not all plastics are the same making recycling difficult. Sorting, cleaning, and reprocessing costs money. Reprocessing does not always produce the same quality material and cannot be sold for the same price - devalued after recycling. This money is not always cost competitive to buying virgin plastic. </p>
<p><strong>Types of plastic.</strong> Just a little background on the different types of plastics. The different identities of plastic (PET, LDPE, HDPE, PP, PS, PLA, etc) have different thermal, optical, and mechanical properties. They each have a different processing temperature, they degrade by different mechanisms, and they are different in flexibility/durability/rigidity/optical transparency. In terms of food storage, they also have different barrier properties to things like oxygen and water. Although the different properties allow these plastics to have different applications - plastic water bottles, detergent bottles, hosing, insulation, etc - it also means that they cannot be mixed together and reprocessed together.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Sorting plastic.</strong>  Like oil and water not mixing, two different types of plastic such as PET and LDPE/HDPE are not able to be processed together (at least not for the time being - research is hot in this area). First, sorting takes a lot of effort and it is not very efficient. It takes mechanical, optical, and human sorters to have high purity sorting ($). Even then, some impurities still sneak in through the sorting process. Once it is sorted to the respective plastic types with different degrees of purity, the sorted plastic gets sold to a buyer of recycled plastics. They then further sort it ($) and clean it ($ and difficult). </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Sorting plastic (cont.).</strong> Marketing also makes it so that plastics are dyed. These different colors are not able to be extracted out of plastic so typically, plastics without color are more valuable than those with color. The problem with putting color into plastic is twofold. 1) sorting becomes more challenging. It is hard to know what plastic type a piece of plastic is that has color. Optical sorting technology cannot differentiate what the plastic is when it is black. Black plastic is &quot;not recyclable&quot; in my area because of this. 2) Due to the challenges of extracting the color compounds in dyed plastics, (too costly, chemically challenging), it is not done or considered. Thus, if you mix a bunch of plastics with different colors together, you will get poop brown plastic on the other end. Not super desirable for many applications. Also, if you do fine a use of mixed color plastic, people will want you to maintain consistency with the color so it costs $ to make sure when you are mixing colors, you are doing it in a way that results in a consistent color/quality.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Reprocessing plastic.</strong> The most desired type of &quot;recycling&quot; is to thermally reprocess plastic for the same type of application it originally came from (a milk jug for another milk jug). Only certain plastics can be thermally reprocessed, melted and reformed into a new shape, these are called thermoplastics. Other types, called thermosets like those in rubber tires, are only recycled by chopping them up and using them as fillers in other applications (asphault, playground rubber, etc). This is called &quot;downcycling&quot;. Mixed plastics (plastic packaging like frozen food bags/cereal bags or toothbrushes with different plastic making up the bristles/handle/grip) are hard to separate. This are typically not recycled because of the cost and challenges (both mechanical and chemical) to separate them.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Reprocessing plastic (cont.).</strong> OK, so now that a plastic that you used has gone through sorting, more sorting, and cleaning, you can reprocess it if it is a thermoplastic. This is typically done by thermal processing ($). Most plastics will decompose over time and over multiple thermal treatments. Bonus, the plastic may have decomposed before getting to this step in the process. This makes it so that the plastic after recycling has inferior properties to the virgin plastic and results in &quot;downcycling&quot;, meaning it produces a plastic with inferior properties even though it is the same chemical identity as before. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p><strong>Transport.</strong> There are costs to transporting this plastic from your house to the recycling center to the reprocessing business to the business using the plastic to the store. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Overall, most plastics are designed to contain the material being sold. There is very little consideration and business incentive to consider the downstream impact of the plastic implemented. There is a significant effort to keep food fresh for longer and keep it safe. Nobody wants to open a box of cereal and have it be stale. There are also efforts for marketing purposes. Sprite bottles do not need to be green, yet green is what sells and what we as consumers see as being a signature of Sprite. Recycling plastics costs a lot of money and due to the different plastics that are out there. rightfully so since they have such vastly different properties. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Sorting costs money, cleaning costs money, reprocessing costs money. When you consider all of that and then think about the cost for a company to buy a virgin plastic which typically trends with oil prices (low oil prices = lower cost for plastics derived from oil) OR buy a recycled plastic, it can be cheaper to buy a virgin plastic. In addition to that, the quality of a recycled plastic is different that a virgin plastic. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>There are more new plastics being made all the time. They do great things in terms of making you car more lightweight, durable, and safe. However, this plastic will be in use for a long time! This means that this plastic needs to be more durable. This is a different design principle than a single-use plastic cup. We want to use a plastic cup once and then be done with it. This has spurred new plastics that are compostable/degradable. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several kinds of plastic. Thermoplast, Duroplast and Elastomere.
Thermoplasts get liquid at certain temperatures, so you can melt down plastic parts and cast new parts out of it. Duroplasts degrade at certain temperatures, so if you heat them up they don't melt but they decay into new stuff like co2 and unusable particles. So it's much harder to recycle duroplasts. And the purity of your shards has to be very high to maintain the properties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always like to use the example of a pop bottle when I explain it to people that don't know anything about plastic.  The cap, label, and bottle are all different types of plastic.  The cap and label are both PP, but the cap has a melt flow rate of 20-30 (think viscosity when melted) and usually contains little to no filler, where the label is about a 2-5 melt flow and if already printed on can contain anywhere from 20-50% filler (not plastic).  The price of the two plastics separately can be a spread of 25 cents per pound or more.  The unfilled cap being much more valuable.  Mixed together it can still be used in some applications depending on the ratios but is much less valuable.  Then there is the bottle itself which is PET.  If you are trying to extrude PP, any PET is considered a contaminant, since the melt point of PP is much lower than PET.  The PET will just clog up the filters in a minute.  If you raise the temperature to try and melt the PET you risk burning the PP and completely ruining it and giving it a burnt smell.  In short, there are a lot of different processes to separate different plastics, none of which are perfect.  The struggle really is in the amount of time and money it takes to separate them once they are mixed together.  There is a reason a lot of plastic waste is shipped over seas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
