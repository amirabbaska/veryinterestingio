		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurobiologist here. It's early, I'm hungover, but allow me to try and explain this the best I can. As others on this thread have commented there are various ways your body keeps track of time, the most notable are circadian rhythms. But this is somewhat wrong, you see it's not circadian rhythms that <em>produce</em> our sense of time, but rather are a <em>product</em> of various biochemical events in the brain (notably the superchiasmatic nuclei) which give rise to frames of reference that we perceive as time.</p>
<p>How this works in its entirety is still somewhat a mystery. My old phd mentor was actually looking at how subregions of the frontal lobe may use various methods to check and compare events that have recently occurred to give a reference frame for length of duration between events. Others have pointed to a series of chemicals in the brain for giving that 'value' for duration of time elapsed, one of which is adenosine, the others are the circadian chemicals 'Clock' and 'BMal' (plus one more I can't remember for the life of me). These chemicals and their density in certain receptor sites encode values for duration awake and roughly can translate into time elapsed since your last 'Brain event' which signals a 'checkpoint' like sleep or other cycles. </p>
<p>Let's start with adenosine. You may not know it but this little bugger is something we all hate and try to inhibit on a daily basis. When adenosine triphosphate (atp) breaks down over the day from atp to adp to amp it finally rests with just a single adenosine molecule. These adenosine packets then float around the brain till they fine their receptor site and bind there, with enough binding you start to feel groggy and sleepy. It's also the receptor site that caffeine binds to and prevents said tiredness. While this isn't translated directly into 'time perception' as we know it, it is one more daily cycle that allows your brain to make reference points and determine how much time has gone by in your single wake cycle, and as such the amount of free floating adenosine may allow for the brain to reference around what time events have occurred.</p>
<p>Now for the slightly confusing parts with our circadian rhythm making friends BMal and clock. These chemicals have little known use beyond producing a slow, continuous wave of increase and decrease in each other. We think this rise and fall of the two chemicals produce circadian rhythms; they achieve this in a pretty cool manner, clock and BMal both affect each others production amount. As one increases in concentration, the other decreases, doesn't sound complex right? Wrong! As the decrease occurs it inhibits production, which then inhibits the inhibiting factor of the other, which in turn increases the amount, which in turn inhibits itself. Bah, go look up the fine points, my head is throbbing too hard to think about this too hard. But the underlying point is that the two regulate each other, when one gets to be too concentrated, it produces the other, which decreases the first, then the second becomes too concentrated and the cycle continues with each regulating the other. The byproduct of this ebon flow of ups and downs is a predictable, constant wave. With the wave having roughly the same amplitude and frequency each time, it allows your brain to use other reference points from your long term or short term memory, encode them to a point in the 'wave' and then reference the cycles to determine how much time has passed. (This is my most sloppy part of my post, bear with me I'll edit more points in after I wake up more.) </p>
<p>Something you may have noticed is that I have constantly said 'reference' that's because the brain needs cues to operate. You need light and other factors to tell the brain 'it's this time in the day'. Or else we would be bound to one internal clock and jet lag would suck so much harder. (I just realized I left out a part on melatonin, while it helps set cycles I don't think it has that much to do with time perception) because we need cues our brains, and that of other animals, have developed strategies. For instance some species of lizards have a very very thin skull right above their pineal gland; they use this to tell if it's light outside and to deliver light directly to the brain! Yes, you heard me, lizards have photosensitive brains...that act like... Well, a third eye (cue spooky music). We, on the other hand, are not as cool. We use our eyes and optic nerve to deliver light to the brain and let it know &quot;dear brain, it's X brightness outside, leading me to believe it's X time of day&quot;. But even then it's all to do with frame of reference.</p>
<p>To conclude, your brain constantly communicates with a plethora of biochemical and physical indicators of duration/frame of reference. The amalgamation of all these things I mentioned (and many more I did not) lead your body to have a sense of time, or at lease how many 'cycles' have occurred since last frame of reference. The body clock isn't perfect, it can make time feel very slow (like being hungover listening to the garbage truck crash around outside your house, ugh) or very fast (like explaining your scientific passion to someone who cares to ask), but at the end of the day it's really a hard question to answer. How do we perceive time? The best I can do is explain what I know, what others have observed and what the community thinks. For all we know it's could be all wrong... I guess time will tell ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Circadian clocks are built into the majority of cells in the body, and are synchronized in large part by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain (which is in turn entrained by light from photosensitive cells in the eyes) and circulating melatonin (which is produced in the pineal gland when it's dark out). Circadian rhythms are thus largely regulated by the 24-hour light/dark cycle (though other cues, such as typical meal times, also play a role).</p>
<p>Without photoentrainment, circadian rhythms run longer than 24 hours, though this varies across individuals (usually around 25 hours). For example, folks who are totally blind (i.e., no light is processed by photosensitive cells in the eyes to the brain) often have trouble sleeping because their internal clocks run out of sync with the rest of the world. It has been suggested that daily administration of melatonin (at the same time each day) assists in entraining the clock in these individuals and relieving sleep issues. See: Sack, R. L., et al. (2000). Entrainment of free-running circadian rhythms by melatonin in blind people. New England Journal of Medicine, 343, 1070-1077.</p>
<p>As for &quot;how does it matter how fast the body is moving&quot;, that's more a physics question than a biological one. A physicist will do a much better job than I could, but suffice to say that physical time (such as it exists) is relative to your perspective. As far as your body is concerned, I expect that travelling near light speed would be processed in the same way as travelling at any other speed, and the only difference would be that time would have been moving more slowly for others relative to you. As far as you are concerned, x time has passed (because it has relative to you); and as far as others are concerned, y time has passed (because it has relative to them). </p>
<p>Keep in mind that relativistic speeds at the macro level are not something that cell biology normally needs to account for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will try to adress the last part of your question, about near light speed travel. Let's say you are travelling at a constant speed very close to the speed of light. As you are traveling very quickly compared to the people left on earth, you and everything on your spaceship will experience time dilation. Time will pass more slowly on your spaceship than on earth, you will age slower. </p>
<p>Now let us imagine you wanted to measure that effect from inside your ship. What kind of test could you perform? You could try keeping track of &quot;earth time&quot; by bringing a piece of radioactive rock and measuring its decay. But all the atoms in this rock would experience time dilation at exactly the same rate as you. If you brought an earth pocket watch it too would slow down by exactly the same factor. Even the neurons firing in your brain would fire more slowly and hence even your thinking would be slowed down by the same amount as the watch and the rock. No matter how you tried finding something to measure time dilation from inside your spaceship you would run into this same problem. In fact, given that you are traveling at a constant velocity, there is NO experiment whatsoever you could perform that would behave any differently than if you were sitting still on earth's surface in your spaceship doing the same experiment. (Let's assume there is some way of replicating earth gravity in your ship)</p>
<p>So since it is physically impossible for any kind of test to separate the two cases this means there is litterally no way you could experience  six months passing on your spaceship any differently than you would have on earth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
