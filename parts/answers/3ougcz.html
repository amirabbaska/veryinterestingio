		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is going to be too late, but...</p>
<p>Check out &quot;<a href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x20su5f_the-power-of-nightmares-1-the-rise-of-the-politics-of-fear-bbc-2004_news" target="_blank">The Power of Nightmares</a>.&quot; </p>
<p>Essentially, the Islamic World used to be moderate. A generation or two ago, it was controlled, run, and filled with moderate Muslims, particularly places such as Egypt, Turkey, and Morocco--the places Europeans were most likely to visit. </p>
<p>Since it became an oil empire, Saudi Arabia has used its wealth to fund and export a particularly brutal brand of Islam, Wahhabism. Likewise, during that time the Islamic world was also controlled by autocrats that were propped up by the West. In part, these autocrats strictly controlled Islam, either using it to form the basis of their power (Saudi Arabia) or enforcing a secular government because they saw Islam as a threat.</p>
<p>Average Muslims saw that their people were suffering under a secular elite, and, in their telling, Islam had lost its way. In the decades after its founding, Islam had an unprecedented run of success. It conquered--and then held and governed--a massive amount of territory. It fought off European powers in the Crusades. It had a long era of success that was gradually corrupted from within due to excesses, similarly to the tales we tell ourselves about the Roman Empire. (You don't remember this, but in the 70s, it was very popular in the West to compare rising incidents of homosexuality, teen pregnancy, and the sexual revolution [i.e. women's empowerment] to the collapse of Rome). </p>
<p>For these Muslims, the key to regaining the power and prestige of Islam was to become more religious, to follow the true religion of Muhammad. This is an extremely powerful message. You'll find it around the world. Fundamentalist Christians tell us America has lost its way. Fundamentalists in politics in the US tell us that we have strayed from the vision of our Founding Fathers (it's the &quot;original intent&quot; of Scalia or the hero-worship of Washington and Monroe on the Right). Fundamentalists in economics tell us the Free Market has been corrupted and needs to be purified of regulation. See how powerful those ideas are in the United States. Now imagine how powerful they would be if the United States was a third-world country that had once been a globe-spanning empire. We would all dream of returning to our glory days, especially when we were at the height of our power during the era of Manifest Destiny. </p>
<p>As the Islamists tried, they were suppressed and tortured by the regimes in power, backed by the West. They became increasingly radical. The governments responded with increasingly harsh clampdowns. Each of these autocrats had powerful entities of state control, security apparatuses that would torture and kill. The Islamists--and many moderates--learned to fear and hate them, and the Western governments that gave them monetary and logistical support in return for control of their resources (for instance, in Egypt the French and UK controlled the Suez Canal for years, in Iran we took their oil at cut-rate prices). We got access to cheap resources while the people who should have benefited from those resources got the heel of the boot.</p>
<p>Over time, more and more people came to believe the tales of the Islamists. The only options were either secular autocrats or a religious government. They came to believe that a religious government was the only way forward. To an extent, this was the real reason for the Iraq War. Neoconservatives came to believe in the power of democracy and capitalism so much from the examples of Japan and West Germany post-WWII that they believed we needed to &quot;drain the swamp&quot; in the Islamic World--remove the autocrats and the stagnation, wave a magic wand and make Iraq a glowing capitalist democracy, like Japan. A shining beacon with a booming economy that could show the Islamic World a third way, and remake the future. </p>
<p>It is a beautiful dream, but like many dreams based upon ideology (and executed by ideologues convinced of their own inherent success) it was an abysmal failure. Hence neocons have much in common with Islamists. &quot;The Power of Nightmares&quot; draws further parallels and it utterly brilliant filmmaking. Everyone should see it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lol can't even believe it but finally! FINALLY! My education will be able to contribute to something on reddit!!!!!</p>
<p>I have an undergraduate in Political Science and History, focusing mainly on insurgency/counter insurgency in South East Asia. Specifically the Vietnam War and the War in Afghanistan. </p>
<p>I am currently doing my Masters in Counter-Terrorism in England. </p>
<p>As someone pointed out earlier, Globalization is a big factor, but another big factor was the emergence of Qutibism &amp; Islamic Fundamentalism. (Sayd Qutib) </p>
<p>Sayd Qutib visited the United States around 1948-1950. When he came here he basically saw how Capitalism was functioning and interpreted things that were going on around him as &quot;moral decay&quot;. Basically he thought the 'wests' idea of progress was backwards because liberalism had made anything and everything permissible. </p>
<p>So Sayd Qutb left and went back to Egypt, and converted to Fundamental Islam (Muslim's will argue and deny that Fundamental Islam doesn't exist, but if you're asking my opinion it does- I also studied Islam in my undergrad). He also joined a group called The Muslim Brotherhood (MB), which was founded in 1928 in Egypt and was created as the result of secularization in Turkey. </p>
<p>Sayd Qutb became one of the leaders of the MB because he had the most radical views and had a great deal of influence on the younger generation of muslims (younger generation of Egyptian Muslims were arguably pushed into this radicalization because of the fact that they were mostly well educated and didn't have any jobs). So this younger generation of muslims would go hang out in coffee shops and talk about religion and why they hated the government because they had no jobs. Most joined the MB because they wanted to be active in their religion/ the MB wasn't always a radical organization. In the early days the MB was a social organization that built Mosques and ran social activities. Eventually though, with the help of Sayd Qutb and his teachings, these middle class Egyptian Muslims became radicalized. </p>
<p>Sayd Qutb taught that Islam was the only true Religion and all other religions and Civilizations were barbarian, evil and animal like. All contact outside of the Muslim world was to be shunned. He taught that the west was the enemy, and that peace with the west was not possible. </p>
<p>It should be noted however, that although Sayd Qutb claimed to be a theologian of sorts, his writings were initially banned from the oldest university in the world (created by Muslims) Al Azhar in Egypt. </p>
<p>Basically what happened was eventually Qutb and the MB started engaging in 'terrorist activity' in the Egyptian state. This lead to crack downs by the Egyptian government and eventually to mass arrests. Qutb and other MB members spent years in Egyptian prisons. </p>
<p>In prison he wrote twenty books. Most important of these books was a 30 volume interpretation of the Koran and a book entitled Milestones. (Also I should mention that there is suggestion that Qutb, along with other members of the MB were severely tortured while in these Prisons, although there is definitely some debate about that because personally I don't think I'd be able to write 20 books while getting beating and tortured day in day out... but thats just my opinion.) </p>
<p>Milestones basically amounted to an ex-communication of all Muslims who did not agree with his brand of Islam. The book claimed that all existing Islamic states and their rulers were not sure Muslims but pagans and that a 'relentless war should be waged up to their destruction' (Laqueur, 2003. p 33). Milestones also amounted to a declaration of war against not just present rulers but on Society.  It should be also noted that this brand of Islam did not appeal to the older generations of the MB, but to the younger more radical aspects of the MB. </p>
<p>Eventually Qutb was released, but was eventually executed for his influence on the MB's assassination attempt on President Nassar. So him being executed by the 'infidel' state caused him to die a Martyr and thus he became a hero of Muslim extremists/fundamentalists everywhere. </p>
<p>After Qutb was killed his works were mass disseminated across the Muslim world. Qutb's teachings later went on to inspire a variety of other Islamic extremist organizations. </p>
<p>So why has this just come to the for front in the past thirty years? </p>
<p>The constant suppressing of these movements have basically only added fuel to the fire. Also there is definitely an argument to be made that Fundamental Islam is in fact the 'true' Islam, which generally gets people labelled as a biggot or racist, but unfortunately what you have to understand about the Islamic religion is that there is certainly a part of the history that is violent (along with most other religions but right now the flavour of the month ((or past thirty years)) is Islamic extremism). </p>
<p>This whole story basically picks back up with a man named Abdulla Azzam. Abdulla Azzam initially studied agriculture, then he went on to receive an Islamic Education in Syria and Egypt; he received a PhD in Islamic law. As a result of his education he was heavily influenced by the teachings of Sayd Qutb. Long story short Azzam dedicated his life to Jihad. As a result Azzam moved to Pakistan and founded Bait al Ansar, later called Maktab el Khadamat, in Peshawar. This amounted to basically a recruitment office for Foreign Fighters interested in carrying out Jihad (the Mujahideen in Afghanistan). Azzam's ideological goal was to establish the Khilafah, or Caliphate. His first goal was to liberate Afghanistan, then onto Global Jihad. Azzam believed that Jihad should continue until all mankind worshiped Allah. </p>
<p>Azzam biggest contribution to the 'Global Jihad' was the creation of the idea of 'Muslim invincibility'. This was because he caused his followers to believe that Allah had allowed them to beat the USSR in Afghanistan, not the CIA money / American weapons. </p>
<p>Basically beating the Soviets gave the Islamic extremists a false belief in their god/power (or is it? only time will tell).</p>
<p>Azzam also did not believe in negotiation with the west or any of the superpowers. </p>
<p>Azzam first met Usama Bin Laden (UBL) in Peshawar. UBL became the main financier for what was soon to be known as AQ/ Al Qaeda / 'the base'. Contrary to popular opinion/ belief, Azzam was the founder of AQ, not UBL. Once Azzam died (some suggest UBL had him killed) UBL took over AQ. After UBL took over Aiman al Zawahiri became UBL's top lieutenant or advisor whatever you wish to term him, basically he was really important to UBL, which is why he took over the leadership of AQ after the US Navy SEAL raid in 2011. </p>
<p>Prior to 9/11 UBL was busy in the Sudan setting up Islamic NGO's that would later work as fronts for the 'Global Jihad'. UBL left the Sudan in '96 at the request of the Sudanese government who had been getting pressure internationally to either give him up. The Sudan wouldn't give him up so they asked him to leave and so UBL left to go back to Afghanistan. </p>
<p>Two years later in 1998, UBL and Aiman al Zawahiri set out the basic tenets of the Jihadi ideology. This amounted to both a declaration of war against the west and a unification of Islamic extremist groups, which included; AQ (signed by Bin Laden) Egyptian Jihad (signed by al Zawahiri), Egyptain Gama'a (signed by Abu Jasir), Jamiyat Ulama (signed by Abu Hamza al Misri) and the Jihad Movement in Bangladesh (signed by Fazul Rahman). UBL got them all to work together because he had the money. </p>
<p>In this document was also a Fatwah (Islamic law) that was headed down by Sheikh Abu Hamza al Misri which gave religious sanctioning for the declaration of war on the USA and its allies; this Fatwah also condoned the killing civilians and military members. </p>
<p>Then 9/11 happened and things pretty much just went down hill from there in terms of Islam's image in the West. </p>
<p>TLDR; Sayd Qutb - Qutibism - Jihad - Azzam - UBL - 911. </p>
<p>Also, by no means am I saying this is the 'correct' account of what happened it is 100% just my interpretation of the history. As well you asking this to be ELI5 is really not a reality, my TLDR is basically just the buzz words / lineage that I would look at if you want to understand it more. This shit is fucking complicated and academia is split literally 50/50 on who's at fault for this shit. But its not going away and I'm working hard to try and 'fix' it for the sake of everyone. </p>
<p>Also the majority of my information comes from two books, Hoffman's Inside Terrorism and Laqueurs No End To War: Terrorism in the 21st Century. </p>
<p>If you want a documentary, watch Power of Nightmares, someone else referenced that in here as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Globalization happened.  </p>
<p>Basically every culture outside one's own was seen in a very simplistic, often romanticized way.  Now people see that other cultures are complex and varied things.</p>
<p>But to this specific, Islamic terrorism against the West (and we're talking about the West's viewpoints here really, right?) first really came to the forefront with the 1972 Munich Olympics thing.  By 1985, the bad guys in Back to the Future (aside from Biff and his friends, of course)?  Libyan terrorists.  Then the Cold War ends and Russia is the West's &quot;friend&quot;?  The rise of Islamic terrorism against the West receives even more attention simply because there's nothing like it to compare it against.</p>
<p>EDIT: So many people are trying to tell me I'm wrong and citing earlier examples of violence/terrorism. I'm just giving the general timeline for when the Western popular narrative begin to change and why.  Other people are telling me it's not that simple: I wrote a graduate thesis paper that was very long based solely on the Suez Crisis, so I'm quite aware that literally books, plural, could be written on this subject. I just gave a quick ELI5 before I went to work, I wasn't <em>trying</em> to be comprehensive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm probably a bit late to the party - but here’s my interpretation:</p>
<p>It all begins with “statehood” in my opinion. Back at the beginning of the 20th Century, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan didn't exist. It was only when the Ottoman Empire fell that these states were created. After World War 1, the Ottoman Empire was carved up and distributed between France and the UK as mandates, with friendly Arab leaders in charge. This was the Sykes-Picot agreement. Before this agreement, the Middle East was an enormous patch of competing tribes. This would prove to have a major impact later on - as would the Balfour Agreement which created the state of Israel (despite British promises to leave the Arabs alone in exchange for their help during WW1).</p>
<p>Eventually, the British and French left having created these superficial states and inserting Israel into the mix. In the 1948 War - between Israel on one side and Egypt, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and Iraq on the other - Israel managed to comprehensively defeat the combined Arab armies and expanded their borders (similar to their current borders). </p>
<p>Before the war, the Arab states had thought that Pan-Arabism (or Nasserism) could make them stronger (i.e. creating one large super state, similar to things under the Ottoman Empire). But after this humiliating defeat, that project was abandoned. Instead, Arab intellectuals insisted that they must seek to discover what made Israel so much stronger. In the end, they settled on the fact the Israel was a religious state and that “nationhood” had made the Arabs weaker. Thus began the first notable period of Islamic revival of the last hundred years.</p>
<p>Islamic revival is a huge part of the religion of Islam. During periods of uncertainty, the people of Islam (or the ummna) are encouraged to use Islam to find strength via the twin doctrines of “renewal” and “reform”. These doctrines are key tenets of Islam and there have been thousands of instances of Islamic revival over hundreds of years - almost always in response to a threat from outside (spoiler: the West).</p>
<p>So - the pan-arab/state project had failed and people in the Middle East felt that they had lost their tribal and religious identities. Economic hardship also began to take its toll. All around the world, we see the effects of modernity and weak statehood yielding the same results – religious revival. Just look at nations in Africa and South America. By contrast, Egypt and Iran are much older states, and are therefore comparably more stable. </p>
<p>These areas also have very young populations. The younger the population, the more likely it is you’re going to get a revolt. So what we are seeing today is the conflation of several factors. Ultimately however, the States were not built to last and religion remains a much more powerful idea in the Middle East than the European notion of nationhood.</p>
<p>Obviously there’s a big gap between 1948 and the Noughties and there were in fact repeated attempts to make states work – largely via Western patronization. Saddam Hussein is a strong example of this. However, economic pressures have again destroyed the idea of statehood as “functional” and we are seeing an even stronger religious revival backlash as a result.</p>
<p>Why the Middle East feels particularly hostile to the West however relates back to the Western obsession with interfering. Although Iran isn’t an Arab state (and has existed for millennia), it offers perhaps the best example. We put their “Shah” or King in charge back at the beginning of the 20th century. The Shah was not a good ruler and the people grew poor and resented his reforms. In 1953, there was a revolution and the Iranians elected a democratic Prime Minister, Mosadeq. The Americans didn’t want a democratically elected Prime Minister over in Iran as he wanted to keep all the oil revenues for the people of Iran. So, the Americans arranged and funded a counter-coup and put the Shah’s son, Reza Shah, back in charge. </p>
<p>This state of affairs continued until 1979 until, you guessed it, there was an Islamic Revolution. Islam seemed to be the only viable antidote to Western interference and thus Reza Shah was forced out and Iran became the an Islamic Republic – despite being historically very secular. Due to the prominence of the clerics in government, it is now almost impossible for the people of Iran to elect a moderate – although they did manage once with Khatami in the 90s. Khatami, in fact, tried to ward off the influence of the clerics; bring women into government; and sought to make friends with the West. He even called up George Bush after the 9/11 attacks and offered Iran’s support to hunt down Osama Bin Laden (since he was sunni and Iran is shi'a). The following morning, George Bush gave his infamous axis of evil speech where he highlighted North Korea, Iraq AND IRAN as the most evil states in existence – despite the offer of help 24 hours earlier.</p>
<p>Finally, YES, the media lack all nuance and it's much easier to make out that the Arabs are all terrorists who hate us for no reason rather than providing a proper history lesson.</p>
<p>In essence, the reason the Middle East seems so hostile today is because the Western project of statehood has failed; Islamic revival is a powerful movement; and the West have conspired over the course of a hundred years to make everyone in the Middle East hate us.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: Statehood is a European invention that cannot be forced upon other cultures without repercussion. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this is Edward Said's concept of Orientalism. Basically, Orientalism states that the way we view foreigners, in particular those from the Middle East, is motivated. We view them through a lens that distorts their culture for our own purposes. The concept was initially born out of French and British colonization, and the fact that Europeans defined Middle Eastern culture in western terms. For example, Napoleon brought his own writers, scientists, etc. to Egypt to make observations and classifications of the region. The result was that western explanations of non-western culture became the norm. The romanticism you mentioned was really a product of European colonization. The Middle East was a strange and beautiful place, ripe for the taking, and its people were different and exotic: perfect for exploitation. European Orientalism helped to classify and subjugate the natives.    </p>
<p>At this point in time, the US was not heavily involved in the ME. Then everything changed in 1948 with the creation of Israel. Since then American Orientalism has been on the rise, and it is far more politicized than European Orientalism was during the colonial period, in large part due to our support of Israel. Our perspective of the Middle East has shifted more towards an anti-Islamic point of view than that of the European one. Our anti-Islamic view has only grown since then as countries like Iran grew more radical after the 1979 revolution and groups like Al-Qaeda and eventually ISIS emerged, giving concrete face to Israel's anti-Islamic ideas back home in America. With 9/11, American Orientalism grew exponentially, to the point where many people now view Middle Eastern culture as inherently violent and inhumane. Really, this is just our own distorted lens brought on by politicization of an Orientalist perspective.    </p>
