<p>It's like asking if your footprints are still in the grass of your grade school yard. Well, the grass wouldn't be in the exact configuration it's in now had you never walked on it, but... come on. You wouldn't  know the difference if you were shown the grass without your interference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just going expand on the zero part, but you can answer this question just by saying that the energy eventually leaves and normalizes the system (whatever that normal state is). But going to zero actually means something else, you can think of all systems, and how you measure values from those systems in the following way:</p>
<p>Depending on which model you are working with, the average measurement can APPROACH zero. If you take for example energy in a system, lets say KE, then your average measurement can be zero. By the nature of riemann sums and the fundamental theorem of calculus, you know that you are taking the sum of parts. The parts are never zero, but their sums can be. The measurements reflect some sum. If you are ever able to measure a part independently, you would never get a 0 measurement within a system (unless it is relative to it self). Even if its completely ordered with no entropy (an impossible system even at abs 0). By the nature of measurements, it would be a force relative to something. None of our current models allow it to be zero. Only in theory can a non-summed zero measure exist. In practice, that zero measurement would be relative to another force, and thus explicitly non-zero.</p>
<p>We thus only know the part up to the smallest measurement, and breaking it down any further is theoretical. You pick your model and based on that model you can take a measurement and break it down into the smallest defined possibility for that model. In simplest terms, if you find that the KE of a 2 particle system is some arbitrary value 4. If your model for this system predicts equal distribution of energy between particles  then you can use that to do &quot;math&quot; on the measurement of &quot;4&quot; and arrive at 2 per particle (although you never measured that 2, you measured its sum). Similarly, now with that value of 2 you can use a model for that one particle and arrive at how the KE is distributed within the particle etc etc.</p>
<p>Engineers that do signal processing for example use Fourier analysis to break down signal wave forms into their fundamentals based on knowns, measurements  and theory. Each step allows you to get further. However, once you move beyond measurements of parts, you are basically breaking down the sums using the model for that system. Its really powerful. It might not be the &quot;true value&quot; but it is consistent if the model you apply is consistent. So our smallest calculated value can be non-real but still be a defined consistent output. Weirdly enough, this calculated value can be 0. But the measurements leading up to it can never be zero. Or if you prefer, it can also be said as ~ there is no way to measure something unless it is relative to another thing, even if that thing is a purely theoretical value. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Conservation of energy says if you put some energy into a system, it either stays there, or crosses the boundary again somehow, but you got that energy somewhere else, and it certainly still exists <em>somewhere</em>.  In most of the situations you'll encounter, it will leave the system as heat after being damped out by some resistance, or friction, or some such.</p>
<p>I had a professor who liked to say &quot;Models have limitations; stupidity does not.&quot;  When you calculate the differential equations, you're modeling the system.  You're excluding dozens of damping mechanics and higher order terms that contribute to the system's operation.  In your example, you have already considered damping - this is not a sink, but a radiator of energy via heat.  You're essentially transforming displacement energy into heat via friction.  Oscillation requires energy!</p>
<p>Using a different example, an LC tank circuit would theoretically appear to oscillate forever at its natural frequency after being charged, but in reality any inductor or capacitor you used to build it would also include equivalent series resistance, and parasitic components that are generally not accounted for by a simple 'L' and 'C'.  The unaccounted for resistances would dissipate the energy as heat, which is then transferred across the boundary of the system to the environment.</p>
<p>TL;DR:  That punch has been an unnoticeable part of our common experience since you damped it out in your muscles and radiated the heat through your skin to the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
