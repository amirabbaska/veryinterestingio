		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>BitConnect was a ponzi scheme using their own cryptocurrency, the BitConnect coin. &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot; means that a company offers a supposed investment opportunity to its customers, promising above-average returns (in this case <del>120% per year</del> 40% per month). They intend to make good on that promise by attracting more and more investors, so that the payouts can be paid by an ever increasing stream of money. In order to make this possible, they rely on multi-level marketing: They encourage the investors to do the marketing for them, by telling their friends, family and online communities.</p>
<p>The end-game for a ponzi scheme is that at some point, when no more people come in and investors start demanding money, they go bust. But not before the people who created it all siphon away all the money they can.</p>
<p>The way this worked here was that people bought the BitConnect coins with BitCoins, and then &quot;lend&quot; it to the BitConnect platform. At the end of it, investors wouldn't get back their money in BitCoins, but the BitConnect coin - which is pretty much worthless everywhere else. </p>
<p>So what happened was that BitConnect grew so big that it attracted media attention, and people rightfully called it out for what it was. (Edit) Due this and the recent bitcoin crash, they decided to close their platform, presumably keeping a lot of the BitCoins that people gave them for their worthless cryptocurrency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You give your friend 5 dollars today because he said he could give you 50 cents a day as a return. He says that the money is being invested by a computer and that's how he's able to get such a high return. You tell all your friend's and they all give him 5 dollars as well, he's getting money in and only giving each person 50 cents a day. Then one day he stops and no one knows where he went. The first few people maybe got their money back as popularity grew, others had just given him 5 dollars today when he disappeared. Bit connect did that, but scaled up a ton. Not saying they never did invest the money, just when they had enough, what stops them from disappearing rich with everyones money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bitconnect was a service in which you could give your cryptocurrency to a bot which was supposedly able to trade with higher return. Alleged gains of around 1% a day were spoken of.</p>
<p>Naturally, many people jumped in on this. As time went on, around US $3Billion was &quot;invested.&quot; Later on, the service was discontinued and people who invested were given &quot;Bitconnect tokens&quot; matching the value of their investments, but as the investment bot was down/never existed, it was quickly apparent that people lost quite a bit of money, in turn (along with other factors) contributing to the value of the majority of crypto devaluing about 30-50%.</p>
<p>Tl;dr ponzi scheme</p>
<p>Edit: am grammar gud</p>
<p>Edit 2: I am by no means an authority on this; I just got into it the past month like what i understand is a great many other people. There are some good replies to this comment that touch on things in a more technical, less ELI5 capacity. Money, whether mainstream or alternative, is complicated as hell. I'm gonna go read about taxes and cry now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bitconnect is - or rather was - a classic pyramide scheme.
As far as i know, it was a platform that requested people to give them their money as a credit and then earn up to 40% income return. Bitconnect told the users that their money would be handled by a 'trading bot' which would result in the extensive income returns. They also asked users to recruit new users (and thus new money). </p>
<p>The platform is now offline and the money is gone. There most likely never was a 'trading bot' in the first place - it was just a pyramide scam. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bitconeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeect is platform where you invest your money for a period of time and you get daily interests on it.</p>
<p>They claim to use your money in &quot;trading bots&quot; to give consistent profits but in reality no trading bot can do that.</p>
<h1>How it works</h1>
<p>Alice invested $100 in Bob ( bitconect ) for 1 year. </p>
<p>Bob estimates to give Alice $200+ in 1 year trading Alice's money using their special bot. </p>
<p>While he keeps $100 ( initial principal ) locked up for 1 year the rest of the money is given in small parts daily.</p>
<h1>Ponzi part</h1>
<p>Then another person Tim invested $500 in Bob. </p>
<p>Bob will use $200 from Tim's invested money to give Alice $200 in 1 year and so on.</p>
<p>So basically they are giving money of new investor to old investor.</p>
<h1>How people lost money</h1>
<p>Bitconeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeect got cease and desist from many states and had to close its ponzi platform.</p>
<p>Most People who invested in bitconect in early days have got their principal but the new people who bought less than in a year are still stuck with principal money. </p>
<p>Even if they return it back they are returning in BCC coins which is now worth 5-10 times less than when they bought it for.</p>
<p>YouTube like Trevor James , CryptoNick and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7r6chx/here_is_a_list_of_crypto_ponzi_schemes_and_people/?utm_content=comments&amp;utm_medium=hot&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=CryptoCurrency" target="_blank">countless others</a> scammed money from their subscribers knowing bitconect was ponzi and now deleting their videos when busted.</p>
<p>Bonus </p>
