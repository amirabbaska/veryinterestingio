		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a very excellent historical reference with a large chapter on clothing in a book written by Ruth Underhill and published by the US Department of the Interior in 1945.
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015003692897;view=1up;seq=121" target="_blank">Indians of the Pacific Northwest</a> is a full copy of the images available online. The clothing chapter begins on page 115.</p>
<p>The native people of the Pacific Northwest lived with such an abundance of food and resources within easy reach that they spent a relatively large amount of time on artwork and more elaborate craft work. Any clothes that they didn't wear therefore wasn't from a lack of available supplies or time, but strictly due to the comfort and freedom from restriction.</p>
<p>According to photos in other old journals and the reports in Underhill's book, the women wore skirts and the men wore breechclouts for practical daily life. Despite average annual temperatures in the upper 50s and low 60s, the natives from my area relied on their own body fat for warmth most of the year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Sentinelese are an isolated culture living on the Sentinel Island in the indian Ocean. They have had very little contact with outsiders, and are presently protected from contact by the Indian government. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=42oZ-sWG7Zg" target="_blank">This video shows a rare interaction between an Indian anthropologist team and the tribe.</a> It’s interesting in that the tribe is seen holding their genitals in plain view, in what is probably an aggressive act. Unless you are an anthropologist, it’s probably technically NSFW.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a study that correlates the divergence of body lice from head lice to the beginnings of human clothing. The theory is that there was no habitat for body lice until clothing started being used. And that head lice predate body lice.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just as a side note, clothing is <em>much</em> older than that 72,000 year age you state.</p>
<p><em>Homo erectus</em> is generally accepted to have had clothing, basic animal fur stuff early and stitched clothing later on and their species range was from around 2 million years ago to 100,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The use of clothing predates our species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
