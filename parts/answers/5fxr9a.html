		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one really knows for sure.  According to a study released in 2013 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, food allergies among children increased approximately 50% between 1997 and 2011.</p>
<p>Also some allergies can be outgrown, like milk, eggs, and soy.  Meaning there would be more children with these allergies than adults.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had fairly severe food allergies as a child; one type of flour, citrus, some cheeses, chocolate, any artificial colourings or preservatives, quite a few other bits and pieces. Contact with these led to hyperactivity, illness, general bad times. </p>
<p>As I grew older, they kind of wore off. I have always assumed it was repeated exposure to them. It wasn't all at once; gradually, different allergies became less. I am thirty two now, and still allergic to just one known thing: orange. If I drink too much of a diet drink (and thus aspartame, to which I was once very allergic) I still get minor symptoms, but I need to drink a lot to have that happen. Similarly, occasionally I feel the warning signs that maybe I shouldn't have eaten whatever that was.</p>
<p>It's been over six years since my last big problem, when I foolishly tried some orange juice to see if I was still allergic. And also to see just why everywhere stocks it. I don't get it; it doesn't taste or smell that great. Maybe I'd have a different opinion had I been able to drink it as a child, of course :-P</p>
<p>Tl:dr, had food allergies as child, still have at least once, assuming repeated contact built up my resistance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My thoughts are it's partly down to our more sterile way of living now and partly down to a change in food production. The sterile thing is fairly self explanatory. But the food thing is much more subtle. </p>
<p>Why does nobody question how milk would cream over in the bottle within minutes of it being delivered in the 80's and early 90's then do it again if you used it and then left it for a while. But since buying supermarkets milk in plastic bottles this never happens. </p>
<p>There's countless things to spot if you pay attention to your food. And I'd bet if you got your milk from a farmer it would still have the cream. </p>
<p>I'm not trying to join or instigate some conspiracy. Things change and as far as we can tell... normally for the good. But I can't help suspect that this is why so many people have reactions compared to previous generations. </p>
<p>And next to nobody is gluten intolerant by the way. That number is so small compared to the people that claim to be. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not a medical professional in any way, but this is what I've heard: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Areas further away from the equator (and thus with lower ambient ultraviolet radiation [UVR]) have been shown to have higher rates of childhood food allergy-related hospital admissions [4], epinephrine autoinjector prescriptions [4, 5], and peanut allergy (up to six times the risk) [6] than areas closer to the equator. Season of birth (being born in autumn or winter when there is less UVR exposure) has also been associated with higher risk of anaphylaxis [7] and food allergy [8].
A link between late introduction of egg, one of the few common dietary sources of vitamin D in the infant diet, and food allergy has been observed in a large Australian study [10]. Infants who were first given egg earlier (that is between four and six months) had significantly less food allergy than infants first given egg later (that is, after six months of age).
Research using direct measures of vitamin D from blood samples have also shown an association between low vitamin D and increased risk of allergic sensitization in children and adolescents [9] and food allergy in infants [11]. In this Australian study, infants with low vitamin D were more likely to have egg or peanut allergy and were more likely to have multiple allergies compared to infants with normal vitamin D levels. </p>

<p>The teacher who told me this said that there was a reason to believe women using sunscreen in pregnancy has led to lower vitamin d. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
