		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This crucial maneuver is usually achieved through the use of  <a href="https://spaceflightsystems.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/gimbaled.html" target="_blank">gimbaled thrust</a>.</p>
<p>In a gimbaled thrust system, the exhaust  nozzle(s) of the rocket's engine(s) can be swiveled from side to side. As the nozzle is moved, the direction of the thrust is changed relative to the center of gravity of the rocket.</p>
<p>At the moment of launch, the rocket is positioned vertically, and the engine exhaust nozzle is centered.   The direction of thrust is along the center line of the rocket and through the center of gravity (CG) of the rocket.   The rocket therefore accelerates straight and vertical.</p>
<p>Once it's clear of the launch tower, the rocket flight path must begin to &quot;curve&quot; away from the vertical in order to gain the crucial horizontal velocity required for orbit.  </p>
<p>To accomplish this, the engine nozzle is swiveled slightly in the direction the rocket is to turn.   The thrust line is now inclined to the rocket center line at an angle called the gimbal angle.  Since the thrust line no longer passes through the rocket's CG, a torque is generated  which causes the rocket to rotate about its CG. This rotation moves the nose of the rocket in the same direction the engine was gimballed. </p>
<p>When the desired flight angle is achieved, the exhaust nozzle is gimballed back to its original orientation,  eliminating the torque and halting the rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called a gravity turn and is achieved through steering. Either gimbals in the thrusters or different thrust during ascent. Theoretically you could launch something straight to space, but it requires excessive amounts of Delta V and the vessel would have to leave earth's sphere of influence or it would just fall back down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason for this is that orbit requires high velocites in the horizontal direction (relative to the ground).  Just going straight up would be fine if you didn't care about achieving orbit, but you'd come straight back down (neglecting planetary rotation).</p>
<p>The ISS, for instance, has to move at 7672 meters/second (17,136 miles per hour) to stay in orbit.</p>
<p>The idea is that, because even orbiting objects are constantly falling, you move fast enough sideways that, by the time you fall far enough to hit the ground, you've moved sideways far enough to miss it.  Get your speed just right for your altitude, and you just stay up, going in circles.</p>
<p>Rockets pull off the lean/turn by pivoting their engine nozzles (&quot;gimballing&quot;); changing the direction for thrust changes the direction of flight.  </p>
<p>In this case, both gravity and aerodynamic forces help out.  The rocket nozzles swivel to one side, generating a force on the tail of the rocket toward the opposite side.  The nose of the rocket begins to lean in the same direction the engines swiveled.</p>
<p>The rocket is still moving mostly 'up,' so it begins to encounter increased drag on the other side of the airframe.  This acts to push the nose farther off center.  When the nose moves far enough to the side, the rocket's center of gravity shifts over, and gravity helps pull the rocket the rest of the way over.  This all happens in less than a single second.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the rocket needs to stop turning once it reaches it's desired course.  Rather than try to directly fight the massive forces it has just generated by swinging the nozzle the other direction, we take advantage of the rocket's momentum to help us stop the lean when we get where we want to go, by redirecting it rather than reversing it.</p>
<p>The rocket again changes the angle of it's nozzles, this time inducing a slow roll.  The nose of the rocket describes a small, tight spiral as it rolls, with the spiral ending when the rocket is pointed where we want it to go.  By this point, the nozzles are re-centered, and we've steadied up on course.</p>
<p>Edit:. Spelling, clarity</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can theoretically happen naturally if you give the rocket the right amount of lean to start, and have your aerodynamics right. It isn't practical though, to deal with wind variations and minor fluctuations in thrust, you need some control of the rocket to have a reasonable chance of success.</p>
<p>If the rocket is flying through the air at an angle , rather than straight up or down, gravity will pull its trajectory downward. As this happens, the tail fins will orient the rocket to point along the direction of travel relative to the air. So at first, when the rocket is close to vertical, most of the thrust goes straight down, while only a little is pushing sideways. As the rocket gains horizontal speed, it tilts more, and more of the thrust goes into horizontal acceleration. At the end of the turn, and the end of the burn, you want your last bit of thrust to be all horizontal, with gravity cancelling the last bit of upward momentum. If this horizontal point comes too early, your rocket will point towards the earth, and you will not be going to space today. If it is too late, you can still achieve orbit, just not as efficiently in most cases, and your multi million dollar launch could have gotten more done, possibly saving you a second launch.</p>
<p>While some basic aerodynamics and the right starting angle can do the job, it is much more practical to launch from vertical, and having control of the ship let's you deal with wind and pressure changes that can push you off course, or affect thrust levels. This can be done by gymbaling the engine to get control of the thrust vector, or with small thrusters aimed to the sides at specific points on the rocket to control attitude, or with active aerodynamic surfaces that can be moved by a pilot or computer to maintain control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other comments have discussed active stabilization and steering during ascent, and they are correct for most cases. The less common approach (at least for orbital rockets) are passively stabilized gravity turns. There is some <a href="https://space.stackexchange.com/questions/24754/why-jaxas-tilted-launch-from-a-tilted-rooftop" target="_blank">great discussion if this here</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, the fins of a rocket force it to turn into the airflow. If you launch perfectly straight up with no wind, that will be straight down, and it will fly straight up. If there is wind, however, the rocket will turn to fly into the wind.</p>
<p>As long as flight angle remains parallel with the center of thrust, fins will keep you straight. However if your rocket starts to tilt, the thrust angle will no longer be vertical, and it will begin to pick up horizontal velocity. Gravity doesn't affect horizontal velocity, but it does affect your vertical velocity. Thus a passively stable rocket will curve along a parabolic trajectory, same as any thrown ball.</p>
<p>By adding a bit of thrust at the top of our parabola, we can extend the opposite side of our orbit from being underground to being above the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Depending on how aerodnyamically stable they are (many actively controlled rockets are neutrally stable or even unstable), all rockets will be dragged into a gravity turn, unless they launch straight up or actively resist it. This isn't a bad thing. As stated, gravity doesn't affect the horizontal component of your velocity. Orbit can only happen outside of the atmosphere, but once you get there the most important thing to have to stay up is horizontal velocity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
