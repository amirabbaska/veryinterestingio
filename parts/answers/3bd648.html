		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, people had thousands of years of bronze smelting before anyone figure out how to get iron from ore. People used meteoritic iron long before then too, but of course there wasn't much of that.</p>
<p>Iron isn't too hard to get out of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog_iron" target="_blank">bog ore</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goethite" target="_blank">goethite</a>. Some places where you could get bog ore also yielded <a href="http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/manufacturing/text/bog_iron.htm" target="_blank">iron nodules</a>. Maybe someone got some bog ore mixed in to their bronze smelting operation.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The onset of the Iron Age in most parts of the world coincides with the first widespread use of the bloomery. While earlier examples of iron are found, their high nickel content indicates that this is meteoric iron. Other early samples of iron may have been produced by accidental introduction of iron ore in bronze smelting operations. Iron appears to have been smelted in the West as early as 3000 BC, but bronze smiths, not being familiar with iron, did not put it to use until much later. In the West, iron began to be used around 1200 BC.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iron doesn't need to be melted (1536 °C) to be extracted. You can reduce iron ore in a solid state between 800 to 1,050 °C depending on the composition of the ore. This is not much higher than temperatures needed for copper production. That's a clue in terms of the evolution of iron production. To cut a long story short, iron is often a by-product of copper reduction processes (in the form of an iron-silicon mix called fayalite) so the theories are that the skills of extractive metallurgy in copper opened the door for iron extraction. One of the nicest all round books on this is the seminal work by R. F. Tylecote (1992) A History of Metallurgy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right, you couldn't stumble on iron smelting by accident. The extremely high temperatures and high carbon monoxide partial pressure necessary to reduce iron oxides (the easiest reducible iron ore) are not something you can create in a bonfire. You have to have a container, such as a furnace. </p>
<p>However, when you break it down to its most basic, iron smelting is not that different from copper smelting, which people were already doing well. Iron smelting in Africa is often extremely elaborated (particularly for performance to western ethnographers), so don't read too much into that documentary. You can smelt iron with wood, rather than special fuels, and you can use pigments such as ochre as ore, which we know people were using for substantial periods of time before they ever got around to smelting metals. Critically, you can also use the same kind of set up as people used for copper smelting (which likely also originated in the smelting of brightly coloured material like malachite) - very small, very low profile, low impact furnaces.</p>
<p>Basically, follow the same pattern for copper smelting, only add more fuel, make sure your furnace has a bit more in the way of walls to hold in the heat, and pump your bellows harder for a bit longer, and you can smelt iron.</p>
<p>Edit - and I realise that this is going to get lost miles down in the comment thread, but I basically just got my PhD in early iron smelting two weeks ago, so if anyone does have more questions regarding the chemistry and physics of iron smelting, I am all over that :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People didn't start with Iron, the first metal used was copper, which has a much lower melting temperature.</p>
<p>Nothing official, but it's speculated that when using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_OrBw4L490Y" target="_blank">malachite</a> as stones in a fire ring, people were able to recognize the melted result as a malleable substance.</p>
<p>Once metallurgy was discovered, a LOT of trial and error developed bronze, then iron, then steel, then modern alloys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find it funny that when a discussion like this occurs, bronze is mentioned, but only in passing. Smelting bronze is more difficult, as not only do you have to have the correct amounts of tin and copper, but you would have had to figured out how to smelt it from Cassiterite.</p>
<p>Just a little quirk in the human progression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
