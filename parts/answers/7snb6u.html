		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At low frequencies, or DC, the current distribution is even.  At high frequencies, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_effect" target="_blank">skin effect</a> starts to appear, causing the current density to increase on the outer walls of a wire, and reduce in the center of the wire.</p>
<p>Note that this is referring to the current, which is the motion of electrons, not the electrons themselves.</p>
<p>One thing that can change the electron concentration is a magnetic field.  This causes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect" target="_blank">hall effect</a>, which causes a slight grouping of the electrons on one side of the conductor in the presence of a magnetic field, and a lack of electrons on the other side.  This causes a measurable votlage, in the millivolts, that can be read without any super specialized equipment, and is commonly used in many places, for instance measuring current (which causes a magnetic field) or detecting if the lid of a laptop is closed (which has small magnets in it).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends a little bit on whether it is AC or DC. In AC signals it is predominantly on the edge of the wire. I feel a bit embarrassed but I'm not even sure about the answer to the question in regard of DC. I think it is quite uniform. Measuring the distribution will be quite hard. The best way I could imagine is to make a bundle of wires that are isolated from each other. Then you run a DC current through all of them and attempt to measure the current through each individual wire individually. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons don't actually move in a wire when carrying current. What moves is the electric field, basically a wave of electromagnetic energy that travels with the speed of light.</p>
<p>The electrons do move a little, in what is called electronic migration, but this phenomenon is very slow and not really significant. For semiconductors, there you can have localized movement of electrons and holes (ions), but in wires such as copper wires, there is no such movement of electrons.</p>
<p>The movement of electrons to explain current flow is more like a simplified model.</p>
<p>This is a previous thread talking about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7mub6z/can_temperature_affect_the_speed_of_electricity/" target="_blank">&quot;speed of electricity&quot;</a> which may give some insight on the whole phenomenon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't confuse the electrons and the electric field and energy transfer.
In a wire the electrons move in the order of about 23 μm per second throughout the wire. (Wikipedia, Drift Velocity).  The electric field ripples down the wire at about 1/10 the speed of light and is how the energy is transferred.<br />
Much like if I pushed on the end of a 100 foot long board, the board would move slowly, but the far end of the board would move (almost) immediately.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrons are better described as matter waves. (Schrödinger )</p>
<p>Don't think of water in a pipe since that implies particles, but a tin can telephone (connected by string).  The string (medium) only moves slightly  but the energy of a sound (wave)  is transmitted through it.</p>
<p>A superconductor is like a string in a vacuum that loses no energy from its motion.</p>
<p>Electrical energy from a  battery, is like someone yelling into the cup.</p>
<p>So can we look at the cross section of the string to see the sound distribution or do we need to look at its wave characteristics as a whole? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
