<p>Note that the core of a star is very dense, so dense it can fuse elements at much lower temperatures because of the extreme pressure. In fusion reactors they have to compensate for the lack in pressure with higher temperatures, however, the amount of stuff being heated is much, much smaller and less dense. Take ITER's chamber, it will be a vacuum housing only a couple of grams of material in gas form and then heated to a plasma. If confinement is lost, there is so little mass that it will cool down immediately and stop the fusion process. </p>
<p>Edit: if my calculations are right, the 500 MW ITER reactor would release about this much energy in case of a breach (around 120 kg of TNT equivalent).</p>

<p>I wouldn't want to be near the chamber if it implodes and the heat is released, but it's hardly a world ending event.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When they fail the reaction stops. The plasma cools down.  That's why its difficult to keep a reaction running for long enough, you have to keep the plasma hot . If it were any different  it would probably be easier to achieve. The amount of fuel in the reactor at a time is a few grams only, so yes it's safe.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hate it when people call building a fusion reactor as capturing &quot;A piece of the sun.&quot;  If you do the math, the sun has the average energy production lower than a compost pile. It's just really huge, so there's a lot of it.</p>
<p>To be a viable energy source, fusion reactors on earth will have to operate at <del>energy</del> power densities that are orders of magnitude higher than the sun, and at significantly higher temperatures. <em>However</em>, there is so little thermal mass involved that should there be a catastrophic containment failure, pretty much nothing will happen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human components to a fusion vs fission reaction is reversed. </p>
<p>Fission reactor material wants to react because there's a critical mass of solid material that just splits due to stray neutrons.  The human component slows or halts the reaction through control rods in the system.  When the human component fails to keep the control rods in place the chain reaction runs away and you get a meltdown.</p>
<p>In a fusion reaction the human component is the various magnetic bottling techniques to both keep the plasma from touching the inside surface of the reaction chamber and getting too cold to fuse, and maintain a plasma density large enough for the reaction to continue.  If the human component fails the fusion material immediately falls below reaction density and loses much of it's heat (not radioactive in any way) to the container walls and subsequently goes out.</p>
<p>It's also worth knowing that hot plasmas are way less dense than science fiction would indicate; most laboratory fusion reactions could be safely extinguished by placing a hand in the stream... not that anyone would because there's still stray neutron in the stream.  But it's not commonly understood that there's so few atoms that even at high temperature the water in your body can disperse the heat and quench the reaction before cellular damage would set in at a noticeable level.</p>
<p>TL;DR: In fission humans are there to stop a runaway reaction.  In fusion humans are there to initiate the reaction.  Fusion is safer than fission because when the humans fail to do their job the reaction just stops.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compared to fission reactors, very much so.</p>
<p>Fission reactors have a few central problems. One is unintended criticality, where the reactor is &quot;on&quot; but you don't want it on, maybe even a lot <em>more</em> on than you desire. This is the meltdown scenario or the Chernobyl scenario. It can be mitigated through various design choices (which Chernobyl didn't make use of) but it's still a potential problem. Another is the fission products problem. Fission products are ultra radioactive and hazardous to human health. They need to be protected from entering the environment at all cost. Unfortunately, they also generate a lot of heat. Which means that cooling is a major problem for a reactor <em>even when it's off</em>. This is the Fukushima problem. It can also be mitigated through various design choices (Fukushima was an old design) but it's always a worry.</p>
<p>Fusion reactors don't really have either of these problems. They need to be constantly forced into being in the &quot;on&quot; state just due to the nature of the reaction. The second you flip the switch the conditions necessary for fusion to happen stop being in place and fusion rapidly stops. There's no issue of unintended runaway as there is with fission reactors. Additionally, while fusion reactors do produce and use some radioactive materials (Tritium being the most problematic, I think) the amount and the threat of the radiological footprint of fusion reactors is vastly less than for fission reactors. You don't have the fission products to deal with, you don't have the fissile fuel (Uranium and Plutonium) to deal with, you don't have the waste heat problem, etc. You do get some neutron activation in the reactor housings and you do produce some stuff like Tritium, but overall it's much less dangerous. And also much easier to contain.</p>
<p>Even in a worst case scenario of something going wrong at a fusion plant you can't get a Chernobyl or Fukushima type disaster, nor even something on the scale of Three Mile Island.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
