		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because Windows forbids it. There is no technical problem with allowing it, and in fact other OS'es generally do allow it.</p>
<p>Windows uses a policy of locking files when an application is accessing them, which means they cannot be deleted or (depending on the type of lock) renamed.</p>
<p>The reason Windows does this is (probably) to keep things simple and understandable from the user's point of view. What would happen if you deleted a file while an application was in the middle of reading from it? In particular, what would the application see? Would it be able to continue reading? Would it get some kind of error that it then had to handle?</p>
<p>From a technical point of view, the answer is simple (the application would still hold a reference to the file, so it could continue to read and write the file as if nothing had happened), but from the user's point of view, Microsoft has chosen not to allow it.</p>
<p>But these are policy decisions, not technical limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:  </strong></p>
<p>To be clear, my explanation of <em>why</em> Microsoft has chosen this behavior is based on guesswork and half remembered blog posts by Microsoft engineers. Another plausible reason that comments have brought up is simply backwards compatibility. 30 years ago, DOS was created to behave this way (and that was perhaps just because it seemed the simpler way to do it back then), and it is possible that Windows has retained this behavior <em>solely</em> to preserve backwards compatibility. My guess is that both are factors. They certainly don't want to break backwards compatibility unnecessarily, but they also have a long record of introducing new functionality on an opt-in basis so that legacy applications aren't affected, and they could have done something similar if they wanted to allow renaming of open files if the thought it was a desirable feature.</p>
<p>Regardless of the motivation for this behavior, it is a fact that the Windows kernel does support everything needed to allow you to rename or otherwise modify a file while it's open.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can. (Linux)</p>
<p>If, for example, I open a handle to a file and then move said file (eg here), it works like you might expect, I keep writing to the new file after the move: <a href="https://pastebin.com/G3gb03u8" target="_blank">https://pastebin.com/G3gb03u8</a></p>
<p>However, bear in mind that this very much depends on <em>the program in question handles files</em>. For example, if I edit a file in <code>vim</code>, rename it (<code>mv</code>) and then save-quit, I get the unedited file under the new name, and the edited file under the old name. This is presumably because <code>vim</code> (a text editor) isn't maintaining a constant handle to the file. So unless you actually know how the program in question you're using works, it's risky business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we say we are &quot;opening&quot; a file, this could actually mean a couple different things depending on the application. The two primary operations we do with files is read and write. Compare this to filling out a form, or doing a homework assignment. Most of the time, you have to read some info on the form, such as a question, and then write something down onto it and then continue reading. Some applications will work the same way, they need to be constantly reading and writing to a file. Some programs (but not all) that do this will put what's called a &quot;lock&quot; on that file. Its like if you were in a group project and said &quot;I'm going to write by myself, because if we did it at the same time, we would get in each other's way&quot;.</p>
<p>Now on the other hand, think about if you were reading a book, or if your homework had an instruction sheet that didn't need any writing. It would be fairly easy to share with someone else. They could read over your shoulder or sit next to you at the table. You'd both be getting the same information, because neither of you is changing it. Applications can work like this as well. When they start, they'll do a preliminary read of the file, and forgoe locking altogether. Other applications can do the same thing at the same time.</p>
<p>As others have said, windows is a bit more strict on this for the sake of user experience. But it's not always the case, simple text editors won't always lock the file they have open, and will let other programs make changes. Therefore, having the file &quot;open in two programs&quot;. It all depends on what the application needs to do with the file.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>lots of explanations but initially was because using the filename as a primary key was faster and used less space</p>
<p>as CPU speed got faster and memory cheaper, developers started using a hidden index to refer to the file and the name would be a label - of course this leads to duplicate filenames</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
