		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're basically caused by a certain kind of skin cell called a melanocyte, which is responsible for giving you a tan by producing the pigment melanin. There's supposed to be one of these melanocytes for every ten 'normal' skin cells you have.</p>
<p>The exact cause of moles is pretty unclear, but when you're developing as a foetus, signalling molecules and how they're distributed determine quite a lot of characteristics that you'll have throughout life. One thing that happens if these signalling molecules aren't distributed evenly is that you get melanocytes replicating before they can be 'spaced out' properly. This leads to an overproduction of melanin in a small area and, through that, a mole.</p>
<p>The saying with moles is &quot;you aren't born with any; you don't die with any&quot;. This is because they migrate from the outer layers of the skin, where there is no reaction against them, to the inner layers of the skin, where your immune system recognises the cells as foreign and begins to pick them off at a low level. Hence by the time people are 55+, most of their moles have gone.</p>
<p>Edit: to clarify what seems to be a controversial point, when I say 'you aren't born with any; you don't die with any', this isn't an absolute rule. It refers to moles formed by melanocytes that go through the standard progression of Junctional&gt;Compound&gt; Intradermal naevus. This doesn't cover other, rarer forms of moles such as congenital naevi, which can be present from birth, nor does it cover other pigmented skin lesions which are often called moles (such as seborrheic keratosis- an extremely common lesion in elderly people with fair skin).</p>
<p>Overall, &quot;mole&quot; is a very ambiguous term that isn't used officially within medicine, but is most commonly used when referring to melanocytic naevi, and that's what I've geared my answer towards on here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moles occur when cells in the skin grow in a cluster instead of being spread throughout the skin. These cells are called melanocytes, and they make the pigment that gives skin its natural color. Moles may darken after exposure to the sun, during the teen years, and during pregnancy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
