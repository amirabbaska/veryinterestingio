		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bananas contain potassium-40 (^(40)K), which decays <a href="http://inspirehep.net/record/1191882/files/K40_decay_scheme.png" target="_blank">like so</a>. So about 10% of the time, ^(40)K will emit a 1460 keV gamma ray. And to a lesser extent, you'll also get 511 keV gamma rays from annihilation of the positrons produced by pair production and the beta^(+) decay of ^(40)K. The primary decay branch is beta^(-) directly to the ground state of ^(40)Ca, but these betas don't penetrate very far through matter.</p>
<p>So the only substantial dose you'd receive by standing in a room full of bananas would come from the gammas.</p>
<p>If you consider the fraction of the banana that's made of potassium, and consider the fraction of natural potassium which is potassium-40, you'll come to the conclusion that you need a <strong>huge</strong> number of bananas to get an appreciable dose rate. Then you also have to think about how the bananas are arranged in the room and consider the fact that the if the gammas have to travel through a significant amount of material before they reach you, they will be attenuated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without a lot of technology,  you would die from alcohol poisoning long before, just by breathing the fumes of fermenting banana.  The quantity is the problem...</p>
<p>Even if we assume the sketchy math on dose/banana is correct, you need to be in a room with at least 40 million of them.</p>
<p>Average banana weighs 120 g, so you need 4.8 million Kg, or 4,800 metric tons.  According to <a href="http://www.naturskyddsforeningen.se/sites/default/files/dokument-media/banana_report_final_version.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.naturskyddsforeningen.se/sites/default/files/dokument-media/banana_report_final_version.pdf</a> this is about 1/4 [ of 1/1000] the annual world exports of bananas.  </p>
<p>Edit: oops, 40 million bananas
Edit2 oops, x 1000</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radiation Sickness - No, you won't receive enough radiation, no matter how many bananas you pile up, because when the banana pile gets beyond a certain size, the radiation produced by the bananas at the back will be shielded and blocked by the bananas at the front, and Radiation Sickness is a &quot;deterministic effect&quot;, which means that severity of radiation sickness increases proportional to the amount of radiation you've received.</p>
<p>Cancer - Yes, you could get cancer from the banana radiation. The odds are extremely low, but Cancer is a &quot;stochastic effect&quot;, meaning that you either have it or you don't, but the odds of getting it increase proportional to the amount of radiation you've received. There is also a thing called the LNT hypothesis which complicates everything, because no one conclusively knows how very small doses of radiation affect people. The general consensus is that small doses (â‰¤ what we get from nature) have very little measurable effect on our health, good or bad. So, depending on the specifics of your hypothetical situation, such as exactly how radioactive your bananas are, and how you stack them, and whether or not they're peeled, you might have an increased risk of cancer or you might have a normal risk of cancer. Or you might have a lower-than-average risk because your immense banana-dome is shielding you from solar radiation. Hard to say.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Banana radioactivity comes from potassium-40 decay, which releases a 1.4 MeV Photon. By using NIST data I'll say that a gamma will travel roughly 30cm of water, lets assume banana's are 100% water. A banana is about 4cm thick.</p>
<p>So you would surround yourself in a sphere of banana's 30cm in radius, or 8 banana's in radius. That's about 1.1*10^5 cm^3 of banana surrounding you.</p>
<p>An average banana has a volume of 156 cm^3 . So you are surrounded by 705 banana's.</p>
<p>A banana has 0.358 g of potassium in it, which gives about 11 Bq (decays per second). So you are surrounded by 11*705 = 7755 Bq of radiation as an absolute maximum.</p>
<p>Under Japanese law, the government must remove mud radioactivity levels of more than 8,000 becquerels.</p>
<p>So you can't get radiation sickness from being surrounded by banana's</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
