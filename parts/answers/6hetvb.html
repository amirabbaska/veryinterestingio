		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Similar to how magnetic field lines give some indication of which way a dipole will orient at that location and how strongly, and electric field lines indicate the direction of force a positive charge would experience, gravitational field lines indicate the strength of gravitational force a mass would experience at a particular location. </p>
<p>In the case of the Earth, these gravitational field lines would point towards the center of the Earth, and converge(indicating more force) as a mass moves toward the surface.</p>
<p>Keep in mind these field lines are just visual depictions of the field. They aren't &quot;real&quot; in the way gravity is real, just representations.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Newton's theory of gravity, you can definitely define gravitational field lines. The reason they aren't used very much is that they aren't as useful as magnetic field lines are, for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Magnetic field lines can be seen directly. For instance, plasma is often frozen onto magnetic field lines, as in this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corona#/media/File:Traceimage.jpg" target="_blank">example on the Sun</a>. You can use a magnet to force iron filings to align with the magnetic field.  In contrast, the gravitational field is much less useful directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Newtonian gravity has no speed limit. There was never any need to use a field to transfer the force from one place to another, because Newtonian gravity is instantaneous. Note that electrostatics (Culomb's Law) is also instantaneous, so electric field lines were not invented until after magnetic field lines were invented.</p>
</li>
<li>(related to the second) There are no (Newtonian) gravitational waves. Fields become necessary (as opposed to just useful) when they carry significant energy independently of matter. Light is an electromagnetic wave which can only be understood classically in terms of a field. There are no free gravitational waves in Newtonian theory, because Newtonian gravity is instantaneous. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can think of gravity as having field lines, but there is still a big difference between gravitational field lines and magnetic ones, in that if you move a wire across the field lines of a magnetic field, a voltage is generated in that wire (which is how electrical generators work). No such effect occurs when moving anything across the lines of a gravitational field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A field is an area within which an object, with a certain characteristic, can feel a force. </p>
<p>For an electric field, the characteristic is charge and the lines point in the direction that a positive charge would travel. </p>
<p>For a gravitational field, the characteristic is mass and the lines point in the direction that a point mass would travel. </p>
<p>For a magnetic field, the characteristic is a moving charge and the lines point in the direction that a compass would point.</p>
<p>The strength of all these fields can be displayed by drawing more lines within a certain area. More lines means stronger field. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something to add to the other comments already here: Magnetic fields can store energy in their fields, and the upshot of this is that the field can sustain <em>tensional stress</em>. This makes it behave a lot more like a physical object than other fields. </p>
<p>When something like iron filings or a plasma is contained in the field, this makes the material seem like an elastic ribbon, moving under tension (e.g. as seen on the suns surface). It's important to realise that the material is just there because its stuck along the field, and the energy is driven by the static magnetic field storing and releasing tension. In the coronal arcades of the sun, the changing magnetic fields can release this the elastic tension and 'flick' plasma out as mass ejections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
