		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose I showed you an apple. It's red, it's shiny, it has an easily recognizable shape, and I've even taken the time to write &quot;APPLE&quot; across it in permanent marker.</p>
<p>Now, further suppose that after showing you the apple, I went into another room and dipped it in wood varnish. This coating wouldn't be enough to obscure any details, but the color would be a bit darker, the shine would be a bit more pronounced, and the word &quot;APPLE&quot; would be slightly blurred.</p>
<p>Would you still be able to recognize it?</p>
<p>Scent works in much the same manner for animals. We can mask it or alter it in ways that are pretty profound from a human perspective... but for a creature whose nose is literally 10,000 times better <em>at minimum</em>, perfumes, soaps, and deodorants do very, very little to mute our natural aromas.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Animals can recognize your scent in much the same way that you can recognize a friend wearing subtle makeup.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's like saying, &quot;I know you recognize people by sight, so how do you not get confused by different clothes and haircuts?&quot;</p>
<p>Perfume seems overpowering to us, because we don't rely on our sense of smell, but to an animal with a keen nose, it's just another part of the smell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A dog's dominant sense is smell.</p>
<p>In contrast, a humans dominant sense is sight.</p>
<p>When I was at USARPAC Basic Sentry Dog School, they told us that when a dog thinks of a place, he thinks of the way that it smells. In contrast, when a human thinks of a place, they think of the way that it looks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/nature/dogs-sense-of-smell.html" target="_blank">Dogs' sense of smell</a> overpowers our own by orders of magnitudeâ€”it's 10,000 to 100,000 times as acute, scientists say. &quot;Let's suppose they're just 10,000 times better,&quot; says James Walker, former director of the Sensory Research Institute at Florida State University, who, with several colleagues, came up with that jaw-dropping estimate during a rigorously designed, oft-cited study. &quot;If you make the analogy to vision, what you and I can see at a third of a mile, a dog could see more than 3,000 miles away and still see as well.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I heard it explained this way: if I put a bowl of chili in front of you, what you smell is chili.  If I put it in front of a dog he smells beef, paprika, tomatoes, garlic, etc.   That's because his nose is exponentially more sensitive <em>and</em> his brain has evolved to be able to discern scents.  So while your friend Kevin smells like AXE body spray to you, to a dog he smells like Kevin and AXE.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
