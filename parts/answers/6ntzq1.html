<p>It's just throwing numbers at you, so I just glanced at it, but meat consumption seems to be growing everywhere. World meat consumption is increasing like crazy, European meat consumption a little less, but still growing.</p>
<p>Is anyone from /r/dataisbeautiful around?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What &quot;growing % of the population avoiding meat consumption&quot; ? </p>
<p>Worldwide, the largest reason why people don't eat meat has always been (and still is) being too poor to afford it. As large parts of global population are getting out of poverty, they're starting to consume large amounts of meat - for example, the per capita (so, ignoring population growth) meat consumption in China has doubled in the last 25 years.</p>
<p>If anything, today the global % of meat-eaters is larger than ever before, simply because more people than ever can afford to eat it and not just the cheap staple crops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.worldwatch.org/global-meat-production-and-consumption-continue-rise" target="_blank">No.</a></p>
<p>For every member of the first world who decides to eschew meat, there is a population increase of much more than that.</p>
<p>Even discounting the population growth's effect on meat production, per capita the figure increases to grow.  Worldwide, per capita meat consumption increased from 41.3 kilograms in 2009 to 41.9 kilograms in 2010. (<a href="https://data.oecd.org/agroutput/meat-consumption.htm" target="_blank">Sources regarding this figure vary</a>)  So even if a growing percent of the population in your country/part of the world is avoiding meat consumption, the ones who are left more than make up the difference.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Percentage increase but also population increase. </p>
<p>For example, population of 1000. 10 percent don't eat meat. That means 900 people eat meat. Population increases to 1050, 11 percent don't eat meat. 934.5 people eat meat. </p>
<p>Over time the percentage of vegetarians may increase. But so does population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I wonder is, how little meat would each person need to consume to make a significant difference?  I'm a vegetarian myself, but I realize that it's impossible to get everyone on board with that.  But if people were to reduce their meat consumption, maybe it can do something.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
