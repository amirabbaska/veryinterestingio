		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fluoride binds into your enamel, rebuilding very mild wear and tear and making it stronger. That's why we have fluoride in our tap water.</p>
<p><a href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TyVV0UDQ_f4" target="_blank">SciShow</a> has the answers you seek.</p>
<p>TL;DR for the video: as bacteria eat sugar, they produce acid that dissolves your enamel. Fluoride binds to the byproducts of that reaction, creating a new compound that's reincorperated chemically into the enamel. But that only works as the enamel is being dissolved, so once it's gone, if you didn't fix it then, it can't be fixed. So it does rebuild enamel, slowly, and it's limited, and it does make your teeth stronger. The vast majority of toothpaste in western nations is going to have fluoride in it.</p>
<p>For those of you just joining us:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Nazis did not invent fluoridation, that's a <a href="http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2011/oct/06/critics-water-fluoridation/truth-about-fluoride-doesnt-include-nazi-myth/" target="_blank">myth</a>.  The first deliberate fluoridation began in Grand Rapids, MI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There <em>was</em> a Harvard study on naturally fluoridated water in China that suggested high concentrations may cause a drop in IQ over time in children, but it was inconclusive.  Their conclusion was that more studies were needed, and in any case the concentrations they were looking at were significantly higher than what you would find in deliberately fluoridated water.  That study can be found <a href="http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/1104912/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contrary to what my post implied, fluoridated water is apparently much less effective at treating tooth decay in adults than in children.  /u/carlsab has more information <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3zalyf/eli5_can_you_or_cant_you_rebuild_andor_strengthen/cykwcby" target="_blank">here</a>.  I offer that not as a rebuttal - water <em>is</em> still fluoridated to fight tooth decay.  But it's certainly a complicated process involving different kinds of applications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bottled water <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs/bottled_water.htm" target="_blank">probably still has fluoride in it</a>.  As do <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs/wellwater.htm#q3" target="_blank">wells</a>.  Fluoride occurs in water naturally.  In fact, tap water is likely to have significantly <em>less</em> fluoride in it than natural sources, depending on where you live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>/u/Czaer has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3zalyf/eli5_can_you_or_cant_you_rebuild_andor_strengthen/cykqzwk" target="_blank">very thorough</a> and more technical explanation.  You can find an even more technical explanation - complete with all the chemistry involved - <a href="http://www.dentalcare.com/en-US/dental-education/continuing-education/ce410/ce410.aspx?ModuleName=coursecontent&amp;PartID=2&amp;SectionID=1" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So yes or no?  The answer is yes, in a very limited, technically correct way.  It's a legal grey area where the product does what it says it does, but not what you are led to believe it says it does.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Topical vs ingested: During development, before the teeth erupt from the gums, fluoride is incorporated into the enamel.  However, ingesting fluoride after eruption still helps fight tooth decay.  Systemic fluoride is the fluoride ingested, usually via fluoridated water.  That water gets used throughout the body, including your saliva, where it becomes a constant topical source.  Information <a href="http://www.allianceforacavityfreefuture.org/en/us/technologies/systemic-fluorides#.VontWlK8Hao" target="_blank">here</a>.  So, yes, fluoridated water is still effective well into adulthood according to the research I've found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not a dentist, just a smart guy who knows things.  I'm getting a lot of technical questions, and I really wish I could answer them but I just don't know all the things!  There are a few dentists (and dental students) like /u/Lowstradamus leaving comments, hopefully they'll have better answers than me!</p>
</li>
<li>NovaMin is complicated, but the short version is that it does the same remineralization that happens naturally with calcium to reform the same hydroxylapatite normally found in your enamel. That means it's not as good as fluoride <em>per se</em>. However, the way it works delivers the reactants more efficiently, so you get more hydroxylapatite bang for your buck. Why isn't it available in the US? Marketing decision by the company, not a grand conspiracy by dentists. It's really not that impressive.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello GalaxyDelta9
The world of advertising can be quite confusing with health products because advertisements have to explain the science behind it so concisely that they may end up with something that sounds a bit skeptical. The words 'rebuilding' and 'strengthening' are words most of us can understand so advertisements use them, even if they aren't 100%.</p>
<p>I'll explain the science first. I am studying dentistry currently. Take heed in that; I am not a dentist yet, nor a scientist in the front-lines but part of my education involves understanding this basic concept of tooth maintenance.</p>
<p>Enamel is mostly inorganic. Nearly all of it is in a crystal form of calcium hydroxyapatite. Many many crystals make up the enamel. There is a tiny amount of protein and water but this is insignificant when we are talking about normal teeth and their maintenance. These crystals are very strong to deal with all the forces teeth have to handle when we bite and chew. Sadly the hydroxyapatite is liable to dissolving away with a sufficient acid exposure. When the hydroxyapatite dissolves with the acid the calcium is removed from the structure of the tooth. Hence we say acid exposure demineralises the tooth. This acid can be from your diet, from bacteria in your mouth, from stomach contents in the mouth (i.e. vomiting), and from the environment. Scientists have found that enamel will start demineralising when the pH is below 5.5. The pH of your mouth will drop below this value after you eat but only temporarily.</p>
<p>Why? because there are a number of processes in the body that reduce the rate of demineralisation. But in the modern age with its modern diet there is a need for us to help these processes to keep our teeth in good form.</p>
<p>Toothpaste has fluoride in it. Well most do (there is much heated debate over fluoride use and there are people that will not accept its advantages to health; and hence there is still a market for non-fluoride toothpaste). Fluoride does three things that protect the teeth; one is relevant to the 'rebuilding' or 'strengthening' claims. As I said before there are processes that defend the teeth. There are processes that reduce the amount of demineralising that occurs but there are also processes that remineralise what was lost. Simply speaking the building blocks for calcium hydroyapatite is present in saliva. When you are not demineralising you are remineralising at a small scale (sadly not enough to fend off tooth decay). When fluoride is present in the saliva and tooth surfaces then calcium hydroxyapatite is not made on the surface of the teeth - calcium fluoroapatite is made. The fluoride replaces a component of the hydroxapatite to make an altered crystal that is less liable to dissolving. What we find is that calcium fluoroapatite dissolves at a lower pH (3.5 I believe). This makes it more resistant to demineralising. In effect: the mouth has to be more acidic to lose the same amount of enamel as before.This is the reason why water fluoridation has its advantages. If the water you drink contains a little bit of fluoride you are increasing the exposure of fluoride on the teeth and promoting more calcium fluoroapatite being made. </p>
<p>This is where 'rebuilding' and 'strengthening' comes from. The toothpaste is providing the fluoride so I suppose it has claim to be rebuilding the tooth. And this 'rebuilding' makes the tooth more acid resistant or 'stronger'. Rebuilding and strengthening aren't necessarily the accurate words to use; but they are good words to use in a market where few know the science behind it.</p>
<p>As to why these claims are appearing these days but not years ago? It is hard to say but I would suggest it has something to do with the changing attitudes to oral health. Decades ago, going to the dentist meant getting fillings and having some teeth taken out. The elderly had full dentures and no teeth. Tooth decay was accepted as being something that happens as you age. These days people are taking better care of their teeth. Tooth loss is getting less accepted and more stigmatised (especially for the young and middle aged) and people are realising that keeping your teeth is expensive if you do not look after them. </p>
<p>TLDR: The rebuild and strengthening claims are true in toothpastes if you understand that companies take all the science mumbo jumbo and simplify it to concise claims words longs. These claims are also trying to sell the product rather than explain the science. This simplification reduces accuracy but sends the message across to the masses. We are seeing people more conscientious on their oral health these days which is giving companies more of an incentive to include these claims with their adverts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can strengthen what's there, yes. And some people call that &quot;rebuilding&quot;. But once it's gone, it's gone. It can be replaced by artificial means (that's kind of what a filling is) but your teeth won't naturally re-grow it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>After one dentist gave me a clean bill of health and another told me I had five cavities six months later, I did some research. </p>
<p>Your teeth are actually caught in a constant cycle of remineralization and demineralization. Acids demineralize the teeth. Namely, they dissolve calcium and phosphate ions. As other posters have said, sugars (and simple starches) are not inherently damaging to the teeth. However, they break down in the mouth almost immediately. Bacteria feed on these sugars and starches and produce lactic acid as a byproduct. This does result in demineralization.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our saliva contains calcium and phosphate ions. These ions remineralize our teeth. This is a major reason why people who have medical conditions that cause dry mouth are at a greater risk for tooth decay.Unfortunately, even in someone without dry mouth, demineralization can outpace remineralization, causing cavities.</p>
<p>Fluoride actually does not directly remineralize the tooth. It is helpful for a few other reasons: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It causes fluorapatite to be formed during remineralization of the teeth, as opposed to hydroxyapatite. Fluorapatite is less soluble than hydroxyapatite. Thus, the teeth are more resistant to future demineralization.</p>
</li>
<li>Fluoride enhances the ability of calcium and phosphate ions to come together and form calcium phosphate. This speeds up the remineralization process.</li>
</ol>
<p>So, if you take #1 and #2 combined, this is strengthening and rebuilding the enamel. This is probably what the toothpaste companies are referring to.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it has long been a goal of some to produce a calcium phosphate solution that the teeth would instantly take in, resulting in rapid remineralization. Of course, if dentists didn't make money from dental work, we would probably have something amazing by now. However, there is one product I know of that has been shown to remineralize teeth. It is called Novamin. It can work with fluoride to produce better results than either alone. </p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to find Novamin toothpaste in the U.S., but Sensodyne Repair and Protect from England does contain it, as well as fluoride. This is why I buy my toothpaste from England. </p>
<p>I also am very skeptical of dentists. Three out of four have told me teeth don't remineralize. Others have tried to sell me unnecessary oral cancer tests. Some dentists are more crooked than my teeth pre-braces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
