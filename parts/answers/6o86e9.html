		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is definitely possible. </p>
<p>First, a solid celestial body would have to enter the star's sphere of gravitational influence. Then, it would have to pass through the Roche limit. That's the distance where the tidal forces will rip the object apart. </p>
<p>If the object wasn't on a collision trajectory with the star before disentegration, then it will form a ring around the star.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you don't think the asteroid belt counts as a ring (it <em>is</em> the actual solar equivalent of having a ring), then not really. The reason it can't have a dense ring of small particles in very close proximity like Saturn is because of how stars are born. Once the accretion disc has built a body large enough to begin fusion, the star &quot;lights up&quot; and blows away the rest of the disc, except for things that are a combination of too far and too massive. This would be the planets and the asteroid belt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not.  Here's why:</p>
<p>The principle people are referring to so far is the Roche limit, the closest a planet can venture towards the body it's orbiting before the force of gravity on the front-facing side differs from the force of gravity on the rear-facing side by <em>so much</em> that it exceeds the gravitational self-attraction of the planet.  So now the net force of gravity is no longer attractive for that planet.  As most of the rocky bodies in the solar systems are merely loosely-held balls of gravel rather than hard spheres - notable exceptions being the 4 inner planets - these balls of gravel will just pull apart as they orbit.</p>
<p>In fact, we can calculate the Roche limit for the sun when orbited, by, say one of those loosely-packed balls of gravel, more of less.  Let's pick Ceres, the largest asteroid:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>d = 1.26 R<em><em>S</em></em> <em> ( ρ</em><em>S</em><em> / ρ</em><em>C</em>* )^1/3</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...where R<em><em>S</em></em> is the radius of the sun, and ρ<em><em>S</em></em> and ρ<em><em>C</em></em> are the densities of the sun &amp; Ceres, respectively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>d = 1.26 <em> 6.96 </em> 10^8 m <em> ( 1.41 / 2.16 )^1/3 = 7.61 </em> 10^8 m</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You see the problem?  For a body that is denser than the object it's orbiting, the Roche limit ends up being dreadfully close to the surface of the larger body.  In this case, the Roche limit's at 1.09 solar radii.  By comparison Mercury's orbit is about 100 solar radii away from the sun.</p>
<p>At that distance I would imagine several things would happen: First the planet would likely melt.  If it were torn apart by tidal forces then the little bits of rock and ice would likely melt, and/or vaporize.  In fact, we can calculate the thermodynamic equilibrium temperature at that distance:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>T<em><em>eq</em></em> = T<em><em>sun</em></em> <em> ( 1 - a )^0.25 </em> ( R<em><em>sun</em></em> / 2R<em><em>orbit</em></em> )^0.5</p>
<p>T<em><em>eq</em></em> = 5,770° K <em> ( 0.5 )^0.25 </em> ( 6.96 / 15.2 )^0.5 = 3,280° K</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's high enough that almost everything you're going to find in a rocky body is going to vaporize.  It's higher than the boiling points of Gold, Nickle, Iron, Chromium, and Copper.  So instead of forming a ring I would expect a body that close just to burn up and find it's bits &amp; pieces scattered to the (solar) winds, so to speak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would be much rarer and have shorter lifetimes, at least around actual stars (versus brown dwarfs). A ring forms inside the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roche_limit" target="_blank">roche limit</a> of an object, which is where tidal forces from the more massive object are larger than the object's own self-gravitation. This doesn't mean that objects break apart there necessarily, but it does mean that objects that are mostly held together by gravity can be easily disrupted. It's somewhat more challenging to get objects into mostly circular orbits inside the roche limit of a star than to a planet, but it is possible.</p>
<p>The bigger issue is radiation pressure. Dust, pebbles, and rocks in close orbit around a star will experience strong orbital dynamics perturbations due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting%E2%80%93Robertson_effect" target="_blank">Poynting-Robertson</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarkovsky_effect" target="_blank">Yarkovsky</a> effects. These will tend to deorbit or blow away most of the stuff in the ring at a much faster pace than if it were around an outer planet like Saturn, because the solar radiation flux is so much higher.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
