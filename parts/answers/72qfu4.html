		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who go hot and cold in relationships usually come on very strong during the &quot;hot&quot; phase. They will put a lot of effort into making you feel like you're special and wanted, so when they go cold you start to question of you did something to cause it. You think &quot;we'll they were so into me, they will feel that way again if I just x, y, z.&quot; Sometimes you'll think if you start putting in more effort, then you can draw them back in but that approach usually back fires. You stick around waiting for them to go back to how they were before, which the the hot/cold person expects. When they feel like giving you attention again, they know you'll be there. </p>
<p>Alternately, the person is scared of commitment and does believe the things they say in the hot phases but gets scared when they realize they're responsible for your needs and happiness. So they pull away out of fear. Either way the result is the same for the person on the receiving end of this behavior.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the old adage &quot;it feels good to be needed&quot; plays a role here.</p>
<p>As a species still heavily rooted in our primal desires, we see mates that are easier to attract as more viable mates strictly based on our confidence of a higher success rate.</p>
<p>Kind of like why people often go home with the &quot;wrong person&quot; from the bar...they're drunk, desperate, and are on the prowl for a mate. Alcohol/drug use makes it even worse because lowered inhibitions means not thinking things out far enough into the future to make proper decisions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Attachment disorder.  Your relationship patterns are created by your parents and your early relationships.</p>
<p>If a child doesn't get enough attention and love from a parent they will seek out similar partners.  They also watch to see how one parent gets love and attention from the other.  If the dad is dismissive to the mom and the mom just tries harder, the kids are very likely to repeat that pattern when they enter relationships.  </p>
<p>My favorite quote about this is &quot;if there are ten guys in a room all flirting with me and one that's ignoring me, that's the guy I want to date&quot;.  </p>
<p>They are interested in a guy who ignores them.</p>
<p>You can go on r/sex (except you're only five years old so don't do that) and see examples of this all the time.  Prople unhappy in relationships with an attentive and loving partner who get turned on by inattentive partners.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;emotionally unavailable&quot; I often used for this.  Married people, long distance relationships, addicts, or any way that unconsciously tells you that the person you're dating is not likely to get emotionally invested in you (even if they do TELL you they are, or will be) are more appealing to peoe with attachment issues. </p>
<p>One study found that women generally find married men to look more physically attractive.  Emotional unavailability literally makes the other person LOOK more attractive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
