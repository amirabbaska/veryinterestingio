		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I happen to be a semi-professional perfumer (or at least, I have fragrances available in real, live brick and mortar stores that people buy).  I can't tell you why they do commercials like they do, but I can tell you that even if they were to tell you what a fragrance smelled like, it wouldn't be particularly helpful. </p>
<p>If you look up &quot;fragrance notes,&quot; you can find a list of things that a particular fragrance is supposed to smell like...but they're mostly wrong.</p>
<p>Why is that?  Is seems pretty straightforward saying that a fragrance smells like violets and oranges and sandalwood, right?  Well...it's not really.  </p>
<p>Most of the ingredients in fragrances are things that people have never smelled on their own.  Some of the most common fragrance ingredients now (in everything from drugstore cheapies to $300/bottle niche fragrances) are aromachemicals.  If it doesn't smell like it was made in the 1920s, chances are it's 60-90% synthetic...and if it does, it's still probably 50% synthetic.  Here are some of the common ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iso E Super</li>
<li>Hedione</li>
<li>Coumarin (90%+ of all fragrances made in the last 100 years have this one)</li>
<li>Linalool</li>
<li>Galaxolide</li>
<li>Ambroxan</li>
<li>Hydroxycitronellal</li>
<li>Calone</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if they are using naturals, many of the commonly used ones in perfumery are uncommon outside of it, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>vetiver</li>
<li>oakmoss</li>
<li>clary sage (not the same as the sage in your kitchen)</li>
<li>benzoin</li>
<li>labdanum</li>
</ul>
<p>Since very few people outside of the fragrance industry have heard of these (much less smelled them on their own), they can't say that Cool Water smells like &quot;Calone, dihydromyrcenol, Evernyl, coumarin, etc&quot; instead they have to find things that the fragrance kind of smells like to list in the notes.</p>
<p>Hedione becomes jasmine.  Coumarin becomes tonka bean (which most people still haven't smelled). Calone becomes &quot;aquatic notes.&quot; </p>
<p>Remember how I mentioned violets and sandalwood?  Natural violet flower absolute oil (kind of like an essential oil...but extracted in a different way) hasn't been produced in large volumes in more than a century because it takes about a million flowers to get 1 kg of it...and then it doesn't even smell much like violets.  Instead, just about every violet flower scented thing you've ever smelled (and your grandma has ever smelled) came from a mixture of synthetic ionones.  This is not a new thing  The violet formula I use is from the 1940s.</p>
<p>Sandalwood was heavily overharvested and is very expensive now, so most sandalwood scents come from synthetic aromachemicals like javanol and ebanol and sandalore.  </p>
<p>Really, most of what makes a fragrance smell the way is smells are ingredients that almost no one has ever smelled by themselves and are only a little bit similar to things that people have actually smelled.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, even if they DID tell us precisely what it smelled like, it would mean nothing significant to a lot of people.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a fragrance description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>TOP</em>
Mint gives its explosive flavour to a surprising and unusual top note. Spearmint, peppermint and wild mint create an unexpected bouquet, its incredible freshness providing a stunning effect.</p>
<p><em>HEART</em>
The heart of the fragrance reveals the seductive power, introduced by citrus fruits. Like a crisp coating of ice, hibernal underlines these contrasts and prolongs the dialogue between icy crispness and sensual breath, giving the fragrance an almost unlimited life. </p>
<p><em>BASE</em>
The woody and distinguished character of vetiver from Haiti is both wet and dry, with fresh and hot nuances. This ambivalence creates a particular sensuality and vibrancy, very attractive on men's skin. Communicating self-confidence and charm, vetiver provides a very intimate comfort. Ginger from Nigeria illuminates the base note and brings a crackling and woody vibrancy.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a description for <strong>Armani Code Sport</strong>. </p>
<p>My boyfriend wears that cologne. I <em>know</em> what it smells like. I smell it all the time! I love that cologne, and I love it on him. </p>
<p>But if I read/heard that description without knowing which cologne it's referring to, I would never say, <em>&quot;Oh, hey, that's totally what my guy wears!&quot;</em> It wouldn't even register that I knew it at all. If I can't match a description to a cologne I know intimately, there's really no way a commercial describing a fragrance I've never smelled would impart any useful information to me whatsoever. I'd still have no earthly idea what it smells like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you sell a scent? The fact is most of the perfumes and colognes are owned by just a couple companies. I know this because I once worked on ad campaigns for one of them. BTW, as someone who is passionate about good advertising, I hated it! We had at least three meetings to discuss how much hair our model should have on his chest, and another to discuss the kind of rope to use on the yacht. I'm not saying that I don't appreciate the details, and that these things aren't important, but going home each night my eyes hurt from all of the rolling. I just didn't care. It wasn't for me.</p>
<p>To get back to your question, scents are just mixes of chemicals. There isn't anything there to own so it's 100% branding. If it's done well then you connect with it and you buy it. if it isn't done well it looks disingenuous and tacky. Or, maybe you were never part of the intended audience to begin with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nephew of Freud, Edward Bernays, was one of  the founders of modern advertising. He realized that it was possible to circumvent the intellect using psychological insight. Bernays understood, as did Pavlov in his experiments with dogs, that we can make arbitrary associations between two things. So, perfumes, for, example are sold almost entirely based on the qualities they give to a person who wears them (e.g., a cologne for todayâ€™s modern man), rather than on the actual content of the product. </p>
<p>This ability to make arbitrary associations is also why you've seen companies' names change from things like Ford (named after the inventor) to more abstract concepts like Amazon, Apple, Blackberry, Bonobos, Casper, etc. Colognes are never called Fir Tree or Woodsy--they have names like Excite, Anarchy, etc. (just Googled Axe's fragrances to find those).</p>
<p>There are people who study what emotions certain sounds evoke, and so you can make a name that has nothing to do with the actual product that evokes certain feelings and connect the feeling and the product. The /i/ (&quot;ee&quot;) sound for example is thought to be a more feminine sound. Words that start with &quot;br&quot; tend to be thought of as strong.</p>
<p>The other thing is that you are able to tell us what was in the commercial: a man giving certain looks, music that seemed out of place, and a French name. All of that is likely purposeful. We tune out most of the information around us, but you tuned into this. So something that is jarring, out of place, or emotional can grab your attention. If they gave you just pure information about which essential oils the cologne contains you might tune it out.</p>
<p>The fact that all advertisers do the same thing probably means that it works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
