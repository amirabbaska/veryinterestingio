		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Silanes are the direct analogue of alkanes, with silicon replacing carbon. They are less stable than alkanes though, especially as the chain gets longer.</p>
<p>Silicon can form many polymers, but the most common ones have oxygen in the chain - those are known as silicones.</p>
<p>Polysilanes are like the silanes except longer and with organic side groups. And those have a tin analogue, the polystannanes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not as well. The heavier elements in the carbon have more electron shells, which makes them occupy more volume in a molecule and form weaker bonds with other atoms. Carbon is 'small,' allowing it to form stronger bonds and fit into more densely-packed molecules (density in the sense of total atoms within a given volume - not to be confused with density in the conventional sense of total mass within a given volume). The more massive members of the carbon group are poorer at this. Silicon can still form alkane analogues (known as group-14 hydrides) and polymers, Germanium can do so to a lesser extent, and Tin can only form two known group-14 hydrides (stannane and distannane). Plumbane (PbH4) is known but only in trace amounts.</p>
<p>So the short answer is yes, the other Carbon group atoms can form chains, but not as well. The heavier the element in the group, the shorter the maximum chain length it can form.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
