		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you are confronted with a stressful event, your brain anticipates the energy and focus for the event. It's gonna stimulate or slow different systems in your body. In stressful situations (good or bad), you are gonna use your accelerator (sympathetic system) and pump more blood, breathe more oxygen, get more focus and make your muscles more reactive. This is you, bracing and getting ready to get through the event.</p>
<p>In an anxiety disorder, you have your foot constantly on the accelerator. Any situation can become stressful by the way your brain analyse it and adjust to it. Your brain perceives danger in a non-threatening situation or over stimulate in stressful events. This is what happens when you have a panic attack, your body responds excessively to stress.</p>
<p>Antidepressants regulate some pathways of this nervous system. It forces the accumulation of certain chemicals in your brain so these nervous pathways are not constantly stimulated. It may help to manage the disorder better.</p>
<p>Edit: Grammar, better phrasing. For all the redditors going through anxiety and/or depression: you are strong and resilient, you can adapt to everything. What you feel is temporary, nothing lasts, you are not defined by your diagnosis. Your doctor loves you, has seen you distressed and prescribed you antidepressants and/or anxiolytics to help you get through. If your symptoms or depression longers for way too long or you have difficulty to manage it, please seek help, please see a psychologist/counsellor/GP/psychiatrist. You'll be amazed by what you are capable to overcome. We love you.</p>
<p>To respond to some questions and stays in an ELI5:</p>
<p>Anxiety is your physiologic response to a stressful event. A disorder is a maladaptive response to what we consider the norm. When you have an anxiety disorder, you chronically react too much or have difficulty to come back to a normal state.</p>
<p>Anxiolytics (for benzodiazepines, most commonly used) work on your central nervous system by making your neurons less excitable, this is extremely useful to calm you down during a panic attack or in prevention when you have to confront a stressful event. Your muscles respond less to the accelerator, your heart calms down, you breathe slower, your muscles relax. Unfortunately, this is highly addictive and just treat your physical symptoms.</p>
<p>Depression is a low mood state, a temporary inability to feel excited or joy. It is normal to feel that way. What we consider not normal it's when this state last for more than 6 months or is accompanied with worthless feelings and/or suicidal thoughts. Your antidepressants medications will help you having more good feeling molecules in your brain, helping you a get through the rough events you are going through. However, this takes time to have an effect and this will make your brain produce or recapture less of these molecules (this is why you need progressive withdrawal and develop tolerance).</p>
<p>Depression and anxiety are commonly seen together. A lot of anxious persons develops depression states or juggle with both disorders. We do not know exactly all the mechanisms, different theories going on. Same with medications, we know half the exact mechanisms of very common molecules on our nervous system. That is why it seems off to put people on antidepressants with chronic pain or anxiety, but we do know there is an effect on the nervous system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Antidepressants and antianxiety meds work by altering the availability of certain chemicals in the brain, primarily serotonin and dopamine. They do this through chemical action on brain receptors and cells, usually preventing the reabsorption of the chemicals once released, thus increasing their availability.</p>
<p>Serotonin and dopamine have roles that play a part in both mood and anxiety levels, so they often work for both mental health conditions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a long-term patient/sufferer of a severe/chronic anxiety disorder (panic w/agoraphobia, which I assume is based on GAD because it's been so many years but I dunno).</p>
<p>I like understanding things so have asked lots of questions of my doctors and done lots of research. The following is according to my understanding, although as described, I'm not in a position to call myself an expert.</p>
<p><strong>What exactly is an anxiety disorder?</strong></p>
<p>This question has two potential meanings: When do we consider anxiety a disorder? And, what causes anxiety disorders? So I'm going to broach both.</p>
<p><strong>When do we consider anxiety a disorder?</strong></p>
<p>Anxiety disorders are not singular entities. It is not a fact that you either have or do not have one in the same way as you can either have or not have a cold. There is not a single pathogen, or single physical issue, or anything we can objectively see on a scan or in a blood test that can tell us whether you do or don't have a disorder. </p>
<p>Instead, anxiety disorders are classified according to clusters of symptoms. The main 'symptom' of any mood disorder is that the mood (whether anxiety, depression, whatever) causes significant distress and dysfunction. So if you're 'a worrier' but it doesn't really bother you and it doesn't mess with your life at all, then depending on country (the US seems to enjoy pathologising from what I see/hear...) a psych is going to be reticent to call that a disorder. Generally, it's only considered a disorder if it's actually causing you pain and holding you back in life. (As an aside, this is not true for ego-syntonic disorders like personality disorders and some cases of eating disorders - e.g. people with anorexia often claim to 'choose' their disorder and do not consider it a 'bad' thing - but when it comes to mood disorders like anxiety, suffering and dysfunction are key).</p>
<p>As for the different 'types' of mood disorders, the lines are really just drawn in the sand. That's why many people have a long list of 'disorders', because there's significant overlap and you can fit into many categories at once. People with GAD often experience OCD features. Most people with GAD also have social anxiety. People with panic disorder often have GAD. Most agoraphobics have panic disorder. Most people with anxiety have depression and vice versa. This is because we're not dealing with a specific disease entity here, these labels just describe which symptoms you're experiencing at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>What causes an anxiety disorder?</strong></p>
<p>No one knows exactly. There are many theories. These span genetics, neurochemistry, and social and environmental factors (such as how you were brought up). It is generally accepted that the cause is <em>probably</em>, a bit of all of these things, but treatment normally focuses on changes thoughts and behaviours that you have learned in childhood (which have been shown to be a significant factor in either causing or perpetuating anxiety), or changing neurochemistry with antidepressants. Even when it comes to medication, most people agree that antidepressants aren't the 'cure', personal change through therapy is the more sustainable way to recover. Antidepressants are generally seen as a way to stabilise mood so that one can make necessary changes to themselves/their lives to reduce overall stress.</p>
<p><strong>How is this linked to the sympathetic nervous system?</strong></p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system is activated under stress regardless of whether you have an anxiety disorder or not. The physical symptoms of an anxiety disorder are experienced by everybody under stress, but they tend to be worse with an anxiety disorder simply because you experience them more severely and more often. </p>
<p>The sympathetic nervous system governs your fight/flight response. Under stress, all human bodies will go into 'turbo mode' and start prioritising all the systems needed to help you flee danger or fight it. Your blood is directed to your muscles and away from your digestive system and skin. So you get pale/blanched skin; nausea; diarrhoea; vomiting; IBS etc. You breathe faster and your heart beats faster to get super oxygenated blood to your muscles to help them move more quickly. So you feel dizzy, faint, and get heart palpitations and sometimes chest pain (which is actually just muscle pain). With so much energy sent to them and a sudden desire to move, move, fucking move; your muscles tense up in readiness. So you get aches and pains all over your body. You also sweat to cool you down during your flight/fight. </p>
<p>So, like I say, everybody gets these symptoms to varying degrees when nervous/anxiety/stressed. But in an anxiety disorder your body is constantly reacting like this and your body isn't really made to be in turbo mode all the time, so you get additional symptoms -exhaustion, fatigue, confusion, brain fog, insomnia etc. Essentially, your body is just <em>knackered</em> and it's struggling because it's being pushed so hard.</p>
<p><strong>Why do antidepressants work on anxiety?</strong></p>
<p>No one knows. No one knows why antidepressants work on depression either. They also don't always work, but there's no good way of seeing who they will work for and who they won't. Many people find no benefit from medication; many others find enormous benefit from medication. </p>
<p>Some people believe that this may be because of a chemical imbalance in the brain; but another way of seeing it would be that when you are depressed/anxious, your brain creates/reuptakes different neurotransmitters in different amounts. What are depression/anxiety anyway in the physical sphere except a brain process? So it could be that by artificially disrupting the brain process that is triggered by stress/danger, you can reverse engineer the situation so that you 'trick' the brain into behaving as if it isn't under stress/danger. </p>
<p>This is already an overlong response so I will stop there. Hope it went some way to answering your question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people will take SSRIs for only a period of time until their anxiety has settled, but to have an anxiety disorder, its a chronic imbalance. This can cause everything from stomach problems to pain, overwhelming fear, and so on. My neurologist did a good job of reminding me that when you get embarrassed, you blush, meaning that the blood vessels in your cheeks actually expand. This is just a little explaination of the effect that the hormones which control your &quot;feelings&quot; can affect your physical self.
I know this isn't exactly answering the rest of your question (cause it's already been answered), but that is really what anxiety is. An imbalance of chemicals in your brain. So any pain or nausea that comes with it, isn't someone being &quot;crazy&quot; it's a very real pain.
I just went through 6 doctors to find out why I've been having overwhelming pain, tremors, nausea, fatigue, vertigo (and so on),and two years and many ER visits, mris, ct scans, xrays, and LOTS of blood tested, I am diagnosed with PTSD. Turns out that the back of my mind is still processing things that have occured, even if the part of my mind which I can control, feels accepting of the trauma.
(This means that I have hormones running through me that are causing damage to my body) the mind is so very weird. I've been on anxiety meds for about 5 years already, and I'm soon going to be on other meds to help with the current situation.
I hope this helps to explain anxiety and stress disorders more. I have a genetic anxiety disorder and a stress disorder brought on by trauma. It's crazy stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic/anxiety sufferer here. I see anxiety/panic attacks on a daily basis, and I have a general script I use to crudely explain/understand them.</p>
<p>The &quot;Fight or Flight&quot; aspect of your nervous system is a highly evolved survival mechanism. The ability to instantly put your body in a ready state to deal with life threats has been a key factor in animal development. However, humans have two traits which have complicated this mechanism.</p>
<p>The first is higher brain function. We can form complex thoughts, thus materializing threats and confusing or overloading the reflex. Our ancestors risked becoming the prey of larger carnivores, whereas modern man risks unemployment or losing a parking space....yet our brains perceive those threats similarly.</p>
<p>The second is our domain over our environment. We've eliminated large carnivores from the equation. Similarly we've shaped our terrain into (mostly) harmless cities, suburbs, farms etc. Shelter protects us from all but the most extreme weather events. Science has uncovered the mystery of disease. Simply put, the lack of consistent life threatening stimuli has possibly de-calibrated the sympathetic nervous system slightly. (much like some experts suspect &quot;germophobic&quot; people have a higher chance to develop allergies due to lack of immune system exposures.) </p>
<p>I hope this helps in some respect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
