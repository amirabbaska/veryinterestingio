		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the drug reference guide that I use (it's subscription based and commonly used in hospitals): acute overdose of melatonin is not expected to result in significant clinical toxicity. Adverse effects are expected to be related to cns depression related (lethargy, confusion, headache. hallucinations are possible). Says hypothermia and slowed heart rate have been reported. Didn't mention deaths so I'm assuming either none have been reported or it's extremely rare.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
