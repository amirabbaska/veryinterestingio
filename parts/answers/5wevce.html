		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A motor spinning a disk with a hole near the rim.   The hole passes in front of a light.  Light travels out to a distant mirror and back to the disk.  The disk has continued to turn and the hole is now in front of a telescope.  Adjust the distance between the light and the telescope until you can see the light when looking thru the scope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One simple way would be to use an old microwave and something you can melt, like a chocolate bar or a bunch of marshmallows. <a href="http://www.planet-science.com/categories/over-11s/physics-is-fun!/2012/01/measure-the-speed-of-light-using-chocolate.aspx" target="_blank">This article</a> gives a good practical description of how to set up such an experiment. The key idea is that the distance between the melted spots, combined with the known frequency of your microwave should give you a way to get a rough estimate of the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwave, marshmallows, and a lasagna dish. Take out rotating plater in microwave, pop in lasagna dish lined with marshmallows, turn on microwave until the marshmallows start to expand in spots. Measure the distance between the centers of the expansion spots (should be around 12 cm). Multiply that distance by the frequency of the microwave magnetron (2.45 GHz). </p>
<p>Boom, speed of light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historically, Galileo measured the speed of light, and the answer he got was, &quot;it goes really fast&quot;.   There are lots of relatively easy experiments that will work to get you that result.  (Basically, anything that makes a loud noise and can be seen from far away.)</p>
<p>That's (pretty much) the big challenge with measuring the speed of light:  Because light goes so fast, you need very precise timing or pretty long distances.   For example, Fizeau's experiment involved bouncing light back and forth about 5 miles, and the time interval is still a few hundred-thousandths of a second.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
