<p>On another note, what are the most common cognitive disabilities you find in dogs? Do they depend on breed (i.e. a Dalmatian vs. a Husky)? If someone is caring for a dog with a cognitive disability, what are the necessary steps they should take to ensure their dogs life is still enjoyable?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
