		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain activity can be measured in waves, these waves are measured by an EEG. When we are awake and active, our brain produces beta waves. When we are deeply relaxed but still awake, we produced alpha waves. Theta waves define the first sleep stage. You could say that you could base the moment you fall asleep on the appearance of theta waves. Stage 1 and 2 have them, if you woke somebody up in these stages they may say they weren't even asleep yet, you've probably experienced that feeling before. Stages 3 and 4 become deeper sleeps and the brain produces delta waves. These are the longest waves and signals a deep dreamless sleep. After you move through stages 1 to 2 to 3 to 4, a person generally goes back through the stages backwards except instead of stage 1 they go into what's called REM sleep. REM stands for rapid eye movement and that is what characterizes this sleep stage, you may have witnessed this in someone else. This is the stage where you will dream. This whole cycle takes about 90 min. You will continue cycling though the stages this way but REM stage will get longer and the time you spend in stage 3 and 4 will get shorter as the cycles go by. </p>
<p>I apologize if this is messy, I'm exhausted and on my phone. Looking forward to cycling through these stages myself in a moment </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Falling asleep is a gradual process where brain activity across many different areas of the brain slowly shift into sleep over many minutes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called the Hypnagogic State</p>
<p>Fun fact: It's where Salvador Dali claimed to get a lot of his inspiration from. He'd try and paint in this state. </p>
<p>&quot;Hypnagogia is the experience of the transitional state from wakefulness to sleep: the hypnagogic state of consciousness, during the onset of sleep. Mental phenomena that occur during this &quot;threshold consciousness&quot; phase include lucid thought, lucid dreaming, hallucinations, and sleep paralysis.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
