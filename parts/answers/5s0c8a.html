		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>Tylenol/paracetamol is not an NSAID</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long term use of NSAIDs has been shown to lead to an increased incidence of non-union in orthopedic surgery so many/most orthos limit NSAID use to a few days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is some low-level evidence that NSAIDs IMPROVE outcome in hypothermic sepsis</p>
</li>
<li>As with everything else in medicine we know very little.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: based on commentary I want to clarify that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3259713/" target="_blank">the data for point two is poor</a>, mostly in animals, and taken as an article of faith by many orthopods who are very serious about it and make trauma rounds a daily argument. But it's getting better.</p>
<p>Edit #2: Non-union means that the fracture fails to heal</p>
<p>Edit #3: Tylenol is a weak COX-2 inhibitor and therefore has anti-inflammatory effects and multiple commenters have argued that it is, in fact an NSAID. I would argue that it does not share most of the clinical characteristics that people lump under &quot;NSAID&quot; and therefore to most clinicians it is in a separate category. For example, its pain control mechanism is different, in clinical use it is not ulcerogenic or nephrotoxic, it has no platelet effect and it is hepatotoxic. It can be used at the same time as classic NSAIDs with no decrease in dose necessary in either medication. </p>
<p>Edit #4: Thanks for the gold and I appreciate the discussion and education.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yes, inflammatory mediators are there for a reason, inflammation is the method the body uses to repair damage and fight infection.  Hindering the COX 1,2 enzymes (as NSAIDS do) will slow down recovery times. The question is however how measureable a difference there is. </p>
<p>Here's a link to a study that might help to answer your further questions:  <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081099/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3081099/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hold on - paracetamol (acetaminophen aka Tylenol) is not an NSAID. I get what your are saying though; it IS an ANTIPYRETIC (brings fever down ) as well as a pain reliever...  Important because in general NSAIDs are anti-inflammatory (acetaminophen isn't) and can make you more prone to bleeding (acetaminophen doesn't).

<p>Paracetamol isn't an NSAID, but no, the HEAT study showed no affect on mortality* for patients with severe infection - <a href="http://www.wessexics.com/The_Bottom_Line/Review/?id=7257804966227311886" target="_blank">http://www.wessexics.com/The_Bottom_Line/Review/?id=7257804966227311886</a> </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Allow to explain few immunological concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inflammation is an immune response tissue damage whether to infection, autoimmune (Lupus for example), burns, radiation injury, and chemical exposure. the list goes on but im gonna keep it short.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Infection is the presence of invasive pathogen as in bacteria, parasite, fungi that entered the body, it could be localized infection causing an abscess, more invasive causing, for example, narcotizing fasciitis, or in the blood stream causing septicemia.</li>
</ul>
<p>Paracetamol isnt a NSAID, it possesses analgesic effect but little anti-inflammatory properties so it wont actually affect the immune response to inflammation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, NSAIDs (Ibuprofen, Naproxen, etc) will inhibit COX (cyclo-oxygenase) enzyme which utilizes Arachidonic Acid to produce prostaglandins and leukotriens, both are potent inflammatory mediators. These two agents will promote an immune response called chemotaxis which attracts immune cells to site of inflammation. So, NSAIDs could reduce or influence the immune response but not completely stop it.</p>
