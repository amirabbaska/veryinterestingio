		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So.    My sister in law works for a company that does this type of work.   When someone “goes viral” her boss calls them and sees if they have representation.   Then they set them up a YouTube channel or other social media (not sure on this part)     They basically work like attorneys who are on commission.  If they can get money funneling to you they get a cut. </p>
<p>They also work with nightclubs and malls /stores and television news agencies to charge those people for appearances.   </p>
<p>So if Ellen heard about your video this company’s job is to get to you before Ellen’s people do so try can negotiate the fees for appearance. </p>
<p>So basically you make money off ads, appearances, selling video rights, and hopefully future videos or social media </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My wife's picture went viral last year (&quot;Angry Splash Mountain Lady&quot;) We didn't make any money off of it, but we did get a few phone calls and emails from some folks.  We had a few minor TV appearances, but we didn't get paid for them.  We did talk to a producer from &quot;Ellen&quot; when the whole thing happened in March of 2016.  They were really nice and we had a Skype convo, but nothing else ever came of it. Visit Orlando was nice enough to fly us and our family down for a weekend so we could have a &quot;re-do&quot; pic where I rode with her.  Every now and then, we'll get an email about it and we talk about our story a bit.  We've never made any money, but we got the chance to talk about kidney transplants, dialysis and organ donation a lot, which is pretty important to us.  10/10 would do it again!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>in short?  merchandising.  People love a shit show, someone who's just too big, too crazy, too <em>much</em> to be real...</p>
<p>They also like people who are super lucky (right place at the right time) or the opposite.  </p>
<p>Once a great many people notice you, you have a certain worth, a certain value, if only of the novelty sort.</p>
<p>But someone who is smart, who has some business savvy and knows how people think, can snatch up this individual who is having their fifteen minutes of fame and stretch it out real thin (but so thin people can see though it, oh no!) so that it lasts a bit longer.  </p>
<p>People also believe that lightning strikes twice.  Don't believe me?  check out how many people continue to play the lottery even after they've won even top dollar prizes.  </p>
<p>Regular people: they buy into this cult of personality that the meme now represents.  they want to be &quot;in at the ground floor,&quot; so to speak.</p>
<p>And show producers, networks, the music industry- they don't see a meme- they see a walking dollar sign that currently holds the admiration, revulsion, or ironic disdain of an enormous base of consumers.</p>
<p>And so, we have rapping cash me ousside girl, and HIDE YOU WIFE T-shirts, and...well, just search the top threads of all time for reddit.  There's probably merchandise out there for more than half of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a YouTube video for example. Once a YouTuber gets enough subscribers and views on their videos, they have the option to enable ads. Have you ever seen an ad on a video? Yes, those are the ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What happens is that companies makes ads and pays YouTube to show them on their websites (and videos). When a video is posted, you can enable ads to show on the videos. When a viewer clicks the ad, the creator of the YouTuber will get a certain amount of money, and YouTube itself will get a certain amount of money. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In essence, the companies make the ad...pays YouTube to show them...viewers click on the ads....YouTube shares a small commission to the creator of the videos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a person has a large instagram following, they can get paid big money to post a picture of a product on their feed. Same for FB. Conor McGregor does this pretty regularly - he was pushing toothpaste a few days before the recent fight. It was literally the worst ad you've ever seen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
