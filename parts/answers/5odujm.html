		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When studying the ISM (interstellar medium) we typically make broad assumptions for the number of atoms per unit volume in a certain region of space. The &quot;cold ISM,&quot; aka &quot;empty&quot; space typically contains like 10-100 atoms per cubic centimeter. Denser regions, like planetary nebulae and AGN, can have 1,000-100,000 atoms per cubic cm---this type of high-density is incredibly easy for us to detect with instrumentation, but if you were somehow wandering through it with your bare skin, you'd have no idea there was any actual substance there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The consistency of outer space is close to nothing compared with Earth. You can't flap a wing and it do anything. Does it feel empty? depending on where you are floating say in your space suit it would feel rather disorientating, you might be very slowly rotating. You would certainly see stars around, although as soon as you face the sun it would be pretty blinding, your eyes would take a bit to adjust and so you would see mostly blackness around. </p>
<p>Plasma in space are usually around stars ( or planets with magnetic fields) or star forming regions. The reason we see them is mostly due to long exposures in astrophotography. And remember that often a nebula is several hundred light years across so we are seeing an accumulation of light from a huge amount but spread out over a vast distance. </p>
<p>If you ended up in a region between two galaxies space might appear a bit darker, though if you had some binoculars would be able to make out other galaxies around you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing to understand is that there are no absolute physical boundaries marking what is and is not &quot;outer space.&quot;  The density of matter and energy, as well as the chemical proportions of matter, just changes from place to place across the universe.</p>
<p>We arbitrarily say that space begins (with respect to Earth) at something called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C3%A1rm%C3%A1n_line" target="_blank">Kármán line</a>, at 100 km above sea level because this is a convenient number and the density of atmospheric gases is quite low by that altitude.</p>
<p>Similarly arbitrary points would denote where space ends and the Martian atmosphere begins, or the stellar corona, or the beginning of interstellar space, or what have you.  This is not to say that these points have no physical basis - the heliopause, for instance, is roughly wherever the solar wind and interstellar wind are in balance - but these are not absolute locations, but rather vague statistical regions.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the universe is completely devoid of matter/energy, so it just changes as you go.  If you encounter a solid object, the densities and compositions change very quickly, but even then the change is not instantaneous from one microscopic location to another - there are atoms constantly in motion, being blasted off of a solid surface by impacts from particles in the stellar and interstellar particle flux.  </p>
<p>This is what is meant when researchers say that a body otherwise in vacuum like Mercury or Pluto has an &quot;atmosphere.&quot;  They don't mean there is any practically significant amount of gas around it that you would experience, but simply that there is some small amount of molecules that linger in a gaseous form near the object.  </p>
<p>The amounts never go to zero as you get farther away, the numerical density just decreases until it meets another environment where it increases again.  If you were to travel from the surface of Mercury to the surface of Earth, the density of (for instance) oxygen would go from some small number and keep decreasing over the space between until it came close to Earth, then start increasing more and more until it was very high at Earth.</p>
<p>As to what space <em>is</em>, that's a deeper matter that delves into quantum theories and various alternative models (etc.).  One thing that has been observed is that &quot;empty&quot; space - lacking in massed particles - is not in fact empty, but rather a froth of mutually-canceling particle pairs with opposite energy to each other (thus not changing the net amount of energy in the universe).  </p>
<p>The opposite way that gravity affects the constituents of these pairs is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hawking_radiation" target="_blank">Hawking radiation</a> can cause black holes to lose mass and evaporate over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have different thicknesses. They vary between thinner than any vacuum that has ever been created in a lab, and vastly thinner than any vacuum that has ever been created in a lab. And I guess there's the stuff just outside the atmosphere on planets where it's just a fairly good vacuum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
