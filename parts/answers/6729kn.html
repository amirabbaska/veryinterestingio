		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Note that the Poisson bracket {q, p} is dimensionless and real-valued. So the commutator [Q, P], which has dimensions of action and is skew-adjoint, is not really the correct analogue.  The right analogue is really 1/(iℏ)[Q, P], which like {q, p} is dimensionless and is self-adjoint (the analogue of being real-valued).</p>
<p>1/(iℏ)[Q, P] is the correct analogue since it, like {q, p} in classical mechanics, determines the <em>same</em> Lie algebra of linear translations in phase space.  It's in that sense that the quantum theory is a &quot;quantisation&quot; of the corresponding classical theory.</p>
<p>&quot;Recovering&quot; classical mechanics means recovering the <em>full</em> Lie algebra of transformations in phase space (i.e., not just the linear translations).  The non-zero value of [Q, P] is responsible for the discrepancy between the classical and quantum algebras. (If [Q, P] = 0, then all of the operator-ordering ambiguities disappear.)  Since [Q, P] = iℏ, the classical limit is defined by ℏ → 0.</p>
<p>But on the way to the limit ℏ → 0, note that the value of 1/(iℏ)[Q, P] does not change, and may be given the same value <em>at</em> the limit.  In other words, while the Lie algebra changes as the value of ℏ changes -- in particular as ℏ becomes 0, nevertheless the Lie <em>sub</em>algebra of linear translations in phase space is always the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Emerges from what though? Not from the Schroedinger equation, nor from quantum statistics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
