		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The control center of emotions, called 'lymbic system', has a degree of control over the autonomous nervous system.</p>
<p>Crying is controlled by a branch of the autonomous nervous system - the parasympathetic.</p>
<p>When you feel sad, the parasympathetic nerve that controls the lacrimal gland is stimulated. </p>
<p>So, basically, the brain process that makes you feel sad is directly linked to the mechanism that stimulates the lacrimal gland to produce tears. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They’re easily visible and cause other visual effects on the face (redness, puffiness, etc) to silently display distress. Crying came about as a quieter way to tell others that they need help, since cries of pain/anguish etc sound like “come finish me off” to nearby predators within earshot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember a semi-recent study noticed a protein in tears that speeds up healing, and the debate firing up about if we cry in an attempt to speed the healing process of wounds and emotional tears are simply processed the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
