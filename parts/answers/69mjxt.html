		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, definitely! You can easily see that in <a href="http://i.imgur.com/NZjWfWT.jpg" target="_blank">this series of images</a> taken in the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared (IR) parts of the spectrum. As you can see there is a UV band below the violet edge and an IR band above the red edge, which you obviously can't see with the naked eye.</p>
<p>This result is exactly what we would expect. The way rainbows work is that when sunlight strikes water droplets suspended in the air, part of the light is reflected at the air/water interface at the back of each droplet, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/tcLYm5o.png" target="_blank">as shown in this diagram</a>. Since water is dispersive (meaning that the rerfractive index varies by wavelength), each droplet effectively acts as a small prism spreading the white light into its spectral components. Now our eyes our only sensitive to the visible (by definition), which is why a rainbow looks like a colorful transition from violet to red. However, sunlight also contains <a href="http://i.imgur.com/KbIrTzA.png" target="_blank">IR and UV components in addition to visible light</a>. While the water droplets absorb some of this light, much of it ends up reflected, as part of this extended rainbow that you can see from the IR and UV images posted above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do, and this is how William Herschel discovered infrared radiation.</p>
<p>He was conducting an experiment to see if the different colors of a rainbow (as produced by a prism) had different temperatures.  He placed a series of thermometers in the different colors of the rainbow and another to the side, next to the red in the rainbow, as a control.  When he discovered that his control thermometer indicated a higher temperature than any of the others, he correctly theorized that there was an invisible form of light that was being split off past the red component.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes!  In fact, that's how we accidentally discovered IR radiation.  William Herschel was experimenting with color temperature to see if any color was &quot;hotter&quot; by breaking sunlight up with a prism and putting a thermometer in the different color zones.  He put a thermometer next to the red as a control thinking there was nothing there, but to his surprise that one got the hottest.  If he had put it next to the purple side, we may not have known about the extended spectrum for another 50-100 years. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, it's been about 45 years, but I remember from school that the way infrared was originally discovered/proven was when some scientist put a thermometer just past the red on a spectrum coming through a prism, and the temperature rose.</p>
<p>And while I imagine in works for lower frequencies too, I know with higher frequencies the ability to lens them gets lost because of the shortness of their wavelength. Which is why x-ray cameras don't have lenses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this is actually how we discovered IR/UV. (Newton? I think?) Placed thermometers under a spectrum to measure each colors' temperature, believing some might be warmer than others. His control thermometers on either end of the spectrum also heated up, revealing there were components to the spectrum that humans couldn't see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
