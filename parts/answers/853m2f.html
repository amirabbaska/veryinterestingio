		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, they are used for cooling water in the condensers. They are used in coal power plants as well. Not all nuclear power plants have then. Fukushima for instance discharged water back into the ocean. Other reactors, like the one we have locally here in Byron, IL, use a relatively small river as its water source and would damage the local ecosystem if it discharged the heated water back into that small river, hence large cooling towers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The “smokestacks” are <a href="http://www.nucleartourist.com/systems/ct.htm" target="_blank">cooling towers</a> – essentially giant radiators that are used to cool clean water. A common design uses a water spray that’s directly exposed to the air, resulting in the cloud of condensation.</p>
<p>The distinctive shape is a hyperboloid. It’s stronger than a cylinder, but can still be built with straight beams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They use the Venturi effect to cool clean heated water as it rises. They are hourglass shaped because it causes the rising hot water vapor to compress as it travels upward, which creates droplets in midair that fall like Wiley Coyote as soon as they form. This falling droplet population further cools the rising hot vapor allowing further cooling from falling micro-rain. </p>
<p>The towers themselves are literally just big tubes of cement, nothing more, suspended off of the ground to allow secondary airflow draw. You can stand underneath one and clap your hands and it will echo for a long period of time, but sure why, but it's cool (har). </p>
<p>The water that is cooled is in a completely separate system than the radiated water that drives the turbines. So the vapor you see (if any) is just as clean as a cloud. </p>
<p>The idea is that the radiation heats the dirty water, which drives the turbines and needs to cool. It is cooled in a closed system by the proximity of this cooling system, like a coupe of cold water wrapped around a hot water pipe. The radiated water is returned in the system and the turbines continue to run, and the heated cooling water is released under these static towers that get virtually free cooling through the process described above. </p>
<p>As a side not, I've always found it amusing that once we split the atom, the best we could come up with for capturing its power is &quot;hey, it's hot, let's burn water.&quot;</p>
<p>Edit: Bernoulli is about cool math</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are cooling towers and aren't just used for nuclear.  My local coal plant has 2 cooling towers.  For coal plants the exhaust gasses / steam are cooled and injected with fluids to pull as mush of the SO and SO2 out of the air.  (smog / acid rain producing gasses)</p>
