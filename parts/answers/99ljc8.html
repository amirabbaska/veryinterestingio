		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually know this one! Sympathetic nervous response (SNR) more commonly known as “fight or flight”. When you induce stress on the body it begins releasing dopamine and adrenaline to give you the best chance at surviving the immediate stressor; shutting off digestion and using that energy for more immediate things like beating your heart more and getting more oxygen rich blood to muscles etc.</p>
<p>Issue is most stressors these days are stuff like debt that being able to run faster doesn’t actually solve so the body runs down its reserves and basically fucks itself trying to prepare you to punch a wolf to death or whatever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's often in stressful situations, when people have a high output of Adrenaline. Besides accelerating heartbeat and sharpening senses, Adrenaline also affects <del>peristalsis</del> your colon moving poop (thanks, u/falloman2347) and slows it down. This is often felt as a 'knot'. Fun Fact: the same thing happens when you get butterflies when you see your crush.</p>
<p>Edit: please see also u/wolfgirlnaya 's response below. She went a little bit into more detail about adrenaline' uses.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have a small version of our brain in the gut.  The myenteric plexus. And it’s dumb as Fuck!  It’s basically a squirrel brain that is normally in charge of digestion, endocrine, exocrine, digestive juices and when it interprets a threat is going on outside (could be anything), it over-reacts and causes all kinds of butterflies, nausea, diarrhea, constipation.  </p>
<p>Brain:  “Hey chill out down there!  Remember, Cave bears are Extinct.”
Gut brain:  “Whut does extinct mean?!?  Oh god! Shut the rest of it down!  No wait, fire it up!  We’re gonna die!’</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's part of the fight or flight feature of our bodies.  Certain animals will vomit whatever is in their stomachs when stressed a certain way.  In a wild environs this could either scare a predator away by them thinking you're sick, or failing that you are carrying less weight and can run or fight easier.</p>
<p>Since this isn't life threatening, your stomach is in preparation, but hasn't met the threshold to do so yet.  Similar idea with animals voiding their bowels in high stress situations as well.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;flight or fight&quot; reaction has begun. This causes the body to divert your blood from your internal organs to your muscles to allow them to react quickly under stressful situations. When blood leaves your stomach you get the &quot;butterflies&quot;, you feel the same when the forces of a rollercoaster cause blood to leave your stomach. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
