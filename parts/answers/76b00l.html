<p>My understanding is that a particle &quot;exists&quot; in the entire universe at varying probabilities, and can be measured at literally any point. </p>
<p>Instead of a very short distance, let's say a particle is going to tunnel one light second away. Does it take one second?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>imagine a potential well delimited by a barrier. </p>
<p>you are thinking of tunneling as: the particle is in the well at the start and then moves through the barrier to the right (for instance). </p>
<p>that's not what tunneling is. </p>
<p>tunneling means the particle is already in the well and outside from the start because its wave function is non zero on both sides of the barrier. the particle is the wave function.</p>
<p>what would technically be limited by causality is the wave function evolving to this state,ie the wave function assuming a nonzero value outside of the barrier.</p>
<p>needles to say these things are often calculated in nonrelativistic qm where this is neglected and assumed instantaneous.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way you asked the question implies a bit of an interpretation issue.  When you measure a particle’s location, you don’t know exactly where it is, until the measurement, and then you do.  To you, it seems like the particle spontaneously collapsed from a spread out wave function of possible locations, to a specific location.  </p>
<p>But there was no motion of the particle, and thus no speed.  The particle could simply be imagined to have been at the same spot the whole time.  What had size was the ambiguity.  The kicker is, that, to you, that ambiguity is utterly real.  From a certain definition of reality.  </p>
<p>A way to think about it is to imagine possibility as an extra ‘space’, like a real ‘dimension’, that you hardly ever see, because things normally don’t have any significant ‘size’ in that ‘dimension’.  When they do, it seems like complete nonsense from a 3d space + time viewpoint.  But, somehow it is apparently not nonsense, it is just extremely weird.  Something real extends beyond normal, everyday 3d space and time, which is more of an approximation.  You have to accept and add that extra level of reality (or overlapping realities) to begin to make sense of quantum effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The point of quantum tunneling isn't the movement itself, it's that the particle moves to a position that classically it shouldn't have been able to get to, not because of a speed of light limitation, but because of a kinetic/potential energy limitation.</p>
<p>For a clarifying analogy, consider a ball rolling around in a circular frictionless valley. It has enough kinetic energy to get about half way up the valley way before it rolls back down towards the center. On the other side of the valley wall, the terrain slopes back down so that some distance away, it is at the same elevation as the center of the valley. Classically, that ball is destined to stay inside the valley for eternity. It doesn't have enough kinetic energy to get over the valley wall and down the other side. But if it was a quantum mechanical particle instead of a macroscopic ball, then as time goes on and the system evolves, the wave function expands beyond the valley wall and there becomes some probability that the particle will be found outside of the valley even though it's kinetic/potential energy never changed and never got large enough to get over the valley wall. It &quot;tunneled&quot; through the wall.</p>
<p>This is how things like radioactive decay happen. An alpha particle being part of a nucleus is a low energy configuration because the residual strong force is attractive and stronger than the electric force at close distances so it holds it inside the nucleus. An alpha particle far from the nucleus is a low energy configuration as well because the strong force falls off and the electric force is repulsive keeping it away from the nucleus. The alpha particle being just far enough away from the nucleus to escape is a high energy configuration though. It's the valley wall separating the two low energy configurations. Quantum tunneling is what allows the alpha particle to escape the nucleus even though it doesn't have enough energy to get past the wall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
