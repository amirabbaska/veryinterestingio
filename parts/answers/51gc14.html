		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an open question! (Sort of! It has a universally agreed upon answer, that isn't really &quot;proven&quot;, but it pretty much has to be right.) So, the main thought as to why this is, is that there's a lot of dust in the Milky Way, particularly in the central couple of degrees of Galactic latitude where nearly all of the massive young stars (and therefore type II supernovae) are located. There's so much dust that we wouldn't be able to spot a supernova through it. To the Galactic Center, there's about 30 magnitudes of optical extinction (which means that only 1 photon in a trillion gets through!). And that's only <em>halfway</em> through the Galaxy! In the infrared it's not as bad, but that's a part of the EM spectrum we have been blind in until fairly recently in history. Just to compare, here's an <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0102/allsky_mellinger_big.jpg" target="_blank">image of the Milky Way in optical</a>, and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e4/Milky_Way_infrared.jpg" target="_blank">here's one in near-infrared</a> - notice you can suddenly see through a lot of the dust to the stars behind. So unless a supernova happened to go off fairly close by, or in one of the few young, massive stars out of the Plane, we'd miss it (EDIT: by eye! As /u/mfb- points out, <del>neutrino detectors on Earth would be aware of a</del> neutrinos from a Galactic supernova leave the star hours before the shockwave and light reaches the surface of the star, and neutrino detectors would detect them - hopefully that phrasing is less confusing). Projects like ZTF and LSST might spot one in the optical, though. </p>
<p>The main reason this is the main idea and not certain knowledge is that we haven't verified that there are historical supernovae that have been missed because of high extinction from dust. There's a way to find out though! Because light scatters off of dust, a supernova can &quot;echo&quot; around the Galaxy and the scattered light can reach us. Pairing up such echoes from different directions with each other or a supernova remnant can give a 3D view of the explosion, and a chance to see the explosion very early on. Armin Rest at STScI has done this with supernovae in the LMC before, but the Milky Way is a much larger part of the sky and is harder to do. His group has focused on known supernovae rather than look at the whole sky for new ones, but with projects like LSST about to image large parts of the sky very frequently to great depth, this area might be about to bust wide open in 10-15 years time. Regardless of if they find light echoes for missed historical supernovae, finding echoes for known ones that happened in the past is still really freaking cool - it's like archeology with light! </p>
<p>EDIT2: We know for a fact that supernova have happened in the last 400 years that <em>weren't</em> seen, because we can see remnants of supernova in X-ray and radio that are only about 100 years old, like G1.9+0.3 (the youngest known supernova remnant).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>kinda a tangent but got me to thinking..  what, if anything, would happen if you hit the cosmic lottery and happen to be looking at a star that went supernova through a large optical telescope?  not an extinction level event but a big one none the less. was thinking along the lines of eye damage but I'm assuming if it's that bad that would be the last of your worries..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The farthest star we can see with our naked eye is 16,000 light years away.  The Milky Way Galaxy 100,000 light years across.  Since we can't see very far into our own Galaxy a star could go supernova on the other side and we'd never see it.  Nebulas and dust block light which makes it difficult to see what's going on on the other half of the Galaxy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
