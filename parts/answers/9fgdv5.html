		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well then. Birds are dinosaurs, so everything we know about birds falls under the purview of your question. However, for extinct forms, we can also make inferences using a technique known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_bracketing" target="_blank">phylogenetic bracketing</a>. </p>
<p>Dinosaurs are <a href="http://archosaurmusings.wordpress.com/what-are-archosaurs/" target="_blank">archosaurs</a>, the two living representatives of which are crocodylians and birds (see also our <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/wiki/biology/birds_are_dinosaurs" target="_blank">FAQ on why birds are dinosaurs</a>). If there's a character that both groups have, it was likely present in their common ancestor. Things like a four chambered heart (which evolved independently from the mammalian heart), <a href="http://mappingignorance.org/2013/03/29/triassic-lungs-unidirectional-flow-in-alligators-breathing/" target="_blank">unidirectional airflow in the lungs</a>, and nest-building/parental care are present in both birds and crocodylians, so they were probably present in their common ancestor. That means extinct dinos likely had those traits or lost them secondarily. We have fossils that confirm these some of inferences, like brooding of nests. </p>
<p>Interestingly, we've also recently found that alligators are monogamous over multiple mating seasons, as are many birds, so that could have implications for how we look at extinct archosaur behavior. Alligators will also show nest site fidelity, coming back to the same or nearby areas over multiple nesting seasons. Many crocs have <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/05/alligator-mating-physics/" target="_blank">complex mating rituals</a> as well, so these also seem to be ancestral to archosaurs. </p>
<p>As far as dinosaur reproduction goes, we've found a lot of similarities between the reproductive tracts in birds and crocs. For example, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1547315" target="_blank">alligators and birds form eggshells in similar ways</a>.</p>
<p>Most <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sauropsida" target="_blank">&quot;reptiles&quot;</a> have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hemipenis" target="_blank">hemipenes</a>, which are paired copulatory organs that are everted for mating. This is not true of archosaurs. Most birds have lost their penis, but some retained it (ducks and ratites like ostriches and emus are two examples). I don't know of any fossil dinosaur genitalia, but birds (those that have a phallus) and crocs each have a single phallus rather than the hemipenes of extant lepidosaurs. That's likely what other extinct archosaurs probably had. However, given the range in variation that we see in living birds alone, I'm sure dinosaur genitalia existed in all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p>In short:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Dinosaurs probably ancestrally had penises similar to crocodylians and some birds, but they could have been lost in lineages like they were in many bird groups.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least some brooded their nests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They probably had mating displays like birds and crocs do.</p>
</li>
<li>Some may have been monogamous over multiple mating seasons like many birds and crocs.</li>
</ul>
