		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there are several parts to answering this question:</p>
<p>First, the concept of the university was invented and developed in Europe. Countries outside Europe had their own systems for higher learning, but they were different - for example, many did not award degrees for the completion of a course. The European system didn't really spread until the 19th century - the British colonisation of South Asia was finished around the start of the century while Japan and China opened up in the mid- to late-19th century. By the time Asia started to develop universities along Western lines, they were either being built by colonisers or by nations with more pressing concerns. In most cases, the resources simply weren't there to build well-funded universities equipped to do cutting-edge research. The reputation of Western universities also works to preserve their position. The oldest, most-established, best-funded universities where you can work alongside the top academics in your field will not only attract good students, but will turn good students into great students.</p>
<p>Secondly, the 19th and 20th centuries weren't great times to be an Asian nation. Without getting into too much detail, colonialism was not particularly helpful for South Asia. Top students would generally leave for the UK (and later the USA), researchers didn't have the resources of people working in the West. In East Asia, devastating wars wracked China and South Korea, in the case of China followed by decades of economic mismanagement. In 1989, China was substantially poorer than, for example, Nigeria, and certainly didn't have the money to build good research facilities. Japan, 1933-45 aside, was a bit more stable, but hardly wealthy until at least the 1960s. In comparison, Britain or the USA had at least a hundred years of investment in higher education by this point.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the priveleged position of English favours English-speaking nations. When it comes to research, a huge amount of work is published in English. It's much easier to engage with that if English is your native tongue.</p>
<p>So essentially by the time the world realised that universities were beneficial, Europe was already dominant and non-Western nations lacked the resources to develop top universities. It's only relatively recently that Asia has become economically powerful, not enough time to challenge 800-year-old institutions like Oxford or Cambridge.</p>
<p>This all being said, I wonder if perhaps you could reverse your question to read: 'If most of the best universities in the world are in the UK and the USA, why do we think Asian countries value education more highly?' Every time I see a news story discussing the high value of education in Asia, it focusses on parental spending or hours spent studying. I'm not sure if this kind of measurement actually has a connection to what universities do and, in the case of over-studying, may actually be bad for the creativity and curiousity that drives top researchers. Instead, I wonder if the value placed on education is really a reflection of the huge demographic pressures of these nations which creates fierce competition for university places and, after graduation, jobs. Perhaps 'education' itself is a catch-all term covering both the idea of education as research of new ideas and education as an advantage in competitive societies.</p>
<p>The last part is purely speculation, but it might offer an answer as to why, for example, comparatively wealthy/stable Asian nations like Japan or Sri Lanka do not have more top universities or why China's universities seem to be improving far slower than the Chinese economy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_Ranking_of_World_Universities" target="_blank">Example of method of ranking</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>[Most academically awarded former students]</strong> Quality of education: Alumni as Nobel laureates &amp; Fields Medalists</li>
<li><strong>[Most awarded or cited teachers and researchers]</strong> Quality of faculty: Staff as Nobel Laureates &amp; Fields Medalists + highly cited researchers in 21 broad subject categories</li>
<li><strong>[Most well-known and referenced papers]</strong> Research output: Papers published in Nature and Science, Papers indexed in Science Citation Index-expanded and Social Science Citation Index</li>
<li><strong>[Grade per person]</strong> Per capita performance: Per capita academic performance of an institution</li>
</ul>
<p>With the above or similar criteria, the West with its oldest (*) recognized universities, naturally has an advantage.</p>
<p>(*) I mean really old. Oxford University, for example, is older than many empires that have ever existed. It is actually older than anything recognizable as modern English, older than many of the basic values that underpin most reasoning and philosophy used today, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>when looking at the top universities in the world, it seems to indicate that the western universities are better.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Almost every answer in this discussion misses some of the most important points, so let me fill those gaps.  I used to work as a specialist tutor preparing students for the entrance test for the top 10 Japanese universities, so I have a little knowledge in this area.  The truth is, university rankings are designed in such a way which favours western universities over many of the top Asian institutions.</p>
<p>It turns out that almost all the recognised world rankings for the top universities combine a number of criteria, one of which is number of international undergraduate and/or postgraduate research students enrolled at the institution.  They use it as some kind of measure of global or cultural outlook and it forms a proportion of the overall score.  Japanese Universities (along with those in Korea and other non-English speaking Asian countries) suffer dramatically in this category.  The reason is pretty simple and obvious.  Whereas most countries teach English as a second language, so English speaking universities can attract talent from far and wide, the elite Japanese Universities (most prominently those of Tokyo and Kyoto) simply can't get overseas students, particularly undergrads, as easily because few people want to spend the time it would take learning Japanese before they can even attend classes.  The fact that the Japanese academic year is completely out of step with many other countries (it runs April to March) doesn't help much either.  And this causes a dent in their scores, which pushes them down the rankings compared to where they should be.</p>
<p>Here's a perfect example of that effect (note the unusually low score for International Outlook) :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/university-of-tokyo?ranking-dataset=1083" target="_blank">https://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/world-university-rankings/university-of-tokyo?ranking-dataset=1083</a></p>
<p>Another common category is &quot;Research Influence&quot; or similar.  This is commonly compiled according to number of citations for papers generated annually by universities around the world because it provides an easily comparable measure of influence.  But again Asian Universities suffer because not all papers are translated to English and therefore are not cited as broadly by a global audience.</p>
<p>Finally, institutions like Harvard and Oxford are simply more prestigious in the west because we know more about them.  I can probably name 5 of the 8 top Ivy League Universities [corrected: thanks /u/21stmonkey] in the States in a matter of seconds.  Can you name ANY 5 universities in the whole of Japan and Korea?  No, probably not.  And yet 6 different Japanese Universities have produced Nobel Laureates in the last 5 years alone.</p>
<p>The Japanese Government and the universities themselves have made pretty serious efforts to try to address the internationalisation issue.  Tokyo University announced a couple of years ago that it was going to completely change its academic year to match western standards.  I believe it ended up giving up on the plan because it was a logistical nightmare to deal with Japanese school leavers who would be left waiting to continue their studies, and deal with existing enrolled students.  </p>
<p>The Japanese Government's Monbukagakusho (scholarship) program is pretty much the most generous in the world.  It provides:</p>
<ul>
<li>A year of all expenses paid full time Japanese tuition to bring you up to a fluent level in the language at an accredited language school.</li>
<li>Full fees paid for all four years of your university course</li>
<li>A monthly stipend (basically what amounts to a monthly salary) paid in cash to the student to pay for your accommodation and living costs</li>
<li>They even used to provide your flights and the cost of a return plane ticket home once a year to visit family etc.  Not sure if they still do, but would be worth checking.</li>
<li>Students can also work on their student visa, so you can take a part time job to pull in even more cash</li>
<li>Many universities provide dispensation for overseas students to submit a portion of their work in English</li>
</ul>
<p>Most Monbukagakusho students I met lived like kings, and went home with a degree from a first class institution, fluency in a foreign language and thousands of dollars in the bank - no debt at all.  It's always amazed me that more people don't apply for it.</p>
<p>[<strong>EDIT:</strong> I've had quite a lot of requests over direct message for more information about the Monbukagakusho program.  The best advice I can give is to check out the official <a href="http://www.studyjapan.go.jp/en/" target="_blank"><strong>Study in Japan</strong></a> website published by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has full information including how to apply.]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oxford and Harvard typically place well in any inter-university student competitions that they enter and produce world class research. That's 100's of years of being 1st, 2nd or 3rd so they built up reputations. Consequently they have the most competitive entry requirements now because demand is so high which in turn makes them more prestigious. In turn they get the best students and continue to excel in research and competition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The asian way of learning, that being pure memorization, no critical thinking and, in certain countries(especially China), a high degree of cheating are simply the reasons why. In many Asian countries, learning in kindergarten AND at a coursework masters degree is the same thing: Read a book, memorize it, and take a test. There's no more to it, they're extremely trained to do so, but it doesn't really make you good at academia - i.e. challenging thoughts and developing actual new knowledge.</p>
<p>Just look in engineering/IT.. Sure, India and China crap out engineers and computer scientists, and yeah, they're getting better. But they're good at reverse-engineering western things or straight up copying. They understand architecture very well, but developing it themselves won't really happen.</p>
<p>Also, in most of asia, challenging someone above you in terms of hierarchy(student to university professor, for example) is heavily frowned upon. In Europe, professors enjoyed being challenged by students on academic material; it's what university is all about. In Asia, however, challenging a professor would NEVER happen because of the social structure. So in that sense, they don't really develop critical thinking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
