		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it this way: the injury occurs (strain of a muscle or sprain of a ligament) and the brain realizes the body has been damaged. The brain sends a rush of blood to the injured area, like turning on a water hose. </p>
<p>This carries the red and white blood cells to the injured area. The injured area only needs a “cup” of blood (for example) to lay down the white blood cells to make a clot. The brain doesn’t distinguish this. It will send a bucket. It has the hose on full blast until the injured area is completely healed. The length of time of this stage is 24-48 hours post trauma. </p>
<p>This is why they tell you to elevate above the heart after an acute injury; so your body’s lymphatic system can reabsorb the swelling not needed at the injured site. </p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human body is very good at fixing itself up, but it can tend to overreact and cause other issues, like excessive pain. We tend to prefer a longer recovery that is less painfull but take longer to heal than a faster recovery that is very unpleasant.</p>
<p>In some other cases, that over reaction can even be deadly, like a throat infection can cause your air passage to swell shut.</p>
<p>In some other cases, like hundreds of wasp stings can cause your body to react normally to each ones, but due to the amount of sting sites you can die from it, it is then better to stop it even if it cause other issues because the alternative is death.</p>
<p>In other words, we do it so it get more confortable, more manageable and/or to save life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one on here has really given the right answer here so I'll chime in.</p>
<p>Swelling is the brain/body's way of stabilizing a joint. Typically if you've injured something to the point that it swells, you've most likely sprained (minor tear in ligament/tendon) something in that joint. The brain now recognises that the join has become less stable, so it pumps synovial fluid to the area to stabilize the join for you until the damage has repaired itself.  In the wild this would be very advantageous. The swelling however (as many others have mentioned) will restrict blood flow to the injured area and the actual healing process becomes slower, but again this is designed for humans who haven't figured out how to make a medical device like a brace to help keep the join immobile while it repairs itself.  So modern humans use ice to reduce the inflammation so that we can maximize blood flow to that area.  Heat is actually no longer an appropriate therapy when treating injuries such as these. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's because while inflammation is natural it does not seem to be actually helpful overall. For example, people with more anti-inflammatory genes tend to live longer.</p>
