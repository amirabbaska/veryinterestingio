		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hell no, in fact you wouldn't even come close to being able to feel it. First of all I feel obligated to mention that practically speaking we can't quite get down to 0K, but we can get down really low. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_temperature_recorded_on_Earth#Laboratory_cooling" target="_blank">the lowest temperature achieved in a lab</a> was 100pK or 1*10^(-10)K, which for all practical purposes (relevant to this question) we can say is effectively absolute zero. So what would happen if an atom of such a material got into your body? Well, it would quickly bounce around collecting energy until it reached your body temperature. To do so, it would suck out a whopping ~50meV, or the energy of an infrared photon (at 25,000nm). </p>
<p>To give you an idea of how ridiculously little energy this is, every time you click your TV remote you get more than 10^22 photons at a higher energy/shorter wavelength (~1000nm) per second! Now put your remote next to your hand, do you feel anything at all? Now divide that by more than 10^22 to see how much that atom would hurt you. To really risk damage you would need to essentially get dunked a liquid at that temperature. For example, a quick shower in a bath of liquid nitrogen (at 77K) would quickly be the end of you. </p>
<p>Put more simply, there is nothing particularly special about things that are really cold, the way they hurt you is by cooling you down and you need a lot material to remove enough energy from your body to hurt you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a nutshell, if we say the single atom has zero kinetic energy (unfortunately absolute zero is more complicated than this but we're just ballparking).  The average atom/molecule at room temperature has about 0.0375 electronvolts of kinetic energy.  So we can say that the absolute zero atom must &quot;steal&quot; 0.0375 electronvolts of energy from you to reach thermal equilibrium with you.  So how much energy is that?</p>
<p>Well, let's make the approximation that you're 100kg (220 pounds, it's just a nice round number) and made entirely of water (H2O).  That means you're made of about 4*10^27 water molecules.  Stealing 0.0375 electronvolts amounts to lowering the temperature of your body by.....  10^-25 of a degree. </p>
<p>So coming in contact with such a particle would lower your body temperature by about 10 trillionths of a trillionth of a degree.  So, no.  Not only will it not kill you, it would be an extraordinarily boring event.</p>
<p>EDIT: Lost a factor of two, fixed it,  not that it matters when you're talking about 25 orders of magnitude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a huge difference between <em>temperature</em> and <em>capacity to absorb or release thermal energy</em>.  In particular, consider the solar corona -- it's at a typical temperature of something like 10^6 K.  But if you somehow stuck your hand into a 10 meter cube of the stuff, you wouldn't even feel its warmth.  The coronal material would instantly dump all its energy into your hand, but there's just not that much energy there since the corona is so tenuous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature is a measure of the average energy of a collection of atoms. Individual atoms don't have temperatures, any more than an individual person has a culture (not the best analogy but all I can think of right now, it's late). </p>
<p>Individual atoms have kinetic energy, and an atom at absolute zero has very little and would be harmless to the touch. Most atoms at incredibly high kinetic energies are also pretty harmless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not at all. A good way of understanding this would be to think about holding a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkler" target="_blank">sparkler</a>. If you've ever done this, you've probably felt &quot;sparks&quot; fall on your hand. These sparks are over one thousand degrees* (F), but they don't burn you because they're so small.<br />
In the case of your single 0Â°K atom, you wouldn't feel anything at all. It's just too tiny.</p>
