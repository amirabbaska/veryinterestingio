		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just to do with how salty the water is (i.e. the osmolarity of the fluid).</p>
<p>The saline usually used in IV drips for rehydration is close to isotonic - that is, the amount of 'salt' is approximately the same as what's in the blood stream. This prevent 'diluting' the blood (i.e. causing hyponatraemia etc) and/or causing excessive fluid redistribution to the various compartments.</p>
<p>In a way, it's similar to how sports drinks can have some salt in them without causing dehydration.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the salt water you're probably thinking of is something like sea water, which is hypertonic. Although drinking it doesn't  really 'harm us' per se, it doesn't rehydrate us. This is because urine has to be excreted in order to maintain osmolarity.</p>
<p>Certain receptors detect when there's too much 'salt' in the blood and concentrated urine is excreted (bringing the osmolarity back down to normal). However, there's a limit to how concentrated our kidneys can make urine, so the amount of water we gained from drinking sea water is less than the amount of urine that had to be excreted - thus increasing the level of dehydration.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sea water has way way more.  You need to get rid of the excess, via your kidneys, and you spend more water removing the excess salt than you gained by drinking it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concentration of &quot;homemade&quot; saltwater is often too high. Sea water hovers around 3%. IV fluids called Normal saline is at 0.9% which is very close to the average human blood salinity. If you were to drink 1 liter of 3% salt water, your body would have to consume 2 more liters to approach the 0.9% average salinity. Without doing that, the body will adjust the volume of saline by flushing it out through the kidneys. The result is dehydration by fluid loss. The opposite situation of consuming large amounts of pure water can occur. Consuming pure water in large amounts in a short period of time can cause fluid overload, pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs) and electrolyte imbalance causing cardiac arrest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>kidney doctor here. It is true that hyperosmolar, or hypertonic saline can be harmful and cause hypernatremia - but note that the volume needed to drink would have to be high enough to cause the increase in Na concentration, which can easily be calculated with high school math. In the short term, the high salt content may cause nausea to prevent the salt load absorption. Smaller amounts of hypertonic fluid intake would be handled by the kidney excreting the sodium out; to a certain limit ofcourse</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
