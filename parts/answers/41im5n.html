		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A typical barrel of oil is used to make many things, such as gasoline, kerosene, heating oil, diesel, with some left over waste being used for things like bitumen/asphalt. If i'm not mistaken, the quality of the barrel of oil determines how much of each product can be refined from each barrel. The profit of each barrel of oil is called the crack spread (i.e., if I crack this barrel of oil into each of its refined components, what's the profit spread on them all combined). It's not inconceivable that a refiner is helping to hold the prices higher in one of these markets (gasoline in this instance) to help offset pricing pressures in the other refined components of a barrel of oil. Also, it can be easy to underestimate the size of the supply chain it takes to deliver gasoline to you. While oil is down to what it cost in the early 2000's, I am still paying more at the pump because the people at the refinery, truck drivers doing the deliveries, environmental workers that help maintain the safety of the tanks, and yes even minimum wage jobs at the gas station are making more where I live than they did back then. </p>
<p>If you google the crack spread for Gulf Coast 3-2-1 as an example, you can see that the refiners are making less profit per barrel than they were just a few months ago. While it may feel like you're getting ripped, that doesn't seem to be the case strictly by the numbers I can find.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oil has to be processed to turn into gas, and those facilities don't just pop up overnight.</p>
<p>Imagine if the price of flour fell 90%. The price of bread would not fall 90% the next day - the breadmakers have to pay labour, rent, utilities, and their mortgages. Bread will be much more profitable, and new bakers will try to enter the bread market, but they will not do so instantly.</p>
<p>A new oil refinery is a serious project that takes 3-5 years to complete. People are working on it now, but it's going to take time, and in the meantime there's only so much processing capacity. Their costs might have gone down, but they sell it for what they can, and that won't chance until there's capacity enough to undercut them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
