		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least for infants, it's the opposite. </p>
<p>Babies have shown preference to foods their mother ate while they were in utero and being breastfed.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/08/08/139033757/babys-palate-and-food-memories-shaped-before-birth" target="_blank">http://www.npr.org/2011/08/08/139033757/babys-palate-and-food-memories-shaped-before-birth</a></p>
<p>However, how flavors taste to you may be partially controlled by genetics. So regardless of what your mother ate, if your father can't stand the taste of oysters, you may hate them as well. </p>

<p>This is a study in which mothers who drank carrot juice had babies who appeared to enjoy carrot flavouring more than babies unexposed to carrot juice during pregnancy and breast feeding.  However, the study does not go into adolescent and adult preferences of the child.</p>
<p>I haven't seen enough studies answering your exact question to say for sure, but my best guess for your question is correlation.  Any studies I'm seeing by Julie Mennella, who researches this stuff, point to pre-born exposure to foods leading to infant preferences.  I haven't seen any longitudinal studies following the child to adulthood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's any data to support this, however you may find <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4172095/" target="_blank">this</a> review interesting nonetheless. It goes into the nature of pregnancy cravings themselves, and how they are similar or different across different population groups. Teasing apart the very real nausea pregnant women experience and how that affects them behaviorally as well as cultural expectations for cravings is no easy task. </p>
<p>Oysters are a particularly problematic example because many people dislike oysters as adults, and oysters are most frequently consumed raw, which isn't advised for pregnant women. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's really interesting. I know that <a href="http://www.npr.org/2011/08/08/139033757/babys-palate-and-food-memories-shaped-before-birth" target="_blank">fetuses taste what pregnant women eat</a> and for the most part, that helps expand their palates, but I don't know anything about over-exposure. It makes sense, though, normally you get sick of something if you eat it too many times in a row, and if you weren't the one choosing to eat it, you might be even more turned off of it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
