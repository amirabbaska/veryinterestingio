		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is due to a polar vortex, a rotating low pressure zone above both the north and south poles, that minimizes the air exchange above these regions.  The vortex limits the inflow of ozone to the depleted regions.  The polar vortex above Antarctica is typically stronger than the one above the arctic, hence the ozone hole over Antarctica is generally more severe than the one over the arctic.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer: The time scale of the chemistry and dynamic processes that drive the ozone hole loss and recovery are shorter than the time it takes to uniformly mix the stratosphere.</p>
<p>The longer answer: Stratospheric ozone depletion does happen everywhere. Roughly 4% of the total ozone layer has been lost due to human emissions of CFCs and other trace gases that react with sunlight to produce chemical gases that consume stratospheric ozone. Because these reactions are relatively slow, the loss occurs everywhere.</p>
<p>The &quot;ozone hole&quot; is a special event of accelerated loss directly over Antarctica a few weeks each southern spring during which almost all ozone is lost.  This occurs because strong circumpolar stratospheric winds exist (the &quot;Antarctic vortex&quot;) that act as a barrier for the mixing of air from warmer latitudes. Temperatures get cold enough during winter that special ice clouds called polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs) form. The PSCs have surfaces that strongly accelerate the chemistry of ozone loss once the sun rises in spring. Then the Antarctic vortex reinforces the local hole by acting as a barrier against mixing of the low-ozone air with other latitudes. Once temperatures get too warm for PSCs each summer, the accelerated loss ends and ozone recovers over Antarctica.</p>
<p>The Arctic has a weaker polar vortex, so is warmer and doesn't generate as many PSCs; therefore the accelerated loss phenomenon is less prone to happening in the Arctic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reaction that causes CFCs to break down ozone only happens at extremely low temperatures (somewhere in the neighborhood of -100 IIRC, but it's been a long long time since I took that class) which only usually happens over the poles in the stratosphere during winter.</p>
<p>It's a big reason as to why it took so long to figure out what was happening. At more normal temperatures CFCs are well behaved. You have to get to the stratosphere above the poles to start to see what's going on.</p>
<p>So. Anyway. There's a hole in the ozone over the south pole because that's where the ozone breakdown happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ozone hole is a temporary and dynamic phenomenon. The existence of the ozone layer is a race between ozone producing processes (mostly the transformation of stratospheric O2 by UV light from the Sun) and ozone destroying processes (such as the catalytic destruction of ozone via Chlorine free radicals). The atmosphere, at all levels, is not evenly mixed, there are different areas that are semi-isolated from each other, and some of the most isolated portions are the polar regions, where polar vortices keep the atmosphere somewhat localized. During the local winter at the poles the concentration of high altitude CFCs builds up, then during the spring there are conditions where it is still extremely cold but there is some sunlight. The presence of polar stratospheric clouds creates conditions that are suitable for the breakdown of CFCs into Chlorine free radicals via UV light, which destroys ozone catalytically (meaning one single Chlorine free radical atom can destroy many ozone molecules in its lifetime). But even though these conditions rely on the presence of the same UV-light that creates ozone, the high concentration of CFCs and the fairly low light levels in the early spring result in ozone destruction winning the race, potentially causing widespread ozone depletion in the area.</p>
<p>The ozone hole is most prominent at the South pole due to the more consistent presence of polar stratospheric clouds and the colder temperatures there. It's also typically a phenomenon that is strongest in September and October (local spring in the Southern hemisphere) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
