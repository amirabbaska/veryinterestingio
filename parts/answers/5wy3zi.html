		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the existence of a magnetic monopole would imply the necessity of electric charge quantization -- the phenomenon that all electric charges are integer multiples of some fundamental charge, a property which is observed but for which we do not have a confirmed explanation.</p>
<p>Secondly, many unified theories imply the existence of monopoles.  So if you found a monopole, you could ask, if this is a unified theory monopole, what would it tell you about the unified theory?  The mass of the monopole would allow us to determine the energy scale at which unification occurs.  Also, in unified theories, the monopoles have a radius determined by the unification scale.</p>
<p>One last thing: The density of monopoles in the universe is related to the expansion rate of the universe and when that expansion occurred.  Inflation -- a period of rapid expansion -- appears to be needed in the context of grand unification, because otherwise there'd be a much higher density of monopoles and we should have seen some already.</p>
<p>BTW, you might be interested to read about Cabrera's experiment that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#Searches_for_magnetic_monopoles" target="_blank">appeared to detect a magnetic monopole</a> in 1982, although since that signal never occurred again, it seems doubtful that one event was real.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add that the connection between the existence of magnetic monopoles and quantization of electric charge was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_monopole#Dirac.27s_quantization" target="_blank">realized by Dirac</a> in 1931. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side questions. Shouldn't there be north monopoles and south monopoles? Would they be antiparticles of each other? Is there an asymmetry that would unbalance monopole production like matter, so there would be one type of primordial monopole left?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
