		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light meat is a meat with smaller amounts of myoglobin than dark meat.  Myoglobin is related to hemoglobin, which is the red part of your blood.  Both molecules use iron to hold on to oxygen.  Dark muscles with myoglobin are used for endurance.  This is why leg muscles on chicken are dark meat...chickens run around all day, but fly in short bursts.  Birds that fly steadily for long periods of time have dark breastmeat.  You can see this in fish, too.  Tuna, which swim constantly their whole lives, have dark meat, while flounder, which spend most of the day lying on the bottom, have light meat.</p>
<p>Alligators spend most of the day hanging around rather than actively swimming, but they need bursts of power from their tail to surge forward in order to attack prey.  So they have light meat back there.  </p>
<p>But what about mammals, you ask?  Mammals differ from most birds and reptiles because they tend to have light and dark muscle fibers mixed together in the same muscle.  So you get &quot;red meat&quot; instead of light vs dark</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's not. it's our modern farming techniques that make chicken that boldly beige (or whatever you call it) colored.</p>
<p>Purdue got famous/big by selling chickens it claimed were more healthful because it had a bolder color, that is you could see it was more healthy. He achieved this by feeding the birds marigolds; the carotenoids in the petals got absorbed into the fatty tissues/tissues in general and turned the meat a stronger,  darker hue.</p>
<p>Eventually this became standard industry practice</p>
<p>In general the more wild forage an animal is allowed to eat, the more color compounds it eats which change it's meat. If you take chickens and just feed them without letting them root around,  I've been told the meat is pretty damned white.</p>
<p>In the same theme of color compounds , alligator tail meat is extremely lean (color compounds are fat soluble)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the other explanations here, it's partly because chickens and alligators have a lot more in common than you'd think. Birds evolved from feathered dinosaurs and are the closest living relatives to modern crocodilians. Both fall into the scientific clade of Archosaurs. Yep, birds are basically warm blooded reptiles. So it's not a stretch to imagine why they'd have similar muscle tissue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
