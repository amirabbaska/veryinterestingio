		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Radial and antiradial thrust &quot;pivots&quot; orbits.  Thrusting towards a planet would lower your altitude ahead of you, and raise it behind you. Thrusting away does the opposite. This doesn't change your orbital energy much, because the thrust is parallel to the center of gravity and at right angles to your orbital path, whereas normal/antinormal thrust is always at a right angle to gravity and orbital vector, so this adds energy.</p>
<p>Anyways, orbital rendezvous - timing and precision is key. I'm going to explain the basics for anyone else who may read this. Like you said, altitude determines orbital speed. Lower means faster, and higher means slower. Two spacecraft in the same orbit (say, a 100km circle) take exactly the same time to complete an orbit. If these two satellites are orbiting the exact same line, but at different points, they are out of &quot;phase.&quot; Let's say satellite 1 is 30 minutes out of phase behind satellite 2 - how do we get them to meet? Well, make satellite 2 take a 30 minute longer orbit, or 2 15 minute longer orbits, or 30 orbits a minute longer. All you have to do is give it a bit more altitude, giving it a longer orbital period. Once you're in phase, match paths again - and do it as precisely as possible.</p>
<p>If you end up within a few kilometers, you're only very slightly out of phase, and close enough that you can maneuver directly relative to your target without worrying about what it does to your orbit. For example, let's say you are 1km directly under your target. Thrusting directly away from the planet and towards your target does alter the orbit some, but it balances out when you thrust in the other direction to slow back down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If I increase the speed (by burning prograde) I will <del>increase</del> decrease my altitude </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looks like you've edited and corrected that, but I think it was better before.</p>
<p>Burn prograde -&gt; increase your speed -&gt; increase your energy -&gt; increase your altitude.</p>
<p>Probably the confusion comes from the fact that higher orbits are slower. That's true, but only on average. Let's suppose from your example that you start from a circular orbit at 2000 m/s at 100 km. Increase your speed to 2200 m/s, then your  orbit will become elliptical and the apoapsis (highest point) will become significantly higher than 100 km. The key point here is that <em>the speed along an elliptical orbit is not constant</em>, during ascent your satellite will slow down and reach the apoapsis slower than 2000 m/s. So maybe this is what made you think higher altitude = lower speed. But then the descending half of the orbit starts, and during this path the satellite will speed up again. When it reaches periapsis (lowest point) it will be the same place where you burned to speed up, same altitude (100 km) and same speed (2200 m/s). The elliptical and the circular orbit touch at this point, and the higher (elliptical) orbit is faster at this point though slower on average.</p>
<p>So the rule of thumb is speed up to get high, slow down to get low. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohmann_transfer_orbit" target="_blank">Hohmann transfers</a>.</p>
<p>Getting back to the question in the title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What does burning radial out/in do?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Prograde/retrograde burns are simple because you can just predict the new apogee/perigee using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vis-viva_equation" target="_blank">Vis-viva equation</a>. Radial burns are a bit more tricky. The problem is definitely solvable since there is a well-known method to determine the orbit from a position and a velocity, and both should be known from your manoeuvre. But since I'm a bit lazy to do the math I'll just go with the intuitive concept: you're changing the potential energy of your satellite, so burning outwards will definitely put you in a higher orbit. At the same time the velocity vector will no longer be perpendicular to the position vector, so your orbit will become elliptical as others said.</p>
<p>Regarding the third part about orbital Rendez-Vous, that's a nice question. If you're far away from the target you must use orbital mechanics for phasing as others said. Move to a lower orbit to shorten your orbital period, or to a higher orbit to make it longer.</p>
<p>Once you've come close enough to your target you can ignore orbital mechanics completely and burn directly to it in a straight line. Why? Because it will be a short distance, it will take little to get there, so orbital mechanics won't have enough time to make a meaningful difference. Don't get me wrong, nature cannot be fooled and the effect of migrating to a higher orbit when you speed up will still be present, but if you're a few meters behind your target and this effect causes you to miss by a few mm, is it really a problem?</p>
<p>The conditions that must be satisfied in order to ignore orbital mechanics are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The distance to the target must be negligible when compared to the orbit's length</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The delta-v must be negligible when compared to orbital speed</p>
</li>
<li>The time it takes you to reach the target must be negligible when compared to the orbital period</li>
</ul></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are missing something. First off, increasing the orbital radius <em>decreses</em> orbital velocity. Second, you would very rarely burn entirely radially, the radial vector is usually a component of your desired vector. You can for instance burn radially inward <em>and</em> prograde to give you more &quot;umph&quot; in a slingshot manouvre / gravity assist.</p>
<p>By burning radially, you essentially translate your orbit in the direction you are burning. Say you burn inward, your altitude decreases but on the opposite side of the orbit, your altitude will increase accordingly.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Burning radially changes your orbit eccentricity and moves your periapsis.</p>
<p>If you're ahead of your rendezvous target, burn prograde a little more.  This will raise your orbit, thus slowing you down, and letting your target catch up with you.  Check out the Euler-Hill (aka Clohessy-Wiltshire) equations --- a linearization of orbital equations of motion in the neighborhood of a circular orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any answer that doesn't caveat with context is going to miss the complete picture:</p>
<p>Generally radial burns are used to change the argument of the periapsis, but this only works effectively near an apsis. This is similar to how out-of-plane burns (normal/anti-normal) are only effective at changing inclination when burning at a node.</p>
<p>For out-of-plane burns in between nodes (at an antinode), inclination doesn't notably change but the longitude of the ascending node does. Similarly, if we burn radially at a non-apsis you get completely different behavior - eccentricity changes, but not argument of the periapsis.</p>
<p>Any scenario where you need to fine tune eccentricity or argument of the periapsis without affecting other orbital parameters will require a radial burn. The anomaly of the burn will depend on which one you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
