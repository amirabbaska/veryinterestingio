		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the various effects differing in magnitude from other pulsars (the answer is not always &quot;larger magnitude&quot; because we don't know the mass of the pulsar), there aren't really any observable variations in relativistic effects between this pulsar and others. As with most other globular cluster pulsars, it is very faint, and so using it in tests of fundamental physics (e.g. gravity, nuclear) might be difficult though some possibilities are mentioned in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0601337" target="_blank">discovery paper</a>. Besides being the fastest spinning pulsar known, it doesn't seem to have any other &quot;special&quot; characteristics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
