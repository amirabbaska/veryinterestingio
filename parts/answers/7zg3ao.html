		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The direction of heat transfer.</p>
<p>When you're putting your cold feet in hot water, the hot water is transferring its heat to your feet and trying to reach equilibrium. There's a huge difference in temperature between your feet and the water so a lot of heat is transferred, so it feels extra hot.</p>
<p>The opposite is true when you put hot feet in cold water. The heat in your feet is being dissipated through the cold water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was a kid I would lay in the bathtub and run only the cold water and would lie perfectly still and my body would adjust and it didn't feel cold. It was soothing, when I got out of the bathtub the air felt so warm, just the opposite of getting out of a hot shower and it's cold as heck. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
