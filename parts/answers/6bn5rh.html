		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit 735: I tried writing a better ELI5 than the one I originally wrote. Added it below the original.</p>
<p>This is a favorite field of mine and also a difficult question to answer. I'll do my best, but I think I'll still leave you wanting.</p>
<p>Even though we have nerves that we know that are related to pain (called C fibers), the processing of the feeling we call pain is much more complex than that.</p>
<p>The brain and the spinal cord (the central nervous system) do all the processing of pain.</p>
<p>So what can cause a random pain for a few seconds? Here are two examples, there are many more.</p>
<p>A. A peripheral nerve (i.e, the one in the bottom of your foot) shooting while unprovoked or because of long term irritation.</p>
<p>B. A sensory nerve (unrelated to pain fibers) shoots an electrical current towards the brain. Because of wrong processing in the brain, the sensory input is perceived as pain.</p>
<p>So these are examples to the &quot;how&quot;. I feel that I cannot answer &quot;why&quot; with confidence.
There is a lot of research, and pain is something we are still trying to understand.</p>
<p>The guy in the next video is a leading researcher when it comes to pain, and he does a great job explaining it in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwd-wLdIHjs" target="_blank">TED talk</a>.</p>
<p>Hoped I helped a little bit, and sorry I couldn't give a more detail answer but my time is really short.</p>
<p><strong>Better ELI5 I think:</strong></p>
<p>Imagine there are roads all around the body, going from all of your body parts (hands, feet, nose, liver, and so on) to your head.</p>
<p>On those roads there are trucks, coming from the small towns to the main station (the head) to unload their boxes with some electronics and food for the grocery stores.</p>
<p>Now, in the delivery room in the main station there is a delivery guy, and he is busy as hell. He is trying to keep up with all that's going on, but he makes mistakes sometimes.</p>
<p>So sometimes, some boxes arrive not where they should be. So now, the local hotdog stand accidentally gets some new TVs, puts them on the grill and stinks the whole town.</p>
<p>Edit: formatting</p>
<p>Edit2: Trying to make things a bit clearer.</p>
<p>Edit3: It seems it's much more interesting to answer questions on reddit than do whatever I was supposed to be doing. Thank you for the challenging questions, and I'll do my best to answer what I can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've had this sharp pain in my ribs on my right side for as long as I can remember. When I started getting sick of the flu or some kind of cold it would trigger the pain. It's always been the way I knew in advance I would get sick before any other symptoms. Until one day I caught influenza and complicated into pneumonia. Needed antibiotics, cortisone, etc... It weakened my immune system. The pain in my ribs got sharper and sharper until after a few days I looked at  my skin and realised I developed shingles on that one side of my ribs. So after all these years, the virus was dormant in my nerve endings and whenever I got sick it would be enough to annoy it a little bit but not enough to wake the virus until that one day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well a little search gave me two reasons plausible reasons -</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It could be due to a phenomenon called &quot;referred pain&quot;. It occurs when sensory information comes to the spinal cord as coming from one location, but is interpreted by the brain as coming from another location.</p>
</li>
<li>This is applicable to only sharp fleeting chest pains and it is called Precordial Catch. It is a non-serious condition affecting the left side of the anterior wall of the chest. It is characterized by sharp chest pains, and usually affects children and adolescents, although it can occur, though less frequently, in adults. PCS manifests as a very intense, sharp pain, typically at the left side of the chest, generally in the cartilage between the bones of the sternum and rib cage, which is worse when taking breaths, or doing physical activity.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many reasons this could be happening. I the case where physiologically there is no illness taking place, sensory information going to the spinal cord and brain can be misinterpreted. In other cases the cause can be pinched nerves, random spasms of muscle fibers, muscle strains, fibromyalgia... The list goes on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Omg yes have had the chest pain too! The horrible sticky kind where it feels like my lung is stuck to my ribs; and more commonly the lightening kind. Have figured it is related to my back, and the more I exercise (which is not a lot! Office based job etc ) and the more I strengthen my back/core, the less I get the pain. If that helps anyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
