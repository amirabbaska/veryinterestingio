		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a little more complicated than that.  All dinosaur species didn't -go- extinct, as their decendants are still with us today, and many others went extinct long before the Chicxulub impact.  But it is widely agreed that the mass extinction at the end of the cretaceous period was caused by the change in climate triggered by a massive asteroid impact on the coast of the gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p>There's no such thing as 100% certainty in science, but we're as certain as the K-Pg impact as we are of anything.  It left a layer of material in the geological record, we know where the impact was, we've identified the crater and determined the approximate size of the impactor, we know what the environmental effects were, we know the non-avian dinosaur species went extinct at the time.  It's pretty settled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The impact event has left a crater and global iridium anomaly which have been dated with absolute methods (radiogenic dating) and good ole fashioned stratigraphic methods and is a major factor in the loss of species we see at the end of the Cretaceous, that's pretty much settled for sure. Complications are in just how it affected the Earth and how much this contributed to the end Cretaceous mass extinction, which is actually a more multifaceted extinction probably than most others. From a GSL special review on the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Cretaceous-Tertiary Boundary (KTB or KPg for Cretaceous-Paleogene) mass extinction is primarily known for the demise of the dinosaurs, the Chicxulub impact as the presumed sole cause and the associated frequently rancorous 30 years old controversy.  But there is more to this mass extinction.  Among the five major mass extinctions, only the KT can be shown to have a close correspondence between the mass extinction, an iridium anomaly, a large impact crater (Chicxulub) plus one small crater (Boltysh), one of the largest continental flood basalt eruptions (Deccan Traps) and major climate and sea level changes (Fig.  1).  Given the revolution in understanding of these events particularly over the past decades this simple impact-kill scenario is simply no longer adequate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the plot thickens. Can't stress enough the potential for large volcanic outgassings as occur with the production of large igneous provinces (such as the Deccan Traps, occurring in the few million years before the the Chicxulub impactor) to affect the global Earth system, from climate to ocean habitability. The full article that I quoted above makes an excellent summary of these sorts of effects: <a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Geoscientist/Archive/November-2012/Volcanism-impacts-and-mass-extinctions-2" target="_blank">Volcanism, impacts and mass extinctions</a>. All mass extinctions seem to have some sort of large igneous province associated with them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An asteroid impact at 66 Ma happened. It's impact on the Earth was surely devastating. However, investigating the cause of a mass extinction is hard because it's more complicated than just finding the metaphorical murder weapon. You have to decide which murder weapon fits the data the best. </p>
<p>There are two leading non-mutually exclusive hypothesis:</p>
<p>(1) <strong>The Chicxulub asteroid impact</strong>: a massive impact just east of Mexico on the Yucatan. Other minor asteroid impacts occurred around the same time and may be related. Extinction caused by massive CO2 release, particulates, sulfur dioxide, and possibly direct atmospheric heating from ejecta re-entry.</p>
<p>(2) <strong>The Deccan Traps</strong> (flood basalts): An unbelievably large series of volcanic eruptions in western India. Volcanic eruptions large enough to blanket substantial portions of the continent in over a mile of lava (&gt;2000 m). Extinction caused by massive CO2, sulfur dioxide, and particulate release into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Much of the discussion revolving around what caused the extinction leads to the relative impacts and timing of these two events and individual eruptions within the Deccan Traps. I'm not super up to date on the literature, but I think that the Chicxulub impact is still preferred. However, I just listened to a visiting lecture about how it was the Deccan Traps, so there may still be ambiguity as people gather more data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The British Geological Survey <a href="www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-36377679" target="_blank">recently completed drilling a borehole</a> off the Yucatan, directly into the peak ring of the impact.</p>
<p>They found evidence of <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/science-environment-41825471" target="_blank">large gypsum deposits</a> at the site of the impact.  When the impactor struck what was a shallow sea, it may have led to a massive release of sulphur dioxide, which could have led to a a global winter lasting years.</p>
<p>Some other commenters have mentioned the Deccan Traps, which is a theory that our lecturers got us debate in when I was in university.  I think most scientists now agree that the timing is a bit off for the Traps to be the sole cause.</p>
<p>What could have happened was a global sea level fall that was ongoing at the time (leading to a loss of marine diversity), followed by a sustained period of immense volcanism, and topped off by a massive meteor landing in the worst place possible giving a knockout punch.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s interesting to note that most species of animals which survived the event are either detritivores or scavengers, who would be the species most likely to survive an aerosol induced winter lasting years.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what everyone else has pointed out, people have a tendency to think about the dinosaurs going extinct as a big dramatic event that happened over the period of days weeks and years. In reality it was a much longer process and was most likely a series of events rather than one specific thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
