		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know what the full range of conditions is under which life can exist.</p>
<p>What we do know is that life is possible in places like the Earth.</p>
<p>So if you were going to look for life, better to spend your efforts in the kinds of places where we know life can exist, but that is not the same as saying life can't exist in other conditions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know that life can exist without oxygen because life on Earth started out without oxygen being present. So that's easy.</p>
<p>As far as water is concerned: There are three common substances in the universe that are liquid over a reasonable temperature range: water, ammonia, and methane. Water has the advantage of being slightly more common than ammonia or methane; in addition, it is liquid at higher temperatures, which means that life forming in water has more energy available to reproduce and move around. So we're not sure that extraterrestrial life forms in water, but water is probably a good guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My astronomy teacher in high school said, &quot;if you are looking for a star marathon runner, you aren't going to start looking at McDonald's. It doesn't mean there isn't one at McDonald's, but you are going to look in a place more likely to have someone who runs.&quot; Its the same thing with life in the universe. We know life can exist on earth type environment, so we start looking there</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the top comment explains it, but I'd like to reiterate that it's simply a case of what we <em>know</em> life looks, where it exists, and how it behaves. </p>
<p>As an analogy, imagine I asked you to find a dog, any dog. You know that it's possible for dogs to swim, but you wouldn't start your search in the middle of an ocean, you'd start somewhere on the land, probably in a dog park, because that's where you know dogs are most likely to be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Haldane and Oparin suggested that the early ocean contained the necessary chemicals to form life. They theorized that the Earth's atmosphere was not oxygen rich but reducing which would have allowed catalytic reactions to happen allowing the formation of early building blocks that could form to give complex molecules which can lead to early life.</p>
<p>25 years later, Miller and Urey conducted an experiment that was similar to Oparin's and Haldane's theory. They combined hydrogen, methane, ammonia and boiling water in a flask to represent what Earth was like before life and used electric sparks to catalyze the reaction. The end result was the formation of amino acids and nucleic acids.</p>
<p>If Haldane and Oparin are correct, the nucleic acids would be the simple molecules giving way to amino acids and proteins. </p>
<p>A theory that is widely popular in biology is the idea that life came from RNA because it would fit Haldane's and Oparin's theory. Ribozymes are RNA complexes that can act as enzymes to catalyze RNA expression. If RNA formed, it can form ribozymes which can bind and express RNA. We know that DNA  is read and translated to RNA which is transcribed into amino acids which forms proteins which forms tertiary structures like muscles.</p>
<p>We also know that organisms do not need &quot;nice&quot; conditions to survive. We have already discovered bacteria that live in highly acidic conditions with little oxygen for respiration. </p>
<p>If we're asking about having similar conditions for sustaining life, the answer is yes. Different conditions can sustain life. </p>
<p>If we're asking if different conditions can give rise to life, who knows? If we're going with the RNA-first theory then maybe all we need is carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and hydrogen along with some catalytic event to create nucleic acids and amino acids. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: Maybe? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
