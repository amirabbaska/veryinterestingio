		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am an engineer working on the Hudson yard project in Manhattan for the LIRR and I've worked on many other jobs with the Long Island rail road. The stone is actually a very good bearing material and is very carefully specified for carrying the weight of the train and providing good drainage for the ties beneath the rails. </p>
<p>Now about the whole stone on the track thing. Trains don't give a single fuck about pretty much anything on the tracks. Stones are reduced to dust. Coins are reminted. People and animals are exploded like meat filled balloons. </p>
<p>Don't fuck with trains. They don't care. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trains can be extremely heavy, this weight is focused upon the fairly small area of their wheels. The stones are actually called <em>track ballast</em> and help to spread the huge force from the train's wheels out over a larger area of ground. Without this ballast the ground underneath might sink unevenly. The sleepers (<em>cross ties</em>) of the tracks are not directly attached to the ballast which allows the track to have a little movement (e.g. as the track expands and contracts due to changes in temperature).</p>
<p>Stones are a good choice for this role because:  </p>
<ol>
<li>They are cheap.  </li>
<li>They can resist compressive loads well.  </li>
<li>Relatively low maintenance.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Also of note: ballast is itself built upon a foundation of earth (the <em>subgrade</em>) that helps to raise the track and further distribute load.</p>
<p>Other functions: stops plants growing around the tracks, allows water to drain away.</p>
<p>Are rocks a significant derailment hazard? Not really -- trains are massive and move quickly -- this enormous momentum means they smash right through most anything in their path. Rocks are typically turned to dust by the wheels of the train or thrown out of the way by the tremendous pressure of the wheels against the track.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The crushed stones are what is known as ballast. Their purpose is to hold the wooden cross ties in place, which in turn hold the rails in place.  You start with the bare ground, and then build up a foundation to raise the track high enough so it won't get flooded. On top of the foundation, you deposit a load of crushed stone (the ballast). On top of the stone, you lay down (perpendicular to the direction of the track) a line of wooden beams on 19.5 inch centers, 8 1/2 feet long, 9 inches wide and 7 inches thick, weighing about 200 pounds...3,249 of them per mile. You then continue to dump crushed stone all around the beams. The sharp edges of the stone make it difficult for them to slide over each other (in the way that smooth, round pebbles would), thus effectively locking them in place.<br />
This is all necessary because a train (depending on size) moving across the tracks can exert up to 1,000,000 pounds of moving pressure on the tracks</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Train driver here.  Slab track (or ballastless track) would be preferable over ballast any day.  It is basically track fixed directly to reinforced concrete slabs and has the advantage of increased stability and lower maintenance costs.  It is however expensive, so sleepers and ballast are used instead.  In some countries, slab track is used extensively on high speed, high frequency lines, such as Japan or around some areas where the track must be stable such as in tunnels or around stations.  This is of course dependant on the amount of investment in rail infrastructure!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
