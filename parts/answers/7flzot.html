		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>
<p>We know how big the Earth is because we can measure it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We can measure how strong gravity is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combining those, we can figure out Earth's mass.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combining mass and volume, we can figure out the Earth's average density.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The density you get from this is immediately weird - 5.5 g/cm^(3). When we measure all the rocks around us, the density is more like 3 g/cm^(3). In order for the <em>average</em> density of the Earth to be 5.5 g/cm^(3), there's got to be a lot of something even more dense so that Earth averages out to a density of 5.5 g/cm^(3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here's where earthquakes help us: Shear waves won't travel through liquid. When we measure <a href="https://i.imgur.com/XPYsXd5.jpg" target="_blank">which parts of the Earth actually receive shear waves</a> we see a big shadow zone, so we can tell there's a big ball of something liquid at the core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Based on the size of the shadow zone, we can figure out the radius of the core.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order for the average density to come out to 5.5 g/cm^(3), using the core's radius we can calculate its density must be somewhere around 7.9 g/cm^(3).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That incredible close to the density of iron, so that's a good candidate for the core material.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We also know that iron is super common in the universe (thanks to our understanding of how stars undergo fusion), so that further strengthens the case of iron as a good candidate.</p>
</li>
<li>Finally, we can measure how strong the Earth's magnetic field is. Based on our knowledge of how quickly Earth rotates and how dynamos work, we can determine that a rotating ball the size of our core and made of liquid iron produces a magnetic field that's just about the same strength as the one we measure.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: Earth's average density, earthquake shadow zones, and the strength of our planet's magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Pysicis combined with Geology, Seismology and Astronomy.</p>
<p>Longer answer:
Geology gives us a strong indication of what the earth is made of simply by digging up rock and looking at things like lava flows.</p>
<p>Seismographic data tells us how kinetic energy movies through the earth, this data is collected all over the earth and is timed and correlated to each-other.</p>
<p>Astronomy tells is what other objects in our solar system are made out of and what materials would have been common in the solar system as earth was forming and also gives the necessary data to assess the earths mass.</p>
<p>Physics ties it all together by using measurements of the magnetic field and its strength, measurements of the earths mass and gravity,  assessments of the data from seismology. Essentially these all paint a picture of the earths composition and it all points to an Iron Nickle core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides what people have already said, we can estimate earth's bulk composition from certain meteorites. The meteorites contain a lot more iron than crustal rocks do, and geochemistry tells us we can't put all the extra iron in the mantle because it's not very compatible with mantle rocks.</p>
<p>It turns out that the amount of iron you need to account for the excess density other people have mentioned is about the same as the amount you predict from meteorites.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When earthquakes happen the waves travel through the entire earth and can even be measured on the other side with accurate enough seismometers. The waves change depending on which material they pass through and from this we can measure the different layers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pardon me if this has already been mentioned, but the geomagnetic dynamo that creates earth's magnetic field makes a molten iron core, or outer core, likely, and although many metals are magnetic, iron is common enough in rocky bodies to make it the most likely constituent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
