		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Political parties are organized around hot button issues like taxes, civil rights, abortion, guns, religion, etc. The political parties and their lobbies and their most partisan voting base demand 100% fidelity to their issues. However, the actual work of governing requires compromise and adjustments to deal with new problems.</p>
<p>Take taxes as an example. Back in 1988 George H.W. Bush promised &quot;read my lips, no new taxes&quot; during his presidential campaign. Of course, GHW Bush wasn't really a true believer in supply side economics and he was just saying what his political base wanted to hear. He had also made promises to reduce the deficit and balance the budget. </p>
<p>During his first term in office, Iraq invades Kuwait and GHW Bush leads us into war. As a practical person, Bush knew that he couldn't go to war, cut taxes and balance the budget. Those 3 things can't happen at the same time. So Bush raised some taxes to pay for the war, but he was labeled a &quot;flip flopper&quot; in the 1992 election and he lost to Bill Clinton (with some help from Ross Perot).</p>
<p>GHW Bush was almost certainly &quot;right&quot; to raise some taxes to pay for the war. His only other alternative was to add more deficit spending to pay for the war effort, which would have broken a different campaign promise (though maybe a less politically costly mistake). GHW Bush's rivals in the Republican party criticized him over &quot;flip flopping&quot; on taxes. His Democrat opponents also used the &quot;flip flop&quot; criticism, even though they agreed that it was right to raise taxes to pay for the war, because they only cared about winning the election. Your political opponents will almost never compliment you for reaching across the aisle to compromise, because they want to win elections. Instead, they'll attack you as a &quot;flip flopper&quot; because it will cost you votes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because their views often &quot;change&quot; <em>after</em> they have been elected while supposedly endorsing a particular view (and getting voted in partially based on that).</p>
<p>After they are in power, changing views would almost necessarily push them <em>further</em> from the voting population since those original views were what got them voted in originally. Why shouldn't this be criticized?</p>
<p>Also, politicians are public figures and get criticized for <em>everything</em>. If they don't change their views, then they get criticized for never changing their views, instead, possibly by a completely different critic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple reasons. First is we love &quot;Gotcha!&quot; news. &quot;OH! We caught you in a lie or you said something else, you're in trouble now!&quot; That simple idea is much easier to understand and grasp on to than &quot;well this person thought carefully and adjusted their position.&quot;</p>
<p>Now there is some legitimacy in calling some &quot;flip-flopping&quot; cases out. Occasionally a politician is pandering or trying to take both sides of an argument. Sometimes someone will say something in a red state and say basically the opposite in a blue state... in some cases it's clear they either don't have a position but are just saying what the people they are in front of want to hear.</p>
<p>The issue is that there have been some times when a politician was correctly called out for such behavior, but that just leads to people to want to see more of it. That inevitably leads to &quot;this person said the country wasn't ready yet for gay marriage when the country was largely opposed to it, but now that the majority of people in polls support it they're pushing for legalization of gay marriage... they're a total flip-flopper&quot; which may be pandering, but also could be respecting the will of the people or changing their mind along with the rest of the country over the course of a couple decades. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quite a number of issues here, really.</p>
<ul>
<li>When they campaign on a specific stance or issue, and then change it as soon as they're in power, it appears (and generally is) disingenuous. If they espoused that opinion during the election, they wouldn't have gotten elected.</li>
<li>When they make a strong stance on principal, and see that it's not getting them any support, they swap it to match the prevailing political winds, it comes across as fickle and pandering.</li>
<li>Regardless of the reasons for a politician changing their mind (including gaining more information or the situation changing - which usually makes the change legitimate and thoughtful), their opponents are going to hammer home the idea of flip-flopping because it is in THEIR best interests to make the other appear weak or indecisive.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bottom line: Whenever a politician changes their mind on an issue, the question &quot;why&quot; has to be front-and-centre in the mouth of the populace.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is like the old saying goes, &quot;A man who stands for nothing will fall for anything&quot;. People expect politicians to have thought long and hard about their ideologies and positions on issues. Politicians are not supposed to just change their ideas based on what is popular.</p>
<p>An isolated flip-flop can be tolerated, but if a politician is doing it all the time you should not trust them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
