		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, the mutation rate for different species is not the same. For example in humans it's about 1.2*10^(-8) per base pair per generation. This can vary even within the human population though -- older fathers have more mutated sperm, which is why paternal age correlates to health problems. It can certainly vary between species, though I don't know by how much.</p>
<p>In particular, bacteria reproduce asexually (mitosis) while humans reproduce sexually (meiosis). The latter is a more error-prone process than the former. [EDIT: not the full story, see /u/EasySeven 's reply]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution and mutation rate are two dfferent things. If a species only produces &quot;bad&quot; mutations, then selection just weeds those bad mutations out. But what a &quot;bad&quot; mutation is, depends on the environment, so the same mutation can be bad in one environment and good in another.</p>
<p>Then there is also the population size. A larger population produces more mutations than a smaller population (seems logical of you think about it). A larger population is also likely to have more genetic diversity. </p>
<p>Evolution works on selection pressure on genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is created by mutations. </p>
<p>To answer you question: bacteria tend to have a larger population size than multi-cellular organisms, even than humans. It is hard to generalize, but I guess selection pressure is also higher in bacteria. So, yes, bacteria are probably evolving faster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First things first, the rate of evolution is not the same as the rate of mutation. Evolution refers to how individuals adapt to their environment while mutation is just changes in genetic sequence. </p>
<p>Now, the human body is remarkable at preventing mutations. Mutations primarily happen during replication (the process where DNA is copied). In this process the DNA double helix is opened up by various proteins, and then an enzyme latches onto the DNA string and slides across it, while catalyzing the reaction that adds the complimentary Nucleotide. </p>
<p>A core feature of DNA is that it's reverse complimentary, meaning that every single nucleotide compliments another one. There are four nucleotides in DNA, Adenine and Thymine always bond, and Guanine and Cytosine always bond. So DNA is copied by splitting the DNA double helix, and having an enzyme catalyze the addition of the complimentary nucleotides to the DNA string, which ends in two copies of the original DNA strand.</p>
<p>So already that enzyme which catalyzes the addition makes it so that  only complimentary nucleotides can be added. But in one out of every thousand additions, a wrong nucleotide is added. But another enzyme checks the additions, and removes wrongly added nucleotides. Together these two mechanisms makes it so that only 1 in a 1,000,000 nucleotides is a wrong one. And finally another repair system &quot;The mismatch repair system&quot; checks the newly synthesized DNA  strand one final time after the synthesis is done, and cuts out any wrongly synthesised parts. In total these three mechanisms make is so that only 1 in 10^9 mistakes are made when synthesising DNA. </p>
<p>This mechanism is present in both bacteria and humans, thus the two mutate at rougly mutate at the same rate. </p>
<p>Now the reason that Bacteria can evolve more quickly than humans is because of something called horizontal gene transfer, which is a way in which different bacteria exchange DNA in the form of plasmids (DNA pieces seperate form the circular DNA in bacteria) that can be exchanged between bacteria. This mechanism does so that Bacteria are incredibly efficient at exchanging DNA, and it is through these exchanges that something like antibiotic resistance can quickly spread through an entire bacterial population in a very short amount of time. </p>
<p>Naturally this discounts the environmental factors, to which bacteria are much more exposed, which also cause mutations.</p>
<p>So in short, bacteria and human cells mutate at the same rate, but bacteria are much more efficient at transfering any beneficial mutations between one another and thus &quot;evolve&quot; faster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.  Depending on &quot;how good&quot; the molecular mechanics is, and how long (i.e. how many potential places there are to have a mutation), the mutation rate will vary between species.  A couple other people have mentioned those numbers and compared humans to other species.</p>
<p>I'm going to also add that it can vary with position in the genome, and environmental conditions.  For example, your immune system has some cells that produce antibodies, and the antibodies are coded for in their DNA.  However, when the immune system senses that it's under attack, some of these specific cells undergo what is called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatic_hypermutation" target="_blank">Somatic Hypermutation</a>&quot; -- there is a special mechanism that makes the particular regions of DNA that codes for antibodies mutate up to a million times faster than everything else.  This results in many different cells with different antibodies; the ones that work get used (they divide <em>without</em> the mutation system turned on), while the ones that don't don't.</p>
<hr />
<p>E: Another example: HIV is known for it's very high mutation rate: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26375597" target="_blank">(4.1 ± 1.7) × 10^(-3) per base per cell</a>.  That's on the order of 100k times faster than other things, and is part of the reason it's so hard to fight off.  That number is high enough that in a &quot;full-scale&quot; HIV infection, the virus can experiment with changing every base pair in its genome <em>every day</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only is the rate different between species, it can be different between genes within the same species.  Some organisms have mechanisms that selectively increase the mutation rate of targeted portions of their genome.  For example, our immune systems recognize pathogens by their surface proteins, so it is advantageous to mutate these proteins more rapidly than ones in their metabolic pathways.  This is a naturally occurring version of site-directed mutagenesis.</p>
<p>One way this is achieved is by carrying broken copies or fragments of the genes near the functional copy.  These can incorrectly bind to the functional gene and increase the chance of a copy error.</p>
