		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure what &quot;everything else&quot; you're thinking of here, if &quot;we understand their effect on matter&quot; is something you take as given.</p>
<p>We have observed stars orbiting seemingly empty space as if there were a massive object there, and we don't have candidates for dark objects of the necessary mass apart from black holes. We have observed systems where gas is heated to extreme temperatures as it spirals into an otherwise invisible massive object, which again we have not been able to explain except as a black hole accretion disk. We have direct observations of stellar orbits around our galaxy's central mass, consistent with a supermassive black hole and pretty much nothing else (given the necessary density of the central object for the closest stellar orbits to avoid hitting it).</p>
<p>We have gravitational wave observations from LIGO that quite precisely match theoretical and computational models of black holes spinning together to merge into a single larger (rotating) black hole; the fact that those observations are such a close match to the theory and its consequences is strong evidence that the details of our theories are quite accurate.</p>
<p>So while I'd love to be able to take a spaceship out to a black hole and perform experiments right there in person, I feel like our understanding of black holes at this point has (very) roughly the same level of experimental evidence that our understanding of, say, neutron stars or red supergiant stars has. What else do you want to know about them that <em>isn't</em> covered by that?</p>
<p>(One immediate possibility: &quot;What happens when you cross the event horizon and head inside?&quot; But I might claim that in that case, we don't &quot;know&quot; the answer theoretically/hypothetically, either. There's a guess, based on the equivalence principle, that for a big enough black hole you wouldn't even notice that you'd crossed that line, at least not until you discovered that you could no longer escape the central singularity. But 1) it's well-established theoretically that you wouldn't be able to report back on your experience anyway, so this is essentially impossible to check as far as we know, and 2) as far as I know, there's still active debate among quantum gravity/string theory researchers about whether there's some sort of &quot;firewall&quot; that would inevitably annihilate you the moment you reached the event horizon, due to quantum requirements that kinda seem to contradict the equivalence principle in this situation. So I don't think this question really fits what you're asking about, either.)</p>
<p>Edit: A couple of people have pointed out that Hawking radiation counts quite nicely as something hypothetical/purely theoretical that we haven't been able to measure yet. That's a great point!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We know they exist and understand their effect on matter. But is everything else just hypothetical</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Your phrasing is still incorrect. Scientists will say that black holes exist because there is no better explanation for observations. &quot;Everything else&quot; we know about black holes is also determined in the same way. There aren't two categories of knowledge on black holes. It is a sliding scale of uncertainty.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Edit: The scientific community does not enjoy the use of the word theory. I can't change the title but it should say hypothetical rather than theoretical </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, theoretical is a better term than hypothetical, scientifically, for this. The reason is that there is theory to explain things about a black hole other than that it exists. The problem is that your question implies that theory is the same as guessing. If you want to irritate a scientist, tell him that scientific theory is &quot;just a theory&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between direct and indirect evidence. In science, the former is valued more than the latter.</p>
<p>This is why the Higgs boson announcement in 2012 was received so well (and also why Messieurs Higgs and Englert got the Nobel Prize for it only after this confirmation), even though we were relatively confident, on theoretical grounds, in the existence of the bosons.</p>
<p>We don't &quot;know&quot; that black holes exist. This is not a claim I have ever heard anyone in the science community make.</p>
<p>What we do know is the following: general relativity is remarkable well-tested (and has that quality of mathematical elegance and &quot;beauty&quot; that has been correlated with truth in the history of science) and admits as one possible solution to its equations remarkably simple objects (&quot;simple&quot; in the sense that they can be described with remarkably few parameters -- for a Schwarzchild black hole, in fact, only one number, the mass). The prediction of the theory is that such objects must be extremely massive to remain stable, and have a strong enough gravitational pull that light cannot escape from them. However, just because these mathematical solutions are compatible with general relativity does not mean that they are realized in nature. With that said, we are fairly confident that there are conditions created during the natural evolution of the universe for which no known force is able to stop objects in those conditions from collapsing in on themselves. Two well-known examples are very heavy neutron stars (for which we can calculate a semi-precise number for &quot;how heavy&quot;) and the centers of large galaxies such as our own. In such conditions, one solution we know compatible with general relativity is a black hole. There are also other solutions compatible with general relativity -- quark stars being an example. But we don't have well-established theories for such objects, and in any case even quark stars will eventually form a black hole at large enough mass.</p>
<p>Of course, there is a continuum in the &quot;directness&quot; of measurements. The better grip we have on the observations, the more fundamental they are, the more the sources of background are understood -- the more we can be confident in ruling out causes other than black holes for those observations.</p>
<p>Direct observations of black holes (i.e. pointing a telescope at them and looking for a gap in the sky) are quite challenging, but are being attempted at this moment. I believe there is a telescope pointed at the center of our galaxy where we do expect a black hole to be present, looking for obstructions in front of background stars. I don't know how likely it is that they will find anything.</p>
<p>But indirect observations, such as the recent LIGO discovery of a gravitational wave pattern that fits quite well the expected profile from the merger of two black holes, and the speeds of stars orbiting the putative black hole at the center of our galaxy, point to it being very likely that black holes exist.</p>
<p>Whether or not these indirect observations warrant a rethinking of the label &quot;theoretical&quot; as applied to the current state of our knowledge, is a question best left to lexicographers and not to physicists. Certainly I find such discussions about labels a complete waste of time. No physicist stays up at night worrying about whether some other person calls their knowledge &quot;theoretical&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't <em>know</em> they exist and we understand even less about what happens to matter inside a black hole.</p>
<p>Black holes are <em>not</em> guaranteed to exist.  I would say healthy skepticism about them is good.</p>
<p>We think that they may exist, and our current understanding of physics says they should exist.  There is also some circumstantial evidence supporting their existence (inferred from observations).  </p>
<p>But I cannot stress this enough: We don't really know.  Lots of astronomers and cosmologists are on the black hole bandwagon but the fact of the matter is that the physics describing them ends up producing lots of divide by 0 errors and infinities, which is at least a tad uncomfortable (usually it's a sign your theories are incomplete).  Then there is that whole debacle about information being destroyed that plagued theoreticians for decades until they did lots of mental gymnastics to work around the problem.  But singularities themselves are bizarre and our understanding of physics breaks down.  What happens to matter inside a black hole?  We have no way of knowing.  And we may never be able to know.  To me explanations that are untestable are more like religion than actual physics. Basically, it sounds a lot like we don't know what we are talking about, when you look at black holes very closely.</p>
<p>They are attractive though -- they are the natural conclusion if you take our understanding of gravity to the extreme.</p>
<p>However, until there is direct observational and/or experimental evidence confirming their existence, it's entirely possible they <em>don't</em> really exist except as solutions to our equations that as it turns out don't describe reality accurately.</p>
<p>There are objects we have observed that look like black holes (in that they are very massive and emit almost no light).  One such object is Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy.  We have observed stars orbiting it at relativistic speeds.  It must be ginormous -- on the order of millions of suns.  And yet it gives off no radiation.  We think that's a black hole.</p>
<p>It could very well be that it's something else entirely.  Some exotic matter we are unaware of that has physics we don't know about.</p>
<p>Or it could be a black hole.</p>
<p>But the existence of black holes is by no means 100% a certainty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have lots of evidence due to the motion of the stars very close to them. (Source: I work on exactly that) And a combination of how much mass in a small space is required for the stars to move that fast, do not leave any other possibility than a black hole. Have a look at this video for example. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_gggKHvfGw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_gggKHvfGw</a></p>
<p>We measure the tracks of each star very accurately. Basically you see a sudden acceleration of the stars when they get close to a certain spot. One can use basic dynamics to figure out how much mass is necessary in order for stars to move this fast. These are not crazy claculations, its basically the same thing used for when predicting how the earth moves around the sun. And then you cannot see a star or any light from that spot where the stars all circle around. So the only explanation for having so much mass in such a tiny space is a black-hole.</p>
<p>In addition to stellar dynamics going around a BH we also observe its X-ray signature. Because contrary to what it sounds like a black hole is often not dark but quite active due to accreting surrounding gas. We call them AGN (Active Galactic Nuclei). And signatures from such accretion evens are regularly observed in the X-rays.</p>
<p>There is also an extremely exciting campaign going on with GRAVITY an instrument that can resolve extremely small spatial scales (<a href="http://www.mpe.mpg.de/372679/Science" target="_blank">http://www.mpe.mpg.de/372679/Science</a>) to look  as close as we can get towards the event horizon of a black hole. </p>
<p>So no, black holes are not just &quot;theoretical&quot;. They are a astrophysical necessity and their properties like their mass, and accretion are quite well studied. However, obviously due to their &quot;dark&quot; nature if they are not accreting of course one cannot just take a picture of them as of normal stars and galaxies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
