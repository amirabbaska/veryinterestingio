		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You throw up because your brain thinks you're suffering from poisoning, and that's the only solution it has. It doesn't actually care about if your stomach actually has anything in it. Until the perceived &quot;poisoning&quot; goes away, it continues the &quot;corrective action&quot;.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, this is why people get motion sickness: when the visual data your eyes give you conflicts with the motion data from your inner ear, the brain short circuits and assumes that you have been poisioned - why else would the ground be moving like that! - and so begins the &quot;purge everything&quot; protocol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
