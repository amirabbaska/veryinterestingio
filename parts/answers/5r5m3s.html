The most extreme example was &quot;Featherstonehaugh&quot;, which is apparently pronounced &quot;Fan-shaw&quot;.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is normal in many languages to allow different spelling and pronounciation of names, be it people names or geographical.</p>
<p>In this case it's just a matter of old saxon roots of those names and the &quot;cester&quot; being pronounced as &quot;ster&quot;.</p>
<p>There are plenty of towns in the are that follow this rule, like Towcester (pronounced toaster).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no easy answer to this question because many place names have unique etymologies for a variety of reasons, but the two first ones are the result of assimilation processes in which the unstressed -ces- syllable merges into the broader word. I'm actually not quite sure where many Americans (and I only say thus because I've heard &quot;Leichester Square&quot; on many a tube ride from confused tourists) got the idea that there's a &quot;ch&quot; sound there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
