		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason for motion sickness summed up in a few words is we simply haven't evolved fast enough to get over it. </p>
<p>Your eyes and ears have to agree with each other. It's only become a problem recently because before the last few hundred years you weren't capable of flying or trains or cars or rockets where you moved extraordinarily fast. So your eyes see you moving but your vestibular system, which is in your ear, keeps a fluid in it to sense balance. If you're in a car maintaining speed, your eyes say &quot;dear God almighty this is fast so much is moving Jesus!!!&quot; Meanwhile your ears are saying, &quot;dude idk what you're smoking but we are standing still right now chill out&quot;. </p>
<p>Your brain doesn't like the miscommunication and thus you feel sick trying to process it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former flight instructor here. I find the tendency to get sick can be cured by repeated <em>short</em> exposures to motion. The sick feeling almost always takes some amount of time to get started: if you end the exposure <em>before</em> it sets in, the student now has a sickness-free flight under his belt. Lather, rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Your subconscious mind learns from <em>success</em>, not from <em>failure</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

As an adolescent, I didn't have this problem until I was left on the egg scrabbler too long. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbStkyz3_qI" target="_blank">Something like this.</a> What happened that made me more sensitive to being spun?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I love how not a single person has answered the question. Everyone is just giving advice on how to get over it. </p>
<p>I wonder if it has something to do with inner ear sensitivity? Or maybe the viscosity of the ear fluid? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You build up a resistance from exposure, and some people expose themselves often as children without realizing (reading on the bus).</p>
<p>Still, it seems to be based more off genetics; some people just seem to have a stronger response to that intoxication effect than others.</p>
<p>By intoxication, I mean, motion sickness is your brain thinking you've been poisoned, since some natural poisons will dilute your inner ear, causing identical symptoms. Very similar to allergies. Why are some people allergic? Genes, but beyond that, it's still an open question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
