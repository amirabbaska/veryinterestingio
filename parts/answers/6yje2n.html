The highest sustained winds in recorded history are all in the 180-190 mph range which almost makes it seem like there is an imaginary cap of some sorts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jose just became a hurricane, following closely behind Irma, which I am assuming (perhaps incorrectly) is sucking energy out of the ocean beneath it as it goes.
(<a href="http://media.nbcmiami.com/images/1200*675/jose-irma.jpg" target="_blank">http://media.nbcmiami.com/images/1200*675/jose-irma.jpg</a>)
Images of other hurricanes' cold wakes give a scale that implies Jose is within the cold wake of Irma
(<a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/upload/2006/09/ioke_sst_anom_2006.png" target="_blank">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/intersection/files/upload/2006/09/ioke_sst_anom_2006.png</a>)
Does the ocean reheat faster than the second image implies? Was there more energy in the ocean before Irma and the residual is enough to supply Jose with more energy? Is Jose getting it from elsewhere? If there was residual energy enough to supply a second hurricane, is there a maximum absorption or an equilibrium point for hurricane &lt;--&gt; ocean energy exchange?
Sorry for the gatling gun questions, very curious! Thanks in advance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
