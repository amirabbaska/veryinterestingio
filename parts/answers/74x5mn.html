		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good marketing that takes advantage of a current trend with low risk.</p>
<p>Why only limited locations? Because they literally can only do that or nothing, they can't release the product more broadly because their supply chain for large production is MASSIVE and <em>SLOW</em>.</p>
<p>Like, I don't think you have an idea of how massively complicated it is for McDonalds to release a new product. I recall an anecdote from one of McD's corporate chefs (the people designing new products and evaluating the existing menu) about how they forewent introducing blueberry milkshakes at one point because releasing that to McDonalds'es throughout America would have required them to buy up <em>80% of all blueberries produced in North America that year</em>. The amount of work and preparation that goes into making a new McDonalds product to release world-wide or just in North America is <em>INSANE</em>.</p>
<p>Remember, the original sauce was a marketing tie-in with a major Disney animated movie, they are not going to do anything close to that for a meme spawned from some random cartoon. But, the people aware of that meme, are also people likely to hear about a limited, smaller scale marketing stunt, meaning McDonalds can get a pretty big chunk of positive marketing with the nerd crowd from the small investment of one of the chefs in the R&amp;D lab cooking up a batch of Szechuan sauce and that being distributed to a couple of locations and notable personages. In fact the exclusivity only makes this kind of marketing even more effective.</p>
<p>So, tl;dr :They got <em>some</em> positive marketing from it without needing to turn their big, expensive supply chain to produce what would likely be a fad product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I couldn't say for sure, but I have a good idea why. </p>
<p>I actually live about 5 minutes from one of the participating locations. The event was supposed to begin at 2pm, so me and my friends headed over around 1:30 knowing there would be lines and stuff. We get there and find out they basically gave tickets to the first 17 customers at time of opening for the SEVENTEEN PACKETS OF SAUCE they were shipped. This is a major location on a busy road in a decent-sized city.</p>
<p>I don't care too much cuz I was really there for the novelty of the whole thing, but I start to feel bad. People are showing up in R&amp;M tshirts. People are showing up cosplaying Rick. We find out early what's going on but the giant line has no idea.</p>
<p>We're starving so we get some of the buttermilk tenders anyway. We're there...and hungry...and we waited in line for 20 minutes, and I assume that was the strategy. You have a metric fuckton of people who showed up for a special event and are gonna be disappointed, but a lot of them will spend some money anyway after they chew your staff out. You didn't spend a ton of money on the ingredients and machinery needed to manufacture enough szechuan sauce for everyone to be happy.</p>
<p>The moral of the story is McDonald's is a shitty corporation. They essentially faked a special event to make quick, easy cash at the expense of their employees, who I heard getting yelled at by a bunch of angry nerds the whole time I waited for my food.</p>
<p>Edit: by the way, the buttermilk tenders were awful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s marketing. Rick and Morty built it up and then McDonalds underdelivered. </p>
<p>Anyways I am at the location in LA that had sauce. A fight broke out and they’re closing the store. A couple people got packets, but lots of people disappointed. Realistically everyone here knew they weren’t likely to get the sauce but we cane to have a good time and it was ruined by violence. </p>
<p>Just thought you’d like a firsthand account of someone waiting in line. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
