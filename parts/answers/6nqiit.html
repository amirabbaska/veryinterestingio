		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smell requires the actual presence of actual particles to reach your nose </p>
<p>Sharks really can smell blood from miles away, <em>after the blood has drifted through the water</em>. They can smell the incredibly tiny amount of blood that has drifted miles away from its source and follow the trail to find an injured animal to eat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>secondary question: </p>
<p>How long would it take for around 1 litre of blood to be detectable by a shark from a mile away?</p>
<p>or how long for a particle of blood from 1 litre travel 1 mileacross the ocean in average conditions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can't. </p>
<p>The &quot;from X miles away&quot; formulation is meant to demonstrate just how sensitive their noses are.  </p>
<p>As in, &quot;If you took some amount of blood and freely mixed it in water until it was highly dilute, then the shark could still pick it up at [impressive] distance.&quot;   It's not meant to imply that the shark can detect the blood from that distance even in the absence of the particles actually getting there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is not the blood, but the electrical contractions made by the muscles.</p>
<p>Sharks have these structures called Ampules of Lorenzini in their snouts that detect electrochemical signals of muscle contraction in the water.  </p>
<p>Blood detection is one thing, but muscle twitching is radar for food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
