		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you go to a website, your computer first asks your DNS server (likely ran by your ISP) to translate the domain name into an IP address, eg pornhub.com to 31.192.120.36. Your computer then connects to the server at that IP address, and asks that computer &quot;Send me pornhub.com/kinkyvideo&quot;.</p>
<p>You never asked your ISP for the URL. You asked your DNS server (again, likely ran by your ISP unless you changed it) to translate the domain name to an IP address, then all of the rest of the communication was between you and the pornhub server, your ISP isn't involved past being the carrier of the data.</p>
<p>Now, if your connection is not encrypted, anyone between you an the remote server (such as your ISP) can see the contents of your communications. They can see &quot;oh hey, clevertoucan just requested pornhub.com/kinkyvideo'. However, if the connection is encrypted, all that your ISP knows is &quot;clevertoucan just looked up the address for pornhub.com, then there was a stream of encrypted communication between the them.&quot; They have no knowledge of what is within that communication, including no knowledge of the specific URLs you visited.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>to add to what people have already added, if you have HTTPS between you and the server the ISP also can't tamper with the message (such as injecting ads into your page)</p>
<p>and if you want to block even the destination from your ISP you can use a proxy, basically this is a site that you make a request to and they make the request to the server for you and send back the response...from the ISPs perspective all they see is you talking to a proxy. so long as the proxy isn't ALSO selling your browsing history (this also goes for VPNs)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
