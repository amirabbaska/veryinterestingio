		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cholesterol is used by the body to build cells and transport nutrients.  So some is good and needed.  The problem comes from too much of the &quot;low density&quot; or LDL type.  This stuff is big and fluffy and has a tendency to get stuck in arteries and blood vessels.  This makes your heart have to pump harder and wears it out faster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cholesterol is a building block for hormones (like testosterone and estrogen) as well as a huge component of the membrane that surrounds cells (cells are the building block of organs/tissues and the membrane is like the wall that defines the cells).</p>
<p>When you get your cholesterol measured you measure fat and cholesterol carriers not cholesterol itself, namely you measure what's called LDL, HDL and VLDL mainly which are made of proteins, cholesterol and fatty acids primarily. These are just based on density you see if you suspend them all in a tube (low density lipoprotien, high density lipoprotien and very low density lipoprotien). </p>
<p>Basically when you eat stuff your intestines absorb the good stuff (amino acids which make up proteins, fats, sugars and cholesterol). Unfortunately unlike amnio acids and sugars, fat doesn't dissolve that well in water (thus blood since blood is 55% water) so the body makes droplets of fat (think like droplets of oil) and to make it dissolve better it packages cholesterol in it which is kinda like soap in that it is partially soluble in water and partially soluble in oil. When it initially is from the intestines it's termed a chylomicron which goes to liver and then is reformed to VLDL which is simply a repackaged lipid droplet from the liver. Liver always gets first dibs on anything you eat because of a direct blood flow from intestines to it. VLDL gives fats to tissues and becomes IDL and it also picks up cholesterol from the tissues and that then gives away its proteins to a precursor HDL and in the process it essentially becomes LDL (it also picks up cholesterol from the HDL).</p>
<p>LDL has a main function of bringing cholesterol to the tissues from the liver (which gets it from our diet) while HDL has the opposite function of bringing cholesterol from tissues to the liver. You need both since we definitely need to bring cholesterol to tissues but we also need to pick up excess cholesterol from cells, maintaining optimal levels are key.</p>
<p>Now LDL has been implicated in contributing to atherosclerosis and that is a more complicated and less understood mechanism but essentially you Want to keep both HDL and LDL levels optimal. If you have too much LDL it can oxidize in your blood vessels and cause the formation of foam cells which cause them to inflame and get narrower so circulating blood gets harder so your body raises blood pressure to compensate (kinda like drinking water through a compressed straw vs a non compressed straw, you need more force through the compressed one) and to do this your heart beats harder and you can get more damage to your vessels and other complications.</p>
<p>TLDR: LDL and HDL are what you measure when checking cholesterol levels, too much and too little is bad because you need cholesterol for a lot of stuff but too much can lead to a whole host of other issues like heart disease.</p>

<p>Edit: Guys I'm not a doctor, while I appreciate that you find me informative and are looking for advice, I'm not qualified to give medical or nutritional advice. If your doctor isn't communicating to you about your conditions or the risks associated with chokes sufficiently then bring it to their attention that you'd like to know more about it or ask another doctor who's qualified on the matter. Take everything you read online or hear from someone else with a grain of salt and skepticism and look to gain knowledge from peer reviewed scientific literature but even then don't take what's given as gospel, but rather look for consensus among the scientific community </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cholesterol is a building block for many essential things in your body. It is decidedly good.</p>
<p>However, it was observed that people who have heart attacks often ( 50%ish) have high cholesterol, and that the plaque in arteriosclerosis is partially cholesterol. So someone decided that having high cholesterol is bad for you.</p>
<p>It gets more complicated when your realize they don't measure cholesterol, they measure specific proteins that transport cholesterol.</p>
<p>So, if you have an elevated level of some cholesterol-proteins, your chance of having a heart attack is greater. That's why they are called bad cholesterol. ( In my opinion there are a few steps missing in the chain of logic, though.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cholesterol is a building block found in all living animal cells. It is necessary for normal cell function and production of hormones in the body. </p>
<p>You obtain some cholesterol from your diet (animal products), but the largest source of cholesterol is from the production in your own liver. This is why the science behind reducing cholesterol in your diet has not reliably shown to reduce your blood levels. Genetics and metabolism play a much larger role. </p>
<p>There are different forms of the cholesterol in your blood, which depends on its density. Some forms are &quot;good&quot; cholesterol (HDL), and some are &quot;bad&quot; cholesterol (LDL). &quot;Bad&quot; cholesterol has been shown to be an important contributor to the production of plaques in your arteries. If these plaques form in your heart arteries, it can lead to heart attacks; if they form in the arteries to the brain, it can lead to a stroke. Other important risk factors include age, being overweight, high blood pressure, and smoking. &quot;Good&quot; cholesterol (HDL) have a protective effect on your health.</p>
<p>The most effective way to reduce LDL cholesterol is through maintaining a healthy weight, and medications such as statins when needed. The most effective way of increasing HDL is through exercise. </p>
