		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is efficient to use the heat from a power plant to heat buildings. First the the steam is used to spin the turbines for electricity production. The steam is still hot but to  extract more heat from the steam  the turbine blades would have to be enormous. The pressure is below atmospheric pressure. To condense the steam cooling towers are used. Or the heat can be routed to warm buildings. The building have to be close.</p>
<p>The engineers have figured this all out. They are really smart and use a lot of math.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Simply put</p>
<p>The district heating system is used for both heating and cooling of buildings where available.  Using the steam generated by power plants and large boiler plants makes sense to building owners because they can heat without a boiler(don't have to buy gas, don't need an engineer to run it) and cool the building using an absorption chiller which uses the steam heat to generate chilled water instead of an electric chiller which would have an expensive electric bill for comfort cooling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAB1gesb8cQ" target="_blank">Short video from NYT</a>. One reason is that a blizzard destroyed all of the above-ground power lines. Since they had to dig and lay down all of those power lines, they decided to also lay down steam pipes and build around that technology.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>where in other parts of the world use boilers and pipes?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>In large parts of Europe there's district heating.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_heating#National_variation" target="_blank">See this list on wikipedia</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a whole, the European Union currently generates 11% of its electricity using cogeneration, saving Europe an estimated 35 Mtoe per annum. However, there are large differences between the member states, with energy savings ranging from 2% to 60%. Europe has the three countries with the worldâ€™s most intensive cogeneration economies: Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland.</p>
