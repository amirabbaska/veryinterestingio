		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When nerve cells want to convey information they send action potentials (APs) to communicate to other cells. In the simple model the AP will reach the end (terminal bouton, yes I did spell that correctly) where there is a gap (synapse) to another neuron. A chemical (neurotransmitter) will be released that will cause the neuron on the other side to also fire an AP.</p>
<p>Of course the reality is a bit messier than that. Whilst this picture is definitely true not all neurotransmitters are excitatory. Most of them are excitatory, but some of them are inhibitory.</p>
<p>Imagine a neuron firing and causing another neuron downstream to fire. These neurons are now synchronised. And if this carried on then eventually all of your neurons would be synchronised. So it is important that neurons can not only turn other neurons on but also to turn them off - the switch needs to go in both directions. Otherwise you could end up was a cascade failure where a few neurons firing ended up exciting all the other neurons and then your whole brain would be synchronised and you'd have no control.</p>
<p>Flashing lights - in those sensitive to photoepilepsy - cause a specific synchronised firing in the nerve pathways leading from the eyes into the Lateral Geniculate Nuclei (an important relay centre) and the Occipital lobe. We don't know exactly what happens as a pathway from here, but the belief is that this heavy synchronised firing spreads to the rest of the brain which is sensitive to excitatory inputs and have no areas firing more strongly to compete.</p>
<p>Note: it is not about the overall amount of &quot;electricity&quot; - inhibitory neurons carry just as much &quot;electricity&quot; as excitatory ones. It is about the synchronisation of the firing. I put &quot;electricity&quot; in &quot;&quot; because the voltage is carried by ions not electrons, so it's not electricity like you have in the wires in your house.</p>
<p>Note2: As others have pointed out lots of other things can cause these seizures and the mechanisms are not well understood. I used to have a friend who's epilepsy was caused by alcohol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Monitor flicker would do the same thing, my first 2 of 3 total grand mal seizures occurred when I was in front of the early computer monitors (early '70s).  I found out much too late that there was a class action lawsuit, apparently I wasn't the only one affected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both of my kiddos actually have seizures.
My youngest has complex febrile seizures (seizures from fevers) that last up to an hour. His body doesn't know how to control a fever as well as it should. For instance, the last time he had a seizure, his fever started at 99.3 and jumped to 105.8 in 15 minutes, resulting in the hour long seizure (typically any seizure over 5 minutes is at an emergency level). This doesn't include the postical time either.
My oldest has a condition known as Doose's Syndrome, which means he has multiple types of seizures and they are extremely hard to control with medication. He has drop, absent, myoclonic, tonic clonic (gran mal), temporal lobe, and complex febrile. His triggers include fever, dehydration, missed dose, upset tummy, hitting his head, lights, and lack of sleep.
The best way I've been able to explain seizures to people is this: your brain is firing neurons all day, and when a seizure happens, it's because a neuron has came out of left field and messed up the &quot;normal&quot; neurons daily order. When this happens, the brain goes into a panic mode and sends out everything (start of the seizure). Once the brain figures out it was just a left field neuron, it starts to take control of the body again (entering postical phase) and then the brain returns to normal (end of seizure), and the person usually sleeps for a while since seizures are exhausting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
