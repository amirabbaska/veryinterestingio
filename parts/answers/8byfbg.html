		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The broad base is to support the structure, as you go up, the radius gets smaller to allow for a faster flow of vapour out of the tower (warm vapour will tend to go upwards and by reducing the area, you force it to go faster). On the top of the tower, you have the mixing between the vapour and the cold outside air. You would want this mixing to be as best as possible so increasing the radius a bit helps with this.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hyperboloid shape is able to be constructed using only straight lines (i.e. the curve doesn't need to be built into the raw materials). This makes it almost as easy (read: cheap) to construct as a standard cylinder, while providing enhanced cooling properties due to the airflow that the shape generates. So essentially it's just a simple improvement on a cylindrical tower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The hyperboloid shape also aids in accelerating the upward convective air flow, improving cooling efficiency. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's part of the reason for the shape. I suppose, by narrowing the diameter toward the top, the rising air gets compressed and won't cool down as much. Cooler air inside the tower would slow down airflow. As for the wider radius at the outlet, I am not sure. Could be to prevent water condensed on the tower wall from dripping down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
