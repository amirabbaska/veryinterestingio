<p>There are several reasons.</p>
<p>First, visibility. The rider is able to see traffic much better when riding at one edge or the other of a lane rather than the middle. Furthermore, other traffic is able to see the rider much better when the rider is closer to the edge of the lane, as they are more visible to oncoming traffic (which is why you'll generally see the rider on the <em>left</em> side of the lane on a two lane road in a country where the people drive on the right). This is true for mirror visibility and avoiding blind spots as well as direct visibility.</p>
<p>Second, traction. The best traction available in the lane is in the tire tracks of where car and truck tires typically go. The grease and oil drippings collect in the center, meaning significantly less traction there. Debris, gravel, and garbage collect on the edges, again affecting traction.</p>
<p>Third, lane dominance. Riding in the center or the incorrect edge of the lane encourages selfish drivers to attempt to share the lane and use the perceived 'extra' real estate to pass a slower driver. This is dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other reasons listed, it's safer to stop near the edge at traffic lights/ behind other cars bc it means if some dickhead isn't paying attention and run up your arse you don't get smushed into the car ahead, you get knocked in between the 2 cars. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So you can see them in a rear view side mirror or behind a trailer. Not all vehicles have rear view mirrors in the center facing back, often that view is obstructed. Also when approaching intersections you are not hidden behind the vehicle in front of you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
