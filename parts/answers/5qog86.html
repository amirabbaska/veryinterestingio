		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From &quot;The Soul of an Octopus&quot; by Sy Montgomery: &quot;University of Vienna researcher Ruth Byrne reported that her captive octopuses always choose a favorite arm to explore new objects or mazes... Tank-bound octopuses, at least, are known to have a dominant eye, and Byrne thinks this dominance might be transferred to the front limb nearest the favored eye.&quot; However, as others have stated in the thread, all eight limbs act somewhat autonomously. The author in this section actually refers to the possibility of &quot;bold&quot; and &quot;shy&quot; arms, describing how some arms will display curiosity when presented with a new object while others retreat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each tentacle has its own nerve center independent of the other 7. So one tentacle may know how to open a jar while the ones either side would not. Some tentacles are probably preferentially used over others I don't know if there is a side bias, but if there is it would not be 4 on one side dominate to 4 on the other.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But basically, they have no dominant sides, their brain serves as a hub for their tentacles, which they almost essentially have no true control over, to interface with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
