		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In any liquid the molecules are in motion. Even if the liquid is motionless, if you could look at the molecules with a powerful microscope you would see them moving around and bumping into each other.</p>
<p>The motion is due to thermal energy. Some molecules move faster than others. Some have enough energy to escape from the surface of the liquid and become vapor. Even if the liquid is not boiling, some vapor escapes from its surface.</p>
<p>When the temperature is raised high enough the pressure of the escaping vapor equals the pressure of the air over the liquid. Bubbles form inside the liquid because the vapor pressure is high enough to push the liquid out of the way.</p>
<p>If you add something to the liquid that dilutes it, the vapor pressure is decreased. That is because there are fewer liquid molecules per square inch on the surface because some of them have been replaced by the dilutant. Fewer molecules on the surface means fewer molecules escaping and less vapor pressure.</p>
<p>The dilutant can be anything that dissolves. The phenomenon does not depend on the molecular properties of the dilutant, it only has to dissolve.</p>
<p>Edit: this is a well known phenomenon in chemistry. Search &quot;boiling point elevation&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemist here, the other responses just aren't correct so far.</p>
<p>You are asking about a phenomenon called boiling point elevation (on the opposite end of the spectrum you have freezing point depression).  A solvent (like water) has a vapor pressure greater than zero and will boil when that equals the atmospheric pressure.  A solute like salt has a vapor pressure of zero.  When added to water, it lowers the vapor pressure.  A lower vapor pressure requires a higher temperature to boil.</p>
<p>It is not a function of the ionic nature of salt, but of a property called molality,  which is moles of solute per kilogram of solution.</p>
<p>ELI5:  Water will boil.  Koolaid powder will not.  Mix them together, koolaid mixture will need a higher temperature to boil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any time you add stuff to water, it makes the boiling point higher, and the freezing point lower.</p>
<p>Everything is solid when it is super cold, all the way to the coldest temperature in the universe.</p>
<p>Everything is a gas when it is super hot, all the way to the hottest temperatures in the universe.</p>
<p>Liquid is a weird, tiny phase that can only happen when something is at a certain temperature range and a certain pressure at the same time.</p>
<p>Pure things try to stay in the &quot;pure&quot; states of solid or gas more. Water becomes ice easily, since nothing gets in its way - it turns into ice as soon as it's cold enough to do so. Same idea with boiling.</p>
<p>When liquids aren't pure anymore, like when salt or sugar is added to water, the process of changing into a solid or a gas is messed up, and the energy change - temperature - has to be bigger for the phase change (liquid to solid or gas) to happen.</p>
<p>When turning into a solid, the solute - whatever impurity is added in - literally gets in the way of the crystal structure forming. Solids always form as crystal structures if the liquid is pure, and that's the happiest energy state, which is why it happens as soon as it's cold enough. Since the impurities get in the way, it is harder for the crystals to form, meaning that the temperature difference has to be bigger.</p>
<p>When turning into a gas, it's kind of the opposite idea. Boiling is when the water is so excited about becoming a gas that it will team up with other excited water molecules and push aside the liquid water to run to the top. When it's pure, there's lots of liquid water, and so the excited water can team up with buddies easily. They need to team up to make a bubble. When there's impurities, though, the water has a harder time finding buddies. For every liter of pure water, there's lots of excited water buddies to find. For every liter of impure water, there's less, which means smaller teams to push aside the liquid. Since you need a whole team to make bubbles, and it's harder to find teammates, the temperature has to be higher, so more water molecules are ready to team up.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not easy to explain to a 5 year old but I took an exam on this question this week, should be able to answer in terms of the thermodynamics of the process, which is in my view a lot easier to understand than these theories of chemistry (which seem to conflict each other from reading the comments). So:</p>
<p>Adding any involatile substance (solute) to a pure liquid will lower the energy (chemical potential) of the solution. Thus, the energy (chemical potential) of the solution is lower than that of the gas or solid phase of water over a larger temperature range. Whichever phase has the lowest energy at a given temperature is the one than occurs naturally, as nature favours lower energy states.</p>

<p>This graph shows what I'm trying to get at, apologies if my explanation is unclear. (The above theory is for idealised solution, but can be extended to non-ideal solutions similarly)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
