		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways through which live attenuated vaccines have been made.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Repeated passage in cells from a different species.  For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modified_vaccinia_Ankara" target="_blank">Modified vaccinia Ankara</a>, a mammalian vaccine, was passaged through chicken eggs hundreds of times.  This is one of the classical ways of making attenuated vaccines, such as for <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2249374/pdf/epidinfect00011-0228.pdf" target="_blank">measles</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3782271/" target="_blank">polio</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/articles/4990327/" target="_blank">mumps</a>.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeated passage in cold temperatures, to make temperature-sensitive strains that don't replicate properly in body temperature.  For example, live attenuated influenza vaccines use the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042682208004868" target="_blank">Ann Arbor</a> cold-adapted strain as their background.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deliberate reassortment with a related virus that leaves both weakened. For example, the <a href="http://www.fda.gov/downloads/BiologicsBloodVaccines/Vaccines/QuestionsaboutVaccines/UCM101457.pdf" target="_blank">RotaTeq rotavirus vaccine</a> is made by combining human and bovine rotaviruses.  </p>
</li>
<li>Intentional modification through genetic engineering.  I'm not sure if these are in clinical use, but at least experimental variants of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2754401/" target="_blank">polio</a> have been made.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_passage" target="_blank">serial passage</a> is basically taking a virus that's well adapted to one host and forcing it to grow in very different cell conditions then putting it back into the original host when it's no longer well adapted. There's always the risk that viruses will just mutate back to their original type as, for instance, sometimes happens with vaccine-derived polio.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your body detects a virus, it does not recognize the whole virus; instead, it recognizes protein patterns on its surface. For some vaccines, it's possible to reproduce this proteic pattern without the rest of the virus attached to it - effectively there's nothing that can infect you in such vaccines. They do tend to work slightly less that attenuated vaccines with &quot;real virus&quot; in them tho.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe you can also if this isn't already described, use viruses on an animal then move it to the person in the form of a vaccine.</p>
<p>However there is a case that I believe GlaxoSmithKline and or merck was involved where as this or a similar technique was over used and the vaccine instead didn't work or even caused/contributed the spread of I believe measles/mumps...They were fined 3 billion for faking antibodies results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
