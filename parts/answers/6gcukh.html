<p>In movies the added 'steam' is usually created by a smoke machine, or dry ice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool story, I used to work at a facility that (for some godawfully terrible reason) had a <a href="http://www.photos-public-domain.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/manhole-cover.jpg" target="_blank">manhole cover</a> that lead to the sewer system for the whole building. This manhole cover was placed right near the entrance to the building so you had to walk past it to get inside.</p>
<p>On cold mornings the wafting steam of 10,000 assloads of shit would rise up from the sewers and create a sort of movie-esque effect. It looked pretty cool!</p>
<p>Only problem was it smelled like death and catching a whiff of it in the morning was the closest I've ever come to actually throwing up just from the smell of something.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr - it actually happens irl</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In New York, there are parts of Manhattan where the buildings are heated by steam generated in centralized plants and distributed through pipes. Sounds somewhat nuts, but it allows the steam created by power plants to usefully heat buildings rather than just be vented into the air. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_steam_system" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City_steam_system</a></p>
<p>Anyhow, this steam sometimes leaks up through the street and you get a very dramatic foggy effect which filmmakers love to recreate for nighttime city scenes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
