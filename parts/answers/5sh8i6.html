		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not known why. A few theories as to the reasons.</p>
<p>Maybe play, especially with smaller dolphins and porpoise. they also swim more efficiently as they jump out of the water, because air has less resistance than water. You often see this when they swim along side boats.</p>
<p>Maybe part of their communication with members of their pod. </p>
<p>Maybe to help rid parasites and barnacles that grow on their skin.</p>
<p>Maybe to just look around. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's so wide spread, it's probably playfulness, as much as anything. It's stimulating to see outside of the water.</p>
<p>Consider, that most behaviors are least energy. It takes a LOT of energy to jump out of the water. Some feel that flying fish do it to escape predators, but it's still very, very energy costly.</p>
<p>So, the reason is stimulation, very likely. See the world from a new view, literally. The whale breaching, esp. the humpback, makes a HUGE noise, as tons of mass hit the water. It's likely communication in that case, too. But there would be several reasons for it, but getting rid of skin parasites, is simply silly. Scratching up against subsurface rocks would be LOTS more efficient,right? And we've all seen animals doing that, OK?</p>
<p>So, it's stimulation, communication, escaping predators, and just plain ludic behaviors.</p>
<p>They could even be using visible coastal landmarks to figure out where they are for migrating....</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For whales and dolphins specifically it's because they're mammals and not fish, they have to breach because they're really just holding they're breath for extended periods of time while under water but still need to replenish the oxygen gas outside of liquid water (unlike fish gills). As for leaping fish like salmon it's to gain advancements up stream, other aquatic animals have ranges of theories depending on the species you're talking about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
