		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I do admire is that almost every other sci-fi show/movie, when dealing with other civilizations, planets, galaxies, and the vast distances and time-space mechanics involved, just stick with days/months/years as the basis of time for everyone concerned.  </p>
<p>I never could figure out how long a senton- septon - centar- was.  The new BSG abandoned that crap from BSG the TV show. </p>
<p>What other sci-fi time/distance systems have been tried , only to confuse and weaken the story? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the original series the stardates were made up just to sound futuristic.  There have been some attempts to explain them, but the original writers didn't have a secret code.</p>
<p>Starting with The Next Generation, they standardized them.  </p>
<p>The first number (4) represented the four in 24th century.</p>
<p>The second number was the season of the show.  TNG originally went for 7 seasons, but of course there was DS9 and Voyager meaning this number would go over 10, so that increased the the first number from a 4 to a 5.  if you hear the first two numbers of the stardate, you get a good idea how many years since the TNG premier.</p>
<p>The last group of numbers 000-999 was the progress of the show through the season.</p>
<p>The decimal point was what part of the day it was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual,&quot; written [early nineties (I'm at work, book's at home)] by Rick Sternbach and Mike Okuda (and if you don't know who they are...), Stardate 00000.0 occurred on the day of First Contact (Frakes' movie, that is), increasing by one every day.  The numbers after the decimal point indicate the time of day, e.g. noon being &quot;point five.&quot;
Been a few years since I've opened the book, but I believe that's where I saw it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
