<p>Similarly, why name the sub shells s,p,d,f?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>s, p, d, and f stand for &quot;sharp&quot;, &quot;principal&quot;, &quot;diffuse&quot;, and &quot;fundamental&quot;. The words come from old-fashioned spectroscopy. After f, it just continues alphabetically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The names of the shells originate from Charles Barkla's notes. He studied X-rays emitted by atoms. Barkla noticed two X-rays with different energy levels, emitted by atoms. First those were named A and B. But Barkla thought there are many more X-rays with more and less energy, so he decided to chose letters in the middle of the alphabet and named those K and L X-rays. As it turned out later there are no X-rays with higher energy but the names K and L stayed. The electron shells were named after the X-rays because the K-type X-ray is produced when an electron in the innermost shell knocked free and then recaptured.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
