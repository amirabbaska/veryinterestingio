		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quite simply, the 50-100mg potassium supplements are not likely to increase your potassium level by any biologically relevant amount, and that's totally intentional.</p>
<p>Any potassium pill large enough to measurably raise your serum potassium is restricted to prescription-only, because it's potentially deadly. A lot of older people have poor kidney function. High potassium can be very rapidly fatal and if you can't pee out the potassium you're in trouble.</p>
<p>So you can get a 10 mEq (750mg) or 20 mEq (1,500mg) potassium pill, but it'll be a prescription.</p>
<p>Taking 20 mEq (1,500mg) of potassium in pill form is much more deadly than eating 1500mg of potassium in avocado or potato or pistachio form. Pills are absorbed into your body very rapidly, while foods are digested slowly, so with food you have more time to get rid of excess K. (and your body may or may not even absorb all of the K in a solid-food meal)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because potassium is the primary cation of cellular biology. The vast, vast majority of it is contained within cells and even when it is released it is rapidly reabsorbed. Potassium ions are pumped into the cells to create an electrochemical gradient-- that is, there is a non zero voltage across the membrane of your cells. This has a lot of functions. The most commonly thought of one are action potentials-- the electrical signals sent down your neurones by opening the membrane to release potassium, but all cells have a voltage potential that helps fuel the motion of molecular machines embedded in the membrane. </p>
<p>A sudden concentration of potassium outside of the cells would disrupt these functions and can have toxic effects-- diahorria and stomach pains can be symptoms. Luckily the body is very good at handling potassium because of its vital role. Excess potassium is excreted through the urine efficiently or otherwise potassium is taken up by cells quickly. Hyperkalemia (high potassium) is rarely caused by supplements for this reason-- instead something needs to disrupt the mechanisms that maintain potassium homeostasis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can eat a bunch of pistachios and get 2000mg of potassium, or you can take 3 2000mg pills either by accident or ignorance and die. One requires the metabolism of the food and will be a slow release, the other shoves it all in at once for rapid absorption. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've tried to find good responses to this question as well, best I can find is suppositions from people <a href="https://discourse.soylent.com/t/potassium-safety/3346/5" target="_blank">thinking along the same lines I do</a> that it's a localized thing...i.e. if you eat a large volume of food that happens to have potassium it's slowly broken down and delivered to your body over time and over the entire GI system...whereas with an electrolyte pill you'll be dumping all that potassium in one very localized location in your stomach and it might kill the cells at that location which sounds bad.</p>
<p>Still not sure why there's no clear answer on the internet, seems like something simple to find but it's just not out there to see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that hasn't been mentioned yet is that if you ingest anything close to your RDV of potassium chloride on an empty stomach, you will get intense abdominal pain. I learned that one the hard way when I found out that you can buy potassium chloride by the pound as &quot;sodium free salt substitute&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
