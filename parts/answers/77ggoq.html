		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deciduous trees shed their leaves in order to conserve energy. Leaves take energy to maintain, so it's advantageous for the tree if it does not have to deal with leaf upkeep when there is limited warmth and sunlight (in other words, winter).</p>
<p>The downside of this is that deciduous trees have to regrow all their leaves the next year, which is something that evergreens do not have to deal with (by the way, I think the question should be deciduous vs evergreen, but that's another topic)</p>
<p>For a non-ELI5 explanation of advantages vs disadvantages, Wikipedia has some pretty good information: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous#Function" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous#Function</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deciduous trees would never survive a winter if they kept their leaves in area where it snows.  Snow accumulates on leaves and gets very heavy, breaking branches and taking down entire trees, especially if it is snowy and windy.. or that heavy wet snow so common on warmer days.</p>
<p>Snow does eventually accumulate on the thin needles of evergreen trees too, but their branches are usually slopped better to handle it, where as the upright branches of deciduous trees cannot cope.  Snow does slide off the needles easier than it slides off leaves.</p>
<p>In areas that get freak snow storms in the fall (before the leaves have fallen off deciduous trees) it is not uncommon to have a  lot of  branches down or trees fully knocked over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leaves take energy to protect and keep alive, especially in the cold, dark days of winter.  If they energy they make available to the try isn't enough to cover their cost, they are a net drain.</p>
<p>If the difference between those two is great enough, it is can cost least energy overall to drop the leaves during fall or winter, and regrow them in the spring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The advantages are that they conserve energy and water during winter months, have a chance to regrow damaged leaves, and are less appetizing to some types of predators.</p>
<p>The disadvantages are the fact that they must expend a lot of energy to regrow new leaves from scratch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three types of environmental conditions.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Wherever there is a seasonal lack of water (either via a dry season or snowy winter) <strong>Deciduous</strong> trees are advantaged because they don't need to spend water maintaining their leaves.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Where the soil is nutrient poor (making it costly to regrow the leaves each year) <strong>Evergreen</strong> trees are advantaged.</p>
</li>
<li>Where neither restriction is in effect <strong>Evergreens</strong> generally outcompete Deciduous trees due to natural leeching of nitrogen out of the soil favouring Evergreens.</li>
