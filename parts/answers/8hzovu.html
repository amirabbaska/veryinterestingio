		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the explanations of taste/being more refreshing, there's a cultural aspect too. Asians vastly prefer hot water to cold water. If you travel around asia you might notice a lot of water refilling machines with hot and cold water options. Also useful for making ramen too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just what you're used to. I've known people born in tropical places without much water/electric infrastructure (e.g. parts of Central America) who <em>find cold water really unpleasant.</em> Without refrigeration, they grew up drinking water at room-temp, and so that's what they prefer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is preference and what people are conditioned to find refreshing. Some countries do not like frigid cold water making ice optional when ordered. In China it is normal to serve piping hot water in establishments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
