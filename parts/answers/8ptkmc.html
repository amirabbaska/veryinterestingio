<p>Here is a great read with a step by step of each reaction after the tap leading up to foam being all over the floor if you want a more detailed explaination.</p>

<p>It has some really neat slow motion video of the individual bubbles exploding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I few explainations here are close, but my understanding of why it happens is a little different.</p>
<p>When you hit the bottle quickly it is forced downwards suddenly. Because the liquid in the bottle is not 'attached' to the bottle it is momentarily suspended (floating) inside the bottle until gravity accelerates it enough for in to catch back up with the bottles downward motion.when this happens, it is causing a gap to open up between the bottom of the bottle and the bottom of the liquid. Because there is no way for any air to get into this gap it is a vacuum. The pressure difference between the liquid and the vacuum then causes it to 'suck' all the CO2 gas out of the beer, filling the vacuum. Finally as the beer falls to refill this gap (gravity catching up) it forces all the CO2 back through the beer, creating a mentric f***tonne of bubbles.</p>
<p>All of this happens within a fraction of a second and is almost impossible to see, but is much more clear in slow motion</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
