		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the salt extracts moisture from the snail.</p>
<p>snails &quot;skin&quot; is a thin membrane which is very permeable to liquid. this one of the reasons why they are slimy.</p>
<p>when you put salt on your skin it also sucks out water, but much slower. for a snail this happens very quickly, resulting in their death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>osmosis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the spontaneous net movement of solvent molecules through a semi-permeable membrane into a region of higher solute concentration, in the direction that tends to equalize the solute concentrations on the two sides.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>water will osmose through the membrane of the snail's skin to equalize the salt concentration on the other side, slowly killing the snail</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it should be noted that salt only kills them slowly.  its not nice to kill a snail this way, its more like torture.  if you want to kill a snail then just step on it or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
