		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With humans (and many other species) few things are either nature or nurture.  Almost everything has a genetic component and an environmental component.  Physical height has a very strong genetic component (tall parents are very likely to have tall children) and it also has a very strong environmental component (malnutrition will very likely prevent someone from reaching their potential height).</p>
<p>There are many diseases (I am not saying autism is a disease here, I'm drawing a comparison) where there's a required genetic component and a required environmental component.  For example, there are autoimmune diseases that only occur in people with a particular allele in the MHC, which occurs in less than 1% of the population.  But only a fraction of those people with that allele develop the disease, and the prevailing explanation is that the disease only occurs if the people with the allele are infected with a specific virus, or combination of viruses.</p>
<p>Finally, even for the rare diseases that are purely genetic and have no environmental component, identical twins are not genetically identical; de novo mutations can arise during development, so that identical twins may have 50-100 genetic differences from each other. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a strong genetic component to autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but as with many diseases and syndromes, we need to get rid of the idea of 'nature vs nurture' and embrace the idea that nature and nurture interact in complicated ways to create the result that we see. </p>
<p>Autism is a spectrum on a scale of severity. And while the severity is largely determined by the severity of neurocognitive abnormality present initially, we see profound differences in outcome amongst autistic children of higher socioeconomic status; those who have more pronounced support systems, and those with access to specialized and intensive therapies. This supports the idea that the environment has an impact on the progression and management of the condition. </p>
<p>While these kids may have the same genetics initially, genes can be expressed differently and at different times during the process of their development. This results in monozygotic accordance rates as a means of estimating the genetic proportion of a  disease. Some diseases will have 100% accordance, meaning everyone with 'X' mutation will develop 'y' condition, while others, like autism spectrum disorder, or schizophrenia will have accordance rates less than 100%, suggesting that differences in the expression of these genes play an important role in the development of disease. The estimated accordance rate of ASD is around 70% amongst monozygotic twins.</p>
<p>We also know that these children, if they are raised together, also have very similar exposures over time, which is confusing given that they have developed in profoundly different ways. </p>
<p>Also, an emerging and interesting study of the microbiome (bacterial colonization) of people plays an important role in many diseases, including autism. Non human DNA is present within our bodily system at about ten times the level of human DNA. The interaction of these bacteria with people plays a major role in human disease that is just beginning to be understood.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: nature and nurture play a dynamic, and interactive role with one another to produce phenotype. Considering one without considering the role and context in terms of the other is an oversimplification in a majority of circumstances. The role of non human DNA is an emerging area of research interest in the development of numerous diseases, including autism spectrum disorder.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The causes of autism are not well known. It is known that autism has a genetic factor, as people with a family history of autism have a higher chance of having autistic children. However, as you have seen, there seems to be another factor at play. This factor is not well understood, and could be anything from environmental factors to some virus to random genetic mutation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
