		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I understand you correctly, you are asking about the situation where doors are opened until there are only 2 left. </p>
<p>ie</p>
<p>Initially n doors</p>
<p>number of doors reduced by (n-2)</p>
<p>therefore number of doors left (including the one you initially chose) is n-(n-2) = 2</p>
<p>If that is the case, the probability of winning if you switch is always going to be 1-(1/n).</p>
<p>because</p>
<p>probability of your initial choice being correct = 1/n</p>
<p>so probability of other remaining door being correct, all other doors having being opened, must be 1-(1/n).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Had 1 correct door, n total doors</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You have a 1/n chance of initially picking right.</p>
<p>He opens an incorrect door, now there are n-2 doors (excluding the one you selected and his bad door), with a combined total of (n-1)/n winning chance, so each has a (n-1)/(n(n-2)) chance of winning.</p>
<p>For example, with n=3, we have 1/3 chance of picking right, and the other door has a 2/3 chance of working.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Had the number of doors reduced by (n-2) after first choice made</p>
</blockquote>
<p>1/n chance of first door working, then that other door has a (n-1)/n chance of working. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You  choose a door. There's a 1/n chance that it contains the prize. (eg, you choose door 1 out of the if n=1000000 doors available. You have a 1 in a million chance of having the winning door).</p>
<p>The host looks at the other n-1 doors, and picks n-2 of them, carefully avoiding the prize door. (eg, he opens doors 2 to 349021, and 349023 to 1000000, carefully avoiding the door with the prize).</p>
<p>You switch (eg, to door 349022.). There's a 1/n chance you've just abandoned the prize, and an (n-1)/n chance you've just switched to it. (For example, it's almost certain, 999999/1000000 that door 349022 has the prize, and only a 1 in 1000000 chance that your original door did)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like to explain the Monty Hall problem like this:</p>
<p>Suppose it is better to stick to the first door you choose and you always do that. Now suppose that the game is with 1000 doors. If you don't change doors the game is identical to the same game without a choice, which is to say your chances of winning is one in 1000. Which means that changing doors gives you a 999/1000 chance of winning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially your win chance when you swap is the chance you were wrong before swapping (since all possible outcomes must add to 1). Which is 1- the chance you were right, which is 1/n. So for N doors, your chances are 1/n if you keep and (n-1)/n if you swap.</p>
<p>TLDR: SWAP!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
