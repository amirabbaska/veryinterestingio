<a href="http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Plumbob.html#PascalA" target="_blank">This page</a> has images of those tests but lacks pictures for the Pascal-B.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a picture of operation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_nuclear_weapons_testing#/media/File:Plumbbob_Rainier_001.jpg" target="_blank">Plumbob Rainer</a> which took place just days after Pascal-B.</p>
<p>I seem to recall seeing the picture marked with writing on it somewhere. I'll keep looking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At 60 km/s I am pretty sure the pressure (approximately a half million atmospheres of drag) would result in adiabatic heating that exceeds the enthalpy of disassociate of iron. If the frame &quot;caught&quot; the bottle cap, it was probably in the process of complete vaporization/ionization.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
