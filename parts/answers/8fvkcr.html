		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Police have Jurisdiction within a city or town. </p>
<p>Sheriff's Departments have jurisdiction within a County. That technically includes cities though they normally defer to the city level police and focus their actions outside of city limits and in towns too small to have their own police, as well as crimes that happen both inside and outside of a city or in multiple cities within a county.</p>
<p>State Police, Highway Patrol, etc have jurisdiction within an entire State. Some departments are focused on specific things, such as highway patrol being focused on traffic safety on highways. Others like State Troopers or the Texas Rangers deal with crimes that happen in multiple counties and deal with the transfer of prisoners across county lines. </p>
<p>National level police such as the FBI, US Marshals, Border Patrol etc are also fairly specialized. They have jurisdiction in the whole US but have specific jobs. Border Patrol, or ICE deal with immigration and customs imports into the US. US Marshals deal with witness protection, transport of prisoners across State lines, deal with crimes on Federal lands such as national parks, and deal with some crimes on Native American Reserves. The FBI deals with crimes that happen in multiple States, specialized cases such as serial killers, and the like. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's area based mainly.. Police have jurisdiction inside the city limits..  Sheriffs Deputies have jurisdiction inside the county.. State and then so on..  but yes, some small towns don't have a Police force so the county has jurisdiction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many think that the US policing system is a mess, and without a doubt I would say it’s complicated but very orderly in that every jurisdiction has its own entity. </p>
<p>Others have mentioned that Australia is much simpler, with Federal police, and then state authorities taking care of local policing, ambulance and fire. Very clear cut. </p>
<p>In Canada it’s a bloody mess. At the federal level you have the RCMP, and various other agencies for specialized areas, though the RCMP often have jurisdiction in these areas too, ex. CBSA is our customs and immigration agency, yet RCMP has jurisdiction over patrolling the physical land and sea borders. </p>
<p>At the provincial level, you also have the RCMP taking care of provincial crimes ONLY if said province chooses to opt in for RCMP service. 3 provinces opted out (Ontario, Quebec, and Newfoundland) and as such have the Ontario Provincial Police, Sureté Québec, and the Royal Newfoundland Constabulary taking care of their own provinces’ crimes.</p>
<p>On the municipal level you again have the RCMP but ONLY if the municipality has opted in. Otherwise, municipal police services can be organized (e.g. the Toronto Police). But municipal forces derive their authority from the Crown at the provincial level, giving them authority anywhere in said province. </p>
<p>In the territories up North, sovereignty/border integrity is again taken up by CBSA and RCMP but also with the Canadian Army Rangers - essentially dudes with red hoodies, hatchets and Lee Enfield rifles. </p>
<p>On Indian reservations, some have Indian police services and others have RCMP - unfortunately I don’t know the distinction. While I’m not very knowledgeable about this, I have heard that some treaty lands have the ability to refuse entry to federal authorities.</p>
<p>In other words, we need some help from the UK and Australia!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
