		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are mutations, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intragenomic_conflict#Segregation_distortion" target="_blank">sex ratio distorters</a>, that cause an organism (and all of its descendants) to only have children of one particular gender. If I remember correctly there are a few <del>species</del> breeding populations of mice that managed to get themselves extinct that way (Edit: this might not be accurate, see below). </p>
<p>I don't know if this is possible in humans though. And even if it is, it seems more likely that your family just happened to get 14 boys in a row. 1 in 16348 sounds like a lot, but it really isn't that unlikely in the grand scheme of things (how many families are there on the planet?).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprised no-one has mentioned that the sex ratio for humans is not exactly even.  It is close, but persistently off from 1:1.  A 2002 study estimated that 106 boys are born for every 100 girls.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't find a decent study on it, but <a href="https://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2008-12/why-does-war-breed-more-boys" target="_blank">war has the curious effect of increasing male birthrates versus females</a>. More boys are born during and after times of war, seemingly in response to the high mortality of males during these times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth considering that the different sperm cells have different physical tolerances, which can be environmentally driven.</p>
<p>I can't find the study(ies) right now, but I remember reading truck drivers tending towards daughters, along with pilots, radar operators, etc. The thinking was along the lines of y chromosome sperm being more easily killed by radar, stress, injury, and heat.</p>
<p>It seems to follow that boys could be driven by exposure to cold, but again I don't have any studies to hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Androgen_insensitivity_syndrome" target="_blank">androgen insensitivity syndrome</a> for example can cause those affected to appear female, regardless of XX or XY.  This would throw off the boy/girl ratio for those families.  However, they don't properly develop female internal reproductive organs, so they don't have periods and can't have children.  </p>
<p>Given that the odds are only 1/16400 and there are probably more families than that in the population, it's not unusual for there to be families out there that are as skewed as yours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
