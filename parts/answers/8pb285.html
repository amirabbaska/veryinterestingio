		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are mechanical differences as well as chemical differences that account for the difference in explosive power of the Fat Man and Little Boy:</p>
<p><strong>Fat Man</strong>:</p>
<p>Used about 13.6 lbs. of plutonium in an implosion, caused by surrounding the plutonium in nearly 3 tons of conventional explosives. Plutonium releases about 210 MeV of energy per fission. Total explosive power of the Fat Man was about 21,000 tons of TNT, which is 5.48404 x 10^32 eV.</p>
<p><strong>Little Boy</strong>:</p>
<p>Using a gun mechanism, a 85 lb. hollow &quot;bullet&quot; made of uranium is shot into a 55 lbs. mass of uranium, causing it to go critical. Uranium releases about 200 MeV of energy. Little Boy's explosive power was about 15,000 tons of TNT, which is 3.91717 x 10^32 eV.</p>
<p>Most likely, the initiation mechanism for the Fat Man was just more efficient, causing more atoms to undergo fission. This would make sense if you think about an implosion vs a gun barrel mechanism. Doing the math, you'd find that 2.61144762 x 10^24 atoms of plutonium underwent fission. For the uranium, it was 1.958585 x 10^24 atoms. To calculate the efficiency of the bombs, you'd have to know their relative atomic densities, but I can't find that information.</p>
<p>Edit: fixed notation and which mass of uranium was shot into which.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the implied backup question: why did they go with one design over the other?</p>
<p>The explosives needed to make Fat Man work had to be incredibly precise. If they all didn't go off in the exact correct shape at the exact right time, it would have shot the Plutonium out of the shell like a cannon instead of compressing it. Frankly, the explosives were possibly a greater engineering challenge than the nuclear part. </p>
<p>Little Boy was much simpler, engineering-wise. They both took an astronomical amount of resources to build, but Little Boy they were almost positive would work. Fat Man was much more efficient, but required testing and had a higher potential failure rate. We went with Fat Man style bombs going forward, hence all the nuclear testing, but we had Little Boy as backup to make sure <em>something</em> went off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fission-based nuclear weapons work through a chain reaction of neutrons hitting atoms, releasing neutrons, which hit other atoms, and release more neutrons. It’s all about neutrons. More neutrons hitting the fissile material means more energy. Put enough neutron producing radioactive atoms together, and you have a runaway chain reaction. </p>
<p>However, when you set off the weapon, it explodes (because of the runaway reaction). The energy tears apart the weapon, which ends the reaction. This is potentially quite inefficient, as not all of the material actually gets to undergo fission.  </p>
<p>Little Boy used a “gun type” mechanism, essentially a cylinder where a “bullet” of uranium hits another piece of uranium. One was hollow, but this is a simple mechanism and the combination process is sort of two dimensional - one thing is pushed into another thing. Quickly, the reaction blows up the entire fissile material involved, and the reaction ends. It is an extremely inefficient design in terms of the fissile material involved. </p>
<p>Fat Man used a more advanced technique where the fissile material is imploded all at once from all sides. This is a three dimensional method of pushing everything together using conventional explosives, and achieves a higher density of fissile material. More material together all at once in a tighter, more compressed space, means more neutrons. More neutrons means a bigger explosion. Even though it is just a brief instant while the fissile material is compressed together, many more atoms are able to experience the reaction. This is more efficient and creates a larger explosion. (They used Uranium versus Plutonium, but the fundamental difference was in how the reaction was set off and the larger power of fat man was primarily due to the more advanced design.)</p>
<p>However, both are fairly inefficient. Little Boy only used around 1-2% of its fissile material, and Fat Man only used about 17%. </p>
<p>Thermonuclear weapons can be much more efficient, since the fusion reaction produces a lot of neutrons all at once. Surround the reaction with fissile material and almost all the fissile material will be hit with neutrons before it is torn apart. This works even for fissile material that can’t support a chain reaction on its own, because you are supplying the neutrons from the fusion reaction. This method can efficiently use all the fissile material because you have a large amount of neutrons hitting it, and provides a huge amount of energy (much of the energy in thermonuclear weapons is actually through this process, not the primary fusion reaction).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi. Former DOE nuclear weapons guy here. First of all, the weapon effects are nuclear (not chemical) in nature. The simple answer to your question is that the weapons were different in design (gun vs. implosion type) as well as how much special nuclear material (SNM) and the types of SNM used. Little Boy was designed as a low-efficiency but high probability of success device. Gun type weapons are a pain in the ass as U-235 is hard to refine and the design tends to go supercritical too quickly. Perhaps the ultimate gun-type design was the W33 artillery fired atomic projectile (AFAP). Fat Man was a single stage implosion device. More complex due to designing explosive lenses/timers/detonators to get a good burn. In the end, most countries ended up using imposion-type primaries with plutonium or hybrid plutonium/uranium pits and secondaries/tertiaries using both SNM and lithium deuteride. </p>
<p>(TL/DR) Kinda like comparing the performance of cars. Lots of different variables and design constraints come into play. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Little Boy used over 10 times as much fuel by mass (uranium) than Fat Man (plutonium) but the design of Fat Man was over 10 times as efficient. Their estimated explosive forces are of the same order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Little Boy used a gun-type design that pushed a chunk of uranium into a casing of uranium to get supercritical mass. Fat Man used an implosion-type design that pushed <del>two hemispheres</del> of plutonium together. Little Boy was significantly simpler than Fat Man, but weapons-grade uranium is harder to produce than weapons-grade plutonium, but the plutonium gun-type design would have been 17 feet (5 meters) long and had trouble staying in the necessary position to detonate.</p>
<p>Chemistry-wise, plutonium has a lower critical mass, the mass required to achieve detonation. Pu-239 has higher fissile probability and produces more neutrons than U-235 per fission event. Pu-239 can be formed into very large subcritical masses due to its stability.</p>
