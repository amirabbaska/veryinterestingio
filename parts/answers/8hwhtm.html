		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Almost all ozone near ground level is formed by reactions happening in the atmosphere. The most common pathway is for NOx gasses (NO or NO2), mostly produced by vehicles, to react with volitile organic compounds (VOCs) coming from a variety of sources. That reaction needs energy from sunlight, so a high ozone concentration is predictable if there are high NOx and VOC levels, and a sunny day is predicted. </p>
<p>There's some more complexities involving atmospheric temperature dynamics, but those tend to be more seasonal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are quite a few methods for predicting ozone levels at the urban scale but one of the most widely used is with the aid of chemical transport models. These are mathematical models which try to describe the dynamics of the underlying physical (e.g. transport due to meteorology) and chemical (mainly photochemistry of ozone creation and destruction) processes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Current ozone levels are determined by using devices that meter how much ultraviolet light is absorbed by the ozone molecules.  Some of the devices use lasers to make distant observations from the device. </p>
<p>There's a multitude of such sensors that are used to generate an accurate enough map of current levels of ozone and we use similar forecasting tools as with regular weather to determine predicted ozone levels.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't think of it as the ozone just appearing.  It already exists, and comes from somewhere else.  They can see it coming.</p>
<p>Imagine there's a forest fire that starts 50 miles north of you and winds are carrying the smoke south at 5 miles per hour.  You can reasonably predict that it'll be smoky where you are, in 10 hours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
