		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drug trafficking in Colombia is a complex theme that has greatly shifted and modernized over the last ten years. A cartel is a large, unified power structure that controls all aspects of the particular drug trafficking activity within its territory. This activity changes depending on where the country is in relation to the target market. In Mexico, cartels work to move drugs from the southern regions where they are imported or manufactured, across the border into the US, and into the hands of distributors, and then facilitating the movement of the profit back down south. Their organization has a hand in all facets of this activity, and any particular member is subject to the influence and decisions of the leadership. </p>
<p>Colombia has changed largely due to the method of transport and the target market. Colombian traffickers are less concerned with sending loads directly to the United States. Rather, they’re mainly concerned with getting as much product as possible to Central America or Mexico. The further north, the higher the profit margin per kilogram, but the greater the risk and operational cost. </p>
<p>So how do you get large amounts of cocaine to Panama or Guatemala? Small boats. In essence, a three-man fishing boat with two 75HP outboard engines transporting between 500 and 1,000kgs of cocaine through the open ocean, coordinating refuel points with rogue fishing vessels, and ultimately making an at-sea delivery at a pre-determined arrival point. Without going in to too much detail, planning this kind of venture requires people with different skill sets. Rather than bring the various involved parties under one organized umbrella of leadership, these coordinators operate largely as independent contractos, providing services to different groups who have production and land-based transportation capabilities. Backing these production groups are wealthy investors who finance the purchase of maritime equipment and often coordinate directly with the receiving parties in the corresponding Central American country. </p>
<p>In brief, rather than a large, centralized command structure as is indicative of a cartel, the current landscape in Colombian drug trafficking is best described as loosely affiliated groups of specialists backed by rich, shadowy traffickers paying for their services. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that the US gives Colombia a lot of money to shut down cartels before they become powerful...and they are pushed out of major cities and into the jungle. Its kind of like a win win. They get major cities back for tourism and the production of drugs is out of sight out of mind in the jungle somewhere. Also a lot of cartels moved to neighboring countries...ie Peru..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't need cartels to move inventory. Cartels are when competitors cooperate, which as you might imagine is an unstable relationship. Competitors competing with one another will still get their goods delivered, just not by cooperative means.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Colombian here:
Cartels would never again exist in Colomnia in the same the were in the 80s with the Cartel de Medellin and Cartel de Cali. There have been a lot of follow up cartels, like the Cartel del Norte del Valle and a lot of organized crime that have also been very powerful but never like the Cartel from escobar.</p>
<p>2014 the guerrilla group FARC dismantled (at least that is what we are told) and signed a peace treathy. To that point (2014) they were the biggest cocaine cartel in the world and one of the most powerful and organized terrorist organizations. </p>
<p>You don't see the same amount of deaths as in the 80s, when Medellin was the most dangerous city im the world but the is still a lot of crime around cocain and other hard drugs.</p>
<p>Most of the cocaine produced in Colombia goes to the states trough Mexico. That is were the most powerful cartels are right now. Sadly for my mexican fellows here.</p>
<p>Pablo Escobar was killet on 1993 and almost 25 years later, Colombia is still the biggest producer of Cocaine. There is a lot of corruption in my country and a lot of fredom for crime organizations. And there will always be cocaine as long as it is bought at absurd prices in the USA or Europe.</p>
<p>Sadly, the narco culture left by Escobar still is present in all parts of society and it shaped our way to see the world. It fucked up Medellind and it fucked up Colombia. That guy was cancer and the worst thing that happened to us.</p>
<p>I also have to say that things are much much better now and we have accepted our past. There is a lot of good people and you are encouraged to visit us :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a Colombian, here my thoughts:</p>
<p>New drug lords go to the top universities, study logistic, do MBA and learn about inventory and production management. You don’t see them with big cars and killing each other like before. They have suits, do sports and go to meetings. </p>
<p>People plan drugs in the forest and by ordinary people. They earn good money for that, in comparison of planting potatoes or something similar. </p>
<p>Transport is done by the Mexicans to the world. That’s their strength. </p>
<p>Government and local police receive a part of the deal. It is full of corruption. They “plan” to get caught. So if on one side they are caught with x tons of cocain, on the other side they are move 100 times more. </p>
<p>You noticed the power they have over the country in 2008, when the economic crisis didn’t affect much of the Colombian economy back then. </p>
<p>Personal opinion:</p>
<p>I think government US and Colombian are directly involved in this. The world need to do produce drugs. Because if nobody creates drugs, some people, specially people in government positions, would go crazy. </p>
