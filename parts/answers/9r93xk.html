		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your tastebuds like a drawbridge.  When food comes in contact some of the bridges open up and you taste it.  Not all the drawbridges at once, but some.  </p>
<p>Salt comes along and acts like a key or bribe to the drawbridge guard, allowing many more and different drawbridges to open up giving more flavor sensation.  </p>
<p>In this case the drawbridges are ion gated channels and salt acts as a &quot;key&quot; to help activate (or deactivate in some cases; either way it &quot;increases&quot; what it was doing before) the channel.  Salt is like giving it some redbull and letting the channel amp up.  </p>
<p>Not specific to salt, but many many substances can be detected (tasted smelled) in small quantities.  Some in the parts per million or parts per billion (ppm/ppb). </p>
<p>Note: Yes, I did this like I'd explain to my niece so the exact science analogies fall apart if you dig too deep.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small amounts of salt makes food sweeter by masking other bitter notes, making those veggies delicious.</p>
<p>Large amount of salt will completely cover the sweetness and actually add more savoury notes bringing out the umami of the dish or the fifth flavour, like a thick warm beef stew. </p>
<p>Salt is magic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of our five senses of taste, sweet,  sour, bitter, savory, and salt have survival value.</p>
<p>Sweet; this fruit is ripe.</p>
<p>Sour; this fruit isn't ripe yet.</p>
<p>Bitter; this stuff might be poisonous.</p>
<p>Savory, AKA Umami; This stuff is rich in valuable proteins.</p>
<p>Salt; without it, you die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have ion channels on your tongue that serve as salt sensors. When an ion of NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 passes through the channel, the cell membrane depolarizes which leads to action potential that your brain recognizes as a salty taste. This ion channel is very sensitive, highly expressed, and binds to many different ‘salty’ molecules. This is versus sweet/bitter/umami receptors which are GPCR receptor proteins that require mediation by other proteins to produce a response. So salt receptors are efficient as well (bitter receptors operate the same way).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
