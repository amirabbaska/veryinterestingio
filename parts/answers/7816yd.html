		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly it is just atmospheric humidity entering the food, making it lose it's crunch. The water activity in a crisp chip is very low, so left exposed to the environment, it will come in contact with water in the air and lose it at a much lower, not even comparable rate. Theoretically this would happen until equilibrium is reached. The starches will then soften when exposed to water, making the chip more chewy. The opposite effect is seen in very turgid fruits and vegetables. Because their water activity is so high, they slowly lose water to the atmosphere. The equilibrium is in the opposite direction, although in this case, the water is actually helping the plant cells to stay &quot;crisp&quot; because of the water pressure against the cell walls. As water slowly escapes, they lose pressure and become limp. To test this out, you can leave a cucumber in a very humid, sealed container with some wet paper towels and compare it to a cucumber left on the counter for two days to see the difference. Also, you can try to re-crisp your chips and crackers by throwing them in the oven for a few minutes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things happen. Moisture is one, oxidation is the other.</p>
<p>When you re-crisp something and it still tastes stale, it's usually the oils that oxidize, producing stale flavor. It's somewhat worse with &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;organic&quot; products because potato chips keep their taste longer if they're treated with antioxidants like butylated hydroxyanisole and EDTA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not all water and humidity. A lot of it is amalose (starch) crystallizing. This happens more quickly in some foods than others. For example, if you refrigerate rice noodles from your local Chinese place, they will get hard and gross in a day or two, even if wet. </p>
<p>Also, when chips go stale they lose their crunch, and that's the deal breaker. If you remove audibly the crunch from fresh chips, they will still feel stale. It doesn't take much for a chip to lose its crunch and that could easily be done with just humidity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not 100% sure about the exact chemistry of stale food, but <a href="http://www.seriouseats.com/2014/06/does-refrigeration-really-ruin-bread.html" target="_blank">Serious Eats has a really interesting piece talking about the science of stale bread.</a> Moisture loss is only one of the factors that makes bread stale. The other is the crystalline structure of the starch in flour. When heated, the geometric raw starch molecules breakdown into something more amorphous. However, over time the starch will revert back to that crystalline state. Since potatoes are quite starchy I would assume they are subject to a similar process. Heat will revert the starch back into it's delicious amorphous state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
