		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, yes. Gravity has an infinite range. However, it also takes some time to propagate - information about local changes in the gravitational field will propagate at the speed of light. So if a supernova goes off and creates a black hole, we won't feel the gravitational disturbance until we see the light from the supernova. </p>
<p>Additionally, since the universe is expanding there are distances such that we will never receive information from. Anything that happens beyond that horizon will not be able to effect us. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In few words, yes, but since in simple calculations gravity becomes weaker with the distance between objects^2, it will eventually reach a point that is can essentially be perceived as zero in most calculations. This same idea (perceiving small numbers as zero) is done very often in large scale (like astrophysics) mathematics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Okay what if I put a Hydrogen atom in the middle of the universe? Does it still have an infinite range?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, there is no such thing as a &quot;middle of the universe&quot;.</p>
<p>Second, if you consider a hydrogen atom on Proxima centauri, so just next door on the universe's scale, it does exert a gravitational force on you, about 10^-61 Newtons, or the weight on Earth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a billionth of a gram.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Followup question:</p>
<p>Isn't gravity too quantized? I thought the least amount something could influence something else was the plank constant? So there should be the maximum range, where the force would be smaller than the plank constant and as a result doesn't exist anymore? Or will it still have an effect if say two sources of gravitational pull with a strenght of 1/2 plank constant are pulling the same object? I'm confused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer: Yes. The strength of a gravity field decreases by the square of the distance from its source. So, as compared to any given 'base' distance and strength (e.g. the Earth's 9.8m/s^2 at 6367km), at twice that distance the strength will be 1/2^2 = 25% as much, at 3 times that distance it will be 1/3^2 = about 11% as much, at 100 times that distance it will be 1/100^2 = 0.01% as much, and so on. You'll notice that this function decreases towards zero but never reaches it for any finite distance. That is to say, 1/X^2 for any positive finite X is some positive value strictly greater than zero. The only physical entities that have zero gravity at some finite distance are those which have zero mass and thus zero gravity at <em>any</em> distance.</p>
<p>More accurate answer: Maybe, it depends what you mean. The above account is precise in the world of newtonian physics, but the real world runs on einsteinian relativity and quantum physics (or something to which einsteinian relativity and quantum physics are closer approximations than newtonian physics is). As it turns out, the propagation of gravity through space is limited by the speed of light. For instance, the Earth is only about 4.6 billion years old, so objects farther away than 4.6 billion light years have not yet been affected by any gravity from the Earth, although they may currently be affected by gravity from the matter that later fell together to form the Earth. But it gets even worse, because the Universe is expanding over time, space stretching apart and becoming larger, so beyond a certain distance (roughly 14 billion light years), the overall expansion of space passes the speed of light, and objects beyond that distance will <em>never</em> be affected by any of the gravity 'emitted' by the Earth right now (nor will we ever be affected by the gravity they're 'emitting' right now). Again, such objects may in the past have been close enough to be affected by gravity from the Earth or from the matter that later formed into the Earth, in which case they are also <em>still</em> being affected by the diminishing gravity that just barely got past the 14 billion light year cutoff point, and will continue to be thus affected into the eternal future, although the strength of that gravity will gradually approach zero over time. This raises another question: If you wind back the clock to just after the Big Bang, when the entire Universe was much smaller, was there enough time for <em>everything's</em> gravity to reach out and affect <em>everything</em> else, thus ending up in this 'eternally diminishing but never zero' situation? Or were there bits of mass separated so fast and so early that they never had the chance to affect each other? Physicists are still working on this problem; it depends exactly when certain things happened in the first moments after the Big Bang, and in what order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
