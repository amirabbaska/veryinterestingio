		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your ding dong has a <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;url=https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_frequency&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiHoLnS353aAhVIuY8KHagiDWIQFjABegQIAhAB&amp;usg=AOvVaw3tdE8kfcUIeaZTHmW61Fwt" target="_blank">Natural Frequency</a>. This frequency increases by the root of the stiffness and decreases by the root of the mass of your schlong. Since both these properties tend to go in the same directions, the effects basically cancel out, so its not like you can change the natural frequency of your gentleman's sausage's whenever you want, no matter how excited you are. To get your salami really going, your best bet is to shake it at its natural frequency. But be careful, it might hurt or even break when resonance is achieved. Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Edit: As I write this edit, almost 8000 fellow trouser-snake thrashers have gotten something out this explanation. I stand proud and stiff at this achievement. Unfortunately there has been too much learning going on as the question was delisted. But I won't be discouraged as apparently a mysterious member manipulator saw fit to give gold for this. The world thanks you. I will use it to fund ongoing research into other important issues of public interest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
