		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reflective surfaces tend to be metals. Metals are very good conductors of heat. That means that when you touch a piece of metal it is very good at moving that heat into your skin. Your skin cannot actually tell the actual temperature of something you touch only if something is hotter or colder than your skin. Since the metal moves heat into your skin very quickly it feels much hotter than another object that has also been sitting in the sun.</p>
<p>You are correct in saying shiny objects do reflect more light in at least some portion of the spectrum so they might even be slightly less absolutely hot while feeling much hotter to human skin.  </p>
<p>Explain like I'm in highschool edit: As someone mentions below the balance of IR emissivity and visible emissivity will determine the actual temperature of the object in this situation. I don't have data for stainless steel, which is the nominal slide making material last time I checked. If anyone does that would be cool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Additional to some answes given here the sun emits different wavelengths of light. While the wavelengths in the spectrum of visible light might be reflected, infrared light is absorbed. Normal window glass for example absorbes infrared light thus heating up.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not because they are shiny, but because they are metal and conduct heat. A poor conductor may be as hot but when you touch it but the surface layer almost instantly becomes the same temperature as your skin. Heat from further in only gradually conducts to the surface and then to you, so it's barely noticeable.  The surface of a lump of metal keeps being fed by heat conducted from the bulk below, so there is a temperature differential between it and your skin for a long enough time for you to feel it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
