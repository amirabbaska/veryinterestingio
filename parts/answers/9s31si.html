		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They got a light source (think: a bulb) that is consuming so much energy it's crazy compared to the tiny box you got in your own living room.</p>
<p>And bulbs always create excess heat that needs to be cooled away with active cooling. i.e, fans. Fans are noisy.</p>
<p>But no-one in the cinema cares, because that projector is in it's own room, with a glass window. No-one in the audience hears the fan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like everyone else has said, money.  It's literally like the difference between a used Honda and a brand new Rolls Royce. A movie theater projector costs around $75k-$100k and 20,000-30,000 lumen,. Everything about it is precision made, calibrated, and maintained. You can get home theater projectors with DLP 3chip technology, 4k video, 5000 - 8000 lumens, and interchangeable lensing, but it still won't come close to the one at the theater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same like in every industry doing essentially the same like consumers do themselves.</p>
<p>You can buy a nice little light effect and it would be enough for you but a company which is earning their money by using lights has the money and the knowledge to buy a more professional product.</p>
<p>The projector you are using at home may cost around a thousand dollars, the projectors used by professionals cost much more that that. For that much money they get a better lamp, better optics and the ability to play movies that are stored in a way that is too expensive for the end consumer. Also they will use a much better screen, which makes a lot of difference.</p>
<p>They spend hours in calibrating the projector what wouldn't be worth for anyone showing some content for less that a couple thousand people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some have multiple lamps...some have extremely powerful lamps.  Some have multiple extremely powerful lamps...that are maintained by professionals. Lenses are excellent, and the projectors have great ventilation keeping them dust free and cool. They also have specialized software optimally running them. They are also mounted at optimum distances/angles...and the screens are designed to be used with them, so they are very bright/clear. Also the files they play are high resolution, using specialized players/processors...that are connected to the projectors with digital cable (fiber/dual link dvi).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big difference is that they use three display devices (DMD or LCOS) to make red/green/blue, so they don't need a rotating filter wheel.  Better screens and lenses help too. It's like the difference between a cheap digital camera and a good DSLR and lens. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
