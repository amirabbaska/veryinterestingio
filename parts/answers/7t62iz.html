		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Major purchases (though I'm not sure if a house counts as &quot;retail&quot;) are big deals for the players involved.  The car dealership doesn't sell nearly as many cars as the supermarket does loaves of bread.  The dealership has a strong interest in getting you to commit to buying a car (it may only sell a handful of cars a day, and losing your business could be a significant fraction of that day's business).  Taking a hit on the profit margin is worth <em>having</em> a profit margin that day.  A supermarket, on the other hand, may sell hundreds of loaves of bread a day, and thousands of items.  The &quot;threat&quot; of &quot;give me a better price on this car, or I'll go elsewhere&quot; is stronger than &quot;give me a quarter off this bread or I'll go elsewhere&quot;.  It's worth having an employee devote a significant amount of time to get you to buy the car, but it's literally not worth paying an employee for the time to let you talk down the price of bread.  Plus, on commodity items like groceries, the profit margin is already razor-thin, and they're already giving you close to the best price possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In some countries you can dicker over the price of anything.  I work in retail and every now and again people do actually try to ask for a lower price on certain things.</p>
<p>Cars and houses have much bigger price tags so much more room to negotiate a better deal.. plus it may be a private sale - person to person, rather than person to business.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it isn't worth anybody's time to haggle over small retail purchases! What would you expect to save on a can of black beans or a Gap t-shirt by haggling at the register? And how much longer would every errand take if some little old lady is negotiating pennies off every one of her 50 items? Instead, things like sales, promo codes and coupons are used to adjust demand, account for price sensitivity. </p>
<p>Cars and houses are big ticket items, which are often one-off goods. That house is different from any other house, so the value can only be estimated. Cars, too, are often not 100% exact even if that just means color combination on same trim level. And with used cars, it's even more likely there isn't another exactly like it for sale nearby right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, as to cars, the new car dealership industry can work a little strangely.<br />
Very often the car manufacturers don't actually give their dealers a very good price on the vehicles. So the profit the dealerships get from selling a car can be very minor, like not enough to stay in business minor.  The dealership's profit comes in the form of bonuses they get from the manufacturer for selling a certain number of vehicles.<br />
Making a months target sales numbers or not can mean the difference between being in the black or the red.<br />
So naturally they are inclined to negotiate price, because it's the <em>sale</em> it's self that's more important then the price (depending on how successful/busy the dealership is).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is &quot;transaction costs&quot; related to time.  Time is valuable.  Its not worth negotiating for 5 minutes on a $2 loaf of bread for either the seller or the buyer, because you mitigate only a small financial cost but incur a much bigger time cost.  However, spending an hour to haggle on a car or many hours haggling on the cost of a house is worth it for both buyer and seller.</p>
<p>In less developed societies who spend a large portion of their income on food, you still see haggling over small items for this very reason: because its worth spending a little extra time to save a significant chunk of money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
