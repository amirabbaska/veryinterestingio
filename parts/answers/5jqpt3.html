		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The curing process for leather renders it far less conductive than the original flesh was.  This is mainly due to the removal and replacement of water with some kind of oil.  The thing that makes your skin conductive enough is the water on the surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are specifically designed leather gloves that are conductive enough. I own a pair of gloves with TouchTec leather (IIRC) and they allow me to use my touch screens with no issue, besides reduced accuracy due to the leather fingers reducing my overall dexterity a bit.</p>
<p>What's more, I even managed to scan the fingers of the glove into TouchID so i can unlock my phone with the gloves 'fingerprint'.</p>
<p>So in summary, some specifically designed leathers do function in this way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's resistive and capacitive touch screens. Resistive is where you press in a bit and you can use pretty much anything to interact with it. Capacitive is what most smart devices use and it detects an electrical signature on the screen. Some screens are more sensitive to the electricity than others and can pick it up easier. The leather glove restricts the electricity from transferring. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since leather is treated it has lost its similarity in conductiveness to human skin. A curious fact is that orange peel does have the same conductive properties as human skin and will in fact work with a smartphone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many touchscreens DO work with leather gloves. It all depends on what they were optimized for when they were designed. It's possible to increase the sensitivity of the touchscreen by increasing the gain of the drive that &quot;powers&quot; the screen. However, this comes with tradeoffs, including the possibility of false touches from extraneous noise. In some touchscreen applications (industrial markets and casino gaming, for example) the potential impact from false touches  is FAR more serious than someone not being able to produce a touch while wearing gloves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
