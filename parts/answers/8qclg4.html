		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water in bottles (as in store-bought bottled water) can and does stay fresh for long periods of time.  </p>
<p>Once you open a bottle of anything, it's exposure to the outside air will eventually change the flavor, but in my experience, a previously opened bottle of water will still taste about the same for some period of time as long as it continues to be cold, and assuming that the bottle is re-sealed.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a physician but I have a degree in chemistry</p>
<p>Eli5: water mixes with air, which changes the water, which makes the water taste different. </p>
<p>ELI older than 5: Old water tastes different because as water interacts with the air, CO2 from the air mixes with the water. This causes the pH to change, which changes the taste. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exposure to air. Remember, bottled water sold at the store manages to stay just fine for weeks and weeks too.</p>
<p>When water (or soda, which is just water plus carbonation plus flavors) gets packaged and sold, the packaging is airtight. You usually can't make it air-tight again yourself, even if you screw  the lid back on really frigging hard. Exposure to air means dust can settle on top of the water, bacteria could in theory move in, stuff dissolved in the water or soda has somewhere it can leave to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
