		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: It helps get blood moving. </p>
<p>More: Blood returning to the heart in a vein passes through a bunch of one-way valves that prevent blood from flowing down into the feet. A muscle contraction squeezes a vein together from the outside, and the one-way valve means the blood has nowhere to go but up. Shaking your arms and massaging your muscles essentially accomplishes the same thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have a natural tendency to shake our limbs after a really good stretch, which is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretch_reflex" target="_blank">stretch reflex</a>.  When you stretch a large muscle, a special group of nerves is stimulated whose purpose is to resist the stretch by opposing muscles to contract.  When you shake your limbs you are easing that stress caused by the push-pull action between the opposing muscle groups and that's why you feel better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
