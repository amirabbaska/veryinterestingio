		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually quite common, there are more binary stars than singular stars. <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/speed-light-galilean-relativity/" target="_blank">They can be used to show that the speed of light isn't added to the speed of the star</a>, because otherwise the light from the far star would catch up to the light from the closer one as they orbit. Generally though they have a more mutual orbit, as a great size asymmetry is less common. Sirius is an example of a star that fits your criterion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. In fact, the closest star system to our own, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" target="_blank">Alpha Centauri</a>, is actually a trinary system, in which Alpha Centauri A and B orbit in relatively close proximity, and a third, Alpha Centauri C (aka Proxima Centauri) orbits further out.</p>
<p>Alpha Centauri C is a very small red dwarf, while A and B are of roughly comparable size to our Sun.</p>
<p><a href="http://oi60.tinypic.com/30wxdeg.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a rough diagram of what the system looks like.</a></p>
<p>As far as stars joining other systems, that's more complicated (but in fact may have happened with Proxima Centauri joining the Alpha Centauri system). Without some very complicated orbital mechanics, any star which passes near another star will likely just pass by with a very slight change in trajectory. To enter into an orbit, one or both stars must decelerate.</p>
<p>Captured planets or moons (like some of Jupiter's moons) are possible because they alter the orbits of other planets or moons by throwing them into a larger or smaller orbit (transferring energy between the two bodies) in order to decelerate and fall into a stable orbit around a larger body.</p>
<p>When you're talking about a star, which is many times larger than a planet, it would take an immense amount of energy to decelerate the object enough to create a stable orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey I actually know a bunch about this! Binary stars are super common, but the case is not generally so much that one star captures another and it sticks around, but rather stars have a tendency to form this way. This is actually the same case as with planets too.</p>
<p>The coolest thing about binary stars is they have a huge range of separations, from many thousands of astronomical units on the larger side, to literally touching as you bring them together. Contact binaries, as these very close stars are called, are like the coolest thing ever. Gravitational forces go like 1/r^2, but the <em>tidal</em> force, which is the same force the moon exerts on the oceans, goes like 1/r^3, so contact binary stars are dramatically deformed from spherical and end up looking <a href="http://www-tc.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/overcontact-binary.jpg" target="_blank">super wonky and really really cool</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know I am VERY late to the game here, but HD 91962 is a nifty quadruple system where the central star has three others orbiting like planets.</p>
<p>The G0V is HD 91962A.
The M3V is HD 91962B.
The first K5V is HD 91962C.
The second K5V is HD 91962D.</p>
<p>The last three orbit around the first as though it were as a planetary system.  Paper below:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most stars are actually located in binary systems, and a significant number are in bound systems that are even larger, such as the Alpha Centauri system ( A and B are orbiting eachother, and the binary systems orbits (and is orbited by) Proxima Centauri). </p>
<p>It should be noted, however, that there is no significant tendency for binaries to consist of very large and very small stars. Instead, the smaller star typically has a mass <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1211.5936" target="_blank">approximately uniformly distributed</a> between 10% and 100% of the mass of the larger star.</p>
<p>In most cases, these binary systems resulted from two stars forming close together in clusters, with few stars forming from captures. This is because unless a star is already in orbit around another star, it will fly in and fly back out of the larger star system as a result of conservation of energy. In order for a star to be captured, it must dump its energy into another object (which escapes), but close stellar encounters are extremely rare in most of the galaxy. One possible location for stellar capture is in dense globular clusters. When a binary star system  has a strong encounter with a single star, the least massive star will probably be thrown out of the system, and a new binary will form consisting of the two heavier stars. Such binaries will likely have stars of similar masses, because light stars are ejected. </p>
<p>So while some binaries form through stellar capture, they are likely to consist of stars of near-equal mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
