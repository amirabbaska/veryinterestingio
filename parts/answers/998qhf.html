		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so I work in the industry of antimicrobial testing, and no, it's not a legal disclaimer, we test and see how much of a log reduction a product gets and we literally scrub the shit out of the device or surface or whatever, so no, it's not a CYA claim, it is based on actual FDA or EPA regulated testing on very specific strains of bacteria, fungi or viruses, or appropriate surrogates. The remaining bacteria or other microbes not killed may very well develop resistance and there are even concerns that some previously non-pathogenic strains of E. faecium and faecalis have evolved to be resistant to alcohol based sanitizers. And yes, sterilants can kill even super bad spore strains, but the contact times are like 20 minutes for even the best, trendiest ones used on devices. And those sterilants are pretty nasty. Basically, don't overuse any antibacterial substance, and know that manual scrubbing of contaminated surfaces with any cleanser or disinfectant goes a long way, a product just works better when you scrub and use at the proper contact time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 0.01% form spores or slime layers that are resistant to alcohols and detergents that are in the wipes. The purpose of the chemicals is to destroy bacterial cell walls. However, if the germ has a protective layer, it can remain on surfaces until it enters a more favorable environment. Not to mention, when the cleaners <em>do</em> kill bacteria, the cell remains still remain on surfaces after being broken apart, so there is still a possibility of triggering immune systems even though the bacteria can't actively grow.</p>
<p>C. diff is one particular organism that is rampant in hospitals for this reason (that and the patients are already <del>immuno-compromised</del> deprived of protective gut flora due to antibiotic therapy). That's why healthcare workers have to physically wash their hands by scrubbing for a period of time, and not just use hand sanitizers/cleaners.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question. Before addressing it, it's prudent to understand first what's in the wipes/cleaners that's affecting bacteria. Most household wipes &amp; cleaners either contain 70%+ alcohol, bleach, detergent and with additives such as oil formulations, and enzymes. You will not find any antimicrobial agent classified as &quot;antibiotics&quot; in these products out of concern for antimicrobial resistance development. </p>
<p>Also before tackling the question, it's also prudent to consider the bacterial load. In common household surfaces, the typical bacterial load will range around 10\^3 for seemingly clean surfaces to 10\^5 or 10\^6 for dirty surfaces upward 10\^9 in the kitchen sink or bathtubs. (These units are colony forming units per ml). Most household sanitizers boast an impressive 4 log reduction (as determined from laboratory assessments in-vitro) which translates as 99.99% bacterial killing. The 0.01% of bacteria referred to in the question will translate into 0.1 or practically 0 or 1 for seemingly clean surfaces, 10 or 100 bacteria for dirty surfaces and 100,000 bacteria for kitchen sink or bathtubs. As you can imagine, depending on the bacterial load in different surfaces, the number of surviving bacteria can influence their surface recolonization if their growth conditions are satisfied which would be true for kitchen/bath or their potential for infection.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about why 100% killing can never be achieved with household wipes/cleaners. Alcohol dissolves bacterial membranes and denatures proteins/nucleic acids. This agent is very effective against Gram negative bacteria but less so against Gram positive bacteria. This is due to their cell membrane structure. In addition, some bacteria have a slime coating that confers increased protection against chemical insults. Also, some bacteria in the environment are found to be living in complex communities of polymicrobial aggregates called biofilms. In this state, bacteria that are found in the deepest part of the biofilm remain protected against chemical insults. (this is my area of expertise and while there seems to be a debate as to why these bacteria remain protected, chemical agents have a very hard time penetrating the entirety of the biofilms). </p>
<p>Bleaches or quaternary ammonium compounds also act upon bacterial membranes. They react against membrane proteins or glycolipids and sometimes create pores or disintegrate the membrane. Again, here, the same principles apply as with alcohol sanitizers. Depending on whether the bacteria has a thick membrane, is encapsulated with a slime or glycocalyx or is embedded in a thick biofilm, the effectiveness will vary.</p>
<p>Some posts mentioned contact time, concentration of the antimicrobial agent, application of heat, mechanical perturbation, killing kinetics of the antimicrobial and yes they will all invariably affect the outcome of the antimicrobial treatment. Regardless, for any given population of bacteria, there is a portion of bacteria that's called persisters in the microbiology literature that resists/tolerates antibiotics but also chemical treatments to some degrees. These are not bacteria that gained or developed bacterial resistance to specific agents but turns out to be metabolically inactive bacteria that just don't respond to the treatment. Interestingly, research has shown that once the antimicrobial agent is removed, these persisters can grow and restore the population. If this was a hereditary trait, the new population would be resistant in a second round of treatment but research shows that's not the case and that there is always that small fraction of bacterial persistence/tolerance to antimicrobial agents and chemical treatments. </p>
<p>I have read some posts here on reddit where users were arguing whether or not its possible for bacteria to develop resistance to membrane damaging antimicrobials. The short answer is yes. There is scientific literature showing bacteria can modify their membrane lipids and enrich them with membrane proteins that provides them with improved protection but again this would depend on the antimicrobial. Some bacteria can resist certain quaternary ammonium compounds in this manner. Alcohol and bleach, universally no, but I have first hand observed and recovered very small number of bacteria from biofilms that were treated with 70% and 10% bleach.</p>
<p>In the end, it's a long winded answer to your question but there is a lot of factors at play. The TL;DR is that these small portion of bacteria that resist killing are likely in a metabolically inactive state or are deeply embedded/protected by bacteria in biofilms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They never work even that well. There's a temporal aspect to it as well, how long the exposure to disinfectant actually is. That quick spirt of purel is just a security blanket, possibly a net negative if you're taking a squirt from a pump dispenser in a public place everyone is touching.</p>
<p>As a parallel to illustrate the dynamic, in cooking you're supposed to heat chicken to 180 degrees to make it safe, but in sous vide you only heat the chicken to 150 degrees. Why?</p>
<p>Because at 150 it takes around an hour to kill off enough of the microbes in chicken to make it safe, vs almost instantly once the meat reaches 180.</p>
<p>First experiment they had us do in microbiology lab during undergrad was called &quot;the ubiquity of microorganisms&quot;. In it we stamped a media plate with our thumb, washed our hands and stamped again, did a full surgical scrub and stamped, then dunked our thumb in 70% etoh for a minute then stamped.</p>
<p>There was growth from all 4 thumbprints, for every student in the class. But the amount of growth was a clear progression with how intense the sanitation step was.</p>
<p>As someone who works in a biohazard lab, aside from physical PPE like disposable gloves and gowns olde-fashioned handwashing with soap and water is how we decon ourselves, and the mechanical action of washing our skin is doing more than any antimicrobial properties in the liquid soap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
