		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They leak mostly emails. Emails contain a mechanism called DKIM which basically inserts code into the email when it is first sent. With this code you can 100 percent verify if they were tampered with and the source. </p>
<p>Using said method you can easily see all emails released by wiki leaks are verified. The site has never released an email that was not. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, wiki leaks is more accurate and trustworthy than MSM. </p>
<p>This only goes for emails. Everything else would need Authentication using other methods. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The documents Wikileaks releases are genuine, by any journalistic standard, nor have they been found by anyone to be forged. This is WHY the Wikileaks releases have caused such consternation for those in power over the past decade. </p>
<p>If you are old enough to remember the Afghan War Logs and the Collateral Murder video leaked by Chelsea Manning, (then Bradley Manning,) you know the history of where those documents came from and how Wikileaks protects its sources as EVERY journalist in the business does.</p>
<p>Documents posted by Wikileaks are extremely reliable.</p>
<p>Don't let your partisan duplicities get in the way of cold hard facts, or you're no better than the Republicans defending war crimes when it was their turn to come under Wikileaks' looking glass. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i think that if anything WL released was not genuine then WL's detractors and enemies would be all over the airwaves and internet crying FAKE NEWS! at light speed.</p>
<p>the collective lack of anybody speaking out against the veracity of the WL source documents is all the proof i need that the documents are valid, genuine, and accurate.</p>
<p>good question tho</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
