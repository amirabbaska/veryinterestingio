		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are caused when the small blood vessels on the surface of the eye (sclera) become enlarged and congested with blood. The term &quot;bloodshot&quot; is actually sort of grossly accurate, because your red eyes are the result of blood vessels on the sclera - the white part of the eye - becoming swollen. The cause of that swelling, though, can vary wildly. On the one hand, red eyes can be caused by simple environmental irritants.
In general, red eyes usually are caused by allergy, eye fatigue, over-wearing contact lenses or common eye infections such as pink eye (conjunctivitis). However, redness of the eye sometimes can signal a more serious eye condition or disease, such as uveitis or glaucoma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has to do with irritation. As some others have mentioned, this can be due to your eyes not being well moisturized during your sleep (though this doesn't happen to everyone, or even to the same people all the time). It can also be due to lack of sleep (where your eyes are still 'tired' and irritated due to fatigue), or because of other issues (like excessive dust in the air directly after waking).</p>
<p>That being said, the first two are the most common reasons I'm aware of - outside of a hangover hehe</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also to add to the other answers: during the day, when your eyes are open your cornea (the transparent part) gets most of it's oxygen through the air that permeates through the tear film.</p>
<p>During the night it has to make do with the much lower supply coming from a circle of vessels around the rim and the oxygen coming from the blood vessels on the inside of your eyelid.
(People with droopy eyelids often exhibit neovascularisation of the cornea under the part that's permanently covered)</p>
<p>Add some drying out and irritation and -bam-
bloodflow gets increased , leading to red eyes.</p>
<p>This is also the reason why you shouldn't sleep with most contact lenses on, as they will further limit the flow of oxygen from the eyelids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
