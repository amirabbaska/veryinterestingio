		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general it is to protect either existing information sources, such as a spy planted in another government, personal information, which was inadvertently discovered over the course of the investigation and the public does not need to know, or information that is not relevant to the discussion, such as earlier versions of a final draft which had incorrect conclusions.  Occasionally, it will be hidden to protect other classified data as well, which is likely why the recent 9/11 pictures came out.</p>
<p>Basically, much of the hidden evidence was tangentially related to the investigation at one point, and is labeled as such, but does not produce material that is useful to the public either for verification or may harm other US interests.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if this is 100% correct but in US History class the teacher said that one of the reasons is that the government waits 75 years because they want everyone associated with it or anyone who was living in that generation to be gone before they open up and release the information. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so say there was a big ol' terrorist attack in the US and a lot of people died.  The country wants a detailed investigation into what happened to find out who did it and why.  You work for the FBI and need to track down that info.  You call up people all over the world.  Finally, you land a lead from a CIA agent in Pakistan.  He points you to a couple of people he knows who may have some info.  You track them down and get what you need to pin the attack on a bunch of Dbags living in the US that played a role in the attacks.  You wiretap said dbags, track their cell phones, and then freeze their bank accounts.  Finally you arrest them and it's time for a public trial.  Hold up though!  You don't want your sources to be uncovered.  The CIA agent is a mole in Pakistani intelligence and it would totally cause an international incident if his ID was leaked.  The agent's sources are close to the terrorist cell that carried out the attack.  You don't want to blow their cover either.   You also don't want to disclose exactly how you managed to track the suspects because you don't want other nations to know the government's spy capabilities.  So you classify the info, that way the sources are protected and so is the US gov's spy capabilities.</p>
<p>You start to feel good.  You can take the dbags to trial and know that the country's interests are protected.  Then you look at the 1000's of pictures that were taken.  It just so happens that the site of the attack was in an office building owned by the government where a lot of sensitive information was stored.  Well, you don't want to expose anything about the construction of the building that may show architectural flaws or its physical security, or may show sensitive documents, or show any computer servers.  Then there are the pictures of the dead and injured.  The press already has a bunch of pictures they took; nothing you can do there.  But you don't want to show the most gruesome stuff because you don't want to upset the public or inflame tensions with anyone.  You also find a bunch of info on the victims that would infringe on their privacy were it to go public.  So you classify all that too.</p>
<p>25 years pass.  Your CIA agent is now retired.  The agent's sources have been granted asylum in the US.  The building that was attacked is no longer being used by the govt and the govt agency that used it has relocated to a new, better building.  The technology in the pictures is hugely outdated.  You decide that the public can learn a bit more about the attacks and investigation because it won't really affect any US government interests any more.  You declassify the info.</p>
<p>You also decide that you're still not going to release a bunch of docs because they contain private information about a bunch of people who are still alive.  It would totally infringe on their right to privacy and wasn't really relevant to the investigation anyways.  There are also some documents you have about the spy project in Pakistan, which is still ongoing even though your spy friend retired.  You decide to keep that stuff classified.  You can always try declassifying it again in 25 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
