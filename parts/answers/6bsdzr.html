<p>The real answer is that we have no idea. Some people will say that it has to do with pressure changes in the atmosphere and how that effects scar tissue or healing fractures. However, this doesn't pan out when you actually try to look at it. Not everyone gets this sort of pain, and even people who do get this pain don't always get it with pressure changes. Such as airplanes, traveling to the mountains, etc. It's completely unpredictable. However, it is totally a thing. It is absolutely a real phenomenon that people experience. We just have absolutely no idea as to exactly why.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
