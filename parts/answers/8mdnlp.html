		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we say the universe is flat, we don't mean it in the planar sense. We are referring to the shape of spacetime. Imagine you have two lasers that are perfectly parallel to each other. In a flat universe, they will behave as we expect and remain parallel forever. In a curved universe, on the other hand, the lasers would actually start to bend towards or away from each other. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has yet addressed the second part of your question, so make an attempt. The famous image of the CMB is supposed to represent microwaves coming towards Earth from all directions. The images you see of the CMB are displayed usually on screen or on paper, which is of course flat. This can be misleading. A more accurate way of showing the CMB would be a globe. <a href="https://www.physicsforums.com/insights/poor-mans-cmb-primer-part-0-orientation/" target="_blank">Here</a> is an example. You are floating in the middle of this  globe, and the colours you see on the globe surrounding you represents the temperature of the microwaves coming towards you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can experience curved three-dimensional space <a href="http://h3.hypernom.com/" target="_blank">here (H3)</a>, <a href="http://h2xe.hypernom.com/" target="_blank">here (H2xR)</a>, <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/rtavenner/Uniform-Polychora/master/index.html" target="_blank">here (S3)</a> or <a href="http://www.roguetemple.com/z/virtual-crocheting/" target="_blank">here (another S3)</a>. The space itself is curved, so the geometry is different. For example, in the H2xR link, if you press '2', you can see that you have a grid of &quot;squares&quot;, but five of them meet in every vertex, so their angles are 72 degrees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
