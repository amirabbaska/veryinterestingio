There are many people working on newer blockchain currencies taht have many improvements, one of them is faster block minutes. The reason why these aren't released yet is that they don't want to split up the community. It will be released when it's done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, this is something Bitcoin Unlimited  (a proposed fork of the chain) is supposed to do. Exchanges won't support it, though. There was some kind of letter signed by the major exchanges such as Bitfinex and BTCchina that said that even if more miners mine BTC unlimited that they will not consider it the &quot;real&quot; bitcoin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
