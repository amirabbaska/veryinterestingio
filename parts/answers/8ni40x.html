		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you are watching a movie. The first number is how the person in the movie is moving. The second number is how you are watching the film (normal or in reverse).</p>
<p>1 x 1 is a person walking forward, you watch it normal. Answer is you see a person walking forward, which is 1.</p>
<p>1 x -1 is a person walking forward, you watch it in reverse. You see a person walking backwards. -1</p>
<p>-1 x 1 is a person walking backward, you watch it normal. You see a person walking backwards. -1</p>
<p>-1 x -1 is a person walking backwards, but you watch it in reverse. What you will see is a person that looks like they are walking forward. 1</p>
<p>Edit: I first saw this explanation on a prior ELI5. Just restating it to help spread the knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If we take the opposite of the opposite, we are left with what we started with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a whole book about this sort of question: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Negative-Math-Mathematical-Rules-Positively/dp/0691133913" target="_blank"><em>Negative Math</em>, by Alberto Martínez</a>.</p>
<p>Basically, it's possible to come up with alternative arithmetic systems in which &quot;minus times minus equals minus&quot;, but they would not have the nice consistent properties that we want out of conventional arithmetic.</p>
<p>The same goes for defining the imaginary and complex numbers. There are different ways we <em>could have</em> defined them, but the way that we <em>do</em> define them makes them work out correctly for various purposes, both in pure math and in applied math and engineering.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a direction (which it is on a number line). Negative means backward, positive means forward. Add is add distance, multiply is change how big your steps are.</p>
<p>Your equation says “travel 1 backward, change to backward of current direction” (that might not be the best phrasing but I hope you get it).</p>
<p>It says turn 180 degrees, if you turn twice you are facing forward again. I think it helps the most if you draw it out on a number line though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
