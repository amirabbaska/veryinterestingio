		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A random high school band teacher may be a great conductor, and a great (world class) conductor may make a terrible high school band conductor.  (Though in my experience, most conductors who rise to the top of their field are prodigiously inspiring communicators and could probably coax beautiful music out of an elementary school recorder ensemble -- but this is not to say that they would excel at the day-to-day grind of teaching young musicians).  </p>
<p><strong>IN PERFORMANCE</strong>    </p>
<p>In very, very, general terms, a high school band conductor has to put more emphasis on the mechanical elements of a performance -- keeping the beat, adjusting balance, cueing entrances and cutoffs, etc.  Depending on the level of the ensemble (which varies IMMENSELY at the high school level), the director may have to spend all of his/her energy just ensuring a mostly-accurate rendition of the music, OR with more proficient students he/she may have more room to focus on artistic/expressive interpretation.  </p>
<p>A conductor of a world-class orchestra rarely has to work to keep the ensemble together (though it depends on the complexity and familiarity of the music), and rarely has to worry about preventing trainwrecks in terms of intonation, accuracy of rhythm/pitch, blend/balance, etc.  The conductor <em>does</em> make adjustments to these elements, but on a much more subtle level that the average person would barely notice.  A professional orchestra could perform most repertoire without a conductor and it would sound fine.  But a great conductor can take it to the next level and beyond -- first of all, the conductor can hear the 'bigger picture' of the whole orchestra better than any individual musician, and second, the conductor has a vision (audiation?) of the music as he/she imagines it, and can sculpt the orchestra's performance through body language and (what sometimes feels like) sheer psychic force of will.     </p>
<p><strong>IN REHEARSAL / PREPARATION</strong>    </p>
<p>So far I'm only discussing what the conductor does <em>in performance.</em>  In reality, the conductor's main job is what happens in rehearsal.  A high school band director is, first and foremost, a teacher.  Depending on the level of the students, the teacher spends a lot of time crafting lessons to teach technical skills and concepts, as well as fixing wrong notes, developing music reading skills, working on exercises and warm-ups to improve tone and intonation, giving instrument-specific technique instructions for solving problems that the students may be too inexperienced to figure out for themselves, etc.  (Not to mention managing behavior, maintaining records, communicating with parents, and all of the clerical/leadership duties involved in classroom teaching and managing a performing organization).  </p>
<p>A world-class conductor doesn't have to micro-manage the fingers and lips of an orchestra full of technically-superior musicians--the conductor will express what kind of sound he/she wants and the musicians will know how to make that sound.  (In some cases the conductor will give specific instructions, for example telling the violins to play with the tips of their bows, or to use a specific hand position or fingering -- but this is a matter of establishing a consistent section sound and matching the conductor's interpretation, not a matter of teaching the musician something they didn't know).    </p>
<p>To be fair, a high school conductor typically does all of the things that a world-class conductor does, but often has to focus a lot more on the educational/technical/mechanical aspects of rehearsing/performing.  The artistic/expressive/interpretive aspects of music are an essential part of this, but they're not particularly effective until the kids are playing accurately and together.  Further, the level of artistry a high school conductor can coax from an ensemble tends to be less nuanced due to the relative inexperience of the students and the presence of 'weak links.'  (That said, a strong high school ensemble can play quite maturely).  </p>
<p>A world-class conductor can take most of the educational/technical/mechanical aspects for granted (at least on a macro level) and focus almost entirely on artistic expression and very subtle shading/sculpting of the technical aspects.     </p>
<p><strong>GENERAL TRAITS</strong>    </p>
<p>Ultimately, conducting is a matter of leadership and professionalism.  World-class conductors, by and large, are RIDICULOUSLY accomplished musicians with incredible ears and insanely deep and intimate understanding of the repertoire.  Every day they have to stand in front of 60-80 of the world's best musicians and earn/maintain their respect and awe.  They have to inspire and lead and communicate their interpretations of the music to 60-80 individual musicians who all have their own ideas and interpretations.  </p>
<p>High school conductors have to do the same but the leadership tends to be more about teaching and classroom management skills, similar to the leadership required of any academic teacher.  It typically goes without saying that the band director is a much more accomplished musician than his/her students (though not necessarily a <em>better</em> musician -- there is the occasional hotshot student who could compete with the teacher in certain areas of proficiency, but probably not in terms of experience and breadth of musical understanding).  But in a high school ensemble, simply being a strong musician is rarely enough to lead and inspire a group of kids, many of whom are only there for fun and don't really care much about developing into professional musicians.  A world-class conductor may get good results guest-conducting a high school band due to the awe factor and his/her fresh approaches and inspiring demeanor, but wouldn't necessarily be up to the task of the daily pedagogy and management required to prepare the student musicians.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to keep in mind that a conductor is nearly always the leader of the orchestra, too.  So for weeks and months before you see him/her waving a baton around, they were in charge of auditioning band members, selecting the music, organizing rehearsals, making artistic changes or interpretations to the piece as it goes, and directing each section and musician.  So there was a hell of a lot of behind-the-scenes work that we don't always think of.</p>
<p>As far as actual performance, a good conductor is giving a dozen instructions at once.  Speed, volume, and style are all communicated by single movements.  Are his beats large, waving motions, full of drama?  I'll bet there'll be horns blaring long, sonorous notes.  Are they short, tight, precise movements, close to his chest?  You're almost definitely going to be hearing soft, short staccato notes.  Is he facing the trombones, pushing one hand down while conducting with his other hand?  He's asking them to play softer - maybe the acoustics in this room aren't what they're used to, and they're overpowering the rest of the band more than expected.  There are a million little adjustments that will go on in any given performance, and a good conductor can make them on the fly in very clear ways.</p>
<p>And of course, all of that body language goes to the audience too.  When you see that person swinging their arms in big, wide arcs, you'll get excited, even as the music begins to swell.  And when you see them sweep their arms in, you'll lean in, straining to hear the soft parts of the music.  The conductor is a visual cue to you to tell you what your ears can expect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A great conductor does all things mentioned in the thread so far, but what sets one above all others for me is of they can bring musicians out of their own heads and make them CONNECT to the music.  Technical skill is only means to an end, and in the end what really matters is if you made the audience feel something.<br />
My choir conductor will regularly have these incredibly deep speeches about the music we're performing, and he always gives us so much to think about right before we begin (these speeches are often within the hour before we go on).  He understands what is really important to the audience and people in general, and is really willing to be as vulnerable as we need to be.<br />
I remember once we were performing Eriks Esenvalds' &quot;Rivers of Light&quot;, and what he said to us was actually so incredibly vulnerable and heartbreaking that it made it hard for us to focus on the technical aspects of the piece; but we had one of our most incredible performances of that year, and the audience responded extremely well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answers below, but I've found a lot of people (not the people answering below, just in general) don't really know what a conductor does. Hint: He's not just waving a stick in time to the music.</p>
<p>Here's the thing about playing in an orchestra: You can't actually hear all the other instruments. If you're in the middle of the brass section, chances are you can't hear the flutes. So you don't know if you're playing in time, playing too softly or loudly or if you need to slow down or speed up.</p>
<p>That's what the conductor is for. He's front and center and can hear everyone. So his job is basically to signal each section when to come in, indicate the tempo, when to play louder or softer...and this is really <em>really</em> difficult to do well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good conductor synthesizes and provides an immense amount of information at any given moment. Clear cutoffs, attention to musical expression, balance...the list goes on in other posts.</p>
<p>A GREAT conductor not only provides the mechanics that the ensemble needs to function, but provides leadership. A great conductor empowers their ensemble emotionally and musically. They need to be a total technician in regards to their conducting, but it has to serve an artisitic end.</p>
<p>Otherwise...it's just noise!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
