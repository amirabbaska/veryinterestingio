<p>Edit:
Yes, there’s an A battery. Yes, there’s a B battery. No, they didn’t name them after bra sizes. No, that joke you stole from another post about “the louder they scream” isn’t hilarious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put it simply, Cell voltages are not compatible </p>
<p>The long answer is A and B exist, or rather existed. These are the battery sizes you're likely most familiar with: D C AA AAA P3(most people call them 9 volt batteries)</p>
<p>The naming conventions were sort of standardised by two organisations, ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and IEC (International Electrochemical Commission) who tried to herd together the different national and company-specific naming conventions for batteries and try to produce standardised batteries that could be used across various consumer devices and for different purposes.</p>
<p>The batteries you see above go by many different names (still!), though they are often marketed under a fairly uniform identifier these days. For example, AAA batteries can also be identified as [1]:</p>
<p>By IEC:
LR03 (alkaline)
R03 (carbon–zinc)
FR03 (Li–FeS2)
HR03 (NiMH)
KR03 (NiCd)
ZR03 (NiOOH)</p>
<p>By ANSI:
24A (alkaline)
24D (carbon–zinc)
24LF (Li–FeS2)</p>
<p>Other marketed names:
U16 (In Britain until the 1980s)
Micro
Microlight
MN2400
MX2400
Ministilo (Italy)
Palito (Brazil)</p>
<p>That's just for AAA batteries. As you can imagine, there are a great many different types of batteries floating around various markets with different dimensions, constituent chemicals, capacities and names. Many were standardised in name only and fell out of favour due to poor up-take or availability. </p>
<p>This is precisely what happened to A and B (and a host of other) batteries. AAAA batteries exist, though are used only with very, very thin devices like penlights. As one user commented above. </p>
<p>Ps. A size batteries are hard to find as well. In fact, I can't even find a picture of one, because they were primarily used in really old laptop batteries. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
