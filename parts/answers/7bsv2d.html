		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a question about the paper vs plastic debate. I am a chemical engineer, and I have done research on some of these type of debates when I was in college. Most studies found that paper actually takes more energy to make, and recycling wood pulp actually creates a higher CO2 output on the environment, while most plastic items are relatively simple and easy to make, without the massive expulsion of CO2 on the environment. While this is true, it is also true that plastics,when littered in the environment do have a strong impact on wildlife. My question is, how can paper recycling create more CO2 output but still be considered a safe replacement for plastic?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've heard that of the meat we eat, cows are by far the biggest contributor to climate change. In response to that, I've tried to cut out beef and replace it with other meats like pork or chicken. </p>
<p>First, is this true, and is it worthwhile to cut out beef alone?</p>
<p>If so, what then is the added benefit from moving from a beefless diet to a vegetarian diet?</p>
<p>Lastly, is there then a greater benefit moving from a vegetarian diet to a vegan diet?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Edit: I think to make this question simpler, above, you state the value of going vegan. Is most of this value from cutting out beef?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How does an extra person release 58t of CO2 per year if the other emissions are so low?</p>
<p>So if driving, flying and bad eating habbits only can account for 5t per year, what causes the rest +90% of the carbon foot print?</p>
<p>Also how is the living car free is calculated? Is it based on walking instead of driving? Riding bike instead? Using bus instead? Using train instead? Moving next to work place and walking instead? Also some people drive car 1km per day, others 200km per day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
