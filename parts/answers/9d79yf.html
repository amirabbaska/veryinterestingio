<p>When this happens through a permeable membrane (skin which is not water-tight), we call this Osmosis. </p>
<p>If the % of salt in a sea-snail's body is equal to the saltiness of the water it lives in, he will not lose moisture, but if we took him out of the sea and put him in a bucket of water which has extra salt dissolved in it, the sea snail would suffer the same fate as a land-snail covered in salt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><del>Eesh, not many comments here and half of them are a train wreck and not even ELI5, so I'll have a go:</del> EDIT: True at time of posting, not so much now. Taken the opportunity to fix a couple of write-like-I'm-five errors whilst I'm at it. Carry on!</p>

<p>You know how you love to slurp your juice out of your cup? Well, salt loves to slurp water out of things just like you do. Even salt in water can slurp <em>more</em> water out of things. Salt <em>really</em> likes water, just like you <em>really</em> like juice. Slugs in the garden have a lot of water in them (it's why they are squishy and wet), and if you put salt on them the salt slurps the water out of the slug. You know how you don't like it when you slurp all the juice out of your cup? Well, slugs really <em>really</em> don't like it when salt slurps all of the water out of them, and they die. But slugs in the sea are special slugs, because even though the water in the sea is <em>really</em> salty, so is the water in the slug, so there is no slurping and the water stays in the slug. The sea slug is happy in the sea, it's used to it. The garden slug wouldn't like it though, they like gardens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Real ELI5: Osmosis is when water goes back and forth through a membrane (skin is a membrane) it is more likely to get stuck on the side with more stuff in it, especially if that stuff attracts water, like salt does. </p>
<p>Sea-creatures get around this by having similar concentrations of salt in their bodies as in the ocean, so they neither lose or gain more water than they should in their salty environment.</p>
<p>Even so, you can still expose a seasnail to too much salt and kill it, it just needs to be surrounded by more salt than what you'd find in the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt is deadly to most life.</p>
<p>The founding and principle statement of toxicology is &quot;everything is poison, and nothing is not poison; only the dose makes the difference between poison and not poison&quot;. In layman's terms, in the right concentrations, even healthy things can be deadly and deadly things can be benign or healthy.</p>
<p>For snails, who constantly secrete moisture, pouring pure salt on them will suck a bunch of moisture on them and cause them damage and death. If you put yourself, or an elephant or whatever, in a room full of salt, the same thing would happen, only more slowly because mammalian skin is less moist and permeable than snail/slug skin. </p>
<p>For sea snails, the concentration of the salt in the ocean is much lower than pouring pure salt on them; the salt in their bodies exists in balance with the salt outside their bodies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
