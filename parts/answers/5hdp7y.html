<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/6kG96" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/6kG96</a> (<a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/how-much-meat-contribute-to-gw.html" target="_blank">source</a>)</p>
<p>The main sources of greenhouse gases are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Electricity and heating (24.6%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deforestation (18.3%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agriculture (13.5%)</p>
</li>
<li>Transportation (13.5%)</li>
</ol>
<p>For each of those sources, there's a different set of possible solutions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>(a) Electricity generation: Coal is more than just a present that Santa gives to naughty kids. It is also the worst source of energy for heating and electricity that we have. Natural gas power plants emit about 50% as much CO2 per kilowatt-hour as coal power plants. Coal pollution also kills about 800,000 people every year, or 1136 times as many as died in the first 5 seasons of <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/entertainment/game-of-thrones/" target="_blank">Game of Thrones</a>, so getting rid of coal power is a good idea no matter what. (Unless you just really hate people.) Nuclear, hydro, wind, solar, and geothermal emissions are close to zero. We should use more of those. <a href="http://imgur.com/a/DIJfM" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/a/DIJfM</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_greenhouse-gas_emissions_of_energy_sources" target="_blank">source</a>) (b) Heating: switching to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/District_heating" target="_blank">district heating</a> is the most efficient option. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_pump" target="_blank">Heat pumps</a> and improved building insulation are also good options. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Deforestation: This is largely <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation#Causes" target="_blank">driven by agriculture</a>. Government policies can be put in place to protect forests either by controlling land rights or charging forest clearers money which can be used to plant trees elsewhere. We can also reduce the amount of land needed by agriculture by producing the same amount of food on less land. This can be achieved by making (and eating) less meat, by reusing land more, or by using better agricultural technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Agriculture: About 66% of all agricultural emissions come from meat production. Beef production is responsible for most of this. Making a pound of beef produces 2x to 5x as much greenhouse gas as making a pound of pork or chicken, and 20x as much as making a pound of beans. The problem with beef is cow bellies. Specifically, the stuff that comes out of cow bellies. There are two different things that come out of cow bellies: burps and poop. Cow burps contain a lot of methane, and methane is about 30x more powerful as a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. As for cow poop (manure), when it decomposes it produces a lot of nitrous oxide, or laughing gas. That might sound funny, but nitrous oxide is about 10x more potent than methane, or 300x more potent than carbon dioxide. The solution? Don't eat beef at all, and when your parents tell you to eat your vegetables, do it.</p>
</li>
<li>Transportation: When you want to go somewhere, use the bus, walk, ride a bicycle, carpool, or tell your parents to buy an electric car.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other comments have great answers on how to reduce the amount of CO2 you cause, but I want to point out why that's more important right now than removing it. </p>
<p>Think of atmospheric CO2 as water in a big bathtub.  Lots of us are little spouts adding water, and there's a drain way at the bottom.  It's filling up because all of us are pouring in more water than the drain can let out. Soon it will overflow and we'll have a big mess.</p>
<p>You're asking how to make the drain bigger.  That's a good question but it's hard to make it bigger because it's hard to get at and expensive to change (we don't have efficient technology for removing carbon from the air, and rely mostly on natural processes).</p>
<p>But the goal isn't really to drain the tub.  It's to stop it from overflowing and then to get the bath down to the right level for bathing in.  We can do that by making the drain bigger, or we can do it by adding less water.  You have a lot more control over the CO2 and other gasses you cause to be emitted than you do the amount of CO2 that leaves the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The amount of CO2 something or someone (like you!) causes to be emitted is their carbon footprint, but we also care about other gasses like methane and CFCs that also fill the bathtub.</p>
<p>A really easy but really powerful first step is to eat less meat, particularly beef.  Cattle use something like 4 times the food to make the same amount of meat that a chicken can, and they put out a lot of methane too, which is much worse than CO2.  If you go from eating beef daily to only once a week, you'll have a big impact.  You'll save money too!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question. Time for a bit of optimism. </p>
<p>First, realise this is the greatest opportunity we've ever had to build a better world and revitalise every industry we currently have and lots we haven't even invented yet. </p>
<p>The technology is there and we're more than capable, today, of switching over to it in developed counties and helping less developed countries go straight to green. </p>
<p>Second, forget all this stuff about turning off lights, not using plastic bags etc. It's a lie created to allow industry to blame individuals for something that can only be dealt with collectively. You going green in these small ways is great but it's a drop in the ocean. Everyone wants change. No body wants to change themselves. We're been trying to convince people to change their habits for 40 years, and yet here we are. But do try and get governments to enact policies that address this, collectively, and tell anyone who'll listen how important it is. </p>
<p>Third, grow out of coal and natural gas use. Build lots of nuclear and power plants that use renewable energy sources. Invest heavily in fusion research. Ban or more realistically control/regular heavily arable agriculture (cows are the worst). </p>
<p>Four, make being green a requirement that must be considered in ALL government policy making and by every business. If it can't be green, it shouldn't be done. </p>
<p>Five, remember pollution etc is not the same as climate change. Pollution is usually quite local in effect (although not always). Climate change is global and so is the solution. </p>
<p>Finally, climate change is a problem created by a system created and controlled by people. There is nothing inevitable about it. Beating is not impossible, it is necessary. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A simple &amp; partial answer: plant trees.
Tress photosynthesize more oxygen, take up CO2, provide shade, and do wonderful things for your soil. Their roots help open up (effectively ventilate) your soil which allows CO2 to get in where it's converted to humus by various microbes. Soil formation can store <em>a lot</em> (dont have numbers handy) of carbon, the trouble is that it takes forever.
Reasons shade is useful: reduce energy costs for buildings, esp in summer. Keep waterways cooler which generally provides better habitat conditions. Warmer water also absorbs more CO2. </p>
<p>Other ways: recycle, buy local, buy secondhand, walk more, take the bus, turn off the lights in rooms you aren't in, take cold showers, really anything to reduce the amount of energy you consume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Buy less processed food.  The amount of waste and pollution that goes into the growing of corn to turn into cheap processed crap is obscene.</p>
<p>Reduced your intake of meat, particularly beef and pork (whenever possible get free ranged organic, but buyer beware just because it says so on the package doesn't mean it is) </p>
<p>Drive less.  Walk more.  Let your lawn overgrow (new plants suck up more C02) and be wild.  Look into alternative energy options, there's still incentives for them.</p>
<p>Vote for politicians who are acknowledging that this is happening.  Buy from companies that are working to reduce their carbon footprint.</p>
<p>Get the Buycott app for this, it's amazing.</p>
<p>And now a note on GMOS because it will come up. I generally oppose them, but not for the reasons most people cite.  A few years ago I read a book, Diet for a Hot Planet by Anne Lappe, and one of the main points in it is about how our food is grown and processed is one of the biggest contributors to global warming and yet gets ignored.</p>
<p>it's a hugely wasteful process, not just in terms of water, but top soil and fossil fuels (fun factoid: Most industrial fertilizers and pesticides are made from fossil fuels) and a huge polluter (look up exploding pig shit)</p>
<p>what does this have to do with GMOS, well, they're being marketed as the future of agriculture because they can withstand the harsher conditions that were created by us and our wasteful farming techniques.  It's like taking more insulin so you can eat more sugar as opposed to cutting sugar out your diet, it's addressing a symptom in order to avoid dealing with the actual problem.  Furthermore it's almost always corn, which is one of the most inefficient food sources we have.  This promotes monoculturism which is further degrading to the biosphere.</p>
<p>There also isn't much evidence that they actually do increase yield when compared to say organic produce.  Of course it's the techniques that are wasteful so it's not enough to grow organic, we need to address the way we grow our food.</p>
<p>Permaculture is a far more promising program to build a more sustainable food production system.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
