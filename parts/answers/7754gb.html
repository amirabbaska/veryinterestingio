		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it:</p>
<p>HIV’s genome is made of RNA. In order to infect human genomes, it has to first be transcribed into DNA. It accomplishes this via a protein called “reverse transcriptase.” Reverse transcriptase has a very high error rate. It makes a lot of mistakes. Because of the high rate of errors and the high rate of reproduction of HIV-infected cells, there’s a lot of mutations that are different but still functional. That means that HIV has a lot of opportunity to mutate in a way that makes our treatments no longer effective. </p>
<p>That’s why most AIDS patients are on what they refer to as a “cocktail.” It’s not just one treatment. It’s like 5 or 6. So if their particular strain starts to develop an immunity to treatment A, they’re still affected by treatments B through E. </p>
<p>That said, there technically is a “cure” for it. A small subset of the population has a natural immunity to HIV. Their immune cells aren’t susceptible to infection by HIV. By chance (I think), one of those people donated bone marrow to someone who was HIV positive. Bone marrow is the place in your body that makes immune cells. The donated marrow began producing HIV-resistant immune cells. Eventually, the patient was AIDS-free. </p>
<p>However, bone marrow transplants are very dangerous and risky, and have high rates of failure and/or patient death from complications. So while there is technically a cure, it’s not a very useful or viable cure. It’s not terribly worth it considering that the HIV treatment cocktail has become very good and effective and most HIV patients live longer and have a better quality of life compared to bone marrow transplant recipients. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, the distinction between HIV and AIDS. HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is the virus that is transmitted between people and that causes AIDS. HIV likes to infect immune cells (or certain types of immune cells), which are the cells that are called to action to get rid of (or clear/resolve) an infection of any kind. </p>
<p>AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) is a set of rare/unusual diseases that can occur in HIV-infected individual when the HIV virus has destroyed a certain amount of immune cells.</p>
<p>AIDS is pretty preventable, if using the right medications. Most people with HIV can avoid progressing to AIDS if they're taking the right medicines and if they're taking their medicine properly. <a href="http://www.aidsmap.com/Life-expectancy-near-normal-in-people-with-CD4-counts-over-350-a-year-after-starting-therapy/page/3142626/" target="_blank">This is thanks to antiretroviral therapy (ART)</a>.</p>
<p>So far, HIV itself can be controlled but not cured. A lot of commenters have touched on important aspects of HIV that make it hard to fight. However, it is important to note that HIV, as a retrovirus, integrates into the genome of the cells it infects.</p>
<p>What this means is that once it gets into a cell, HIV takes its genome and puts it into the genome of the cell it is infecting. This means that, for that particular cell, HIV is now part of the DNA of the person. (This only happens in infected cells and it does not happen to &quot;germline&quot; cells, so you can't 'inherit' HIV in the way you would inherit, e.g., eye colour). This is different from other non-retroviral viruses, which by-and-large remain outside of the host genome. It is currently very hard (read: impossible) for any methods we have to determine which cells have this little HIV stowaway and which ones don't.</p>
<p>This is all aggravated by HIV's preference for certain immune cells. Essentially, the cells that are responsible for clearing viruses are the targets of HIV infection. This is bad at first because when an HIV infection starts, these cells rush to the site of infection to try to limit the spread - and this ends up making it worse. As time goes on, HIV destroys these immune cells; this weakens the immune system so that it becomes unable to protect the body against HIV (and, in the context of AIDS, it becomes unable to protect the body against all sorts of things that immunocompetent people never have to worry about).</p>
<p>The answers provided by /u/wittymcusername and /u/burhunk are also important, but I think you should also keep in mind that HIV isn't like a lot of other viruses - once it is inside a cell, it becomes essentially indistinguishable from the host by inserting its genome into the host's genome. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Berlin_Patient" target="_blank">person cured of HIV</a> that was mentioned by /u/wittymcusername was only cured because his immune cells (in which HIV lives) were destroyed (by radio/chemotherap) for the stem cell transplant he received (<a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/acute-myeloid-leukemia/treating/bone-marrow-stem-cell-transplant.html" target="_blank">because he had acute myeloid leukemia</a>). I don't think this would ever be done in the case of an HIV+ patient that does not have acute myeloid leukemia because radio/chemotherapy for cancers are very damaging in themselves. Also, this man was lucky to be compatible to someone with an HIV-resistance - not everyone could have received stem cells from this donor. Even if you did want to use this as a &quot;cure&quot;, you would need a lot more donors with the HIV-resistance phenotype (called &quot;delta 32&quot;) than there actually are.</p>
<p>If it makes you feel better, there are hardly any cures for any viral diseases (<a href="https://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/features/cure#1" target="_blank">Hepatitis C</a> is the only one I can think of off the top of my head; maybe rabies, although  I'm not sure whether to count it as a cure). Most resolve on their own (by the action of the immune system), or never resolve. Some of these viruses do infect immune cells, but are different because they do not integrate into the genomes of these cells like HIV does. </p>
<p>Vaccines are usually the best approach to combat viruses. They are not a cure exactly, but they prevent an infection from happening in the first place. Why <em>vaccines</em> don't work for HIV (so far) is a different story - this relates more to what other commenters are saying about high error rates and a disguised shell (/u/Its_just_a_Prank-bro). Basically, HIV changes too quickly for vaccines to keep up. This is superficially similar to how you need to get a different Flu vaccine every year.</p>
<p>Edits: removed an extra period and corrected &quot;Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome&quot; to &quot;Acquired immune deficiency syndrome&quot; (thanks /u/jeffbaier)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've heard that most people with HIV can live relatively normal lives thanks to the development of drugs in this field. In fact, I think I remember reading that the levels of HIV in the blood of positive people is so low that it's virtually impossible to pass it on. Is this true?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm seeing many comments on here that diseases are kept infectious because they're 'profitable.' Please take off the tin foil hat. </p>
<p>I am a medical research scientist and I can tell you, the massively talented team I'm in work extremely hard to combat illness and improve survival rate. </p>
<p>Sure, unfortunately some treatments for illnesses are not manufactured. This is due to a cost-benefit analysis of the medication. A costly to produce treatment for an uncommon illness, or treatment that may not be hugely successful or it doesn't improve survival rates much, will not be marketed. Even if there is some evidence it works. Unfortunately that's the way of it. Whenever we get the red light on a product line, we all think 'but if my mum had this illness...and companies have shelved a cure...' But we need to move on and focus on a treatment for an illness that's extremely common: HIV/cancer for example. Not only would this net massive profits for the company that have put in sometimes hundreds of millions into R&amp;D, but it will save, or improve, countless lives. </p>
<p>If we produced medication at a loss, we'd go out of business. And then there'd be no more cures for anything. The cost of medical isn't the cost of producing it, that pales in comparison to the cost of developing and approving it. Recently we did an animal trial on 3 pigs. The cost? 1.8million GBP. To show something we already knew. Add that on top of a 3 year project which has already cost in excess of 30million and you'll see where the cost comes from. </p>
<p>And if this product doesn't make it to market, the losses also have to be recouped from somewhere. I.e. Another product line. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question!</p>
<p>To put it simply:</p>
<p>When HIV infects a new cell and inserts its genetic material into the cell’s DNA, it has two choices. It can start making more viruses right away (this is what happens the majority of the time) or it can choose the sneaky option. The sneaky option is to do nothing.</p>
<p>Inhibitors (HIV treatment) can find cells making HIV and stop them, but they can’t do anything when a cell’s only sign of being infected is a little bit of virus DNA. These cells that have the virus DNA that aren’t actively making new virus are the latent cells</p>
<p>Someone with HIV who takes a few doses of inhibitors and stops might be fine for a while, but eventually the latent cells in their bodies will become active and start making virus. Then they’ll get sick all over again. </p>
<p>This life-long cycle of inhibitors is the only way to keep HIV in check until scientists can find a way to kill latent cells before they ever start making HIV. With a combination of inhibitors and drugs that target latent cells, we’ll have a cure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
