		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of metals react with oxygen and moisture to form an oxide. Steel is just iron with a bit of carbon and various other elements to control its exact properties. The iron in steel also reacts with moisture and oxygen (its relatively passive to just oxygen, the moisture helps the reaction along.) Unfortunately iron oxide doesn't stick well to iron because metal expands as it turns in to iron oxide so it flakes off. In addition iron oxide is slightly porous and can adsorb additional moisture, so the rusting process progresses through the metal. </p>
<p>Some metals react with oxygen and form a compound which doesn't undergo a significant volume change and doesn't flake off. One such metal is chromium. In addition chromium oxide is pretty stable and is relatively resistant to chemical attack. Stainless steel is steel where a significant quantity of chromium has been added - this chromium reacts rapidly with oxygen in the air and forms an incredibly thin but inert layer on the surface preventing oxidation of the iron. Other alloying elements can be added to further improve the resistance of stainless steel under particular conditions. (High temperature, salt water etc)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My time to shine!</p>
<p>My job is a Metallurgist inspecting stainless systems on a large engineering assembly.</p>
<p>As many others have said, the Cr content in the steel helps develop a passive protective layer that prevents oxidisation on the surface. However if that layer is damaged, either mechanically or chemically, the underlying material can rust, and in some cases can rust faster than normal steel. If the atmosphere doesnt allow the material to repassivate the potential for the materials corrosion is greater. </p>
<p>In my industry, chlorine contamination is particuarly bad, and as halides are extremly good at depassivating the material, cleanliness is important. </p>
<p>Whats more S/Steel can be more susceptible to other types of corrosion,such as pitting than a normal steel and in the right (or wrong) conditions this can lead to stress corrosion cracking (SCC). Ive got a collection of Stainless bolts that after a few years i stagnant sea water have corroded away very severely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Welder here.</p>
<p>Stainless steel can rust under the right conditions. However, the reason why rust doesn't form in normal conditions is of the added chrome that produces a chromium oxide layer. Other alloys are added to stainless steel to give it mechanical properties that are needed for particular applications. 329 stainless steel for example resists oxidation in salt water environments. 304 stainless steel would rust in a salt water environment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It should be noted that stainless steel got it's name in England when Harry Brearly applied the newly developed chromium steel alloy in the production of kitchen cutlery. They were purported to &quot;stain less&quot; than other knives. No one made the claim that they did not stain (or corrode) at all. You will notice this if you have ever left a nice knife at the bottom of your stainless sink for a while (if wet).</p>
<p>In addition to what others have said, stainless steels (the 300 series) can even be <em>more</em> susceptible to corrosion that plain carbon steels. There's a really interesting mechanism called stress corrosion cracking that is rather counterintuitive, but can be devastating if it occurs. When you have a susceptible material, a corrosive environment, and tensile stresses SCC can occur. All three conditions must be present. Certain materials are more susceptible to certain corrosive environments while tensile stresses could be either applied loads or residual stresses from installation.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>For instance, a 304 or 316 stainless steel piping system carrying a product that contains chlorides above 140F (common in process piping) is <em>extremely</em> susceptible to SCC. The tensile stresses required for SCC to occur is much lower than what you'd expect the steel to fail at which makes designing a system very difficult. To make matters worse, typically the surface of the metal still looks relatively clean and shiny. This leads to many owners/operators being unaware that the integrity of their system has been compromised by widespread cracking. Either whole sale replacement of all the piping with another material that isn't susceptible (duplex steels for instance) or the introduction of environmental controls need to occur to fix the problem. In the latter case, you probably need to replace all the piping anyway since it's already been compromised.</p>
<p>SSC is pretty new to me but has been the focal point of a recent project at work so I'm still learning. I wish I could explain how exactly the corrosive environment and tensile forces interact to cause a usually corrosion resistant material to corrode, but that's still beyond my knowledge. I just know that it occurs with specific stress-material-environment combinations which makes it difficult for designers to account for. If there's a metallurgist or materials scientist that could chime in, that'd be super helpful.</p>
