		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Starvation mode&quot; is a myth. Well, not really a myth, but you won't go into it unless you're actually <em>starving</em>. There is no &quot;modes&quot; that you switch on and off to lose weight. </p>
<p>Losing weight is as simple eating less calories that your body uses. You can find out how many calories a day you need by entering your information (height, weight, etc) into an online TDEE Calculator. (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
Most fad &quot;diets&quot; are just disguised as some miracle food or strategy, but are really just low calorie diets in the end. </p>
<p>Most people should start by eating 250 less calories than their TDEE, and if that doesnt work over 2 weeks than make sure youre counting correctly, and if you are move to -500 calories. You should lose .5-1 lb a week at -500 calories of your TDEE.</p>

<p>When you donâ€™t eat enough calories, your body freaks out and starts conserving energy and you go into starvation mode.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not really, no. Starvation mode isn't really a thing, it's mostly an excuse people use when they don't diet strictly.</p>
<p>As long as you are burning more calories than you take in, you will lose weight, period. Don't worry about all the mumbo jumbo like &quot;starvation mode&quot; you read about, just find whatever method works for you in restricting calories (keto, intermittent fasting, various diets, etc).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>>  What marks the difference?? </p>
<p>In &quot;fat burning mode&quot;, your body has sufficient triacylglycerol stores and dietary protein to provide your brain, liver, red blood cells and pancreas with glucose via gluconeogenesis.  These are the organs which cannot survive off of ketone bodies alone.  Blood sugar levels will actually rise slightly, as your muscles become insulin resistant in order to conserve glucose for the above organs.</p>
<p>In &quot;starvation mode&quot;, your body has depleted its triacylglycerol stores and must begin breaking down muscle proteins to keep blood sugar levels above 40 mg/dL (which in turn prevents your brain from going into a hypoglycemic coma).  Starvation mode takes <strong><em>several</em></strong> weeks of eating at a <strong><em>severe</em></strong> caloric deficit.  Avoiding it is trivial - maintain a healthy body weight and limit weight loss to a couple of pounds (of non-water weight) per week.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chronic calorie restriction results in a reduction of TDEE and the body holding on to bodyfat in case things get [worse].  You will slowly probably lose some weight and be hungry much of the time.   You body will grudgingly use some bodyfat.</p>
<p>If you just DID NOT EAT, aka fasting, your body gives up on holding on to bodyfat -- the time has come!  You switch over metabolically to burning fats.   At night when you sleep, assuming here you had dinner at 6pm and then stopped eating!, you  enter this state which is why it's called break<em>fast.</em></p>
<p>Then on alternate days, eat until you are full.  You'll still lose weight.  Check out /r/intermittentfasting</p>
<p>Staying IN fat-burning mode is called nutritional ketosis.  Check out /r/keto for more info.</p>
<p>There isn't a starvation mode, snack companies came up with that to claim you have to eat all the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you eat sufficient nutrients(protein, vitamins and minerals), but insufficient calories(fat and carbs), your body will liberate fat for energy.  If you eat both insufficient nutrients and calories, your body will start to liberate fat and also catabolize muscle tissue for the raw materials required for maintenance of essential systems.  You stay in fat burning mode by consuming a nutrient dense hypo caloric diet(either by reducing calories or increasing expenditure).  This isn't a black and white thing, it's a spectrum.  There is some speculation that reducing carbohydrate intake will promote fat burning mechanisms and pathways in the body, and i think it's a reasonable approach.  I know people who have lost a lot of weight restricting carbs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
