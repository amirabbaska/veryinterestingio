		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally, the potential energy stored in the bow by the action of pulling back the string is all applied to the arrow you shoot.</p>
<p>If you release the string with no arrow to receive all the hullabaloo, this energy is instead transferred to the bow itself, which cam be enough to break or shatter it, causing splinters in the eye or even a cut up hand or arm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of these comments are quite scientific so I’ll change it up and use an example:</p>
<p>Imagine you have a spring. You push a marble against the spring. When you stop pushing the marble the spring sends it flying. </p>
<p>When you push down on a spring without a marble and let it go the spring jumps up. </p>
<p>The same thing happens with a bow, but because you hold a bow, it can’t jump up. So all that movement goes through the bow and damages it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An arrow has mass. When you release a drawn bowstring, the mass of the arrow requires an amount of energy to accelerate it from 0 to \~300 feet per second (91.44m/s). Without the mass of the arrow absorbing this energy (watch a high-speed video of an arrow launch. The shaft bends wickedly under the forces of the string, and oscillates back and forth along its path to the target), it has nowhere to go but into the risers of the bow itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was learning to do archery, the instructor said that when you dry fire, all the energy has nowhere to go. If you have an arrow nocked, all that the stored energy in the string and limbs gets transferred to it, allowing it to fly far with significant force. If there's nothing there, all that force gets fed back into the limbs. </p>
<p>When you're talking bows with higher draw strength, you're putting upwards of 70lbs or more of force back into two thin strips of plywood. That's going to shockwave through those limbs and eventually cause cracks and material fatigue. Do it enough and the bow could snap. That's a very dangerous situation that can potentially result in serious injuries to the archer. One of the first rules of archery they teach you is to always inspect your bow for any visible damage. Rental bows especially. </p>
<p>If you are testing the limbs or doing a practice draw, the safe way to &quot;dry fire&quot;, is to firmly hold onto the string, pull it back, then let it slowly pull your arm forward into the bow's resting position without letting go. That way the built up energy is slowly and safely released through your arm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
