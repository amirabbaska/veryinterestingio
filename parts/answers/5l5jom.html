		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Animals do sit down and eat a meal together. Well carnivores do. Lions will eat in a group, strongest first. Zebras dont. Why? Its the nature of their 'prey'. As soon as humans started preying on animals far larger than a meal there would have been a subsequent need to collate the food, process it, then eat it as a community. You cant snack on a mammoth and even a decent sized deer is gonna keep a lot of people fed for a while, but only after its brought back to the community, butchered and (at some stage in time) a cooking process was installed. Given the opportunistic nature of hunter gathering I think a large amount of snacking went on, but as humans became more sophisticated hunters of animals larger than their immediate appetites then central meals become more important. If we'd evolved from Zebras we'd just sit at work in the office all day munching on grass snacks and there would be no need for a lunch break.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think an assumption in your question and many of the answers are incorrect: grazing animals do not eat all the time!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Rabbits graze heavily and rapidly for roughly the first half-hour of a grazing period (usually in the late afternoon), followed by about half an hour of more selective feeding. In this time, the rabbit will also excrete many hard fecal pellets, being waste pellets that will not be reingested. If the environment is relatively non-threatening, the rabbit will remain outdoors for many hours, grazing at intervals. While out of the burrow, the rabbit will occasionally reingest its soft, partially digested pellets; this is rarely observed, since the pellets are reingested as they are produced. Reingestion is most common within the burrow between 8 o'clock in the morning and 5 o'clock in the evening, being carried out intermittently within that period.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think only herbivores or animals who need to intake  a lot of calories everyday snack like your describing. Herding animals eat grass all day cause they kinda have too. But like carnivores I know share meals because one catch can feed a lot and one big meal allows them to eat every few days instead of all the time.</p>
<p>Most humans have the luxury to eat big meals or snack. I for one am a snacker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

When the boys would bring back a successful hunt everyone would dig in and they'd have a feast. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference between humans and other primates is that humans in general eat much more nutrient dense foods.</p>
<p>e.g. gorillas have to just graze almost constantly, but humans have probably always ate what you'd basically call larger meals. And that's probably true for now-extinct species of omnivorous apes too.</p>
<p>Having the free time to not eat all day is a pretty major part of our progress. So I think that led to us being human instead of the other way around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
