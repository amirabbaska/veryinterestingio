		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This usually happens when your pillow is either too high or too low. Example: you're lying on your left side with 3 pillows under your head. This causes your head to be pushed too far toward your right shoulder. All the muscles on the right side of your neck are in a shortened position for a long duration of time while you sleep and get tight. There are also small joints on the side of your spine that will get compressed in this position. On the other hand, if you're lying on your left side with one flat pillow, your left ear and left shoulder are too close together and can cause issues on that side for the same reasons described above.
When sleeping,  you should try to keep your head/neck as neutral as possible. To much or too little support and you could be in for a rough day. If you're a side sleeper, try to keep the base of the pillow tucked between your neck and shoulder to provide good support. Stomach sleepers seem to have neck issues due to being in full rotation for prolonged periods of time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe this has to do with your neck muscles having to constantly hold your neck in place all night, to prevent movement or damage, which causes soreness the following day. </p>
<p>It's like if you've ever been camping and slept at an oblique angle to a slope. In this case, your back muscles, shoulder muscles, and abdominals have to constantly work to keep from sliding or rolling, so you wake up sore.</p>
<p>When you sleep, your body makes adjustments on its own. With your neck in an awkward position, you will press against the awkwardness until either your head finds a natural resting point, or you wake up. So you wake up and your neck is sore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
