		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you have it backwards. The unit circle is not the main mechanism to describe the trigonometric functions, the trigonometric functions are the main tool to describe the unit circle! Circles are what we want to know about, and trigonometric functions are one of the main ways that we do this. </p>
<p>With this in mind, note that circles are one of the most important things in Euclidean planar geometry. They geometrically keep track of distance. The Complex Plane is an ordinary Euclidean plane, and so the circles on it will help us keep track of distances on the complex plane. In fact, complex conjugation gives us a really direct way to access distance through the arithmetic of complex numbers (telling us that geometry and the complex numbers go hand-in-hand). The most basic of these circles is the circle centered at 0 of radius one which is just the Unit Circle as seen as a subset of the Complex Plane. So we have a setup where we've found a unit circle and we want to study it, and our main tool for this it trigonometry and the trigonometric functions. </p>
<p>So, because the Complex Numbers have a very, very close relationship with planar geometry, and trigonometry is how we analytically investigate planar geometry, we find that trigonometry and the Complex Numbers are often seen hand-in-hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T647CGsuOVU" target="_blank">Imaginary Numbers Are Real</a> (YouTube series of short, relevant videos)</p>
<p>I learned a lot of important stuff from that series of short videos. They're the most thorough and easily understood math videos I've seen. Highly recommended. They will explain the relationship you asked about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi op, so the reason they aren't really taught together is to really appreciate eulers identity or formula you have to have a bit of understanding of calculus and infinite series. But for simplicity sake what euler found was that if you take the series representation of sine and cosine, when added together they look very similar to the series representation of e^x. In fact what he found that e^ix is =cos (x) + i[sin(x)]. Which when we evaluate at x=pi we get his famous identity e^[i(pi)] + 1 = 0.  So to finally answer you question yes they are related and this relationship allows us to model and evaluate complex wave functions using exponentials which are much more easier to work with then trig functions typically. These have wide applications in physics and engineering, notably in electronics applications. I forgot to note that the complex plane and the unit circle are infact the same thing the only difference is, the complex planes y-axis is imaginary and thus all values have an I coefficient. This effectively makes all the unit circle an effective tool for evaluating imaginary numbers, which is quite important since they pop up in all areas of physics and engineering. And if you have ever tried than you know that it is quite difficult to factor complex polynomails. Hope this helps let me know if you need clarification on anything. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is not so much that the unit circle is related to the complex plane.   It's that the complex plane is the same thing as a two dimensional plane, on which the unit circle exists. </p>
<p>Imaginary numbers are orthogonal to real numbers.  That means that they don't influence eachother..  they ho in completely seperate, non-parellel directions.  The real axis is the x axis, and the imaginary the y.</p>
<p>As such,  rules of trigonometry apply to complex numbers.   A complex number is a vector - a coordinate in the x-y plane, or the distance and direction from the origin to that coordinate.   </p>
<p>So if you square the real component and imaginary component,  add them together,  and take the square root,  you can find the magnitude of the vector. Which is the distance to the origin,  and also the hypototonouse of the triangle.</p>
<p>So the complex number 1+1j would have a magnitude of 1.414.. </p>
<p>If you have a unit vector - a complex number with magnitude 1, like .707+.707j, then it describes a point of the unit circle.   The arctangent of the imaginary component over the real component tells you the angle. </p>
<p>Because we're only in two dimensions,  rotations are also simple.  If you multiply a complex number by another complex number,  it will stretch and rotate the first number.   Keeping things simple,  if you multiple a complex number (a point) by a unit vector, it will rotate the first point by the angle of the vector.</p>
<p>So if i multiply 1+1j by .707+.707j, I should rotate the first number by 45 degrees.  With the result being a vector 1.414 long,  and at 90 degrees along the y axis.  Ie, 0+1.414j.  Multiply them out and see if you get that. </p>
<p>Multiply 1+1j by .707-.707j, and you should rotate it by -45degrees, back to the real (x) axis.  Multiply them out and see if you get 1.414+0j.</p>
<p>If you multiply a vector by a non-unit vector,  you won't just rotate the first vector.  You'll scale it by the magnitude as well. </p>
<p>So 1+1j times 1+1j should scale the first vector by sqrt (2) or 1.414, as well as rotating it from 45 to 90 degrees.  So you should get 0+2j as the result.   Try it out.</p>
<p>Finally,  that brings us to the idea of a complex conjugate.  a+bj and a-bj are complex conjugates. If you multiply then together,  you should get no imaginary terms, just a^2 + b^2.</p>
<p>And this makes sense,  because you're taking your first vector,  and multiplying it by itself flipped over the y axis.  So you'll scale it by its own magnitude (sqrt (a^2 + b^2))^2 = a^2 +b^2 and you'll be rotating it by its exact opposite angle,  returning it to the x (real) axis.  So you get the square of the magnitude as a real number by multiplying conjugates. </p>
<p>This stuff is all interrealated, and good job for picking up on it.  With some experimentation,  you should be able to see how euler's formula fits into all of this. But rather being limited to the unit circle, this has to do with the entirety of vector math and linear algebra.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are interested in all circles, not just the unit one - but of course it's then just simple scaling. Dealing with the unit circle removes factors of <em>r</em>.</p>
<p>As a point of interest, crank open your complex numbers textbook and read the chapter about roots of unity. The gist is that there are two numbers that are one when squared (1 and -1), three 'cube roots' of unity, equally spaced around the unit circle on the complex plane, four fourth roots (1, -1, <em>i</em> and -<em>i</em>), still equally spaced around the unit circle, and so on.</p>
<p>What isn't generally mentioned - perhaps because it's obvious, but I had to think about it, is that something similar holds for numbers other than unity, but the roots don't stay on the unit circle. The square roots of two lie on a circle of radius 1.414, but the fifth roots of two lie on a circle of radius 1.149.</p>
<p>Perhaps you find this pretty or irrelevant, but possibly it demonstrates the power of the unit circle as something everything else can be scaled from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
