		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the speed of light plays a factor in a lot of physics beyond just how fast light moves. So if you want to propose a &quot;variable&quot; speed of light, you have to produce the set of measurements that will show your proposal to be better than the existing assumption. Several attempts have been made in the past to derive a variable speed of light, but none of them have panned out experimentally, as far as I  know. </p>
<hr />
<p>As a <em>rough</em> example, let's say your theory predicts that electrons will have different orbits because obviously the speed of light factors into the electromagnetic force that governs how electrons are bound to the nucleus. So you would predict that, as you look out across the universe, the spectral lines of atoms should shift by <some function>. Then you take spectroscopic measurements of distant stars and galaxies. If the spectra differ by your prediction, and can't be explained by other competing ideas, including the current models, then it supports your theory.</p>
<p>What we haven't seen are those kinds of measurements. Obviously we can't go out with a meter stick and stop watch and measure how long light takes to go from a to b. So we have to use indirect measures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others haven't mentioned it yet, currently we believe in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_principle" target="_blank">cosmological principle</a>. It states that the properties of the universe are <del>uniform</del> homogeneous and isotropic on large scales, which includes the constants. Only because of this assumption we can calculate distances of very far objects based on their red shift, for example.  </p>
<p>We don't know for sure if it is true, but currently there is no compelling reason to not believe so.  </p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Changed one word, homogeneous is the more official word used</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In science, you can never be &quot;sure&quot; about anything.  It's based upon observation and testing of hypotheses.  As long as observations corroborate existing theories and hypotheses, we're &quot;sure&quot;.  When that fails, we become unsure and then either find a way to fit the observation into our existing understanding, or change our existing understanding to fit in the new and old observations.</p>
<p>We &quot;know&quot; that the speed of light is invariant only because all of our hypotheses about variable light speeds don't pan out in observations.  Based on what we see here in our patch of the universe, there's no reason to believe that the speed of light is any different in any other patch of the universe.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting discussion.<br />
Consider that the gravity within a black hole is so dense that not even light can escape.
Would it then be accurate to say that photons within the event horizon are slowed?
If so, would photons nearing the event horizon be accellerated as gravity exerts an inexorable effect on them?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What most of the answers here aren't talking about is that there is stuff in the galaxy we can see that relates to the speed of light.</p>
<p>This lengthy article is in response to creationist bafflegab about light slowing down over time to explain the apparently old universe, but it sort of relates to this question:  <a href="http://infidels.org/library/modern/dave_matson/young-earth/additional_topics/supernova.html" target="_blank">http://infidels.org/library/modern/dave_matson/young-earth/additional_topics/supernova.html</a></p>
<p>Some TL;DR: We can see supernovas far away and see how their light travels through the dust around them and calculate their distance with trigonometry, which isn't affected by the speed of light.  We can use spectronomy to observe element decay, and see that it matches element decay here.  We can see spinning pulsars that are extremely accurate clocks, and they don't change over time.</p>
<p>Basically, when we combine all the evidence we can see in the universe, nothing has shown up that indicates a changing speed of light, and we have a number of datapoints showing that where we CAN check the speed of light far away, it's the same there as it is here, and doesn't change over time in any measurable way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
