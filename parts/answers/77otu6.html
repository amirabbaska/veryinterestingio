		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know video and books are definitely different. but paper books and audio books are processed in the mind almost identically. so when you listen to an audio book it is nearly as if not better than reading the book and handled almost identically in the mind.</p>
<p>Better with a particularly good reader as they can help you engage better.</p>
<p>it seems reading words and listening to words uses the same &quot;portion&quot; of the brain.</p>

<p>there is a forbes article back to 2011 saying the same thing but I can't read it any longer (ad block blocker)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Marines/Navy did a study in the 60s on how people learn the best.</p>
<p>The study was done over 10 years.</p>
<p>What they found is some people learn better by listening, some by reading, and some by doing.  </p>
<p>And you even the people who are best at one form of learning can have it reinforced by another.</p>
<p>So the military especially in basic training try to teach everything 3 times in 3 ways.  You get the information told to you, you hear others being corrected and you yourself being corrected... as well as responding or repeating.  You do it hands on in many different ways and under varying levels of stress.  The third method you get a book of knowledge and they have you study it in any down time.  </p>
<p>Now another thing they don’t do that was found in the 90s</p>
<p>Record yourself reading your notes.  They need to be recorded in 15 seconds or less snippets.  Making each an audio file of its own.  Play it back to yourself on repeat and shuffle.  Your brain interprets your voice as your inner monologue and builds pathways based on what you hear.  If data is only memorized in one sequence then you remember it like that.  But if it’s memorized as short bits of data that’s how you remember it.  So you end up with a better recall because the information isn’t dependent on something else, and the pathways get linked all over the place to different bits of similar data.  </p>
<p>You read it multiple times, see it, read it out loud, and hear it.  Each time your brain makes a link among the data it links everything that it associates with that information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to know how this would vary across the different &quot;types of learners&quot; as well (kinesthetic, visual, auditory etc). E.g. is an audiobook better for an auditory learner? If someone could verify if those learning types have any scientific basis or if they're just made up nonsense that would be good too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remembered reading this article when I saw your question: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/19/readers-absorb-less-kindles-paper-study-plot-ereader-digitisation" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/19/readers-absorb-less-kindles-paper-study-plot-ereader-digitisation</a></p>
<p>Granted it is a small study, but I can identify. When I read physical books or listen to them, I remember a lot of detail. When I read digitally, I don't remember much at all. I'm halfway through a book on my Kindle right now and I can't tell you the name of it, the author, or any of the main characters' names.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
