		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not entirely understood. We don't know if the pain comes from pain sensing nerves, or by the visual information carried by your optic nerve.</p>
<p>The former is straight forward enough, the latter would mean the pain is a result of your brain detecting the signal is too strong and creating the feeling of pain to protect your eyes. Which would need a lot more study.</p>
<p>Much better comment that I paraphrased:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>eye doc here.  In bright light your iris contracts which causes your pupil to get smaller.  The iris and attached uveal tract is a relatively large radial muscle in the eye.  Depending on other factors (such as your eye's size and any inflammation that may be present in the muscle) you may experience a tightening or even actual pain.  This is called photophobia and may be a sign of inflammation in the eye called either iritis or uveitis.  These can then be signs of broader systemic inflammatory conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter syndrome, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease,  psoriasis, etc.  Typically though there should not be any physical pain associated with bright lights so if you have this, go get your eyes checked.  I have diagnosed may people with systemic diseases through their eyes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>im an optometrist. </p>
<p>eyes feel like they hurt because of ciliary spasm. the nerves involved pupil movement ride off another nerve. </p>
<p>when someone gets an inflammatory condition of the eye, we can give drops to knock out the iris and this stops the spasm.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without getting too physiological, your eyes are adjusted to let in as much light as possible when you’re in the dark since there is a scarce amount of light for your brain to produce an image. So your pupils are widened. When you move into the light, there’s a brief period where your eyes are letting in too much light which can harm your eyes in their current state. So your eyes adjust accordingly to decrease the amount of light flowing in. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
