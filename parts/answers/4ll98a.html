		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>South African historian here. You also have to take into account the different historical conditions under which Afrikaans developed. </p>
<p>Dutch settlement in South Africa was never as systematic or considered as British settlement in North America was. The Dutch East India company initially never saw South Africa as more than a refueling station, a stopping point for Dutch fleets travelling from Europe to Asia. It was never intended to be a &quot;colony&quot; in the same way that America was. The fact that it became such happened almost by accident </p>
<p>As a result, the South African frontier was a much more ramshackle and haphazard place.  The company recruited settlers from all over Europe- primarily the Netherlands, yes, but also France, Germany, and other places. Many of the initial settlers in the Cape didn't even speak Dutch as a first language, and if they did it certainly wasn't &quot;proper&quot; Dutch. We're talking down and outs, here; vagabonds, scoundrels, the out of luck and the unemployable. Bear in mind, also, that this was before technological advances made mass communication possible. Language in general was far more idiosyncratic and differentiated at that point in history, and different regions and social classes already spoke very different variants and dialects of the same &quot;language&quot;. </p>
<p>Now, throw these people onto a frontier region where they're encountering radically different languages- KhoiSan languages, Bantu languages, Malay languages, all the rest. These individuals have to develop a common argot with which to communicate with one another, and the result of these efforts is a frankly mesmerising blend of many different dialects. That is how Afrikaans developed; as a kind of linguistic shorthand that allowed people from many different backgrounds to communicate efficiently with one another,. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spelling and pronunciation have migrated over time as well.    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dutch digraph ⟨ij⟩ was converted to ⟨y⟩ in Afrikaans, although pronunciation remained [ɛi]. An example is &quot;prijs&quot; (price), which is spelt &quot;prys&quot; in Afrikaans. Dutch words ending in ⟨lijk⟩, however, end in ⟨lik⟩ in Afrikaans, not ⟨lyk⟩, for example &quot;lelijk&quot; (ugly) in Dutch becomes &quot;lelik&quot; in Afrikaans. In both languages, this suffix is pronounced [lək], with a schwa.<br />
Afrikaans uses ⟨k⟩ for the Dutch hard ⟨c⟩, both pronounced [k]. Compare Dutch &quot;cultuur&quot; (culture) with Afrikaans &quot;kultuur&quot;. Before the 1990s major spelling reform, the latter spelling was also accepted in Dutch.<br />
Afrikaans merged Dutch trigraphs ⟨tie⟩ and ⟨cie⟩ to a single spelling ⟨sie⟩. Apart from ⟨tie⟩, which is pronounced [tsi] in the Netherlands, there is no difference in pronunciation. Compare Dutch words &quot;provincie&quot; (province) and &quot;politie&quot; (police) with &quot;provinsie&quot; and &quot;polisie&quot; in Afrikaans.<br />
The Dutch cluster ⟨tion⟩ became ⟨sion⟩ in Afrikaans. Compare &quot;nationaal&quot; (national) with &quot;nasionaal&quot;. In Dutch, the pronunciation differs from region to region and include [tsiɔn], [siɔn], and [ʃon].<br />
Afrikaans merged Dutch digraphs and trigraphs ⟨ou⟩, ⟨ouw⟩, ⟨au⟩, and ⟨auw⟩—pronounced identically by many Dutch speakers—to a single spelling ⟨ou⟩. Compare Dutch &quot;vrouw&quot; (woman) and &quot;dauw&quot; (dew) with Afrikaans &quot;vrou&quot; and &quot;dou&quot; respectively.<br />
At the end of words, Afrikaans often dropped the ⟨n⟩ in the Dutch cluster ⟨en⟩ (pronounced as a schwa, [ə]), mainly present in single nouns and plurals, to become ⟨e⟩ Compare Dutch &quot;leven&quot; (life) and &quot;mensen&quot; (people) to Afrikaans &quot;lewe&quot; and &quot;mense&quot;. Also in Dutch, final -n is often deleted after a shwa, but the occurrence and frequency of this phenomenon varies between speakers, and it is not recognised in spelling.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, Afrikaans and Dutch are actually very closely related, and there is a high degree of mutual intelligiblity -- so much, in fact, that before WW2 Afrikaans was officially classified as a dialect of Dutch. Dutch speakers find Afrikaans relatively easy to understand; Afrikaans speakers have a little more trouble with Dutch because since the languages separated, Dutch has imported or invented a lot of new words that Afrikaans didn't. One South African writer reckoned that the differences between Afrikaans and Dutch are about the same as the differences between Received Pronunciation -- the &quot;posh&quot; British dialect you might hear on the BBC -- and the English spoken in the American Deep South.</p>
<p>One of the main reasons Afrikaans is quite as distinctive as it is is that it was influenced by other languages that the Dutch spoken in Europe didn't come into contact with: Malay, Portuguese, South African English and some Bantu languages. This mostly affected the grammar, though -- Afrikaans didn't import many words from these languages.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Afrikaans has a French influence in it too, thanks to the many Huguenots who migrated there to escape persecution in France. They're the reason South Africa has a wine industry, and many Afrikaans names have French origins, e.g. Du Toit, Joubert, and Theron (as in Charlize). Afrikaans has a &quot;double negative&quot; e.g. &quot;ek kan <em>nie</em> meer Afrikaans praat <em>nie</em>&quot; (lit. I can no more Afrikaans speak not), something found in French but not in Dutch. I've heard that there are also influences from the Flemish of the time (17th-18th centuries), though I can't attest to that. </p>
<p>edit: after a bit more reading, I can't quite credit the French for the <em>whole</em> of the South African wine industry: a better way of putting it is that the Huguenots weren't the first to try, but they were the ones who got it right, by being a bit more scientific with e.g. cultivars and vineyard locations. I pity the oenophile who hasn't enjoyed a good Pinotage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would be interested in similar comparisons of linguistic distance among other origin nations and colonial outposts from that era - French v. Quebecois, Amish German v. German from whatever parts of Germany they came from, Spanish v. Mexican, Brazilian v. Portuguese. Among all of those examples, I don't think any are thought of as distinct languages (not sure about Pennsylvania German, which as a tiny, isolated population would be anomalous anyway). </p>
<p>I'm thinking this has as much to do with South African identity politics as with linguistics. Afrikaners were forcibly cut off from their Dutch brethren by British imperial authority, they went through traumatic historical unifying events (Voortrek) and they spent most of the last 100 years trying vigorously to assert a nationalist identity that most of the world found illegitimate. Maybe claiming Afrikaans as a distinct language is really rooted in their need to see themselves as a distinct people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
