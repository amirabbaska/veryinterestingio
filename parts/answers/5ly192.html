		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The distance between two protons will never be exactly zero. The strong force is very attractive at some distances, but becomes repulsive at very small distances. This alone keeps the distance between nucleons above some minimum level.</p>
<p>In addition, neutrons are present in almost all nuclei that act as a buffer between the protons. Neutrons and protons are attracted to eachother through the strong force, but there is no Coulomb repulsion between them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, when you get infinities in your results when you're doing physics, it mean that you are widely outside the realm where the model you're using is valid. </p>
<p>In this case you're both assuming that the protons are punctual and somehow that the distance between them is zero. That being said, the strong force is, well, frigging strong yes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Coulomb force is a low energy approximation to the electromagnetic force which is a low energy approximation to the electromagnetic interaction which is a low energy approximation to the electroweak interaction which is a low energy approximation to a theory we haven't figured out yet. </p>
<p>Coulomb -&gt; EM force -&gt; EM interaction -&gt; electroweak interaction -&gt; String Theory?</p>
<p>As the velocities, energies and 1/size of the system being analyzed increases you have to move up this scale. The Coulomb force alone is too simple when you start looking at the electron orbitals of an atom, you need to account for magnetic effects. As you reach the nucleus, the combined electromagnetic force is too simple and you need to account for individual effects such as photon emission, pair production, weak decay (radioactivity). As you start accounting for proton vs proton, you need to look at the nuclear force which is roughly modeled as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukawa_interaction" target="_blank">Yukawa interaction</a> between nucleons. As you look inside nucleons, you need to look at the theory of quantum chromodynamics between quarks and gluons.</p>
<p>To demonstrate why the theories fail, think of the Coulomb force of a pair of parallel plates. The force from the E field is constant between the two plates. Clearly, as you get extremely close to one plate, you start feeling the Coulomb force of individual electrons. At that point, the proximity to those electrons will become a strong effect than the combined E field of the rest of them. The &quot;Parallel Plate Force&quot; is just a low energy theory explaining the Coulomb force. When you get to small distances you need to account for more detail. </p>
<p>In the case of the EM interaction, the Coulomb force is described as the combined force of 10^(big number) photons bouncing back and forth. At a large scale, this seems to be 1/r^2 constant force. At close scale, it's important to account for the individual interactions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Coulomb force is classical, not quantum. In the same way Newtonian physics is inaccurate at velocities over 0.1c, the Coulomb force doesn't accurately predict the energy of a nucleus. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_electron_radius" target="_blank">Classical electron radius</a> is an example of this failure.</p>
<p>So it doesn't go to infinity, but it still exists. The residual strong force between neutrons and protons (caused by one emitting a meson and the other absorbing it) holds them together.</p>
<p>Since mesons decay pretty quickly, so the residual strong force has a short range.</p>
<p>The strong interaction is also known as the color force and is responsible for holding quarks together to make up protons, neutrons, mesons, and other hadrons. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
