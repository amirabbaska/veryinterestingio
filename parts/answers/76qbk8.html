		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes they don't.</p>
<p>There are things called line breeding in which breeders intentionally breed related animals (such as ones with the same grandparent).  </p>
<p>People will also sometimes breed daughters to their fathers..  one mating of such a combination usually isn't a problem but if that offspring was then bred to a close relative that is when problems might show up.</p>
<p>You didn't really say what kind of animal you were thinking about.. cats.. dogs.. horses.. cattle.. chickens..</p>
<p>It's quite different for dogs as it would be for horses because people might only own one pair of dogs at a time but with horses they might own 30 mares (females) and 2 stallions (males).. with cattle they might own 300 cows and 0 bulls (they can get frozen semen) so could pick different bulls each year.</p>
<p>Additionally most breeders don't keep the offspring - they sell them - and might on occasion keep 1 or 2 animals that they produced but then would breed to a different animal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. You can network with other breeders and have one of their animals impregnate yours (for a fee, of course). Or sperm can be obtained from other breeders and artificially inseminated. </p>
<p>Most breeders, especially very serious ones, will still have several breeding pairs, but there are also options without owning every individual animal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantitative geneticist here.</p>
<p>When breeding animals, a breeder has some goals. It could be increased milk yield, decreased lethality, better yoghurt making properties, <em>less inbreeding</em>, better meat, and so on. It depends on the field, the economic market, and what the breeder believes will provide best profit. Sometimes, it is combinations of several factors, a so called selection index.</p>
<p>When selecting who to breed, the breeder calculates breeding values of the selection candidates. These are based on the selection candidates' own performance, their parents and families, or even entire national evaluations. </p>
<p>The breeder uses breeding values to select which animals to breed. This requires experience to decide <em>how many</em> to use to avoid to much inbreeding. If this is ignored in favour of an too high <em>selection intensity</em>, inbreeding does happen.</p>
<p>Recently with genomic selection, we have obtained a new tool: optimal contribution selection. With this, we calculate how much inbreeding we get from a specific mating, and then balance that against the gain in performance. We can either go with focus on gain in performance, and end with an inbred herd, or focus entirely on maintaining a healthy diversity. The latter is usually the case with zoo animals, endangered species, and maintained populations. For production animals, we have enough animals globally to allow some decrease in inbreeding within the herds in return for improved production.</p>
<p>And yes, breeders do often buy &quot;new breeding&quot; pairs, often in form of artificial insemination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rat breeders, for example, have to work hard to ensure animals with known issues don't pass them on. </p>
<p>Sometimes that means buying another rat from a rattery, borrowing a male rat, or purchasing a lab quality rat from a lab. Lab rats are the nuclear option, but they are bred to have no issues at all, except issues with temperament. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large scale breeders usually do keep several mating pairs, but a great deal of animal breeders network to bring their animals together.</p>
<p>I once lived with a woman who made a living from breeding German Shepherds, but she only kept one or two male dogs at a time. Her work was interesting, but the short version is that she would advertise her dogs and their lineage and accolades online, and basically pimp them out in a wide location radius. Owners of female Shepherds could contact her to &quot;buy&quot; their female dogs a night with one of my friend's males. She would drive all over Western Europe to get her boys to their temporary girlfriends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
