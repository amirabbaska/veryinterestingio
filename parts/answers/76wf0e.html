		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got this. One I think you are mistaken it is actually a crisping sleeve. The ones that are different are between the croissant crust and the deli crust or what ever other crust there is. The croissant crust is taller (because croissants rise differently) so requires a different size crisping sleeve. </p>
<p>Source- I may or may not have worked on this business. </p>
<p>Edit- fixed typo </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you mean cooking sleeve, not cooling sleeve. Microwave ovens cook by causing the water in food to vibrate rapidly, warming it up. Different items require the microwaves to reflect in, while others do not need the same reflective material to cook properly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't know anyone even used the sleeves to eat the hot pocket. Just bite off a top corner and a little bite near the bottom and blow in it to cool it down. </p>
<p>I'm assuming each hot pocket has its own automated 'assembly' line including packaging. No use reprogramming or modifying one of their pizza packing machines until it breaks down or is due for servicing. </p>
<p>LPT: Do not bite two holes in the top and blow to cool the hotpocket, unless you enjoy the sensation of your face melting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
