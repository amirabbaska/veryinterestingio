		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dust or scratches in the glass provide what are referred to as nucleation sites where bubbles of dissolved gas can precipitate out of solution. It's hard for dissolved gases to escape a liquid without a nucleation site that allows bubbles to form. This is why boiling chips are used in a chemistry lab, to prevent liquids from becoming superheated and prone to explosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The carbon dioxide prefers a nucleation point to form , usually a surface unevenness or a particle. If the rest of the glass is very clean and smooth, the few points where there is a nucleation point would give off an almost continuous stream of bubbles</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everybody has pretty much covered this topic, but the lack of a nucleation site can also cause some bad effects during heating. If you put water in very new glassware and heat it in the microwave, the water can superheat to temperatures far above the boiling point. However, when you take it out of the microwave and finally cause enough turbulence to nucleate a bubble, it will all rapidly boil, which has led to some serious burns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other have already mentioned there is a small defect which acts as a nucleation site. There are some additional thing to say though:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Glass can be crafted so well nowadays that these nucleation sites have to be specifically built in, otherwise your carbonated drink wont be able to form these beautiful bubble chains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without a nucleation site you can supercool a liquid. For example you can cool water in a bottle to -10Â° C and it will remain liquid. Shake the bottle or pour the water out and it will instantly form ice.</p>
</li>
<li>Sometimes planes are equipped with what is basically a nucleation site production. The pilot then flys in a cloud, causing it to rain. This practise is called cloud seeding. The US used it to increase the length of the monsun period in Vietnam and today it is sometimes done to prevent hail damage. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Champagne is a supersaturated solution of co2, not in thermodynamic equilibrium, and requires defects on the glass surface to provide symmetry breaking for nucleation. On a microscopic level, the defect causes locally enhanced electromagnetic field strength which preferentially causes the co2 molecules to accumulate</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
