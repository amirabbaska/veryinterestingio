<p>The reason one does not feel pain while they sleep is because when you sleep, “most neurons in the brain stem immediately above the spinal cord, reduce or stop firing.” The brain stem is composed of the medulla oblongata, pons, and midbrain. The brain stem is in a way, a highway where the motor and sensory system passes through to the brain. Therefore, while awake, the nociceptors, which is a type of sensory neuron which is active when there is tissue damage, and is what causes the pain sensation, is traveling from the point of damage through the brain stem to the brain. So, while asleep, there is no brain stem connection to the brain from the sensory neurons, ergo no pain perception. You can think of it as connecting Christmas lights. When you connect one series of lights to a second series of lights, it will allow electricity to flow through both sets. If you disconnect the second series of lights, then the flow of electricity will only flow though the first series of lights. As opposed to 1998 when the undertaker slammed mankind through the hell in the cell on a 16 foot drop.

<p>Edit: this also explains why they knock you out for certain surgerys</p>
<p>Edit: TFTG.  Also, side note of fun.  You guys remember the trick of putting a sleeping persons hand in warm water and it makes them piss themselves?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that I do not think has been mentioned and is based on science and not conjecture or anecdote is the fact that the brain releases the equivalent of a paralytic when humans sleep, particularly during REM sleep. It was initially thought to be caused by the neurotransmitter glycine, but is now thought to be two types of GABA (also neurotransmitters). Basically, they effect the muscles, preventing movement during sleep. This is probably a large part of the answer you are seeking.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why should we?</p>
<p>Sleep is important, maintaining that bit of extra awareness of our comfort is taxing.  Consider obstructive sleep apnaea.  This is essentially your body occasionally just waking up just enough to move slightly and correct your neck's position so you can breathe clearly.  </p>
<p>But it's a serious sleep disorder that can cause all sorts of performances issues during the day.  And it's all caused by being minorly woken up due to a condition that would otherwise cause you to suffocate. </p>
<p>Now, with being unable to breathe, yes, we do wake up, readjust and don't die in our sleep.  But it has a huge toll, and a pretty obvious trigger.  Are we becoming hypoxic? Ok, then trigger something to rouse us a bit and gasp for breath.</p>
<p>If our body were to do that every time we got uncomfortable, first of all, it's much harder to define discomfort, especially stiffness that isn't obvious until you actually get out of bed.  Secondly, it would ruin our sleep quality almost every night. </p>
<p>So we fall asleep in a position that is comfortable when we fall asleep, and unless we have some other sleep issue, we don't move around too much when we sleep.  We wake up with minor aches maybe if we were in a weird position, but we walk it off.  </p>
<p>The alternative is to wake up constantly in the night and never sleep properly.  As someone who suffers from sleep quality issues, I would always take a better night's sleep over a few aches in the morning every time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many positions can be comfortable for your body for a short period of time, but after a few minutes can cut off circulation or strain a muscle or tendon that causes numbness or pain. Your body moves into one of these awkward positions because it feels great at the time, and it's not until you regain some level of consciousness that your body will adjust.</p>
<p>Your brain is in sleep mode and is not thinking through &quot;what is the most comfortable position I can sleep in that won't cause me pain when I wake up.&quot; Your body is just finding a position that feels good right now, and does it for you to deal with the consequences later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
