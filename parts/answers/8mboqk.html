		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Graphics is just calculations, and better hardware can do more of them per second, allowing more lighting, shadows, complex models, and higher res textures to be rendered within a shorter time, leading to a higher frame rate. <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/8at78n/eli5_why_does_rendering_take_so_long/" target="_blank">I give a pretty lengthy explanation of some of these calculations in my answer here.</a> There are also improvements in memory access with newer hardware, which can reduce stuttering and freezing when moving from one area of a game to another as the hardware can more quickly load the data needed to render the new area.</p>
<p>Look at how good today's games look with skyboxes, mirrors, refraction, reflection, shadows, thousands of polygons, and high resolution. We could do all of that years ago, but it would take days for hardware of a similar price to your console to render the scenes that it takes your console a fraction of a second to render. We've always been able to do the calculations needed to render these scenes, they can just be done more quickly now, to the point where they can be rendered in real time, 30+ times per second.</p>
<p>The most important improvement to note is the increase in calculations per second per dollar. We've always been able to do the calculations, it's just gotten cheaper to do them more quickly as hardware design and manufacturing improves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people cited the hardware being incredibly more powerful, and that's true, but the software is also much more mature.</p>
<p>The industry grew. Initially you had to write your videogame from scratch, in terrible hardware specific language. Nowadays, you can rent/buy a game engine and get triple A graphics out of the box. You would still need to design the assets... but really soon, software will take care of that too! Seeing how fast Nvidia is making progress on that front, in two years you get automatically generated animated 3d models and environments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One big part is that the manufacturing technology for integrated circuit get more and more advanced. Each transistor get smaller and faster so you can have more on a chip with the same size at the same cost. The result is higher and higher performance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other answers here, I would argue that better algorithms have had the most profound effect. Every so often, someone comes up with a new way to calculate lighting or physics or what have you that is as good, or better, at fooling humans than the current algorithms. Consider these algorithms, which run on the same hardware, but at significantly faster speeds.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things. 3D GPUs with polygon graphics being the main one of them. But even with that, an NES could easily render a very complex scene from a modern 3D game. But it would probably take hours to render a single frame. The main thing that has been advancing is clock speed: the NES had a 1 MHz CPU, while some modern CPUs have above 4 GHz. Basically, a Hz is an operation per second, except many CPUs take multiple cycles to execute some operations. That isn't all - CPU technology has advanced a lot, adding things like parallel execution, which is executing multiple unrelated operations at the same time, and pipelining, which is dividing operations in stages and executing multiple operations in different stages at the same time to further lower execution times, out-of-order execution being executing other unrelated operations while the current one is waiting for something, etc. Basically, since the 80s CPUs have gotten not just about 4000x faster, but are also able of doing a ton of things at the same time, which makes it an even larger difference.</p>
<p>And we aren't quite done yet. True life-like rendering is a form of rendering that even today's hardware would take a lot of time to do. It's called raytracing; tracing light rays from the observer until they hit lights. It's the opposite of real-life rendering, which is because tracing from lights to the eye is even harder. Today's 3D graphics are a sort of fake graphics where each triangle is drawn on the screen then each pixel is processed to approximate proper lighting, shadowing and things like that. But it's just an approximation, and a rough one at that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
