		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The premise that the black hole is holding together the galaxy is wrong. </p>
<p>Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole thought to be at the center of the Milky Way, is estimated to be the mass of about 4 million suns. </p>
<p>To put that in context, the milky way is estimated to have between 100-400 billion stars with a mass of about 12 trillion suns.  This makes Sagittarius A* less than .0001% the mass of our galaxy. So no, it does not affect us. </p>
<p>Having said that, there are a few stars that orbit Sagittarius, and quite fast. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7xl_zjz0o8" target="_blank">link</a></p>
<hr />
<p>What does affect us, though?
<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Galaxy_rotation_under_the_influence_of_dark_matter.ogv" target="_blank">here's an interesting thing to look at</a></p>
<p>The image on the left shows how the galaxy should be moving, predicted by the mass distributions and densities we observe from all sources of light. The image on the right shows how it is actually observed to be moving. </p>
<p>This is exactly why dark matter is hypothesized to exist. The image on the right is only possible if there exists an enormous amount of mass greater than that of the galaxy and outside of it. Just a quick search shows an artists rendition of it, but the scale is roughly accurate: <a href="http://www.physast.uga.edu/~rls/1020/ch22/22-01.jpg" target="_blank">dark matter halos!</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the newtonian approximation any spherically symmetric distribution of mass can be represented as a point mass in the centre without changing the gravitational field outside the original sphere. This is why you can calculate the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the Earth (or any other planet), just by knowing its mass and radius.</p>
<p>This works in the other direction as well. The gravitational field of a million sun mass black hole and the same mass globular cluster are identical, outside the cluster.</p>
<p>So from our point of view the supermassive black hole is just extra mass. It could just as well be in stars, interstellar gas or dark matter. If it was in the same distance and direction just more spread out, it would have the same effect. Since it represents only a tiny fraction of the mass of the galaxy that effect is quite small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a question then:</p>
<p>If dark matter has gravity, and gravity is responsible for the formation of celestial bodies as things are attracted to one another, why is dark matter theorized as a halo?  Wouldn't it cling to, or form its own bodies, even if it's invisible?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>something to consider. black holes are not gravity monsters or anything. mass is still mass.</p>
<p>for example. if you converted our sun into a black hole it would still have precisely the same mass it has now.</p>
<p>all the planets including earth would continue to orbit around the black hole as if it were the sun. no change at all (except that everything would be really cold since black holes don't make heat like stars do)</p>
<p>but gravitationally speaking you could not tell the difference between the sun and a black hole in place of the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If heat from electric circuits caused the Pioneer 1 &amp;2 to slow down a measurable amount due to Newtons third law, then I'd say it at least has a small impact on us. I'm sure it can be approximated by F = Gm1m2/r2. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
