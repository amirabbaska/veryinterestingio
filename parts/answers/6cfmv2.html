<p>Sympathetic -
Relaxes the bronchi (your throats relaxes helping you breathe)
Enzymes in the stomach are stopped (your body pauses your stomach to focus on more important stuff)
Stimulated glucose and adrenaline flood your system </p>
<p>Then comes the stomach drop part.. which happens due to your sympathetic nerve system-</p>
<p>Peristalsis is a symmetrical contraction and relaxation of muscles that propagates in a wave down a tube</p>
<p>In much of a digestive tract, smooth muscle tissue contracts in sequence to produce a peristaltic wave, which propels a ball of food  along the tract. </p>
<p>Peristaltic movement comprises relaxation of circular smooth muscles, then their contraction behind the chewed material to keep it from moving backward, then longitudinal contraction to push it forward.</p>
<p>Your body has turned off the contraction and due to the attention being elsewhere your stomach simply relaxes. Hence it feels like it &quot;drops&quot;</p>
<p>Tldr: stomach usually acts in waves -triggered- stomach only relaxes and doesn't contract again.
