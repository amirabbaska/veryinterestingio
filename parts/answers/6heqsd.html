		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Americans are identified by credit institutions with their social security number. A social security number, therefore, can open a lot of doors in the US. This number is issued at birth, is very hard (or impossible) to change, and is used on every credit application (apart from maybe some payday lenders who lend on title collateral). It is both a unique number, widely used, and stored on many different systems with varying levels of security.</p>
<p>In the UK (for example) there is no centrally identifying single number or document that is used to establish identity (well, there is the National Insurance number but that is not used on credit applications). Identity is established by means of history. This history, usually address history, is matched with electoral registers, previous business with that company, and other factors, to establish a trust profile. If you can match your addresses with your electoral register registration for the last three years, it is a good indicator that you are who you say you are. In establishing this identity, the identity theft fraudster has to know a lot more about the person they wish to defraud (more than a number, anyway).</p>
<p>Another oddity of the UK is that it is not required to have identification. A person can, and many do, in fact, live their lives without ever holding a passport of a driving license and have no way to identify themselves.</p>
<p>Edit: Apparently SSN is not unique. Maybe unique enough to generally work?
Edit 2: SSN is not automatically issued, it is issued on application.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically most countries when you are born/turn 18 get some sort of national ID with picture and 1/2 unique codes. That ID will need to be re-issued every x number of years.<br />
For any important transaction like loans/bank stuff  or education stuff like enrolling in highschool/universities you again need that ID. Sometimes they will even ask for copies from parents ID since their name will appear on your ID.</p>
<p>In America they don't have any national ID. They have a social security number but it's basically a piece of paper with just a number written on it and a name you get at birth, hell it even says on it&quot;Not for identification purposes&quot;. No picture or parents name to cross reference the number .<br />
So if you know some basic information from a person like name/social security number/address/bills to prove that address(which you can take out of the garbage for example) a bank will allow any person to open an account under that name and rak on bills.  </p>
<p>For one of the most advanced countries on earth they have the shitiest social security protection in the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are still running on the <em>benefit</em> system of identification. Social Security was supposed to be only used for tracking your employment history throughout your life in order to receive Federal retirement benefits. It works extremely well when used for this purpose. Then bankers decided to piggyback on this system as a means to track down potential debt defaulters. Since it can generally produce an address, they have a way to contact. Then everyone jumped on this same system to the point where social security is now more related to your personal  financial record than your history of paying into a retirement fund. Due to the lack of protections, as others have mentioned, and the electronic economy where you do not have to produce facial identification, it is extremely easy to take over someone's identity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are mentioning Social Security Number a lot but more importantly is &quot;Public Information&quot;.  Your Birth Certificate, All past addresses, Phone Numbers, Car Registrations, Marriage and Divorce, Mortgage, Land rights, voter registration information, criminal (of course), &quot;owed money&quot; and a lot more of information you don't even realize is stored in government databases and is by law &quot;Public Information&quot; and can be accessed by government websites. Google, FaceBook, Data Brokers and &quot;Background Check&quot; sites like Spokeo, Ancestry, Whitepages, etc. build robots (and pay very cheap labor to &quot;data input) that scrape all this public information and put it in their database. Have you searched your name recently? Your information could be on literally thousands of these &quot;Background Check&quot; sites. All these sites collect and relate you information then make an &quot;account&quot; about you.  They sell the information and or place ads along side your information.  Note that these sites can be run by Chinese, Russians or whoever.  Americans have Zero Rights on their own personal information and it's one of the biggest scams on the internet that people have no clue about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short: You don't have a proper ID system because of many reasons (mainly because of political controversies). The system should be designed with anti-theft functions but you used social security number for that matter which is a bad choice but is also the only choice. </p>
<p>CGP Grey had a very detailed explanation on social security card and it's origin. It explained why it's easy to carry out ID theft in US. <a href="https://youtu.be/Erp8IAUouus" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Erp8IAUouus</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
