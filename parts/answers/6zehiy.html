		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In presence of gravity the space dimension is stretched. Similar is the case with time (because they are directly correlated even though they are still their own individual dimensions), time also gets stretched (more accurately, curved) in presence of gravity. In other words, time runs slower in presence of gravity. The more gravity you have, the slower time passes.  (Also like others have stated, like many things in science we know the how, but we don't know the why. We don't even know <em>what gravity is</em>, so let that sink in. I mean gravity is effect mass has on space time, but I'm not an astrophysicist so I'm not sure if there's more to it than that.)</p>
<p>Now here's a bit more in depth example that a 5 year old may be able to understand:</p>
<p>Time as anything different than dimensional is a kind of illusion, as it is relative to where the observer is in the universe in respect to objects with mass. If I'm on earth, I'm perceiving time as being normal. If there is a second earth somewhere far away with let's say, a black hole close to it, the person on that earth will perceive time just the same as the person on earth one perceives it. But in actuality, earth number two has that large gravitational mass of a black hole close enough to it that the gravity of the black hole is affecting earth two by the bending of space time that happens with large amounts of mass that results in gravity. Since space and time are one and the same, the bending of this space via gravity is also bending time. The more bent spacetime is, the slower time goes relative to the observer. So earth two is going way slower in time relative to the viewer on earth one. Two hours could go by on earth two which could amount to ten years on earth one. Neither earth will feel a difference as each observer feels time going at a constant speed, but if each observer visits each other's planets, they will see how much time has differentiated from the beginning of the test. This doesn't mean that if we find a planet where time moves slower that we can live longer, as humans there will still have their normal age limit, it just means that relative to the other earth that has different levels of gravity acting on it time dilates drastically from each observers relative point in the universe.</p>
<p>Also, for your second part, it is impossible to know what existed before the Big Bang, and so scientists leave it at that. Most scientists go with the fact that time and space started at the Big Bang and there was nothing before that, because there is simply no way of knowing what was before. (Unless we get into theoretical physics of there being multiple universes that this one stemmed out of, but that's all purely philosophical at this point.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The speed of light in a vacuum is a constant no matter what frame of referance you use. This is the reason time slows down when you start going close to the speed of light. Its complicated math but simply if you are going 1/2 the speed of light and shine a torch forward you see that photon shoot off forward at the speed of light, but for somone stationary they too see it travel at the speed of light not speed of light + the 1/2 speed of light your traveling at.</p>
<p>Now when light moves through space it is affected by gravity the same as everything else. If you had an infinity flat &quot;Earth&quot; and shot a photon horizontally it would fall at 9.81m/s^2 and hit the ground</p>
<p>This is where the explination gets tricky as you have to try and visualize space time as dimensional. Which is hard. But if you have seen these images of a flat &quot;space-time&quot; grid with a planet plonked on there bending the space-time grid down and distorting it with its gravity.</p>
<p>Now a photon travels allong the lines of this grid. Without the planet there it takes 1year to travel 1 light year easy.</p>
<p>But when the grid bends the photon as above follows this bent space-time grid. But the distance is longer due to the planets gravity.</p>
<p><a href="https://qph.ec.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-d6269a3e09aa1583a89cb28280c6e8f0" target="_blank">This is what im trying to describe</a></p>
<p>An observer in the gravity of the planet the photon will still take 1 year to travel the 1 light year, but to the outside observer due to the curve and the fact light in a vacuum always travels at the same speed, it will take longer. This means light and therefore time must have been slowed by gravity.</p>
<p>In reality its not actually curved but thats the issue with trying to visualize time as a dimensional thing its hard to describe without a wall of math!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully, this is a pretty good answer:</p>
<p>Time as we understand it - a smooth flow of &quot;before&quot; events into &quot;after&quot; events doesn't actually exist. There's no one &quot;time&quot; that flows at a constant rate forward.</p>
<p>INSTEAD time as we understand it is just the progression of interactions - which sounds like the same thing, but strangely enough, is different. Unlike things like Temperature and Mass, which don't change too much, time changes a lot.</p>
<p>The passage of time, as we understand it, is limited by a variable called <em>c.</em> Usually this is called the speed of light, but that's not totally accurate. What <em>c</em> really is, is the speed of CAUSALITY - the rate at which any event or object is capable of causing any other event. <em>c</em> is the speed at which the universe can talk to itself. Anything that has no mass - like light in a vacuum - will always travel at <em>c</em> but nothing else can do this.</p>
<p>Now, mass has the property of stretching space out, like a bowling ball being dropped in the middle of a stretched out blanket, being held at its four corners. The result of this is that it takes more &quot;time&quot; comparatively to get from point a to point b - even for things travelling at the rate of <em>c.</em></p>
<p>The result is that the rate of change is slower in higher mass systems. A photon in a system with a total mass of 2 travels &quot;slower&quot; than a photon in a system with a mass of 1 - 1 and 2 being arbitrary weights here.</p>
<p>But because the rate of our observation from any perspective is based on the rate of our own brain's processing, which slows down or speeds up based on our surroundings, the rate of change in OUR surroundings will always seem the same - it will always appear that it's the rest of the universe, and not us, that is speeding up or slowing down.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So Einstein asked the question - what does a photon look like if you are also travelling at light speed beside it? If you travel beside a car going 60 miles per hour at the same speed, the car will appear to be at rest. If you travel 60 and another car is in the oncoming direction travelling 60, you can also say that your car appears to be at rest while the other car approaches at 120. This is relativity of velocity.</p>
<p>With light it's different. You can travel half light speed and set off beside a photon, but the photon will still accelerate at light-speed away from you, not half.  Even if you travel 99.9999% of light speed, it will always accelerate away from you at 100% light speed, unlike other relative motion. The effects of time dilation are more apparent the closer to light speed a body reaches. Technically walking in your house gives you a very miniscule effect, but it's pretty much unmeasurable. The astronauts with the most time spent in orbit will be something like 7 seconds &quot;younger&quot; than they would have been if they stayed on Earth. </p>
<p>Now, your question was about gravity. Einstein also figured out that a gravitational force exerted on a body is indistinguishable from a body travelling with the same force. You always hear that Earth's gravitational force is -9.8m/s^2, meaning all things on Earth's surface are being pushed down onto the ground at that rate of acceleration. Someone travelling 9.8m/s^2 has the same effect as standing on Earth's surface.</p>
<p>When you talk about black holes, huge planets and stars, their gravitational effect is also huge, which can make time dialation apparent. While the movie Interstellar took some liberties with certain things, it got that part correct; if you were near a supermassive blackhole with huge gravity, you <em>would</em> experience time dialation due to the forces acting on you mimicking what we think of as &quot;ordinary&quot; acceleration. i.e. moving from point A to point B in space and not just orbiting a massive body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>that's the core of Einsteins work and the reason he is so important.</p>
<p>Space/Matter and time are linked.</p>
<p>as to the &quot;why&quot;, no one can answer that, all physics can answer you there is &quot;how&quot;. Why our universe is the way it is and not another way is a question for philosophy or religion.</p>
<p>I highly recommend using the search function, as this question is asked on average every other week here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
