<p>Let's say you try and reverse engineer an iPhone. </p>
<p>You need to know what each component is made of, this is NOT easy at all and requires some fairly high level analytical skills. </p>
<p>You also need to know how each component talks to each other. An iPhone isn't just the solid stuff, and then OS installed; there is firmware that controls how say the capacitance from the screen is delivered to other bits of circuitry. There is software that controls the battery.</p>
<p>Another example would be say a grain mill! You could build something that looks the same easily; a stone with an axel and then another stone on a pivot that can roll along in a circle. But if you don't know how to use it (the software) it's useless. </p>
<p>With modern stuff the material becomes a big factor!! Touch screens are made of very special materials for one. Military hardware? Can also be very exotic composites, it's not just steel etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Manufacturing engineer, here. </p>
<p>It depends a lot on the complexity of the object and if there are critical parameters or tolerances.</p>
<p>Reverse-engineering a simple table with square legs is easy. Now think of a nice table with a pattern lathe-turned into the legs and a stain. It may be difficult to determine the wood under the stain and the stain color. It will also take much longer to figure out the lathe tooling setup to replicate the legs. If the replica isn't exact, it could still be a nice table. </p>
<p>When you consider mechanical and electronic items,  the process is more difficult for a number of reasons. Electronic components are exponentially more complicated. If you can identify all the pieces, you still have to arrange them precisely. Imagine trying to copy a complete road map of Texas with a pencil and protractor - no tracing. If you manage to build the thing correctly, you still need to develop firmware and software so that it runs as closely as possible to what you are trying to reverse-engineer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is using House as an example, but what about a cake?</p>
<p>You can analyze a cake and determine it's made of starch and sugars, but could you really reverse-engineer that to come up with a list of raw ingredients AND a recipe to recreate the cake?</p>
<p>Even if I gave you the exact list of ingredients, but no directions for mixing them (quantity and order) or baking it, what good would that do you?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is talking about the manufacture of something, and they are explaining why copying things isn't easy...but that isn't reverse engineering.  That's just trying to duplicate something.  Copying stuff is easy.  </p>
<p>If you look at a piece of electronic equipment, a good chunk of the chips and processors are off the shelf.  You can go and buy them and slap them all together and there you go.  But that isn't reverse engineering, that's just assembling something.</p>
<p>If company x builds a cool thing, and company y can't figure out how they did it on their own, company y then needs to buy the thing from company x and do a complete analysis of it.  Reverse engineering isn't about copying something.  So company y brings in the engineers to look at every single component and wire, and then write up the full specs based on what they see in the hardware.  Going back to everyone's house analogy, it's basically looking at a house and then drawing up blueprints.  It's not nearly as complicated as figuring out how to manufacture steel, but it isn't easy.  It's time consuming and tedious.</p>
<p>This is what reverse engineering is.  Looking at a product, and then figuring out exact specifications for it.</p>
<p>After you get your full list of specifications, you hand that off to another completely clean and brand new team to actually design something based on those specifications created from the original product from company x.</p>
<p>Now company y has a product similar to company x, but they have plausible deniability that they copied anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a real life example is that you can take a look at a house. it has some walls, roof, windows. pretty simple easy to understand concepts. now you are in charge of building your own house, and you know what a house is made up of.</p>
<p>now, how do you make a rebar? what is rebar made out of? steel? great! how do we create steel?</p>
<p>it's easy to copy simple things with simple materials, but it's extremely difficult to copy advanced things manufactured with complicated manufacturing processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
