		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with embryology (how the embryo develops into a human).
An embryo starts out as a flat disc with 3 layers of cells and then &quot;folds&quot; in on itself (imagine wrapping a burrito).</p>
<p>The innermost layer forms a tube, which will develop into the internal organs, and the outermost layer forms your skeleton, bones and connective tissues (pretty much everything that isn't your organs)</p>
<p>The outer layer develops symmetrically about the midline. 2 eyes, 2 ears, 2 arms, 2 legs. Interestingly, your brain is also symmetrical about the midline (although the right and left brain do have different functions)</p>
<p>As the inner layer of cells (the tube) it becomes squashed against the walls of the body cavity. This causes the tube to twist and bend as it develops. Eventually different parts of the tube differentiate into different organs. The lungs, liver kidneys and spleen branch off the midline. The gut does a whole bunch of Gymnastics. Interestingly the &quot;start&quot; and &quot;end&quot; of this tube (the mouth and anus) ARE symmetrical.</p>
<p>The heart is a good example of this. It starts out as a symmetrical tube, but bends and folds as it develops, ending up in the 4 chambered configuration of a mature heart.</p>
<p>The reason the outermost layers are bot symmetrical is partly because they are not space restricted like the internal organs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated, speaking as a physician for the last 45 years and a field biologist for 55.</p>
<p>Essentially body structure is that based upon our worm ancestors, which are ancestral to most all animals, but a few primitive ones. This structure is repeating segments of structures starting with the head and then spreading downwards. We have spinal bones and nerve roots coming off each, just like worms, fish, amphibs, reptiles etc. Repeating segments is a VERY efficient way of building up a body, and this least energy rule is deeply imbedded in our embryology as well. Even the gill slits our embryos have are repeating units. Cells are repeating units ultimately, but are greatly differentiated.</p>
<p>This dfferentiation is the basis of embryology and how our bodies develop. Even our ribs are segmented. The sensory nerves and blood vessels and muscles are all segmented, too, just stretched out.</p>
<p>Why and how? It's a least energy series of configurations, largely. so, we're highly efficient in the way we are organized. Evolution is least energy driven, largely, which is the basis of why animals look like they do. Efficiency creates stability and longevity as well.</p>
<p>So, that's largely why each creature and plant look like what they do, a series of least energy solutions to environmental stressors and conditions. Very complex, but with LE we can easily navigate thru the complexities of most all of it, tho there is STILL a very great deal to learn.</p>
<p>Least Energy Rules.  SOA biology, very likely. Others are still trying to catch up.</p>
<p><a href="https://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2015/09/01/evolution-growth-development-a-deeper-understanding/" target="_blank">https://jochesh00.wordpress.com/2015/09/01/evolution-growth-development-a-deeper-understanding/</a></p>
<p>Hierarchical systems are found also throughout our bodies, as THOSE are least energy, too. The arteries, veins and nerves are created in neurovascular bundles, starting out large, centrally and then branching out, Hierarchies, the further out they go. And our bodies are hierachically arranged as well.</p>
<p>The body of trunk, arms, and legs are hierarchies. The trachea, then divides into two main bronchi, then into the bronchioles, also are hierarchically arranged down to the alveoli, and there the large pulmonary veins come in split up branching, then absorb the O2, lose some H20 and CO2, and then become the pulmonary arteries to the left ventricle of the heart. All branching hierarchies you see?  Even our understanding is an organization of our knowledge the hierarchies.</p>
<p>The key to this deep, universal structure can be seen as least energy as well (roads, electric power lines, gas lines, sewer and water systems, etc.) in the way water runs downhill, reaching lower and lower gravitation energies as it flows. least energy again. Springs become rivulets, those become creeks, then streams, the small rivers, and then the large river systems. All branching, all least energy forms, down to the meandering low land rivers, which meandering is least energy turbulent flow to the sea, where the deltas break up into the various channels (branches) as in the MS delta and the Nile Delta, once again, the roots are seen as the various deltoid branches of the great rivers.</p>
<p>It's all least energy driven, you see?</p>
<p>That's the Grand Design of our bodies, reflected in the natural hierarchies, and the vast hierarchies of our understandings, the dictionaries, telephone and city directories, the periodic table of elements, etc., etc., etc. All least energy forms, Just like our bodies!!</p>
<p>The Grand Designs of Least Energy rules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're going to get a lot of long winded answers about this and it's very complex.</p>
<p>The reason is that we initially develop as a worm like thing with a gut tube running mouth to butt. This worm grows things on both sides which become the pairs of stuff like arms and legs. </p>
<p>The gut tube gets too long and lumpy so it gets stuffed back inside your body as a coiled mess to become your intestines and stomach. The stuff that grew off the gut tube gets put on one side of the other to become other things in your belly but they all started out as something right off the gut. </p>
<p>The worm has other tubes like the &quot;heart&quot; tube that kind of flops back on itself which is why your heart looks weird. All of the heart and artery weirdness are later improvements to deal with breathing, moving, crawling, and walking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart has to be asymmetrical in order to do its job.</p>
<p>Your blood doesn't move in a circle, but a figure 8. The right side of your heart pumps blood to the lungs, where it can pick up oxygen. Then it goes back to the heart. The left side of the heart pumps the blood around the entire rest of your body, where it drops off oxygen, and then back to the heart.</p>
<p>The left side of your heart has to pump blood much farther than the right side. To do that, it has to have a lot more muscle, and that makes it bigger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important for accurate sensory input that eyes/ears are symmetrical. It's important for speed and balance that limbs are symmetrical. The organs don't have this requirement, and are bunched in to be space-efficient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
