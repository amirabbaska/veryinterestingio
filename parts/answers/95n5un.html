		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is not my specialty, but I found <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2806387/" target="_blank">this paper (<em>Experience of unpleasant sensations in the mouth after injection of saline from prefilled syringes</em>)</a> stating:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The phenomenon of bad taste or smell is explained by the mechanism of volatile substances, released from saline when injected into the bloodstream and then eliminated by the respiratory system and thus detected by the patients in the air expired by the olfactory system. A sensation of taste, mediated by the taste buds, is usually combined with stimulation of touch and smell. Thus it is not surprising that the volunteers confused taste, flavour, and odour.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Djimbob may have the best info for why you might experience this with <em>any</em> IV fluids, but there are a lot of specific drugs that induce a metallic taste in a larger fraction of the population than for mere saline. One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iodinated_contrast" target="_blank">Iodinated contrast</a>, which is used to improve CT scans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To ad to that, how did they figure out how to safely inject foreign liquids directly into your blood stream without killing you. And does the extra liquid reduce your ability to transfer oxygen since there's new fluid In there sort of &quot;thinning&quot; the blood?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
