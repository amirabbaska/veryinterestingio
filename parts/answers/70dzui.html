		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mechanical Engineer here. Basically gonna repeat what's in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUhisi2FBuw" target="_blank">this fantastic video</a> by The Engineer Guy:</p>
<p>Gases &amp; Liquids want to change their &quot;parent container&quot; into a spherical shape. This is the most ideal for them. (Think of when you blow up a balloon). The problem with this is that spheres are not easy to transport (in fact, they're literally the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528834-500-only-in-3d-are-spheres-the-worst-packers/" target="_blank">least-space-efficient shape in 3D</a>). Like you said, rectangles (or cubes) would be the best.</p>
<p>But cubes have corners and edges like some people have pointed out. These create weak points for pressure. A container of this shape would fail at much lower stress than a sphere.</p>
<p>So we look at cylinders next - cylinders are much better: they're <em>relatively</em> easy to pack, but they also have fewer &quot;weak points&quot; (edges and corners). So we make one more compromise: we take the sphere that the gas/liquid wants to make naturally, split it in half, and put those on the end. Now we have created the best compromise between what will hold the gas/liquid the best and what is the easiest to pack/transport: a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_vessel" target="_blank">pressure vessel</a>.</p>
<p><strong>In the specific instance of transporting on a truck:</strong> Packing isn't really as important here. But a cylinder is still good for two reasons:  you can easily just make a longer cylinder to fit a longer truck and, as /u/IgnoringHisAge mentioned, a liquid will easily funnel down to the bottom of the tank (especially if you set it up <a href="https://www.fueloyal.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/10-Interesting-Facts-About-A-Tanker-Truck-11.png" target="_blank">like this</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A cylinder doesn't create weak points, like corners or like the middle of flat sides (which can bulge).</p>
<p>A cylinder uses less surface material to enclose the same volume, compared to a rectangle. (To help understand this intuitively: rounding off the corners saves a lot of material with only a small loss in volume.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't need to carry more volume. Tanker trucks can carry over 11,000 gallons of liquid. If that was gasoline it would weigh over 70,000 pounds.  The maximum weight of a truck, including cab and trailer, is only 80,000 pounds.  You're already there.</p>
<p>Using a round tank gives you the max volume with the minimum amount of material.  It would also be stronger than a square container. It will be easier to clean out (not so many corners) . </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very simple point that's been overlooked: when unloading a tanker, the cylinder allows for all of the liquid to pool at the outlet, allowing for a complete unload. Most tankers have a little belly or tilt to them that drains the fluid toward the valve.</p>
<p>Your toilet and sink wouldn't be too great if they were rectangles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said, it's all about pressure. A liquid pushes out perpendicular to the wall of the container, to simplify it. So when you have the corner of a rectangle there is equal pressure pushing down, against side 1 and against side 2 creating enormous pressure on that seam. On a cylinder it is equally distributed because perpendicular to the side is an arc, like how an arch Is so strong. Then you have a welded seam on a rectangle which can be a weak points whereas a cylinder is mostly just 1 piece rolled into a tank. There is probably a better way of phrasing all this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
