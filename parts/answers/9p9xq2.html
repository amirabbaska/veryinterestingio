		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heart doesn't work alone to pump blood.</p>
<p>When you exercise, a lot of other systems kick in to help blood get through the body easier and recycle to the heart more efficiently.  Movement of other muscles and one-way valves pushes blood along and veins dilate and contract to direct flow.</p>
<p>Exercise makes those systems more efficient, taking load off the heart.</p>
<p>ELI5: working out starts turning the bloodstream's gravel roads into paved highways so the heart doesn't have to force blood through with so much pressure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun question! So, it definitely has some part to play with the heart, but I'm not gonna talk about that. Instead, here's a more esoteric (definition: stupidly specific) aspect. Heads up, sorta long post but it touches on something complicated so I gotta lay the groundwork.</p>
<p>Endothelial cells, the cells on the inside of your arteries/veins that separate all your blood from all your not-blood, are sensitive to fluid flow. That is, they feel the frictional force your blood exerts on them as it flows over them. The pattern and magnitude of this &quot;shear stress&quot; (shear, because it is acting parallel with the plane they sit on; stress, because that's what engineers call it when a force acts on a surface) causes the endothelial cells to behave in certain ways. </p>
<p>Above a certain value of shear stress, the cells are healthier and can do their job right. Below that value, they start to get a little...pathological (inflammation, make bad stuff, vessel wall gets really really leaky like a hose with holes poked in it). In fact, scientists have known for decades that diseases like atherosclerosis (plaque that builds up in your arteries, that lead to high blood pressure/blood clots/strokes/heart attacks) form almost exclusively at points where the flow is bad or &quot;disturbed&quot;. Like where arteries bifurcate and split (fluid hits the apex of the split and starts swirling like a whirlpool) or around really curvy vessels (&quot;because physics&quot;, the high curvature causes some of the fluid to do weird things).</p>
<p>Exercise, among other benefits, keeps your blood flow &quot;stronger&quot;, maintaining more healthy shear stress values acting on those cells. Happy endothelial cells regulate vascular function so much better (process fats, control vessel diameter which attenuates high blood pressure, inhibit unnecessary clotting which prevents strokes). </p>
<p>This disturbed flow is ultimately unavoidable. It happens in every living creature with blood vessels. EVERYONE has atherosclerosis that gets worse with age. Atherosclerosis, and heart disease in general, are the number one causes of mortality in modern societies. Scientists are still trying to figure out all the details of how that disease develops. So, at the moment, it's an inevitable, ongoing decline as one gets older. But maintaining a healthier lifestyle, including constant exercise and a healthy diet, keeps its progression slow enough that it wouldn't normally bother you across a modern human lifespan. So, uh, obviously a more sedentary or food-centric obese lifestyle accelerates that time table. EDIT: A slight correction, credit to /u/NothingHasMeaning : &quot;A couple of doctors have repeatedly stopped and reversed CVD and fatty streak development with a strict diet of fruits, vegetables and whole grains. No processed food, meat, dairy or oil. Pretty friggin cool.&quot;</p>
<p>Hope this answers part of your question (it's a complicated question, 'cause exercise does SO MUCH for your health, in so many ways). If you have any questions about what I said, feel free to ask. My PhD dissertation is in this field (God grant me the strength to finish my degree haha) so I feel, uh, abnormally confident about answering questions. If you wanna look into it on your own, here are some keywords: mechanotransduction, shear stress, disturbed flow, endothelial dysfunction, mechanosensory, atheroprotective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other reasons that I have not seen mentionned are :</p>
<p>1)the fact that exercise lowers your sugar levels (up to 48h after exercise, diabetic people know to adjust their doses accordingly). Diabetes is a major cardiovascular factor.</p>
<p>2)It also helps adapting your cardiorespiratory systems to higher levels of performance. So when they get sick or when just physiologically aging, they retain more function. </p>
<p>3) statural muscles (muscles that lets you stand up/walk/run) specifically use more cholesterol as an energical substrate than other muscles. This is why sitting 8 hours/day increases cholesterol level (cardiovascular risk) even on non sedentary people vs non sedentary people that don't work office jobs.</p>
<p>4) it deacreases resting blood pressure (not a lot though) which is also a major cardiovascular risk</p>
<p>5)it helps burning fat, which is a cardiovascular risk by many ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>it increases insulinoresistance (=diabetes)</li>
<li>it increases blood pressure (if I remember correctly 5kg lost can help decrease resting blood pressure by 10mmHg but I am not sure of this information</li>
<li>visceral fat (=the fat you don't see that is around your organ) is metabolically active and is more detrimental to health that the other types of fat</li>
<li>impedes respiratory function. the diaphragm has to do a lot more work and that can cause stretching of the muscle fibers and it becomes less active as a muscle</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think another way of looking at it would be asking the question &quot;How does LACK of exercise increase blood pressure and cholesterol which then lead to strokes/heart attacks?&quot; Modern humans really don't get nearly as much exercise as our ancestors did in the past. And exercise doesn't necessarily mean working out at the gym or playing sports. Any physical activity that increases your heart rate and breathing counts as exercise. Doing household chores, walking, etc. </p>
<p>Think of all the modern conveniences which we now take for granted that have automated &quot;exercise,&quot; such as washer/dryers, dishwashers, lawn mowers etc. If previous generations wanted to communicate with someone in another town/state/country they would have to do physical work: actually writing out a letter, putting it in an envelope, then traveling to the nearest post office or mailbox to drop it off. Later generations would have at least had to walk to their living room or den to pick up a landline phone to make a call. Nowadays all we have to do is reach into our pocket and move our thumbs and fingers a little. With voice to text or voice activated assistants, we don't even have to do THAT. </p>
<p>But movement and physical activity is very important. The amount of physical activity humans are required to perform just to live a normal life keeps decreasing and decreasing from generation to generation but everyday stresses have either stayed the same or even increased. In the past, whenever our ancient ancestors were physically and emotionally stressed, because they were running for their lives from a pack of lions for example, their bodies created cortisol and adrenaline to help ensure that they would be successful in running away and live to see another day. In modern times, we don't have to worry about lions so much but we do have school/work deadlines to meet, relationship issues, financial concerns, etc. These stressors also increase the levels of cortisol and adrenaline in the body, but these hormones DON'T GET USED UP because we're not performing the physical activities they were designed to help with anymore. When these hormones accumulate in our body long term due to chronic every day stresses, they mess with our metabolism and homeostasis and lead to chronic health issues like high blood pressure and cholesterol etc.</p>
<p>TLDR: Our bodies defense mechanisms which used to be of great benefit in the past are slowly killing us because we're no longer using our bodies the way we used to in the past, and definitely not getting enough movement or exercise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three things my Cardioloist told me.  One,  when you exercise you strengthen your heart muscle. Two, you force more blood through your arteries at a higher rate to help flush blockages out. Third, and this happened to me, you are basically giving your heart a stress test so if you get some pain or uncomfortable feelings you can get to a doctor and fix issues in the early stages.  Three months after my second heart attacking I was swimming and had a rush of pressure in my chest.  Called the Doc and he had me come right down.  Turns out one of the stents they put  in closed up, which at the time was a 50% occurrence within three months of insertion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
