		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your daughter's science teacher is wrong.</p>
<p>Also, your impression is correct - the planets all rotate in (roughly) the same direction because that was the angular momentum of the original molecular cloud from which the whole Solar System formed.</p>
<p>Now, if we want to be very pedantic, there is also technically the incredibly subtle effect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame-dragging" target="_blank">frame dragging</a>: Rotating massive objects have an relativistic effect on the space-time around them, causing a very slight extra torque to orbiting bodies. This is so small that, in spite of being first proposed in 1918 as a consequence of general relativity, we still haven't had solid convincing proof that it actually exists. There are some very rough calculations done in 2011 from the data produced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_Probe_B" target="_blank">Gravity Probe B</a> that suggest frame dragging does indeed occur, but the margin of error is still quite large.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not exactly wrong. The spin of the sun doesn’t cause the planets to spin in that direction, but the two should pretty much always go in the same direction. It’s a simple mistake of A causes B and C, but being stated as B causes C. A in this situation is that the spin of objects in a solar system should approximately match the average angular velocity of the solar system as a whole. The larger the body the more likely, stars and planets included.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not sure why objects spin the way they do but every object caught in gravitational pull spins at
90* to the rotation of the object upon its axis.
That’s why Saturn has rings instead of a cloud of rotating debris</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
