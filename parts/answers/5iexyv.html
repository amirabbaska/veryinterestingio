		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fire merely requires a sufficiently strong oxidizer, which doesn't necessarily have to be oxygen. Oxidizers are molecules that take electrons away from something, and tend to be toward the right of the periodic table.  Fluorine is even stronger than oxygen and can react with water. Chlorine triflouride is powerful enough to ignite some things that are not normally flammable. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people focused on the fire part of your question, but there are a lot of other reactions that may occur.  In most cases, a planet's sun is constantly dumping photons into the atmosphere, which can produce free radicals from otherwise inert materials.   These are highly reactive materials.   Likewise, lightning can promote some really interesting reactions with seemingly inert materials like nitrogen.   (With oxygen and carbon containing molecules present, you can even make amino acids.)  Then you have geological events, like volcanos, helping to facilitate reactions, particularly between dissimilar metals.   The number of reactions are really limitless, even in an oxygen free environment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chlorine Triflouride is a very strong oxidizing and flourinating agent, surpassing the oxidizing ability of oxygen. It sets fire to a wide range of substances on contact, including metals, sand, water (which it reacts explosively with), concrete, and even asbestos. The recommended tool for dealing with accidents involving it is a pair of good running shoes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/search/?query=H.+Beam+Piper&amp;go=Go" target="_blank">This link is to some science fiction books by H. Beam Piper,</a> but open up Uller Uprising. It's prefaced by an old scientific paper theorizing what conditions would be like on a couple different planets, one with fluorine as an oxidizer, and one that is calcium poor. </p>
<p>Incidentally, the book was inspired by this paper, and is a rousing good golden age story. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Nuclear Wildfire</strong></p>
<p>An early civilisation could encounter natural nuclear fission reactors, due to the abundance of radioactive materials when a planet first forms or on world's with greater abundance of nuclear material.</p>
<p>The Earth itself still had natural reactors up until it was 2 billion years old.</p>
<p>Perhaps aliens that evolved fast enough to discover them could skip fire and go straight to nuclear power.</p>
<p>This would provide a more than sufficient dynamic energy source for technological development even without the necessary conditions for fire.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Alkaline Wildfire</strong></p>
<p>I would like to preface this by saying this is highly speculative.</p>
<p>One alternative to fire has been in the news lately, Alkali metals are able to create thermal runaway that leads to battery fires in our oxygen-rich atmospheres.</p>
<p>However this reactivity and the abundance of oxygen on earth mean these metals do not occur naturally in their pure form. &quot;They are lithophiles and therefore remain close to the Earth's surface because they combine readily with oxygen and so associate strongly with silica.&quot; So we have to use fire/electrolysis to extract the pure form from the rocks they love to form.</p>
<p>However planets can form from oxygen-poor planetary discs, creating what are known as carbon planets,</p>
<p>These planets would not have the same issues as our oxygen-rich world, and alkali metal could occur naturally in their pure form.</p>
<p>Pure alkali metals could provide civilisations that arise on these worlds with a fire-less energy source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
