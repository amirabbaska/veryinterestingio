		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meteorologist here. I cant speak much to biology but tropical systems like Irma cause significant mixing of the surface waters through localized upwelling and freshwater mixing from rainfall. They leave behind cold wakes where you can see the warm water has been mixed with deeper cooler water. I would imagine this impacts the thermocline and life in the lowest hundred feet of the ocean.</p>
<p>Edit* top hundred feet of the ocean. Working overnight means my brain stops sometimes!</p>
<p>Edit edit* </p>
<p>For clarification the thermocline is a well defined mixed layer at the top of the ocean where temperature changes rapidly with depth. Its very similar to the boundary layer in earths atmosphere but reversed in that the sun heats the surface of the ocean and wave action and to a lesser extent convection mixes the top 100 meters or so of water. Tropical cyclones induce deeper mixing which brings even deeper cooler water up from below to alter this layer. Storm surge also plays a role in this. Because of the low minimum central pressure and the resulting strong winds inside tropical cyclones (916 mb as of 12z) the water is lifted up 10-20 feet like a giant straw and blown on shore (especially in the front quadrant relative to motion and wind direction.) This also induces mechanical mixing.</p>
<p>There was a question about wave height as well. Wave height is proportional to wind speed. Irma right now has sustained maximum winds (this is a 1 minute average windspeed) 160 kts or 185 mph
(equivalent to a high end EF-4 tornado)
This can easily produce waves over 20 feet and probably higher. Right now some of the moored buoys are reporting seas of 17 feet.</p>

<p>Im trying to answer as many questions as I can but unfortunately I've got another night shift tonight so I need to call it for the day. Feel free to continue asking and I will try to answer what I can later. Hope this was helpful for some! I'm not a tropical weather expert but hurricanes are super cool and everyone should learn about them! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The massive waves created churn up the water and cause the layers to mix. This redistributes nutrients evenly throghout the height of the water that is being mixed. This redistribution can be very beneficial to surface plankton communities who would otherwise have used up the nutrients in their waters. However, not all surface plankton are &quot;desirable&quot; (see: harmful algal blooms) and so the result of the higher nutrient waters can be &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.  The animal communities in the water have ways of dealig with the churning waters. Some will sink in the water column so the are below the churning waters, some are so small that they hardly notice it, others will migrate away from the area, and some don't really care. When the storm reaches shallower waters and the depth of the wabes created is larger than the depth of the waters, sediments from the bottom get churned into the waters. This increases the turbidity of the water. The sediment in the water will eventually settle out, but can be carried by currents for miles. This redistributes small amounts of sediment throughout the oceans, and can feed deeper organisms as it settles (as some sediments contain organic material). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have so many questions to add to this. </p>
<p>How big do the waves get with +295km/hr winds? Are there boats there right now? How big does a boat have to be to sail through a storm like that? What happens if there's an oil rig there? Would a submarine notice the storm? How deep would it have to go? Does cool stuff ever get washed up onto shore after storms like that? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coral reef tank hobbyist here. One thing to remember is that the wave action on the surface only affects the water underneath for 1/2 the wave length and even then it is greatly diminished the deeper you go. That said, the ecosystems depend on occasional storms to distribute bio-matter like eggs plants and coral so they can propagate. This is similar to how seeds are spread in the wind.</p>
<p>Food and detritus is also kicked up during these storms and becomes more available to the entire ecosystem. This also helps to clean the crap out of the nooks and crannies to allow more oxygen to get into the rocks, sand and other surfaces. Think about cleaning a fish tank and stirring up all the detritus and crud in order to get it out of there. Storms are natures way of doing the same thing. Fish love it because there is more cover and more to eat. Some fish just wait it out though if they are not comfortable with the changed currents, like around reefs, open water though you hardly notice it except at the bottom.</p>
<p>*edit, corrected for the wave base formula</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I can't speak definitively to what fish do, since I'm on the physics end of things, but I can give you the setting here. As a storm passes over the ocean, you get turbulent mixing enhanced by wind stress curl induced upwelling along the storm track, down to ~200-300m, depending on the storm intensity and size. Some fish can swim below that depth, some can get out of the way, and some will fare about as well as you'd expect in this sort of turbulence.</p>
<p>Where things get really interesting in regards to ocean life is after the storm has passed. As /u/twisterkid34 mentioned, the mixing and upwelling of thermocline water leaves an intense cold wake behind the storm. This water is also more nutrient rich than that higher in the photic layer/closer to the surface, since productivity (rate of phytoplankton growth, as a rough shorthand) is suppressed by the lower amount of sunlight.</p>
<p>So, what's the result? You get fairly significant plankton blooms in the wake of these storms! They're strong enough that the chlorophyll signature can be [observed from satellites] (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2003JC001938/full" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2003JC001938/full</a>). Taking into consideration that TCs spend a considerable amount of time passing over the mid-gyre, which is an oligotrophic (low nutrient, low productivity, &quot;ocean desert&quot;) region, tropical cyclone induced phytoplankton blooms can potentially account for up to 10-20% of all biological productivity in these open ocean areas (citation needed, I know, but don't have the literature in front of me).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
