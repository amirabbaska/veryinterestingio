<p>(Such a setup like you describe could also me manufactured relatively simply, as the cranks were fixed to the wheel: no ratcheting mechanisms or chains needed).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before chain drive was invented on a bike, you had to turn the wheel directly. A single gear chain drive bike has a specific gear ratio to go a specific speed if you turn the cranks a specific speed. Without that gear ratio, you would need a larger wheel to do the same thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about your old tricycle: the pedals were connected directly to the wheel. One revolution of the pedals meant one revolution of the front wheel, meant you went forward X distance. X would be the circumference of the wheel. A bigger wheel would mean you could go further with one revolution (but you'd need to push harder to get started). Since your legs can only go around the pedals so fast, if you want to go quickly, you're better off with bigger wheels, since your legs don't have to move as much, they just have to push harder. The downside is that it's harder to get the bike moving to start with, and much harder if not impossible going uphill.</p>
<p>We have long since solved the problem by connecting the pedals to gears, so that the number of pedal revolutions per wheel revolution can be varied depending on the gear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because gears and chains didn't exist. Without this, the only way to turn a wheel is to attach the pedals and cranks directly to the centre of that wheel. Since they're attached directly, one turn of the pedals equals one turn of the wheel, unlike a modern bike where one turn of the pedals usually equals several turns of the wheel.</p>
<p>With a small wheel, that means your legs turn very fast but you don't go very far. A bigger wheel goes further in one turn which is more comfortable, as well as easier and faster. The size of this wheel is limited only by the length of your legs, since you have to be able to reach just past the centre to push the pedals down past it. This is why all these bikes are usually of a similar size.</p>
<p>Now, you also need a second wheel so that you have something to make balancing and turning easier, as well as to stop you simply tipping forward when you pedal. However, since it's not attached to the pedals, it doesn't matter how big this wheel is and a smaller wheel is usually less bumpy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
