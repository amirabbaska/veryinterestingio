		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, a rolling object could be more thought of as having many more impacts, just with less force. A square object &quot;rolling&quot; would have four big impacts, while a bowling ball would have tons of tiny ones, which add up to the smooth rolling noise.</p>
<p>Source: It makes sense in my head so I hope that's how it is</p>
<p>Edit: think of the atoms. As the ball rolls, the object itself stays on the ground, but each surface atom is constantly going up and down, taking turns hitting the ground and then getting rolled back up. That's what makes up all the tiny impacts that cause the sound</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://youtu.be/ZMByI4s-D-Y" target="_blank">roundest object on Earth</a>  , if scaled to the actual size of the Earth, would have 14 to 40 meters of difference between the highest peak and the deepest valley. Bowling balls are reeeally irregular, so they make many tiny jumps every second. The rolling sound is the sound of the ball bouncing towards its target. </p>
<p>Edit: grammar and amount of meters</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert, but I'm thinking this is because the flat surface you're talking about isn't actually totally flat, and the ball isn't totally spherical.  I'd bet perfectly round object rolled on a perfect flat surface wouldn't make a sound aside from the slight wind noise it would create, which our ears probably couldn't pick up anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>everything in the world is squishy. you apply force, and things bend or stretch. not much, for hard things. the amount you bend a block of concrete by standing on it would take specialized instruments to measure.</p>
<p>a sphere and a plane meet at a single point. because of this, even a tiny ball exerts enormous amounts of pressure on the table it's sitting on. as a result, both the ball and the table deform. just a little bit, and not permanently. this bending and unbending of both the ball and the table causes noise even with the best materials.</p>
<p>in practice, of course, balls aren't perfectly round and tables are not perfectly flat. the ball will click and clatter as it's flat parts hit the table all at once. the table will creak and groan as the divots and wood grain strike the ball. etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
