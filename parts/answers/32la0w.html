		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The radius of the Observable Universe is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe#Size" target="_blank">4.3e26 m</a>. The radius of the Earth is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_radius" target="_blank">6.37e6 m</a>. So, your scale factor is about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=6.37e6+%2F+4.3e26" target="_blank">1.5e-20</a>. Everything in the Universe shrinks by that amount and now fits into the size of the Earth.</p>
<p>Some fun numbers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earth itself is now <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5e-20+*+%286371000+m%29" target="_blank">0.1 picometers</a> in size, or about 100 times the radius of a proton.</li>
<li>The Sun is now <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5e-20+*+7e8+m" target="_blank">10.5 picometers</a> in radius, or about half the radius of a hydrogen atom. The Moon is around half that distance away from the Earth.</li>
<li>The semi-major axis of Pluto going around the Sun is <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5e-20+*+%286e12+m%29" target="_blank">90 nanometers</a>, of order the size of a virus.</li>
<li>The nearest star system, Alpha Centauri, is about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5e-20+*+%284.25*9e15+m%29" target="_blank">half a millimeter</a> away, or about <del>half the thickness of a red blood cell</del> the size of an amoeba.</li>
<li>The Galaxy is now about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5e-20+*+%2815000*3e16+m%29" target="_blank">7 m</a> in radius, so about four people tall.</li>
<li>The distance to Andromeda, the nearest large galaxy, is about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5e-20+*+%28780000*3e16+m%29" target="_blank">350 m</a>, almost a quarter of a mile away.</li>
<li>The distance to the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, the nearest big cluster, is about <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1.5e-20+*+%2816.5e6*3e16+m%29" target="_blank">7.4 km/4.6 mi</a> away.</li>
</ul>
<p>tl;dr: space is big.</p>
<p>EDIT: I goofed on Alpha Centauri, thank you /u/W6hwy5Zf ! Fixed.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Thanks /u/lludson!</p>
<p>EDIT 3: Speed of light calculation by /u/TimS194 for those asking: <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/32la0w/if_the_universe_were_shrunk_to_something_akin_to/cqch1iu" target="_blank">link</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the strangest things about this degree of scale – something that strikes me as inexplicably <em>weird</em> – is how incredibly slow the speed of light is over galactic distances. </p>
<p>Even in our tiny little neighborhood, it takes 8 minutes for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth. Imagine standing by a small lake; out in the middle is a 1&quot; floating ball that represents the Sun, and at your feet – right on the shoreline – is a speck representing the Earth at scale.</p>
<p>Imagine throwing a stone that splashed right beside our “Sun.” Now picture a ripple that takes a full 8 minutes to reach the shore. Bizarre, isn't it? The notion that our universal speed limit is so… lethargic… is so strange that it's creepy. It gives me the willies.</p>
<p>It gives me the feeling that if we knew why this was the case, it would literally be like taking the red pill, as some people speculate that this is evidence in favor of the argument that we're living in a simulation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not the same scale you are specifically asking about, but there is a fantastic scale model of the solar system in Melbourne Australia that helped me tremendously in visualizing the scale of the solar system and almost unimaginably empty space is.  It starts at one end of St. Kilda beach with the sun.  Here's a picture of me sitting on the model of the sun: <a href="http://imgur.com/WyGxvXj" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/WyGxvXj</a></p>
<p>At that scale, the earth is a short stroll away, maybe a 3 minute walk.  It's about the size of a marble.  The planets continue down the beach to Uranus, but it will take an hour to walk there.</p>
<p>They also have almost right next to the sun, another model star, about a third the size.  The plaque helpfully explains that it is Proxima Centuri, and that it is shown the correct scale for distance to the sun.... after having gone around the earth once.  That's how far away the next nearest star is other than the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the observable universe has a diameter of about 8.7*10^(26) m, while the Earth has one of about 1.3*10^(7) m.  That's a factor difference of 6.7*10^(19).  So you need to scale everything down by that much.</p>
<p>How much is that?  Well, an atom only has a diameter of about 10^(-10) meters, so if you do this shrinkage, anything about 10^9 meters across would shrink to the size of an atom.  The Earth would shrink to around 100 times smaller, so the size of the nucleus, IIRC.  The Sun though, would be just about the size of an atom.  By comparison, a golf ball is ENORMOUS; about 3 * 10^8 times as big as an atom.  So, what's that much bigger than the Sun?  Well, looking at the numbers on wiki, it seems that the diameter of a golf ball just about corresponds to the distance the sun is from the center of our galaxy, which is also about a golfball length from the edge of the galaxy.</p>
<p>So to sum up, if I did my numbers right, You shrink the observable Universe to the size of Earth.  Now put 4 golf balls in a row, touching.  That's our galaxy, and the Sun is a single atom at the point the first and second golf ball touch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
