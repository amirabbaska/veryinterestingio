		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light therapy lamps for SAD typically do not contain UV light, just a lot of visible light. Additinally, UV light interacts with your skin to create vitamin D, not your eyes. I would guess that the lethargy is just from lack of light in the winter in general rather from your contacts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check out photosensitive ganglion cells located in the eye which affect circadian rhythm which would come into play with SAD and bipolar disorder.</p>
<p>I have sad light glasses which shine light onto my eyes to stimulate these cells to trigger my brain to produce serotonin in winter when it's darker.</p>
<p>If those uv blocking contact lenses also blocked other wavelengths of light from stimulating those cells then you have found the source of your problem.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only UV-blocking contact lens that is FDA approved to wear continuously in the US is Acuvue Oasys, but should be replaced once a week. </p>
<p>You may have dry or irritated eyes from overwear. Irritation may make your eyes feel tired and removing them may make you feel more comfortable and in turn 'energetic'</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
