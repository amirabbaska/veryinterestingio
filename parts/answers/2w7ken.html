		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So many poorly written explanations on here so I'll try to explain it a bit better. </p>
<p>First let's talk about the glass on a car. Most of the windows (except the windshield) are made from tempered glass. Tempered glass is known for being quite strong, but also fails quite spectacularly, instantaneously shattering into an enormous amount of little pieces. Why does it do this? Well let's understand the processing. This glass is cooled rapidly from liquid to solid. Glass that cools more quickly ultimately ends up at a lower density, hence a higher volume compared to glass that cools slowly. <a href="http://www.benbest.com/cryonics/tg.jpg" target="_blank">graph</a> Well guess what, there is a thermal gradient in a pane of glass as it cools. Meaning the outside rapidly cools and the inside does not. This puts the outside of the glass in compression and in the inside in tension. This acts as a crack inhibition method, meaning that the stress necessary to propagate the crack must first overcome the compressive stress on the outside (since glass will fail in tension well before compression). So what do we get? A glass that is ultimately very strong, but has a massive amount of stored internal energy through the tempering process. </p>

<p>Let's say we want to break this glass though. How do we go about it? Well if we can force a crack to propagate through this thin compressive stress layer on the outside and into the stored tensile stress region, then this crack will immediately cause catastrophic failure. The easiest way to do it? Use something small and hard to act as a stress concentrator. This can amplify the force applied and help penetrate this region. So in the case of the spark plug shard, which is made from a hard ceramic (likely an alumina based material) the impact from the ceramic is enough to form a crack and cause it to penetrate the glass deep enough. That is also why you can buy punches (firefighters and other emergency responders also carry these) that are essentially hardened steel or diamond tipped and do the same thing.</p>
<p>Hardness of the glass compared to to impact material is definitely relevant since this interaction is very similar to a hardness test (Rockwell, Vickers, Knoop, etc. Indent tests). The material needs to be harder, or at least close to the same hardness as the glass. I highly discourage people from using the Mohs scale to get actual numbers. </p>

<p>Fun fact: your windshield is engineered to break before a human skull will. <a href="http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/esv/esv20/07-0101-W.pdf" target="_blank">Here is an interesting study</a> talking about injuries associated with laminated vs. tempered glass in auto collisions</p>
<p>Edit: Added sources and some graphs</p>
<p>Edit 2: Updated some relevant information about impact with windshields and took out the sensationalist comment about side impacts</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The comments in this video explain it pretty well. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhlmKHbPFhU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhlmKHbPFhU</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This happens because ceramic is extremely hard, brittle but hard. The glass to you seeing cars is made by super rapid cooling of the glass which creates tension between the outer wall of the glass and the inner core.</p>
<p>The ceramic is harder than outdoor wall which enables it to make a fracture, and because there's so much tension on it the window basically implodes.ï»¿</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As <strong>Hatecranker</strong> says, with tempered glass, any damage to any part of it destroys the entire piece.</p>
<p>This is partly done for safety, because there are no sharp shards to stab/slice through you, the glass disintegrates into a shower of &quot;pebbles&quot;.</p>
<p>However, tempered glass is phenomenally difficult to chip or crack.  You can hit it with a blunt hammer and it will neither chip nor crack so it will not break.</p>
<p>The hardness of the attacking tool is critical.  A steel point might be able to destroy it, but it's difficult.  The edge needs to come to a point to scratch it, but a fine point on steel will bend a bit under the high forces.  Ceramic is very different, it's much harder than steel.  It's more brittle, but that doesn't matter here.  It's not a thin cutting edge of course- a broken spark plug is not a knife- but you can scratch concrete with a broken spark plug much easier than you could with a knife.  It's like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
