		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just water spots.  Someone explained why this happens to plastic in the dishwasher a while back in a different context.  Glass and metal get hot enough and retain enough heat to evaporate the water from the rinse cycle.  Plastic, on the other hand, does not retain enough heat to evaporate the rinse water off.</p>
<p>tl;dr;. To prevent this, open the dishwasher after the metal and plastic has had time to evaporate the rinse water and manually finish drying the plastic with a towel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read the previous comments and I believe they are true to some extent. There are some spots that are caused by the dishwasher that cause deposits on plastic dishes. This could be heat related but it is not due to melting. These spots come off completely with scrubbing. What are these caused by? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
