As a result the tunneling required for beta decay is suppressed for as long as you keep the system cold, and constantly ping a laser off it. For details: Perturbation.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, essentially anything that requires the quantum system to have a well-defined (i.e., classical) state counts as measurement.</p>
<p>More technically, if the state of a quantum system becomes inseparably mixed with the state of another quantum system that is too complex for us to realistically describe quantum mechanically then it is 'measured'. If we could describe the second system quantum mechanically then we'd see that the two systems actually just become entangled. This is called decoherence, and is also the source of the many worlds interpretation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially: interaction with anything you haven't explicitly included in your quantum mechanical model. This leads to decoherence and incoherent dynamics, which are formally the same as observation. You can think of decoherence as being due to a measurement  that you are not told the outcome of, often because the measurer was an inanimate object. </p>
<p>Generally we cannot consider a quantum mechanical model for a wider environment, so some (weak) measurement effects will always be present. </p>
<p>As interactions with a wider environment transfer information about correlations within your system of interest, they also affect dynamics within the system.  If we could a big &quot;environment&quot; strongly to a small system we alter the dynamics in the system.  This can lead to the wavefunction of the system being fixed to a particular value and hence the quantum zero effect.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
