		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the country-specific top-level domains were created, the UK already had an academic network of its own (JANET) with its own naming scheme similar to DNS. Academic sites started UK.AC, commercial ones started UK.CO, and government ones UK.MOD (Ministry of Defence).</p>
<p>The obvious thing to do was flip all the existing names around to create the equivalent DNS names. So Cambridge university was already known as UK.AC.CAM on JANET, and was assigned the domain cam.ac.uk to match.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the very early days of the internet, nobody really knew what effect it would have, and thus how to future-proof it. Many countries simply took the assigned top-level domain for their country and left it at that; others, including the UK, created their own versions of the generic top-level domains like .com, .net, .gov, etc, all the better to manage the whole system if it got massively big.</p>
<p>.co.uk is the most common UK second-level domain, as it's used for commercial and general purposes. Others include .ac.uk for academic institutions, .gov.uk for government websites, .police.uk for the police forces, .sch.uk for educational authorities, .mod.uk for the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces, and so on.</p>
<p>ETA: Thus somerset.gov.uk is the official website for Somerset County Council, while somerset.sch.uk is the third-level domain for primary and secondary schools in Somerset.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the .co subdomain is meant for commercial sites, and the UK is very stringent on who is allowed straight .uk sites (mainly government sites), so commercial entities had to use .co.uk because they weren't allowed to register as just .uk</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way a countries top level domain is subdivded is up to the registrar that manages it.</p>
<p>some chose to mirror generic TLDs like <em>.com as second level tlds like </em>.co.uk and <em>.gov as </em>.gov.uk.</p>
<p>This makes sense as the standard .gov and .edu or even .mil are reserved for American government, education or military institution and a country wanting to have something like that of their own would need to make them underneath their countries TLD.</p>
<p>Other countries never bothered with that and just threw everything in directly under their main TLD and others again made a mixed solution.</p>
<p>Much of that is grown from poor standardization when stuff got started and inertia and tradition carrying it to the present day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
