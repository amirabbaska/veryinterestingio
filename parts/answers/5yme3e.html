<p>The US has overseas bases because they have agreements with those countries to allow them and want them to facilitate their force projection in those theatres.  There isn't a great need to have a base in the US.  No one is worried about Canada or Mexico getting out of hand and needing forces there in a hurry, and obviously the US wouldn't allow bases on their territory designed to protect against the US itself.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this has to do with the Lend-Lease Act during WWII. Part of the Act allowed the US to build bases in foreign allied countries in return for aid and supplies during the war. We still have many of these bases in operation today. Also NATO, any country unwilling or incapable of supporting a military will sign up for NATO allowing the US to place bases in their country in return for defense. The reason no bases exist in US is because we are well defended and don't need to capitulate to demands of foreign nations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before WW2, the US didn't really have bases in other countries, other than Panama and Cuba. As part of WW2, the US military went all over the world ('world war'). When the war ended, the US hoped to mostly go home, aside from the occupation of Germany. But the Soviets started getting belligerent, with the blockade of Berlin and then the Korean War. The US decided on a policy of containment, and most of the non-communist countries wanted US alliances and the US bases to stay, to hep deter the potential for Soviet aggression. So the US stayed in the UK, Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines. The US formed NATO and SEATO, and further basing was based on these defensive alliances.  </p>
<p>On a practical level, the US only stays in countries that want them there. They negotiate a 'SOFA' - Status of Forces Agreement. Economically, the US spends a bunch of money in the country, so it is a boost to the local economy. If a country doesn't want the US, it can ask them to leave at any time.  France asked the US to leave pretty early (due to pride).  Libya asked the US to leave in the 50s. The Philipines asked the US to leave in the early 1990s. Iraq asked the US to leave in 2010 (asked them in 2008 to leave by 2010, which the US did - then Iraq asked them to come back and help after ISIS, which the US did). </p>
<p>So that's why the US has a lot of foreign bases. The US was never invaded or never needed the help of other foreign powers in any of its alliances (Mexcio is not a threat, Canada is a NATO member and Canada actually has troops overseas in NATO facilities just like the US). But it does have a lot of training facilities for its allies, and German has a permanent outpost at Hollman Air Force Base for pilot training, so they do have a military base in a way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most U.S.military installations in foreign countries are there to enable us to fulfill our obligations under mutual defense treaties. Using NATO as an example, if we are to be able to help smaller European countries defend their borders against potential Russian incursions, for instance, we need to have troops and equipment in place in order to respond quickly enough. On the other hand, the U.S. doesn't really require reciprocity. We don't need foreign troops stationed in CONUS to help us secure our borders.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> However, we do have a few, small contingents of foreign troops on U.S. soil, but they are here for training, usually flight training, and on U.S. made aircraft being purchased for use by their countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Every day, you are going to make sure that there is a spot for that friend beside you on the bus ride and at the lunch table.</p>
<p>It's at least as much for the benefit of the host country as it is for the benefit of the US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
