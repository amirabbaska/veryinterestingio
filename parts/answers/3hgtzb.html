		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baidu has now ditched some of the speech recognition techniques mentioned in this thread. They instead rely on an Artificial Neural Network that they call Deep Speech (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567" target="_blank">http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.5567</a>).</p>
<p>This is an overview of the processing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Generate spectrogram of the speech (this gives the strength of different frequencies over time)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give the spectrogram to the Deep Speech model</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Deep Speech model will read slices in time of the spectrogram</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Information about that slice of time is transformed into some learned internal representation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>That internal representation is passed into layers of the network that have a form of memory. (this is so Deep Speech can use previous, and later, sound segments to inform decisions)</p>
</li>
<li>This new internal representation is used by the final layers to predict the Letter that occured in that slice of time.</li>
</ol>
<p>A little more simply:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Put spectrogram of speech into Deep Speech</p>
</li>
<li>Deep Speech gives probabilities of letters over that time.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the reasons Google offered the free google voice system with voicemail text functionality was to test their voice to text reliability rate and find ways to improve it. At one point, part of the terms of agreement for using the service was that they would be able to anonymously compare the sound of the voicemail you received with the text translation of the voicemail they provided you. </p>
<p>They basically crowdsourced a ton of people leaving voicemail messages, used their speech to text software to create a transcript of the voicemail for the users via email, then checked the accuracy of the voicemail to the transcript to learn how to improve their accuracy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's worth saying that this has been one of the hardest problems in Computer Science, and some of the industry's most powerful algorithms have been used to tackle it. First there was the Harpy System, then Hidden Markov Models, then Neural Networks. Looking at the thread, you've gotten a pretty good rundown of each. </p>
<p>The basics of them are the same, though. Looking a single syllable as data (think of an audio waveform, though it's not quite that simple), the AI has a notion of what that syllable might sound like, and can try to match it to that. However, lots of syllables sound similar, and people with different accents say the same syllable differently. </p>
<p>So, instead, this matching can generate a list of different possible syllable matches, along with a confidence level for each. This is put into a list of all the syllables in that breakdown of the sentence, and then that breakdown is put into a list of possible breakdowns, which also has confidence values. Now you've got a list of lists of lists, some of those having confidence values. This set will probably have millions of permutations, so now the game becomes intelligently figuring out what the most reasonable interpretation, and that's where other tricks like Hidden Markov Models come into play. </p>
<p>It's the two rules of making AIs: </p>
<ol>
<li>In AI, searching is to be avoided.</li>
<li>All AI is searching. </li>

How far are we from having a AI similar to Google Now, Siri and Cortana that will help teach us a foreign language?  It would be awesome to have simple conversations with a AI and have them correct pronunciation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
