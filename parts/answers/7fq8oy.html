		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's extravagant.   The numbers you see quoted online are typically from the electric utilities so they're pretty accurate.   Still, if you count the costs of production of miners and other hardware, the price of Bitcoin can be seen tired to energy, silicon, and THEN demand.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's very difficult to estimate the total impact of Bitcoin power consumption.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can estimate the global mining <em>volume</em> (called the hash rate), but there's no way to measure efficiency.  The energy efficiency of mining can vary by more than an order of magnitude depending on the available hardware and the software environment, and efficiency is not reported or tracked by the Bitcoin network.  Miners using stolen or subsidized electricity have no reason to care about the efficiency of their operation, so it's not safe to assume that all Bitcoin production is economic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mining in cold climates can offset the cost of heating.  If a building needs to be heated anyway then Bitcoin mining is almost free; the energy is converted very efficiently into heat.</p>
</li>
<li>On the other hand, mining in warm climates can be more expensive than your computer's power consumption would indicate.  All the waste heat must be moved out, consuming even more energy.  Inadequate cooling can cause permanent damage to computer hardware.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on, think about it this way. One Bitcoin is about $8000. That means that, rationally, people will spend up to $8000 in order to mine one Bitcoin (a bit more if they believe the coin will go up in price). That's a lot of electricity</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's some upsides and downsides to this. Firstly, it does consume a huge amount of raw power, and usually it's pretty constant. This just increases stress on the electrical grid, but it's likely not enough to matter depending on the size and setup of breaker stations and whatnot. Since it's going all the time, it requires the power grid produce more power <em>constantly</em>, which right now means little renewable energy can go towards the systems. There are things people can do to help though, such as using the heat produced from the GPUs to heat a home or a floor of a building or something, but that can be hard to make efficient as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
