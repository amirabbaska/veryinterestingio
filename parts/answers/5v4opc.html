		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The languages you are talking about are the Indo-European languages. Almost all languages in Europe are part of this language family. The original language that all of these descended from (Proto-Indo-European) had gendered words like that, so almost all of the languages that came from it also have it. Originally, there were three genders: feminine, masculine, and neuter. Some languages, like Russian and German, still have this. Some other languages, like Swedish, merged the feminine and masculine words to make a 'common' gender along with neuter. The Romance languages have gotten rid of the neuter gender and have the feminine/masculine words you were talking about. Funnily enough, English also used to have feminine, masculine, and neuter words, but over time people just kind of got rid of them, and now english is almost completely genderless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a vestige of the old Proto-Indo-European language. It simply had these classes. Many other languages have different classes; some use animate-inanimate. Many Native American languages have multiple classes that describe the noun (usually with animacy, state, and consistency). Most linguists use gender when it comes to actual gender (masculine, feminine, or neuter), while reserving class for pretty much everything else.</p>
<p>Gender is usually only grammatical. For instance, German <strong>Weib</strong> (&quot;woman&quot;) is neuter. So as I've said before, it's just vestiges of an ancient ancestral language. Nothing to do with sexism or whatever (usually).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to realise that many - even <em>most</em> &quot;why&quot; questions about grammar just don't have a good answer. Languages developed quasi-randomly, mostly without direction and often without &quot;natural selection&quot; evolving the language towards certain useful features. So a lot of quirks are just there because, well... they just are!</p>
<p>So the real answer is that <strong>we don't know, and possibly there is no good reason.</strong> However we can make some guesses which, in the case that gender didn't just happen for no reason, make sense. The first is that gender makes things less ambiguous. Think about the sentence:</p>
<pre><code>There is a shelf in the shop which I clean.</code></pre>
<p>Do I clean the shop or the shelf? In German this would be:</p>
<pre><code>Es gibt ein Regal in dem Laden *das/den* ich putze.</code></pre>
<p>If you use <em>das</em> then it means you clean the shelf, if <em>den</em> then it is the shop: there's no confusion, because the word has to change depending on the gender of the noun it's referring to.</p>
<p>The next useful feature is that gender just serves as an extra part of the word which, if you have two words which sound similar, serves to make it clear which you meant.</p>
<p>Other people have mentioned that the ancestor language of all Indo-European languages had gender, and this is why <em>so many</em> modern European languages have it now. Hopefully the above explains what we can say about why gender might have developed in Proto-Indo-European.</p>
<p>Finally let me point out that you should not get confused by the terms &quot;gender,&quot; &quot;masculine&quot;, &quot;feminine&quot; etc. &quot;Gender&quot; originally <em>only</em> meant the grammatical category and had nothing to do with human beings. It was occasionally used (often humorously) to refer to people being male or female, and then, because &quot;sex&quot; stopped meaning just &quot;male or female&quot; but started being short for &quot;sexual intercourse&quot; and therefore being naughty, people started using &quot;gender&quot; to mean &quot;sex&quot; much more often. But this was in the early 20th century and way after &quot;gender&quot; had long been used more as a grammatical term, or a way to just say &quot;type.&quot;</p>
<p>I can't find anything about why &quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; were the words used to talk about two of the genders, when they were also used to talk about people's sex. In English, the grammatical term is attested first but I suspect this usage all goes back to Latin. Anyway my point is that you shouldn't read too much into the names for what words are and what people are being the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a linguist at all, but I've noticed it can be helpful for disambiguation.  Here are a couple of examples:</p>
<p>First, consider sentences like, &quot;Put the microwave on the conveyer belt, and then put the ball on it.&quot;  Does &quot;it&quot; refer to the conveyer belt, or the microwave?  It's actually unclear.  So instead of &quot;it&quot;, you would have to say &quot;the microwave&quot; or &quot;the conveyer belt&quot; at the end of the sentence, which adds several syllables and makes the sentence longer, and we're always searching for shorthand.</p>
<p>Now imagine that &quot;microwave&quot; were feminine and &quot;conveyer belt&quot; were masculine.  Then instead of &quot;it&quot;, you would be able to say &quot;her&quot; or &quot;him&quot;, and your meaning would be obvious.  So you'd be able to say a shorter sentence without making it more ambiguous.  If there are 3 genders, then it might be unambiguous 67% of the time by random chance.</p>
<p>Second, I've noticed (this is an information-theory type of answer) is that sometimes extra syllables (sentence context) can make it easier to understand someone's meaning.  Imagine someone says &quot;Hand me the ta-&quot; and you aren't sure if they said &quot;tap&quot; or &quot;tape&quot; or &quot;tab&quot;.  If the word &quot;the&quot; comes in one of three genders for each of the words, then you can more easily guess which one follows.  Stealing from German for a moment, imagine the words are &quot;der tap&quot;, &quot;die tape&quot;, &quot;das tab&quot;.  If someone says &quot;Hand me der ta-&quot; then you can be pretty sure they meant &quot;der tap&quot; and not &quot;das tab&quot;, from the context of the sentence.</p>
<p>So I'm not totally sure how that sort of thing would evolve, but I can see how it adds greater redundancy to sentence structure and makes it easier for people with different accents of the same language group to communicate.</p>
<p>Edit: Oops, I just noticed F0sh's answer was similar.  Check that one out too!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For romance languages, latin had neutral, masculine and femenine. Vulgar latin lost the neutral nouns, so all neutral nouns became, randomly, feminine or masculine. And it changes between languages. For example. From LACTEM, (milk), evolved the spanish word leche and the portuguese word leite. But leche is feminine and leite is masculine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
