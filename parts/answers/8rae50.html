<p>The tl;dr version is because the atmosphere is thinner on Mars storms and atmospheric disturbances can spread much further than they do on Earth. Also with it being such a dry, dusty place, it doesn't take a huge amount of energy to kick up a lot of dust. While it looks incredibly dramatic such storms would likely not have nearly as much effect as say a hurricane on Earth because of said thin atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air density is 1% of Earths. The dust is also very fine so it is easy to lift and propel with the heating of the ground. </p>
<p>This means that once something starts moving it is a lot harder for it to stop moving but it needs to be very light. If the wind is strong enough to resist gravity then it will keep going until the 1% of atmosphere slows to the point where dust can settle but due to lower gravity and air density once it starts moving the same amount of energy that moves in Earth Atmosphere can go an extreme distance further in Martian Atmosphere and encompass a much larger area.</p>
<p>This strongly relates to the one big scientific weakness in Weir's 'The Martian'. While storms can be huge and encompassing, you could walk through one and not really feel the wind inside your suit. The scary part of Martian storms for future Martians is the iron oxide dust ruining equipment and blocking sun light. (Don't fault Weir though, he knew the mistake before hand but needed a good story reason for the events and direness of Watney's situation.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello. I intern with the guy who wrote the report on that storm! It's really dependent on the thin atmosphere getting excited by small amounts of energy, a very dusty surface that's picked up easily, and the small size of the surface itself. The smaller size combined with the excitation means that thermal contrast created by the particulate matter in a storm in one circulation pattern can disrupt and temporarily override other, counteracting circulations, bringing the whole planet into one massive single weather pattern. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mars is now rising around 11:30 or 12 at night.  Interestingly, you can gauge the weather on Mars pretty well by naked eye from Earth--when Martian weather is good, Mars looks a reddish-orange color in the sky.  When a big dust storm kicks up Mars looks yellowish, no telescope needed.  Let's hope the storm settles down soon--Mars is moving toward the best opposition since the big one in 2003, in late July of this year.  A dust storm then will ruin seeing the planet at its best.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One interesting observation that came from the Voyager missions is that the less energy a planet receives from the sun the stronger its storms can become. This seems counter intuitive at first but more energy input means more disturbance. Simply but, a storm on Jupiter or even Uranus can become much more stable and grow larger then say on Earth. With Mars receiving less energy than Earth it's no surprise then that Martian storms get larger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
