		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What sort of information can you get from the surrounding rock about how the organism died? Can you also determine then how long a body might have been exposed before being buried? </p>
<p>I once heard a paleontologist say he loved looking at dead cows in a field since it gave clues to dinosaur fossils and how he finds them. He mentioned he likes to get as much of the surrounding rock as he can from around a fossil to learn more, but he didn't expand much into what can actually be determined from the surrounding rock around a fossil. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UTA geology student here! Thanks for doing this AMA, it's so great that this amazing site is receiving wider attention! What has changed at the site since Dr. Main was there and what newer finds have you all discovered? Will there be any more opportunities to work more closely with UTA in the future? </p>
<p>Additionally, I'm about to go to grad school for geomorphology but paleo was one of my favorite classes. What, if any, opportunities are there in the professional world for someone with an MS in a specialization outside of paleo? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
