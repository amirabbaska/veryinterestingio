		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a mountain range developed on a convergent plate boundary, the plate will be thicker here than in normal continental crust. A rifting zone would avoid these regions and open where else. But the gravitational collapse after a collision on a convergent plate boundary, as well as erosion, will reduce crust thickness. In &quot;old&quot; mountain ranges rifting zones may occur. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This sort of situation doesn't usually happen. When you get the sort of tectonic collision which forms mountain ranges, it involves a massive thickening of the crust which is much harder to rift than other, normal crust. There would also likely be a significant time gap between the mountain-building event and the rifting event, and the mountain range would be mostly eroded by the time of break-up.</p>
<p>That being said, it has happened occasionally. If you imagine the situation before the formation of the North Atlantic, the Atlas Mountains and the Appalachians were originally a continuous chain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geology student here, one example which might answer your questions:
The Appalachian mountains were formed similarly to the himilayas as two thick continental plates collided. Subsequently in earth's history, a huge split occurred in the Appalachians, along with the rest of unified Pangaea.</p>
<p>The mid-atlantic ridge is a diverging plate boundary that basically leaks the mantles liquid magma into the ocean, effectively creating new sea bed. Over millions of years this divergent plate boundary has created the Atlantic ocean, separating the Americas from Europe and Africa. </p>
<p>This divergent plate boundary rendered the converging faults in the Appalachians inactive, and they've weathered and eroded heavily over geologic time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earthquakes, rifts, landslides, mud flows, mass wasting etc will reduce the profile of the mountain. Then the whole mountain maybe submerged by the ocean if the plates do move for long enough time. We might even have hot plumes come up to the surface and form new ocean bed, along the trenches. Basically what is happening in the middle of the atlantic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
