		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because dead animals and plants sink in water. That might seem obvious, but it means that any nutrients in sea water are rapidly used up by animals and plants and when those organisms die they sink to the bottom taking the nutrients with them. The only way those lost nutrients can be replaced is if water from the ocean bottom, where all those dead organisms go, can be moved to the surface again. </p>
<p>That cycling can’t happen in warmer regions because the surface water is warm and warm water floats on the cold water of the ocean bottom. As a result warmer waters very rapidly become nutrient deficient. </p>
<p>Because they are nutrient deficient very little actually lives in tropical waters. Very few algae, very little plankton and so forth. And because nothing much lives in tropical waters they remain clear. That means that light can get go waayyy down into the depths, and as light passes through the water the blue wavelengths get scattered. That produces a vivid turquoise blue ocean. </p>
<p>In contrast cold waters are dirty and full of life due to the upwelling of water from the ocean bottom. All that dirt and all the life it supports absorbs sunlight very fast. Light will only penetrate a few meters in cold waters. With very little penetration the light also doesn’t have much chance to scatter. That produces an ocean that is very dark colored, and where the blue wavelengths are muted by the reds and greens to produce a muddy blue-gray. </p>
<p>So what it all comes down to is that tropical waters are clear, and they are clear because they are sterile and nutrient deficient. Coral reefs thrive in tropical waters precisely because they are clear and sterile and that allows enough sunlight for the photosynthetic symbiotic algae that live in the coral and that provide most of their food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optical oceanographer here!</p>
<p>There's really two things that light does in the water once it hits anything floating in it (or even the water itself!). When light gets absorbed, it effectively &quot;colors&quot; the water. You see all the other colors that don't get absorbed. The other thing is scattering, which makes the water seem more turbid/less clear.</p>
<p>You can sum up everything that colors the ocean into five groups:</p>
<p>Water: changes in the saltiness or the temperature will affect the scattering of light (and absorption if you could see in the infrared). </p>
<p>Bubbles: these highly scatter light and make the water seem white on windy days. </p>
<p>Algal particles: these are the phytoplankton! All combined, they equal primary production of every land plant. There are many many species, ranging in size from bacteria all the way up to visible diatoms. They absorb light like plants on land do, and, depending on their size, will scatter light as well. </p>
<p>Non-algal particles: this is the category for living or non-living particles that don't do photosynthesis. This can include sediment from rivers, dead plankton, fish, etc. They mostly just scatter light, and absorb higher in the blue than in the red. </p>
<p>CDOM: this stands for colored dissolved organic matter. Dissolved to us means that it goes through a 0.2 micron sized filter (1/5000th millimeter). I like to think of this as tea basically (technically tea is CDOM). You have this yellowish fluid leftover from leaves dissolving in the water (in the ocean's case, it comes from the algal particles above). </p>
<p>These five things interact to color the ocean in many different ways. We actually can model these to see how the biology, chemistry, and physics of the global ocean are changing! Then we apply them to ocean color satellites like Modis-Aqua or VIIRS to get a sense for how our oceans are changing over time!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with several factors. </p>
<p>1) the amount of light hitting the ocean. The closer to the equator you are the more light per square km you get in general (variances for time of year and what hemisphere). This is why the equator is warmer than the poles. </p>
<p>2) cloud cover can cause variances also</p>
<p>3) depth of the seabed. Shallow water, especially around islands or where the seabed doesn't drop off quickly. Shallow water means more light reflection off the seabed</p>
<p>4) composition of the seabed. Light colored sand reflects more light versus rock and plant matter.  Seaweed vs sand. </p>
<p>5) amount of organic matter in the water due to temperature, oxygen content, nutrients, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, then what about areas like the Gulf of Mexico, particularly the Gulf Coast of the U.S.?  Areas like near Bay St. Louis have relatively warm, shallow water, but it's all murky and muddy and brown.  Explain me please!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's to do with the depth, floor makeup and life in the ocean. The north Atlantic has more life and nutrients in the water and this absorbs more light than the Caribbean sea for example. This higher absorption of light results in darker and lighter oceans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
