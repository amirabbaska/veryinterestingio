Without the distinct patter at full strength, your brain won't fully interpret it.</p>
<p>Eli5: Your neurons are like muscles,  the more you use specific ones to hear a specific word, the more &quot;tired&quot; they get to repeated use. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>so as a speach therapist here is my answer.<br />
words are just funny sounding things. every word in every language is just a combination of sounds we can do.<br />
now the only reason why they dont sound funny all the time is because we as a species started giving meaning to the sounds. now if you say the same thing over and over again the meaning starts to fade and you are just left with the funny sounding noise coming out of you.<br />
if you try this you will find that words sound funny faster the more abstract their meaning is for the language. so saying &quot;the&quot; over and over again will sound funny faster than saying &quot;tree&quot; over and over again. both will sound funny eventually but &quot;the&quot; does not have a &quot;real world&quot; meaning for most people so it loses its meaning faster. (this last part is specualtion from me though)  </p>
<p>EDIT: I leave the typos. english is not my first language. eat your heart out trolls :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is called Semantic Satiation. In the brain, we have neural pathways that are responsible for recall of memory and also producing speech. When you repeat a word over and over, you are forcing your brain to use those same pathways (the ones associated with the “word” you are saying) over and over again. What happens when you use something over and over again? It gets tired, worn out. So it is harder and harder for your brain to access these pathways and you feel like the word is “losing meaning”</p>
