<p>do animals recognize rhythm?  so if i'm sitting on the couch with my dog, and we're both listening to music, we can both hear it.  my hand rests on his back, and i start tapping my fingers to the beat of the music.  does my dog recognize that the music and my finger tapping are connected/the same? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Have their been many studies done on ASMR? I'm curious about things like the prevalence and difference between people who claim the experience and people who do not.  I've only been able to find one or two pretty generic studies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How does a small birds survive freezing temperatures? Coupled with colder air at higher altitude, it seems like a sudden freeze would result in a lot of dead birds. Do they just huddle up and hope for a chance to get somewhere warmer? Do their feathers provide insulation like, per se, a squirrels fur? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1.) What happens to individual atoms when a material flexes or bends? Do their bond angles and bond lengths change at all?</p>
<p>2.) What would happen if we could enclose helium atoms inside another material? I don't mean in bonding, I mean like a cage of atoms surrounding a helium atom (I believe there's a name for such a configuration but I can't think of it). Would the material be lighter? Would it have any unusual properties?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
