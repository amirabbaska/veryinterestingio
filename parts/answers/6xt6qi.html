		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I finally understood this when I visited the <a href="http://nationalatomictestingmuseum.org" target="_blank">http://nationalatomictestingmuseum.org</a> in Las Vegas.
An atomic bomb is a source of intense heat, what we normally associate with the explosion is the expansion of the surrounding air. In an overly simplified explanation, if there is no air you only get heat but not an outward explosive force. Yes rocks vaporize and all that, but his is less of a factor.</p>
<p>In fact the area around the test device is keep in a vacuum, in the museum you can clearly see the vacuum vessel and vacuum pumps associated to maintain the neighboring area free of air and water. Water creates steam. It is important to keep water and things that can be vaporized away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Compacted earth is incredibly heavy, dense and strong.  According to <a href="http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/earth-soil-weight-d_1349.html" target="_blank">this site</a>, 1600 kg per cubic meter.  </p>
<p>&quot;Cannikan&quot; was the largest underground test in the US at 5 megatons (equivalent to 5 million tons of TNT, or about 240 times more powerful than &quot;fat man&quot; which was dropped on Nagasaki.  It was placed in a shaft 6,150 feet deep (nearly 1900 meters).  </p>
<p>So essentially, imagine a rock wall 6150 feet thick, and even something as powerful as a nuclear bomb has its work cut out for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An underground nuclear test is essentially a bomb in a deep hole or mine shaft. It goes boom, a portion of the surrounding ground is vaporized, and a lot more is superheated. If the hole is deep enough (it should be, as we've done this sort of thing for a while) all the radioactivity and the blast is contained underground. Kind of like having a tiny balloon pop in your hands. The noise is muffled, the rubber doesn't go anywhere, and everything is cool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Underground nuclear tests are performed by buttering the bomb deep underground. Larger bomb tests, such as the one North Korea just performed, cause earthquakes and significantly deform the land around the test site.
