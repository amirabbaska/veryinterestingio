		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Colorado and Washington are not so much legalizing marijuana as removing state laws that make it illegal.  States aren't required to enforce federal laws, and in many cases, like immigration, are discouraged from doing so.  Marijuana remains illegal on the federal level, but the feds lack the resources and the inclination to go after state level operations.</p>
<p>Abortion is legal, not due to federal law, but a supreme court ruling on the constitution, that covers all federal, state, and municipal laws.  Any law passed contrary to this is unconstitutional.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The federal government prohibits the sale of pot in interstate commerce.  This is a federal criminal law based on Congress's ability to regulate commerce among the states.<br />
Just like a police officer can choose not to pull you over if you're going 56 mph in a 55 mph zone, federal law enforcement officers can choose not to enforce the criminal laws.  Of course, the police officers could enforce that law if they wanted, and if circumstances change they may (a new sheriff, increased fatalities on a particular stretch of road because of speeding, or even the weather making the road more dangerous).</p>
<p>Just like my 55 mph example, the FBI and DOJ have been instructed not to enforce federal criminal laws related to marijuana in the states that have legalized its sale, so long as a number of safeguards are in place.  That all could change tomorrow, and the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that the federal government does have the right to charge folks criminally for drug laws even when their state has legalized the drug (because the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution makes federal laws superior to state laws, when Congress has the authority to act, and when the laws conflict).</p>
<p>The right to an abortion isn't a federal law -- it's a right guaranteed by the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  This is an individual right-- just like the right to free speech, to bear arms, and not to be searched without a warrant.  Like those other constitutional rights, Congress, and the states can put reasonable restrictions (no gun possession for felons, no speech that incites riots, searches incident to arrests) but can't pass a law that says &quot;No one can own a gun; no one can criticize our governor; officers can search your house whenever they want.&quot;</p>
<p>If Alabama prohibited all abortions, an individual would challenge that in court, saying their individual rights were violated and the law was unconstitutional, and the court would agree and prohibit the law from taking effect. It doesn't matter what Congress would want, or what the President would want.  The abortion right (for now, at least) exists in the constitution and is guaranteed to individuals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While most of the responses on this have been correct in terms of the power of the SCOTUS and the Supreme Clause, but I think one thing that hasn't been discussed that would be quite important is being able to show judicial standing.</p>
<p>Standing is the legal term for a person to have the capacity to bring a case to court.  In order to show standing, you have to show that you have somehow been damaged by the governments action/inaction (Note, Have been, not will be.  The damage generally needs to have actually happened).  So, lets look at these two items: Not enforcing a Marijuana federal standard, and outlawing an abortion.</p>
<p>Marijuana: By the feds declining to enforce a federal standard (Which is within the power of the Executive branch, they have the power of priority), you haven't taken away a person's right.  If you don't smoke, there is no change to your rights (You didn't smoke before, you don't smoke now), and if you do, you have been given expanded rights, so no infringement there.  Therefore, it would be VERY difficult for a person to show standing to even start a case to force the Feds to enforce said laws.</p>
<p>Abortion: Here, it's different.  Here the Feds say it's okay and the State says it is not. The moments that State forbids you from having the abortion, you are able to show direct harm from the states actions (Being forced to take the pregnancy to full term, the money required to have a child and the care around it, etc etc.).  By showing direct harm, you have now shown that you have Judicial Standing to bring a case against the State for a violation of the rights given to you by the Federal government.  Which means you can take the case to court and they would be obligated to rule on it (For or against, doesn't matter in this instance, but they would be obligated to rule).</p>
<p>A rule of thumb on these sort of things is the States can go above a federal standard, but they can never go below.  Since the feds in the Marijuana issue are deciding non-enforcement (Thus, there is no rule at this moment), the States can work above that level of rule (Whatever they decide, but it's above the level that the Feds have enforced).  But, with abortion, since the Feds have stated a minimum level of a right, a state can't go below that.  By doing so, they would give immediate standing to anyone denied that federal right and I would expect a challenge either from the first person that gets standing, or in some instances, a group that gets standing simply by showing that the violation is so large and imminent that standing is given by the court to represent.</p>
<p>So there you go.. hopefully a ELI5 on Standing, and how that would be the first thing that would come up if someone decided to move on these two items. =)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Roe v. Wade was a Supreme Court decision in 1973 that made it unconstitutional for states to altogether outlaw abortion.  Thus, any law passed in contravention of Roe v. Wade is unconstitutional and unenforceable.  The only thing remotely resembling this in re marijuana was Gonzales v. Raich, which held that the federal government has the power under the Commerce Clause of the Constitution to prohibit the growing and use of marijuana in any state and to enforce that prohibition even in states where marijuana is legal, BUT, they can't make the states do their dirty work and enforce their laws,  nor can they stop states from legalizing marijuana inside their own boundaries.  So, the Feds could still come to Colorado and arrest a Coloradan sitting on his front steps smoking a J, but they can't force the Boulder Police to do the arresting.  They could butt in if state laws were in direct contravention of the Controlled Substances Act (the big drug law), like if state officials started growing and selling marijuana themselves, but short of that, the feds really can't do shit, nor do I really think they would- not worth the time and $.  Also, not trying to pick on Kouhoutek, but he's wrong- Colorado and Washington definitely legalized marijuana in their respective states.  There's a difference between decriminalization and legalization, and they did the latter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
