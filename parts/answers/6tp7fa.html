		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll tackle the &quot;why first&quot;.  So, a computer needs to be able to take input and give you output.  Whether that's deciding what is 2+2 or what it should display on screen.  Thus, we need a device that translates input to output <em>automatically</em> using electricity.</p>
<p>I'll use a MOSFET transistor as an example, as it is arguably the simplest.  There is voltage at one end (power) and ground at the other (somewhere for power to go), but the current flow is blocked by the magic of &quot;chemistry&quot;.  There is an input node <em>next to</em> the path we just discussed.  It isn't on the path, it's just reeeaally close by, separated by a small space.  When you give that node a positive voltage (input), the pathway unlocks, and the current can flow from the high voltage to ground.  </p>
<p>Now, how do we use this awesome little device?  Well, you can take a little wire of copper and connect it to the pathway from before just a little bit above the ground node, and run it to a dead end at the input node of a different transistor.  This means your first transistor's output will determine the next transistors input.  You have now created a digital IF...THEN condition.  &quot;If this happens, then that happens.&quot;</p>
<p>Instead of connecting the bottom of a transistor to ground, you can connect it to the &quot;power&quot; node of a different transistor, such that the 2nd is inactive until you give input to the 1st one.  Now you have 2 switches that interact with each other based on two sets of input.</p>
<p>Mix and match these combos of transistors and you can build &quot;logic gates&quot;.  AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.  These transistor networks give a single output based on the combinations of 2+ input.</p>
<p>AND: If Bob and Terry want to get dinner, then you will go with them.  But if only 1 of them (or neither) wants to go, you won't bother.</p>
<p>OR: If either, or both, of Bob and Terry want dinner, you will go.  You just don't want to go alone.</p>
<p>These logic gates can then be wired together to make more complex things like number adders and decision trees.  At that point, you can now control numbers and IF, THEN conditions, so programming is now possible.  Hop, skip, jump, and you're at your smartphone.</p>
<p>Hope that's a coherent overview.  Source: Electrical Engineering graduate, 2012.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the gold /u/the_cosworth!  I tried to keep the explanation ELI5-appropriate, but for those wanting more details, there are some great EE explanations in comment chain below this.  They go into Bipolar Transistors, explain some of the alternate uses of transistors beyond a simple switch, etc.  There's also some linked videos in the comment chain below that are excellent little classes on the finer points.  Visuals help a ton.  I'll try to drop a comment about the &quot;magic of chemistry&quot; in a bit if anyone still wants to know that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others did Why to death (e.g. quite well) but I'm going to give a stab at the How.</p>
<p>(TL;DR :: A transistor lets one wire &quot;act like a knob&quot; to control how much power goes through another wire.)</p>
<p>So you know how they say atoms are &quot;mostly empty space&quot;? Well there are these particles that are really small (protons, electrons, neutrons) but they claim a lot of space around them. All of physics and mechanical science and such is about those &quot;claims&quot; and how they interact.</p>
<p>What do I mean by claim? You can get very close to a small fire, and even wave your hand through a candle flame, but if you build a great big bonfire there's so much heat that you can't get close. Indeed, if your fire is too big you end up standing out in the cold because the margin between close enough to be warm and too close to be comfortable becomes unworkable.</p>
<p>So particles claim space that's larger than themselves. One of their primary effective claims is &quot;charge&quot;. We talk about positive and negative charges. It turns out that those words &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; are pretty much arbitrary. (Many argue that when Ben Franklin assigned the words he got them backwards, but that's another topic for another day.)</p>
<p>So an atom is some number of protons (positive charges) glued together by neutrons if there is more than one because, um, that's how it works. (e.g. we really don't know why, at the ELI5 level, neutrons are necessary.) And for every proton the atom wants one matching electron. This is because plus and minus attract and want to make a big zero.</p>
<p>On the other hand, physics demands that there be circles (or really &quot;clouds&quot;) of electrons around every lump of positive stuff if you want that lump to be stable and happy. The first circle needs to be two electrons, then all the rest of the circles need to be eight. Why eight? Why the exception for two? More stuff that's true with no good ELI5 reason.</p>
<p>That conflict, the push-pull between one-plus-one-minus and two-or-eight is how all of chemistry works. When you see a molecule described, like water, H2O, it might be drawn as H-O-H. The little minuses are pairs of electrons, one from each of the neighboring letters. H, hydrogen, is one proton, so it has one electron, which is not two, so it borrows an electron from the Oxygen so its circle/cloud is two. Oxygen is eight positives, so it has eight electrons. It's inner cloud uses two so it's outer cloud has six, which is not eight. So it borrows an electron from each of the two hydrogens.</p>
<p>But wait! The hydrogen each borrowed one to make two, and the oxygen borrows two, so What the actual fark, amiright?</p>
<p>The electrons are very fast, so they just leap back and forth, doing double duty. So that line is a very hard, very real connection.  It's like cheating, but it's allowed. Like being stuck doing both the grill and the chili at a barbecue.</p>
<p>And that's basic chemistry.</p>
<p>Now silicon (and other things like it) are &quot;Semiconductors&quot;. They aren't good conductors, and they are not bad conductors, they are just so-so. And so &quot;semi&quot;. Meh. (Note that &quot;meh&quot; here is relative. Silicon is <em>much</em> better conductor than air or plastic, but things like gold and copper are just way, way better.)</p>
<p>And if we looked at a perfect crystal of silicon we'd see a very ordered set of lines. And being all pure like that it barely conducts electricity at all (compared to say copper). That's because each electron is exactly doing it's job.</p>
<p>So we take that pure silicon and &quot;dope it&quot;. We force it to accept some non-silicon atoms. Those atoms have just one too many, or one too few protons, which means there are one too many or one too few electrons.</p>
<p>So the resultant block has too many or too few electrons. Too many and the block is negative, Too few and the block is positive. Too many and it &quot;has electrons (it can share)&quot;. Too few and it &quot;has holes (that can accept electrons)&quot;. Either way, there's now more wiggle room for the electrons to literally skitter around and the silicon is a much better conductor than if every electron has its best spot.</p>
<p>So what happens when we mash two of those lumps, one positive and one negative, together?</p>
<p>Well the positive part &quot;borrows&quot; the electrons from the negative part and it's happy but its now back to being crappy at letting electrons through... in one direction.</p>
<p>There's the magic!</p>
<p>If I keep putting electrons on the negative side, it can keep lending them to the positive side, and I can suck them out of the far part of the positive side.</p>
<p>But if I put electrons into the positive part I just make it even more impossible for the electrons to move around.</p>
<p>It's weird, but that's a &quot;Diode&quot;.</p>
<p>Now when that two-part lump is sitting there it's inherently a match of plus and minus. And when I run electrons in part, and suck them out of the other part, the total amount of plusiness and minusiness of the whole block changes.</p>
<p>So I can take that diode and add a <em>third</em> block of stuff that's even <em>more</em> plussy or minusy than the first two. As long as I put it on the far side of the &quot;same kind of stuff&quot;. Bu that I mean I can do &quot;Positive - negative - positive&quot; or &quot;Negative - positive - negative&quot;. It's got to be three layers and one has to be &quot;stronger&quot; than the other two, hence the capital letter.</p>
<p>So after I make this three layer sandwich, when I suck electrons out of the center (in the Npn case) or add electrons to the center (in the Pnp) case, there's that diode between the capital letter and the center doing the normal diode thing.</p>
<p>But now the second magic bit.</p>
<p>As the center gets more electrons added/removed the two ends with the same doping become able to &quot;see each other&quot;.</p>
<p>Understand that a &quot;Pp&quot; or an &quot;Nn&quot; block of silicon will just pass the electrons on after wasting some of the energy as heat.</p>
<p>So as you feed the interruption in the middle the electrons start to be able to go all the way through.</p>
<p>The more you stimulate the middle, the more electricity can get from end-to-end.</p>
<p>If you stimulate the middle &quot;enough&quot; it's like the middle piece was just removed.</p>
<p>So what does that practically mean?</p>
<p>At low currents a transistor is an amplifier. Put a little power on the center and a <em>proportionally</em> larger power can flow from end-to-end.</p>
<p>At higher currents, known as the &quot;saturation current&quot;, the transistor becomes an on-off switch.</p>
<p>So the transistors in your radio amplify the tiny signals received over the air into the big signals necessary to move your speakers and make sound.</p>
<p>And the transistors in your computer, being operated at saturation, can do &quot;logic&quot; because by using switches in groups you do that AND/OR/NOT stuff.</p>
<p>Finally, the smaller a transistor is, they less energy needs to be put on that center part, and the less heat is generated as the electricity flows from N-to-n or P-to-p.</p>
<p>So big honking transistors can operate real-world things (your stereo) and lots of tiny transistors can become a phone or a computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A transistor is a fast, reliable, and miniaturizable device allowing electricity to control itself. There are different types which work somewhat differently, but the basic operation is that there are two terminals plus a control terminal. In operation the current between the two main terminals is controlled by the voltage on the control terminal. The most basic use is as an amplifier: a small signal on the control terminal can control a large current, for example to transform the signal from the needle on a record player to something that can be fed to a loudspeaker. Things get better when you allow a process to feed back on itself. For example if you apply a phase shifted version of the voltage on one of the main terminals to the control you get an oscillator, so can build radio transmitters, for example. If you have a whole bunch of transistors you can do a simple computation on some set of inputs, each input being high or low voltage (representing <code>0" or</code>1&quot;). If you can do simple computations, you can take the output and periodically feed it back as input to the same circuit. You then have a computer.</p>
<p>There are other devices that can similarly allow circuits to control themselves. For example vacuum tubes can in many ways be nicer for radios and such. But vacuum tubes are big, complex, and have a filament that burns out rapidly and breaks under mechanical stress. The size also causes speed limitations. Relays are great for designing computers with, but are also big, slow, and expensive with moving parts to wear out. Transistors on the other hand are produced by chemically altering a solid piece of semiconductor. They are shockproof, and don't have fragile or moving parts. They can be tiny and can be mass produced. The last point is a huge understatement, since now we build millions on the same piece of semiconductor, so you can have thousands of times the computing power of a building full of vacuum tubes in an inexpensive chip smaller than your fingernail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to think of a transistor is like an electronic switch. You can turn off the flow of current by applying a much smaller current to the transistor.</p>
<p>So imagine the flow of current in a circuit like cars on the street. The transistor is a stop light. When the light is green, the cars can flow. When the light is red, they stop.</p>
<p>Because electricity wants to keep flowing, with multiple transistors you can control the flow of electricity and use it to perform simple (or not so simple!) tasks. Imagine a circuit with two transistors. You could set it up so that if one transistor is on, a light lights up, and if both are on, two lights light up. Now you've made an extremely simple calculator that can only do 1+1.</p>
<p>Modern electronics are built off of the Integrated Circuit, which is actually thousands and thousands of extremely tiny transistors on a silicon chip. So imagine my silly little two transistor circuit. If you had many more transistors, you could make it do all kinds of things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some comments here have addressed what task the transistor performs but it is not just the transistor that can perform these operations. We have other components that can perform the same task but they can't be shrunk. Computer circuitry is actually immensely complicated. It has to be shrunk down to a microscopic level to be capable of the sophisticated computations of the modern era while still fitting in one room. The transistor is a device that we can make at a very small size. Before transistors we had vacuum tubes and before them, relays. They were used to do essentially the same thing but those parts are far bigger and less reliable than a transistor. Vacuum tubes also get too hot, another one of several disadvantages. If we tried to build a modern desktop computer with vacuum tubes or relays, it wouldn't fit in your house. Being able to built a massive circuit with parts that are smaller than a blood cell is a big reason why transistors are seen as crucial to the existence of modern computational capabilities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
