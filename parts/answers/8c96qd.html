<p>Essentially, 40 mph. At that point, too much force is shocking the muscles, breaking them. And the brain will shut down from too much energy exertion</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a number to give you, but yes. There are several factors i can think of:</p>
<p>How much stress the human foot and your bones can take before breaking would be the final limiting factor.</p>
<p>If your leg/for muscles can't reach that number, then whatever the max possible force your muscles could generate would be another limiting factor.</p>
<p>How far you can lean forward while running, maintaining your balance, and not eating shit would be another factor. I don't have the words for this, but leaning forward is directly related to Sprint speed and you can only lean forward so far before the friction of concrete will hold your face real still :). That would be the last major limiting factor i can think of.</p>
<p>But yeah, mostly physics and bodily limitations keep our top speed in the low 20s (and that's pretty impressive!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
