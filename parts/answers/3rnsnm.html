<p><strong>What does it mean for the people in those countries?</strong></p>
<p>The TPP does very little more than a normal trade deal.  The most developed nations above (US, Japan, Chile, Peru, Canada, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore, and Australia) will see little to no change whatsoever.  The main difference will come in the governmental approaches to certain parts of the business world, like trademarks, copyrights, patents, and some aspects to the legal world such as increased penalties for piracy.</p>
<p>For the less developed nations on this list (Brunei, Malaysia, and Vietnam), you will see the markets flooded with products from the other nine nations, a larger international corporate presence, and an increase in manufacturing factories for hire, as seen in China, by small businesses around the world.  This is on top of the changes to the more developed nations above.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>What are the important sections of the TPP and what do they mean?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chapter 9: Investment</strong></p>
<p>This section puts forward economic plans to be carries forward by parties of the agreement in other countries of the agreement.  This also pushes for more investment agreements in the future.  Finally, this section goes to limit the parties of the TPP from playing favorites by treating companies from its own country better than companies from other countries.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 12: Temporary Entry for Business Persons</strong></p>
<p>Although seemingly not important, having a requirement for the parties of this agreement to keep borders open to business people from around the world is a small, but great, stepping stone to strengthening border relations between countries.  Something so simple can mean so much, diplomatically.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 14: Electronic Commerce</strong></p>
<p>This is a huge section in this agreement.  E-Commerce is rarely addressed in international agreements right now, so this is one of the first.  Not much is accomplished in the nine pages of this chapter, but the steps are set up in the future to expand business ties in the E-Commerce sector.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 16: Competition Policy</strong></p>
<p>This section goes to set up laws outlawing anticompetitive business conduct.  The Competition Policy chapter is essentially the US antitrust field's baby due to the smaller size of anticompetitive laws in the section, but similar goal/purpose.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 17: State-Owned Enterprises and Designated Monopolies</strong></p>
<p>Chapter 17 forces governments to treat all companies operating within the free market equally.  This chapter focuses on making sure governments do not favor businesses of which the government holds a stake in (like Amtrak in the US).  This is very big when we are dealing with developing economies, because developing economies often favor state-owned enterprises or companies given monopolies (like power companies in the US).</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 18: Intellectual Property</strong></p>
<p>Essentially extends US intellectual properties to other countries.  The biggest parts to this chapter are the terms of copyright and the new trade mark rules:</p>
<p><em>Copyright</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) on the basis of the life of a natural person, the term shall be not less than the life of the author and 70 years after the authorâ€™s death;74 and  </p>
<p>(b)  on a basis other than the life of a natural person, the term shall be:  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>(i) not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the first authorized publication 75 of the work, performance or phonogram; or  </p>
<p>(ii) failing such authorized publication within 25 years from the creation of the work, performance or phonogram, not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the creation of the work, performance or phonogram.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Trademark</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each Party shall provide that initial registration and each renewal of registration of a trademark is for a term of no less than 10 years.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Chapter 19: Labo(u)r</strong></p>
<p>Forces countries to allow for the right to collective bargaining, the removal of forced or compulsory labo(u)r, abolition of child labo(u)r, elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation, and the requirement of countries to have acceptable conditions of work with respect to minimum wages, hours of work, and occupational safety and health.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 20: Environment</strong></p>
<p>Pushes for member nations to be more environmentally friendly.  I'm going to keep this one light because the 25 pages in the TPP have lots of details that I can't really paraphrase easily.</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 26: Transparency and Anti-Corruption</strong></p>
<p>Pushes to make governmental actions more transparent, and pushes for governments to be anti-corrupt to be in accordance with the trade deal and not face international trade sanctions of any sort.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Other major parts to the TPP</strong></p>
<p><strong>Increase scrutiny on ISDS cases of all sorts</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>RECOGNISE their inherent right to regulate and resolve to preserve the flexibility of the Parties to set legislative and regulatory priorities, safeguard public welfare, and protect legitimate public welfare objectives, such as public health, safety, the environment, the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural resources, the integrity and stability of the financial system and public morals</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few highlights of the TPP:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Lower tariffs generally (good for consumers and export-oriented producers, bad for industries that compete heavily with imports)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signatories agree to enforce intellectual property restrictions for a longer period of time (good for pharmaceutical industry, bad for consumers of generic drugs. Internet freedom activists have also criticized the TPP for its potential to entrench and expand US copyright law)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It weakens protectionism in the auto industry, like the North American content rules (bad for US auto industry, good for Japan)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It enhances labor mobility so it is easier to move within TPP countries </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It includes labor rights clauses, restricting child labor, forced labor, etc. (this will prevent people from challenging labor laws as protectionist measures, and may raise the standards of some developing country signatories slightly)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ends some forms of agricultural protectionism in Japan and Canada (bad for Canadian dairy farmers and some Japanese farmers, good for consumers and producers elsewhere). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also contains an environmental chapter, which has received more criticism than the labor rights chapter as far as I've seen. </p>
</li>
<li>It will establish an investor-state dispute mechanism (some critics argue this will elevate corporations and enable them to undermine national sovereignty, while defenders point out that most trade agreements have such provisions, and the TPP has included an opt-out for tobacco regulations, after the Australian experience). </li>
</ol>
<p>The TPP will likely boost GDP among the 12 prospective signatories (US, Canada, Mexico, Vietnam, Brunei, Singapore, Japan, Malaysia, Peru, Chile, Australia and New Zealand). But the gains range widely. Because the US is already a large diversified economy, its projected gains from trade are smaller - only about $78 billion. Vietnam, in contrast, is projected to see an 11% boost to GDP. </p>
<p>Of course, not everybody stands to gain equally. Consumers gain pretty unambiguously from having a greater access to cheaper goods. Workers in some industries stand to lose as they face greater competition abroad, while others stand to gain from access to new markets. </p>
<p>In some countries, however, there are provisions in place to help those displaced by trade treaties. The US has Trade Adjustment Assistance, for instance. And in the Canadian election, Stephen Harper pledged billions to the auto and dairy industry (though it is up to Trudeau as to whether he follows through). </p>
<p>Some of the other implications of the treaty are harder to sort out in a balance sheet type manner. There may be geopolitical implications, as the US strengthens trade ties with many ASEAN countries, plus Japan. The treaty may pose risks to the environment. And certainly for consumers of generic drugs, this is probably not a good treaty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most, if not all, of the rights normal people enjoy are talked about in the treaty, but nobody can really do anything about them, because the rights people have are not enforceable, that is, their aren't any punishments for violating, or ignoring those rights.  The whims of nations and corporations have strict, unavoidable, punishments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you dig deeper, you'll notice that all of the provisions that recognize the rights of the public are non-binding, whereas almost everything that benefits rightsholders is binding. That paragraph on the public domain, for example, used to be much stronger in the first leaked draft, with specific obligations to identify, preserve and promote access to public domain material. All of that has now been lost in favor of a feeble, feel-good platitude that imposes no concrete obligations on the TPP parties whatsoever.  <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/10/final-leaked-tpp-text-all-we-feared" target="_blank">1</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If a person put a wax lock on a box, nobody would be surprised when someone opened the box by scraping off the lock.  When a nation or a corporation puts a wax lock on a box, criminal charges and enormous fines are mandated.  Sharing knowledge about how to scrape off a wax lock, even if a person has never scraped off a wax lock, carries additional harsh punishments.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The odd effect of this is that someone tinkering with a file or device that contains a copyrighted work can be made liable (criminally so, if wilfullness and a commercial motive can be shown), for doing so even when no copyright infringement is committed. Although the TPP text does allow countries to pass exceptions that allow DRM circumvention for non-infringing uses, such exceptions are not mandatory, as they ought to be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, if you scrape off a wax lock and publish an instructable about it, all computers, tablets, phones, odd bits of wood, decks of cards, musical instruements, and other devices capable of scraping wax off a surface, or publishing the instructions on how to scrape off a wax lock can be taken away from you and destroyed.  No good explanation is provided for this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the scariest parts of the TPP is that not only can you be made liable to fines and criminal penalties, but that any materials and implements used in the creation of infringing copies can also be destroyed (QQ.H.4(12)). The same applies to devices and products used for circumventing DRM or removing rights management information (QQ.H.4(17)). Because multi-use devices such as computers are used for a diverse range of purposes, this is once again a disproportionate penalty. This could lead to a family's home computer becoming seized simply because of its use in sharing files online, or for ripping Blu-Ray movies to a media center.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I could go on, but this is buried.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was hoping NPR or another news station would've given the ELI5 version by now, but I haven't seen anything. Maybe someone who understands the language used in such agreements and has had the patience to have gone through it will respond. Good question, I'll be checking back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reddit is going to say its the Apocalypse and its all doom and gloom, but the reality is that this trade agreement involves about 40% of the world's population.  Think about how many consumers that involves.  If we didn't get into this, do people here actually think countries like China wouldn't?  We'd be locked out of a massive market.  Trade, no matter how much it has been demonized by some is a <em>good</em> thing.  We here in the US live in a very mature economy - most everyone that needs a car, already has a car.  Same with computers, phones, clothes and almost any other consumer good.  There is growth, but not the kind you'd see in up-and-coming nations.  We <em>need</em> to be a part of that.  No, we'll never been a lowest-cost producer, but we excel at making higher-tech industrial/commercial products and services which is where the profit margins are at.</p>
<p>So that is one part of the trade agreement.  </p>
<p>Another is it forces certain countries to improve their human rights.  One of the reasons that labor in other countries is as cheap as it is, is because they don't have the safety and environmental protections that we do in the 1st world.  You start tacking on those costs onto their typically lower productivity and US labor rates start looking far more competitive.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/06/business/international/trans-pacific-trade-deal-tpp-vietnam-labor-rights.html" target="_blank">Vietnam already stated that it will agree to US' terms on labor rights because of the TPP</a>.  China is already starting to see its labor costs increase because more and more of its people are finally entering the middle class and now expect more of the rights and protections that other countries have had for decades.  We are trying to force a similar type of minor revolution in other nations in this trade pact.  </p>
<p>I realize that conspiracy theorists are going to claim that its going to kill all our jobs and then kill the environment, but if managed well, it has the potential to raise a huge percentage of the world's people up out of poverty and closer to the living standards that we enjoy in the US in the long run.  With that, our own industries have the potential to be stronger and jobs here in the US could actually improve as the ultra-low wages in those countries become slightly higher low wage jobs and thus less attractive for outsourcing.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
