		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A needle is shaped so that the flesh goes around the needle, not through it. The front of a hypodermic needle is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypodermic_needle" target="_blank">'beveled'</a>, which means it has a slanted shape. You put the pointy side to the skin when you go in, and it separates the tissue so it doesn't go into the hollow part of the needle. It also (usually) makes it less painful as it pierces less nerves on its way through.</p>
<p>It's kinda hard to explain, but very simple when you take a look at the cross-section.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former syringe  production plant maintenance supervisor here </p>
<p>I worked for Terumo before</p>
<p>The needle/catheters are immersed in a chemical lubricant to make them slide easily making them less painful </p>
<p>Also we randomly sample each batch of needles to a pain test machine to determine if it will be painful </p>
<p>Also the tip of the needle is bevelled to lessen the surface area being penetrated by the needle this prevents tissues from clogging the needles </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of good answers here but I have to say, sometimes they do.</p>
<p>I donate a lot of blood. I noticed when they take a blood donation they go through a lot more sterilization compared to when I get an immunization. </p>
<p>I asked about this and the nurse told me it was not for my benefit but for that of the recipient. Sometimes the needle makes a skin plug that ends up in the donation so they want the skin to be as sterile as possible to avoid contamination of the donation. This is even with a beveled needle though they are kind of large.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hypodermic needles have a beveled tip. This effectively means that the hole on the needle points in a different direction to which the needle is cutting. The shape of the bevel cuts the tissue and pushes it away from the hole.</p>
<p>Some needles are designed to plug up with tissue, and these are used to take a sample of organ tissue, and these have a hole at the front edge and a straight cut and sharpened tip. You insert the needle onto the organ, the needle plugs up, and you twist the needle to break off the plug, pull the needle out and push a rod down the needle to extract the plug. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because the needle is beveled.  So there is actually a right and wrong way to insert a needle.  If you were to insert a needle bevel side down, it would be a lot more painful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
