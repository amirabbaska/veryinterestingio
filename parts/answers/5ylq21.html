		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two things that go into why a material can have a mirror finish.  First, is whether light that hits it reflects straight back or gets scattered in many different directions.  Smooth surfaces scatter less of the reflected light, and will be shinier than rough surfaces.</p>
<p>Any material can be polished.*  Polishing is just making the surface smoother.  Generally, the smoother a surface, the shinier it looks.  </p>
<p>So the real question is, why are smooth metal surfaces extremely shiny and other materials not so shiny?</p>
<p>The second part of the story is that light is reflected any time it encounters a boundary between two materials with different indexes of refraction.  The bigger the difference in the index of refraction, the more light gets reflected.</p>
<p>For visible light, metals have very large indices of refraction.  The huge difference in the index of refraction between the metal and air can result easily in over 90% of light being reflected.</p>
<p>Explaining why metals have such high indices of refraction for light is a little more complicated.   Metals have lots of free electrons that can move around inside them (that's why they conduct electricity).   All these electrons interact strongly with the electric field of light.</p>
<p>Things like wood and plastic do not have many free electrons so they don't interact nearly as strongly with light.  For example, when travels through air and hits a glass surface, only about 4% of the light will be reflected.</p>

<li>It turns out that it's a lot easier to polish a metal than it is to polish wood.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is one of the properties that metallic elements have. Shine, the capability of being polished, being ductile (capable of being drawn out into threads or wires), being a heat and electricity conductor are all part of the same characteristic: metallic character.</p>
<p>This is dictated by the way a metal's electrons behave, among some other factors.</p>
<p>When a bunch of atoms of the same metal react they form what it is known as a Sea of Electrons. Something like <a href="http://chemistry-batz.wikispaces.com/file/view/metal.e-structure.JPG/473394092/metal.e-structure.JPG" target="_blank">this</a>. Electrons tend to be delocalized in this situation, meaning that instead of orbiting their respective atoms they are &quot;loose&quot; between the metal's atoms, like water drops in the sea, forming a sea of electrons. This is what gives metals their characteristics. Light can't penetrate the surface because of the &quot;sea&quot;, so it is reflected thus metals are shiny. This also makes them good conductors of electricty as electrons move freely unlike in wood, for example.</p>
<p>Now, why isn't wood or plastic shiny? It's because of the way their atoms react to each other, too. Those two are or come from organic matter, that is usually made up from nonmetals like Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Nytrogen and others. They can have metals on their structure but not in a way that their atoms form a &quot;Sea of electrons&quot; or anything of that kind. The structures formed by these elements are very big compared to simpler molecules (like H2O) and are highly complex too. Basically, light is absorbed by these compounds instead of reflecting it. One of the main reasons is their electrons are not &quot;freely moving between atoms&quot; but have more specific arrangements and positions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lack of internal structure. The metalic bond in metals and the &quot;amorphic solid&quot; nature of glass are ideal for polishing because of what polishing actually is...</p>
<p>A scientist (who's name I don't remember) realized from his work as a lens grinder that &quot;polishing&quot; is just making finer and finer scratches, closer and closer together until you basically overwhelm the materials ability to &quot;record&quot; the individual scratches (well enough to matter).</p>
<p>So metals, things engaged in &quot;metallic bonds&quot;, largely consist of free-floating atoms awash in a sea of the electrons they've given up to the whole mass. So something that is all metalic bonds can be easily reshaped by the very focused pressures of a series of finer and finer &quot;grit&quot;, first of a rasp, then a &quot;sand paper&quot; and then a &quot;polishing compound&quot;. Basically, at the finest levels, individual atoms are getting pushed around (or, well, maybe clusters, where the clusters deform into individual motion). So metals can be polished very, very well.</p>
<p>Second only to metals is glass. Its lack of fixed internal structure means that, while whole (covalently bonded) molecules have to be shoved around or peeled off, the resulting &quot;minimum deformity&quot; is the size of any one of those molecules and/or the spaces into which it can be forced.</p>
<p>Plastic is much more difficult to polish because it has larger polymer molecules which leave much bigger pits behind when they are displaced. It's possible, and even every-day common, to polish &quot;the right kind of plastic&quot;, such as acrylics. That's what most &quot;eye glasses&quot; are made of these days. Real glass is heavy, fragile, and expensive for something that's become as disposable as plastic over the last thirty years. (But when I was a child in the seventies, virtually all glasses were glass because plastics was still a pretty primitive era.)</p>
<p>When we get to something hugely structural, like wood, all bets are off. The difference between the cellulose inter-cellular matrix and the soft liquid cell centers... and the arrangements of grain and the differing growth segments and all that relatively huge stuff means that as you sand and polish you reach a point where the abrasive starts breaking the structure instead of scratching it. You are gouging out whole cell structures or even groups of cells. The different moisture contents, hardnesses, and connective tissues just aren't consistent enough to get that smooth.</p>
<p>Now don't get me wrong. There are some impressively well polished wood structures. They've often been impregnated with oil or wax, and they are usually made from very dense and hard woods (not to be confused with &quot;hardwoods&quot;... balsa wood is a &quot;hardwood&quot; but it isn't a hard wood) to begin with.</p>
<p>(ASIDE: Hardwoods versus Softwoods is about the seeds of the trees not the flesh of the wood.)</p>
<p>Now something with an internal structure isn't always bad. Diamonds, and most other crystals, can be polished quite nicely despite their internal structure. That's because their internal structure is very regular. A skilled craftsman knows the &quot;grain&quot; of the structures of such materials and knows how to work variously with and against the grains to create the desired effects.</p>
<p>So basically, things with internal structural detail which <em>varies</em> throughout the material is difficult or impossible to polish beyond a particular point.</p>
<p>Finally the &quot;mirror&quot; part. We make mirrors by precision crafting a glass surface and then putting metal on that surface and then viewing it from the other side (through the glass) because we want <em>flat</em> and we want <em>reflective</em>, and the seal between the flat glass and the flat metal lets the flat glass <em>protect</em> the integrity of the flat and <em>reflective</em> metal, while helping prevent oxidation and pitting of that metal. The &quot;flat side&quot; of the glass is often achieved (or was, back in the day) by pouring the molten glass onto a sea of mercury. Basically it was easier to <em>create</em> the smooth glass than it was to <em>polish</em> the glass smooth after the fact. The crappy (and less-important) upper surface of that glass mirror could then be polished, but it didn't take the same amount of care to still get a nice mirror.</p>
<p>So metals make a better mirror because they respond to the electromatnetic disruptions of a large range of frequencies quite readily, largely because of that &quot;sea of electrons&quot; thing (if memory served). (read up on &quot;the types of chemical bonds&quot; and the difference between metallic and covalent bonds in particular. Fascinating stuff.)</p>
<p>But now we are into details of conductivity and the electromagnetic field in which photons spend their reality.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To polish a material to a mirror finish you have to create a very uniform surface, so that all the light is reflected in the same way and not scattered into different directions. The higher the density of a material, the closer you can get to this even surface because the atoms are &quot;closer together&quot;.<br />
Imagine bouncing a ball against a box full of pebbles (resembling light bouncing against a low density surface): no matter how hard you try to arrange the pebbles as evenly as possible, you can't create a surface that will bounce the ball in the same direction every time.    </p>
<p>EDIT: seems like I only got half of the story. Like /u/jjs2424 explained, the index of refraction is the other half. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
