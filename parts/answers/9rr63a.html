		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That saying is just plain wrong. It’s the volts <em>and</em> the amps <em>and</em> the frequency <em>and</em> the duration that kill you. Sadly there is no really simple way to understand all the nuances of electricity.</p>
<p>A typical static shock blasts you with a pulse of tens of thousands of volts, carrying about between 1 and 20 amps amps IIRC. 100 milli<del>volts</del><strong>amps</strong> is enough to kill you, but that is for a sustained shock.</p>
<p>If you touch 170 volts DC from a source without current limiting, it will be pretty unpleasant, but you could definitely hold on to it for a bet; if you touch and hold on to 170 volts AC at a certain range of frequencies from a source without current limiting, you will die.</p>
<p>If you touch 5000V AC at 60Hz from a source without current limiting, you will instantly die. If you touch 5000V AC at 20,000Hz from a source without current limiting, you will get a nasty burn where you touched it, but you will live.</p>
<p>Electricity and biology are bizarre beasts, which is what makes them so interesting! Electricity is an oddball because we can use relatable analogies to represent many of its behaviors (like water pressure and flow rate = voltage and current, one-way check valve=diode, etc.), but there are some behaviors that we can’t really relate to more accessible concepts.</p>
<p>Here’s the most I could distill it down without being misleading or untruthful: <em>Voltage can push current (amps) through you, which can be lethal if enough current is pushed through you at certain frequencies for a long enough duration.</em></p>
<p><strong>TLDR: If it were just the amps that kill you, static shocks would be 100% lethal. It is a combination of the voltage, current, duration and frequency that kill you.</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The title statement is misleading because it takes voltage to make current flow. Together with resistance they form Ohm's Law: E=IR They are inextricably linked. </p>
<p>Voltage is potential, while current is motion. To use the water analogy, water pressure alone can't do work. It takes a stream of moving water to do work. However that water stream won't flow without pressure to overcome resistance of the hose and the work resistance. </p>
