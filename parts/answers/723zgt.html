		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol affects the function of many parts of the central nervous system (CNS). Vision trouble due to CNS problems can come in many flavors, but these are the more likely mechanisms in relation to alcohol use:</p>
<ul>
<li>loss of visual information (-anopia or scotoma): meaning that the information from the light hitting your retina does not successfully reach the visual portion of your brain (occipital lobe) or the signal is not correctly processed and transmitted to the conscious mind</li>
<li>&quot;double vision&quot; (diplopia): because the muscles that coordinate the eyes are not functioning correctly either due to a problem with the muscles themselves, the nerves and brainstem controlling them, or the cerebellum (essentially a supercomputer processor that integrates sensory inputs and allows you to form complex &amp; smooth movements of your muscles).</li>
</ul>
<p>This last bit is the culprit of discoordination and difficulty seeing while drinking and during a hangover. </p>
<p>But I'd like to expand on the effect of alcohol a bit further as it regards hangovers.</p>
<p>Alcohol has a myriad of effects on hormonal signaling in the body. The most relevant for this discussion is that alcohol inhibits your brain from releasing anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), which is responsible for regulation of water content of the urine and blood. This is why you might find yourself going to the bathroom a lot when drinking. While you are actively imbibing, you tend to replace this lost water (assuming your are drinking beer, wine, or liquor + water). However, this effect continues for several hours after your last drink, so you continue to dehydrate and when you wake up several hours (days?) later your bladder feels like it is holding all of the beer that you drank the night before. Moreover, besides the feeling of a dry mouth, you are also experiencing a &quot;dry&quot; brain, resulting in some of the more terrible aspects of a hangover - headache, nausea, photophobia (light sensitivity), and, yes, blurry vision. </p>
<p>There are likely many other effects of alcohol that could be explored to help explain hangovers, but I believe these to be the most salient.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol can effect the occipital lobe in the brain by slowing down receptor time. </p>
<p>The occipital lobe is the part of the brain that processes what your eyes see, thus if the receptor time is slowed, it will take the lobe longer to process what you are seeing, resulting in blurred vision and poor distance judgement.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dry irritated eyes are a hallmark of hangover dehydration. Eye drops can help.</p>
<p>People often get dehydrated after a night out because their body is trying to flush the alcohol from their system. That can affect your bodies ability to make tears and clear mucus from your eyes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
