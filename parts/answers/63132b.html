<p>Quote : &quot; I believe that swallowing is what's called a &quot;prepotent reflex.&quot; This means that it is essential for survival or avoiding harm, and is therefore given the ability to override other competing reflexes, in this case the gag reflex. Gagging is also the result of receptors mainly located in the posterior 1/3 of your mouth, behind the palatoglossal folds therefore in the oropharynx. The boundaries of the pharynx itself are usually only breached upon the actual act of swallowing, so you are at a lower risk of gagging. Note that you will still gag if you accidentally try to swallow something without chewing it, as the area is not prepared and in the act of swallowing. &quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a food/liquid bolus travels toward the back of the oral cavity, the swallow reflex is triggered. One of the muscle actions that happens during the swallow is that the velum (and uvula) elevate to close off the nasal cavity to prevent nasal regurgitation of the bolus. Along with what other people have said about sensation and reflexes, the uvula is mostly out of the way of the bolus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A swallow starts from the forward part of the tongue, pressing food against the roof of the mouth, then the muscle contractions move back in a wave-like motion, pushing the food or liquid ahead of it down the throat. The airway closes up in a number of ways to protect itself. While the initiation of the swallow is voluntary, the rest is a reflex (swallow reflex, not gag reflex). </p>
<p>In contrast, a finger in the back of your throat is just... suddenly present, with no other signals to your nervous system that you are swallowing. As the airway protection hasn't occurred (the correct procedures have not been followed!) this presents a choking risk, so the gag reflex immediately closes the airway and contracts to eject the item/your finger.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Reflexes are mediated by other parts of the nervous system. They are not infallibly present.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: the gag reflex is something you can train to be less reflexive (like many reflexes, hyper-stimulation can cause the body to react less severely).</p>
<p>As for the act of swallowing not proccing the gag reflex, u/Kimeey seems to have a great explanation. </p>
<p>What that explanation doesn't really explain in depth is that when one swallows, there is a small portion of cartilagenous material that folds over your tracheal tubes to prevent your body from &quot;inhaling&quot; the food. When you swallow, the epiglottis reflexively covers the windpipe area and passes food to the esophagus. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
