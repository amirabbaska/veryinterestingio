		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least for livestock it is determined a lot by the frequency of ejaculation, the age of the animal, and the techniques used to collect semen (basically the psychological/physiological stimulation).</p>
<p>I've collected bull and boar semen and assisted with collection of stallions and rams. I'll use bulls for example. Yearling bulls produce much less ejaculate than a four or five year old bull, which is why you wouldn't leave a young bull responsible for breeding more than twenty cows out in the field. When collecting bulls artificially, you could collect using electroejaculation (using a probe to electrically stimulate the prostate), or you could let him mount a cow/dummy and collect it in a sleeve or condom. No bull on the planet likes the electroejaculation, and this method is almost exclusively used to put semen under a microscope to inspect semen and confirm that the sperm are all normal. Why is it only used to test semen quality? Because so little volume in ejaculated when using this method.</p>
<p>Now when you get into real bull collections, where companies buy $100k bulls and collect semen from each animal twice a week- volume is important. More volume = more money. For bulls, stallions, and boars (Artificial insemination and semen collection is very rare in rams and the sheep world) - it's very common to find companies that take important notes about each individual male's preferences. Some get special handlers they like. Some have a specific dummy, or a custom-made artificial vagina. Many of these animals get into a routine that they like and, just like humans, each animal needs just the right stimulation to ejaculate. Getting their preferences right results in the largest and most high quality ejaculate. This is why collector's invest so much time and money into recording what each animal likes.</p>
<p>So at least in the animals world, most mammals' ejaculate is determined by age, frequency of ejaculation, and tastes/preferences. I think it would be safe to assume some of these translate over to humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your general health plays a big part, including your age.  Men around 30 years old have the biggest...load...in general.  Being dehydrated will obviously contribute.  How often you ejaculate <em>may</em> contribute - for example, if you masturbate frequently, you will probably see a small decrease in total ejaculate; <em>however</em>, it is important to note that the volume of ejaculate does not correlate to sperm count.  Ejaculate contains a number of things other than sperm, especially water but also including some sources of sustenance for the sperm.  You may have a high volume of semen with a low sperm count, or vice versa.  Ejaculating often may lead to a lower <em>sperm count</em> but not necessarily a smaller load.</p>
<p>Interestingly, sperm counts in semen from masturbating is generally lower than sperm counts in semen from intercourse.  It seems that your gonads pay attention to what you're doing and don't waste as much sperm when you know it's not going to be doing its job.  For that reason, there's not much point in &quot;saving up&quot; by avoiding ejaculation for long periods.  It <em>is</em> true that the volume will increase, but not by a lot.  If you need a reason to abstain for a bit, consider sensitivity - you can become somewhat numb if you overindulge and have trouble performing when you need to.</p>
<p>The amount of ejaculate also does not seem to correspond to arousal or the strength of your orgasm.  Mostly it just varies from person to person.  And, obviously, you always need <em>some</em> time to recharge and refill, so multiple times in a short period will lead to a decrease in both semen and sperm count.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot; The strongest known determinants of semen volume are the positive relationship with time since last ejaculation (Schwartz et al., 1979) and the dependence of prostate and seminal vesicle fluid secretion on androgen exposure (Kitahara et al., 1998; Tash et al., 2000)&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a source handy but if I recall correctly, there are 2 factors: </p>
<ol>
<li>Time </li>
<li>Amount of time you are aroused. </li>
</ol>
<p>Over time your body is creating additional sperm. When you are aroused your body goes into super drive and creates it at a much quicker pace. Time is the biggest factor though. But, if you recently blew your load and are hoping for another decent size one with little time, just try and stay hard for like an hour or two before you bust and it should help some.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

My Urologist told me that 8 years ago and...he wasn't wrong.  I don't care, my wife doesn't care, and the sheets don't care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
