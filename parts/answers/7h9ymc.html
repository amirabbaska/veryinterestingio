		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for one the largest lithium producers and refiners. We certainly don’t think lithium is running out. We get a lot of ours by drying brine combined with earth in old volcanic zones. The left over salts have a decent concentration of lithium. This helps avoid so much mining too, but there are a couple lithium mines in America and a big one in Australia. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>However is is usually in low concentrations spread around the place.  We certainly are not going to run out of it, we just need to keep developing ways to extract it efficiently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We aren’t really running out of Lithium. It’s true that demand for the resource is projected to increase dramatically, and that the world’s supply is limited. However, Lithium is fairly easily recycled from used batteries (we just don’t do it because there’s no need) and some of the other ingredients for Lithium ion batteries are more limited than Lithium is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can assure you the world is not running out of lithium in any meaningful sense. Today's supply is not enough to meet future demand, but the industry is ready to grow once demand and prices rise.</p>
<p>Currently there are a small number of high-volume extraction operations servicing most of the global market, processing lithium salts out of the highest concentration brine pools for a respectable ROI. There is however an enormous amount of prospecting happening worldwide, as the market has known for many years higher demand is coming. Countless deposits have already been mapped out and more are being found as we speak, but few companies have bothered extracting them yet as the market price of Lithium is still too low to have a good guaranteed ROI.</p>
<p>Secondary sources of concentrated lithium include mineral springs, underground salt deposits, filtering geothermal water (still pretty easy) and even underwater geothermal vents. </p>
<p>In an absolute worst case scenario, lithium can be processed out of seawater. Prices would go through the roof, but it <em>is</em> possible - billions of tons of the stuff are heavily diluted amongst the world's oceans.</p>
<p>It takes something worth an absolute fortune by weight to make nuclear fusion/fission a viable way to produce it. Currently, most examples are radioactive products: various isotopes for medical use, tritium for night illumination coatings, plutonium for RTG pellets, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
