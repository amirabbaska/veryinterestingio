<p>Here is a brief discussion of it: <a href="http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/39/3/287.full" target="_blank">http://geology.gsapubs.org/content/39/3/287.full</a></p>
<p>This is also full of interesting information: <a href="https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Deep_subsurface_microbes" target="_blank">https://microbewiki.kenyon.edu/index.php/Deep_subsurface_microbes</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would assume once the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_gradient" target="_blank">temperature reached about 200-300C</a>. Those temperatures would pretty much cause the chemical reaction rates to go squirrelly. All the chemical basis for life as we know it would stop working at those temperatures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Geothermal gradient is the rate of increasing temperature with respect to increasing depth in the Earth's interior. Away from tectonic plate boundaries, it is about 25 °C per km of depth (1 °F per 70 feet of depth) near the surface in most of the world.[1]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So for 200C it would be at about 7.2km and for 300C it would be about 11.2km.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
