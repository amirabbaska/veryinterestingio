		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Construction manager here with over a decade of building experience. First, have you heard of my profession? I'm the guy who coordinates between the architect and engineer's design with the subcontractors, to make the pieces fit together. It's a ton of work and a lot of coordination involved. </p>
<p>We start by coordinating the layout of the building, columns, beams, piers, slab elevations, etc. Everything gets taken into account in order to build the building correctly. Then move on to laying out sheetrock walls and coordinating the MEP system. We make sure everything is approved and ordered ahead of time, because something like a Fire Pump can take 16 weeks to get.</p>
<p>As you can also imagine, people make mistakes. For a building there are a ton of mistakes. So often times we will have to redo work because someone forgot to insulate a pipe, or the material installed was the wrong one specified. There are also lots of design issues that may not work or incorrectly drawn. It's up to the construction manager to find these mistakes and resolve them in order to move on. </p>
<p>It's certainly not an easy process and I don't think GCs get nearly enough credit for the work GCs do. Newspaper articles always mention the developer and architect who completed a new building, never the Construction Managers/GCs who coordinated the whole thing.</p>
<p>EDIT: Wow thanks for the gold!! I did not think so many people would be interested in construction. I will try to answer as many questions as I can. Also, I forgot to mention the surveyors, they deserve a lot of credit because they have no room for error. They supply the information for every trade to work off, so it's important to find a qualified surveyor. Lastly, when I say Construction Manager, I am referring to a team of people. This includes the PM, Superintendent, APMs, Estimators, Assistant Supers, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm really late to this party but I do this for a living. I can answer any questions if they have not been already.</p>
<p>Basically the regular building crews have only a rough idea of about where things go. The current top comment is from a construction manager; he has no idea where things go either vertically or horizontally. Notice he said he coordinates, that's his job, management and scheduling. </p>
<p>The people that do know are the surveyors. </p>
<p>We start by performing a topo and an as-built survey. This is basically a three dimensional map that shows current elevations of a property and anything that is built on it. We also map everything that is underground, power, water lines, gas etc..
This map then goes to the civil engineers and architects who create detailed designs and structural plans based on the property. These plans have elevations and dimensions for almost everything.</p>
<p>At this point we get these plans both in paper form and in a “cad” file. We then use autocad or somthing similer to create precise coordinates for every single thing on the site. We also give these coordinate points elevations. </p>
<p>So say there is a storm water manhole that needs put in. We will give it coordinates with a “northing” and “easting” just like any other map and a certain elevation based off the civil engineers design. </p>
<p>So at this point the construction manager wants to put that box in, so he calls me and I come out with my equipment and set up on what are called “transverse” or “control” points. These points also have coordinates and are tied into the existing property locations we have already set up. From these points I can find and mark any point on the plans within a thousandth of an inch.
So I will put into my handheld computer that I need to go to that storm manhole and follow the directions. It will read something like OUT:100’ LEFT:22’ or whatever. Basically I just go to the exact location and mark it for the people installing the structures and tell them how far up or down the box needs to be.</p>
<p>We do this for every single thing on a site. Curb, light poles,manholes, planter boxes I mean everything. And this is how regular crews put things in exactly where they are designed.  </p>
<p>Now, this is an extremely simplified description of the process but hopefully it gives you the jist of it. Feel free to ask if there is anything more specific you wanna know about.</p>
<p>Also forgive grammar and spelling! I have the day off and have been sipping on some Macallan 15
for a…. bit. I ain't proofreading shit today. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of translating the plans to an actual physical location on the earth:</p>
<p>GPS and surveying equipment. Usually the GPS will locate a benchmark location away from the disturbance and the traditional surveying equipment will locate everything relative to that. On the higher end stuff we even have satellite controlled earthmoving equipment, which can reshape the land to match a digital model without any operator input.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a commercial/industrial project manager. A lot of it is having the right team design it, then having professionals like myself divide the work into specific subcontracts. The guys installing the foundations are not installing the lights. It is my job to coordinate with the design team and workers so that everything goes in per the plans. There are always gaps in information, so we ask a lot of questions along the way. On big projects there can be upwards of 200 managers coordinating specific trades with 3000 workers on site. If you have specific questions about the construction process feel free to ask. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Architects (plus all the engineers) will draw plans of what they need built. This will often include a demolition plan. </p>
<p>The builder will come up with the most cost effective sequence of construction.  </p>
<p>Civil engineers will include drawings of what needs to be done with the earth before actual construction of footings. </p>
<p>The consultant team (architect, civil engineer, structural engineer, architect, services consultant) conduct periodic checks to ensure the building is built in accordance with their documentation. Their checks are often tied with their payments. </p>
<p>TL;DR there's a whole team of people who check and cross check each other to make sure it's being built right. But ultimately the responsibility is on the builder to get it done quickest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
