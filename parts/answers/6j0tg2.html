		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My father is a fire investigator. I asked him the same question. He showed me photos of the last one he determined the cause. All the knobs on the stove were off besides one. It melted obviously being on. The people had left the stove on. They start at the area that has the most fire damage then look for something that isn't how it should be. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In this case, it was easy - the fire was seen when it started, reported, firefighters attended and extinguished the fire in that flat - but not before the fire spread to the outside of the building. The questions to be answered here are engineering ones - why a cladding material that would have been designed and tested as safe proved to be so unsafe in practice.</p>
<p>But even in less obvious cases, the source of the ignition is often obvious. When ignition happens, there is lots of oxygen there, so things burn completely. When the fire gets going, there's less oxygen available, so things burn partially. Fire generally burns up - so the source of a fire is often the only thing on the floor that is badly burned.</p>
<p>Edit: Lots of good replies to my comment - including some fire investigators that state that the source of the fire is usually less combusted than the surroundings, as they burn cooler before the fire gets going.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a firefighter myself, we tend to have a general idea of where the fire started due to witness accounts and phone report. Once on scene we pay attention to where most of the smoke and fire production is coming from, and after extinguishing the fire we look for stuff like &quot;V&quot; patterns on the wall, alligatoring (aka charring) on wood, melted plastic etc which is usually pretty good indicator of what direction the fire spread from and work almost like arrows pointing in the direction of the original source, after that we can narrow it down, we let the investigator know and then they probe deeper with looking/testing for signs of accelerants, looking at wiring, etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure someone who understands how burn patterns work will be able to explain it to you in the more general case ... but it has to do with the fact that things don't burn out completely, and the scorch marks are different where the fire started and was small.</p>
<p>In this particular case, however, a big helping hand came from the fact that the guy who lived in the flat where it started told people that his fridge caught fire, and it went from there.  Don't have a source right now, but some of the initial reports of the fire quoted some guy as saying his neighbour told him it was his fridge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a certified indoor firefighter.  At the fire academy, we learned how cheaply houses are built nowadays and what to look/listen for in a fire.  A lot of buildings now have what are called truss roofs.  One beam is stretched from wall to wall and smaller beams are fanned out from the center of the beam to support the roof.  To attach the supports most of the time, an aluminum plate is attached and get this, staples or rivets are used, not nails.  </p>
<p>When a fire is hot enough, it will make the plate expand, causing the staples/rivets to &quot;pop out&quot;, making this metallic pinging noise.  If you hear that noise, you need to get out NOW because the roof is coming down.  Construction doesn't include the attic vent sometimes.  This vent is designed to allow the flow of superheated gases to escape the top of the house, preventing a flashover.  Everything is made of plastic nowadays, some which burns at 1200 F, while your turnout gear is good to 800 F.  So many dangers to be aware of in fires nowadays.  I love it when people ask me if I have a fear of being immolated.  I always tell them that I'm too busy thinking of other things, to be worried about that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
