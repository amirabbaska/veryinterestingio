		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking, yes.</p>
<p>But, there was a study, it resulted in claiming that humans will probably never be able to rely on supplements alone and that they will never <em>effectively</em> replace the benefits of (healthy) eating.</p>
<p>There are two major reasons for that-</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are some chemicals (specific types of fibers and phytochemicals) that can never enrich synthesized foods. Also, dietary supplements are not well regulated and may cause a positive drug test result. Therefore, &quot;plate is always better than a pill.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li><strong>The second aspect is purely psychological.</strong> A well-planned nutrition and hydration plan positively influences athletic performance. Eating not only satisfies your palate, but also gives you a sense of emotional satisfaction and fulfills your desire to eat. Gluttony is not that rare among humans. Moreover, social participation such as dining with others is a very important aspect of people's lives. Humans are primordially just social animals; and secluding their meals and limiting the time spent cherishing, admiring, or appreciating &quot;good food&quot; can actually seriously undermine your mental health.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.soylent.com/" target="_blank">Yes, it's called Soylent</a>.  From what I've heard it's fairly bland but otherwise not bad.  They are complete meal replacements - you can live entirely off of Soylent and water and maybe a vitamin or two, depending on your caloric needs (if you have a very active lifestyle you may need a higher-calorie diet).  That said, it's probably not a diet that excites the palate.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/012/132/thatsthejoke.jpg" target="_blank">Soylent is not made of people.</a></p>
<p>Edit: I promise you are not the first person to make the &quot;IT'S MADE OF PEOPLE!&quot; joke.  Seriously, <a href="http://s2.quickmeme.com/img/e0/e06613375a2da4823c7a33a8ab0e14d90c8e6bf7ba43ccfe1ecc350d8806cb78.jpg" target="_blank"><em>that's the joke</em></a>.  I'm amazed that people are still making that joke.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. They're called meal replacements. <a href="https://ensure.com/" target="_blank">This one is very popular in Canada</a>. It is the go-to choice for those who are unable to swallow solid food (after a surgery for example.) It's also provided free from pharmacies to extremely-low-income as part of the government funded drug insurance.</p>
<p>EDIT: For it to be provide for free, there are certain <a href="http://www.health.gov.on.ca/en/public/programs/drugs/programs/odb/opdp_nutrition.aspx" target="_blank">requirements</a> to be met such as: be on a drug benefit plan available to only the ultra-low-income, a prescription for a physician, unable to eat solid food, and/or using it as the only source of food not as a supplement. So no, they won't be available to students... unless you're really in the shitter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I had leukemia and they had me on daily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parenteral_nutrition" target="_blank">TPN</a> with (if I remember correctly) weekly lipids.</p>
<p>It was administered through my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hickman_line" target="_blank">hickman catheter</a>.</p>
