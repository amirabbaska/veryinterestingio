		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vacuum &quot;pull&quot; is nothing but the internal pressure pushing against a lack of external pressure. So the force is given by a pressure differential of about one atmosphere acting on the area of the breach. For a small hole this is not a lot at all: Atmospheric pressure is 1 bar = 10^5 Pa = 100000 N/m^2 . If you have a breach with a cross section of 1 m^2 , the force would be 100000 N, i.e. roughly the equivalent of of 10 tonnes of weight distributed over that area. A hole with 100 cm^2 area (a fist sized hole in the hull) would only have 1000 N force, roughly 100 kg worth. Enough to lose air, but if you want to plug such a hole by putting e.g. a body part or a book on it it will hold.  </p>
<p>If you have access to a vacuum pump (e.g. in a science lab) put your finger over the tube and you will feel a slight pull - this is exactly what would happen with the space scenario. </p>
<p>Movies rarely let science get in the way of a good story.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, that scene in alien 4- where the monster baby is licking Sigourney Weaver, and she makes a dime -sizes hole in the window with her acid-human-hybrid-blood.  </p>
<p>And then the grown-fetus-voldemort-monster gets sucked out through the tiny hole like jello through  a straw? All while keeping his sad creepy smiling face looking at SW? </p>
<p>That's not real?? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I love how in movies that do depict the force from the pressure differential, then screw up by depicting it as a continuous force. For any sizable leak the pressure would be released extremely quickly and the differential would be gone. So the idea of people hanging on trying not to be sucked out as objects go flying by them as they are pulled into the void is BS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
