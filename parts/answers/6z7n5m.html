		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only natural disaster that concrete and brick houses are better at dealing with are fires. </p>
<p>With tornadoes most damage is done by winds so strong that they dismantle concrete, brick, or stone either directly or by throwing debris into them only slightly more slowly than they do wood. You can make a tornado bunker that is above ground with 4 foot thick walls and steel reinforcement. Homes do not do that, even in places that they make concrete homes. </p>
<p>Hurricanes tend to do most of their damage with flooding. Concrete and Bricks flood and mold just as easily as wood. When they are washed away the ground itself is washed away so they break just as easily too. For the extremely powerful hurricanes we have the same wind issues as tornadoes. </p>
<p>For earthquakes the concrete and brick homes are far worse than wood. They are too rigid unless very expensive tech and building practices are used and so they just crumble when an earthquake happens as they cannot flex. </p>
<p>And finally they are 3-10 times more expensive than wooden homes. Chances of you actually losing your home in your lifetime are low, and you get insurance to protect against it. So it is far better for most to spend what money they have to build a larger nicer home. </p>
<p>Also you seem to think drywall is a structural weight bearing material. It is not. It is the interior finishing of the wall. Wood is the structural component and wood/fiberglass is the outdoor wall slat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think to better phrase it you would say &quot;why wooden frames as opposed to concrete&quot;  </p>
<p>In California at least-  this is because the wooden frames hold up to earthquakes -  also as I understand it, concrete is quite expensive in comparison.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe that what the OP is trying to ask is why we build timber frame houses in the US, rather than concrete or cinder blocks/brick. I have been asked this a lot as well by Latinos, who consider American houses to be cheaply made. Some say it is the cost of concrete, but that seems odd because the majority of homes built in Mexico/Central/South America are built of either poured concrete or cinder blocks on a concrete slab. My wife's uncle has a poured concrete house in Ecuador that looks as good as or better than most timber framed McMansions in the US. They don't even consider using timber framing down there. The same applies to tile floors and tile roofs, which are considered somewhat expensive in the US, and generally seen only in higher end houses, but you will find tile floors and roofs in the poorest houses in Latin America. It is nearly all imported Italian made tile, which is the same thing they brag about here. roofing shingles are almost unheard of, and rarely seen. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dry wall is an interior finish not a structural material.  Therefore homes can be built to optimum hurricane code and still utilize the material.  It is better than old plaster interior walls in terms of a construction material as  a homeowner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drywall is a to make the inside of the house look nice. It has absolutely no supportive or constructive function. Wood is used because it's a abundant and cheap. It also handles earthquakes better, like in CA. For the rest of the country, the middle and south of the US are generally lower cost of living. Meaning less money to build with. Housing tends to be cheaper, though not always as land is also cheaper as well.</p>
<p>Wood houses are significantly easier to update as well. Running wires and plumbing is easy, and it's not uncommon to update a house every decade or so dependING on the area and homeowners.</p>
<p>I live in PA. No disasters hit here beyond the occasional small scale flood. There is no reason to use concrete. Brick houses are pretty common, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
