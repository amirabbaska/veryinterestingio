		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Warm blankets are cozy because your body generates warmth which is transferred into the blanket and air trapped under the blanket. This warmth slowly dissipates out the outer side of the blanket into the cooler room and you don't over heat, allowing your body to relax as it is not working to raise or lower your internal temperature. </p>
<p>In a room of the same temperature your body is still creating warmth but it has no where to dissipate to. This makes your internal temperature rise and you feel sweaty and uncomfortable as your body tries to cool down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This quote by Herman Melville is pretty relevant. Taken from Moby dick: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>To enjoy bodily warmth, some small part of you must be cold, for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast. Nothing exists in itself. If you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable, and have been so a long time, then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more. For this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire, which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich. For the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air. Then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to clarify some points by others: the idea that you lose most of the heat through your head is not very accurate, it seems. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/dec/17/medicalresearch-humanbehaviour" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/dec/17/medicalresearch-humanbehaviour</a></p>
<p>TLDR; this probably came from a study by the US army where people uncovered their heads in the arctic. Of course, if your head was the only uncovered part of your body you'd lose most of the heat there. Also, your upper body, head and face are more sensitive to temperature, so that myth is reinforced by your (entirely subjective) experience and but not an actual measurement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Put the blanket over your head, now it's way too hot. Without getting into the science behind it, your head is the main body part that regulates body temperature. What the other poster said about dissipating heat is correct, but (depending on factors like room temperature, blanket thickness &amp; material, etc.) the blanket might not feel comfortable after a while because it reaches your body temperature, meaning your body heat doesn't really have anywhere to go. Placing your head out of the blanket allows your body heat to dissipate there, unobstructed. Leaving your head under the blanket will eventually turn the blanket into a small &quot;hot room&quot; and you will have the same stifling feeling.</p>
<p>To illustrate this, if you're in a hot room and only have a tiny handheld fan, you aim it at your face. Or you stick your head out the window or something. This is also why hot tubs feel awesome until you put your head under the water. I should also note that your head is the main body part that regulates temperature--not the only part. Take that how you will. I'm not sure how biologically accurate this is, but here is a related rule of thumb I've always lived by: If you are hot, focus on cooling off your head/face; if you are cold, focus on warming up your body/extremities (and head, in extreme temperatures).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
