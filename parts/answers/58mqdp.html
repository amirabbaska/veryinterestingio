		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Lightning was far more damaging back then. The Carboniferous period is associated with the formation of large deposits of charcoal, which have been linked to massive wildfires. Part of the reason is that this period had ideal conditions for fires to start. Not only was the oxygen concentration at a record high, but there were also huge deposits of wood that could serve as fuel. Lightning then often acted to close the fire triangle by providing the spark needed to ignite the fuel. Quoting the introduction to <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0031018294900051" target="_blank">this paper</a>:<br><br>&gt;Fusain occurs widely in Carboniferous coals and sediments. It is now recognised to represent charcoal and be the product of wildfire. The occurrence of fire is partly constrained by atmospheric oxygen levels, availability and nature of fuel and by aspects of climate (rainfall and seasonability in particular). The majority of fires in the Carboniferous were probably started by lightning strikes or by volcanic activity. <br><br>edit: Removed a sentence that was off topic</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Others have pointed out that lightning was probably more likely to cause wildfires in a more oxygen-rich atmosphere.<br><br>However I take your question to be more about whether lightning would be on average more <em>energetic</em> with greater oxygen saturation. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dielectric_gas" target="_blank">breakdown voltage</a> of oxygen is lower than that of nitrogen, so it's possible this would lead to more frequent and powerful lightning. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Much more dangerous. The high oxygen environment did exactly as expected, and there was a <em>TON</em> of fuel to burn, as it was the Carboniferous period. Lighting ignited this volatile mixture, causing massive conflagrations</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Sorry, kind of unrelated, but I just was googling to see if there was any relevant information (hoping for a lightning simulator or something), when your post <a href="http://i.imgur.com/CaIyEPV.png" target="_blank">popped up in Google</a> as &quot;live&quot;. I'd never seen that before and thought it was cool. <br><br>Good question, by the way. Carry on.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>What should also be mentioned is that the total atmospheric pressure was likely higher at that time too, so the partial pressure of oxygen was not 35% of 760 mm Hg, but perhaps three times that.  it's all about the partial pressure, not the percentage.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">
