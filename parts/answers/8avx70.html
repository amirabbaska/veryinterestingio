		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. There are some commercial printing processes that use ethanol as a solvent, and you can absolutely have a blood alcohol reading after working with them all day. I’ve never heard of anyone actually being “drunk”, but while I was in trade school, our lecturers did warn us about driving home after work in those situations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We know that alcohol diffuses through lung tissue, this is the basis of the &quot;breath test&quot;. Besides this medical application there are several companies that &quot;vaporize&quot; alcohol so it can be inhaled, this is desired due to how fast you can get wasted. However the last time I checked we really didn't know the consequences of the high alcohol content in inhaled gases</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps, but it has some logistical issues. At room temperature, alcohol has a vapor pressure of ~0.06 bar, which gives it a concentration in air of about 120 mg/L. While you could heat it up or aerosolize it to increase this, you will quickly find that high concentrations of ethanol are not pleasant to inhale (not to mention the fire hazard). This means that to inhale a single drink's worth of ethanol (~14 g) would require inhaling 115 liters of alcohol saturated air, which translates to around 50 deep breaths. Of course absorption wouldn't be 100%, so in practice it would likely be closer to 100 deep breaths. So, in order to get decently drunk, you would need to spend quite a bit of time huffing ethanol</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
