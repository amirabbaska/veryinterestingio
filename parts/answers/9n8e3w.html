		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since 1979, there has been a naming list in use for hurricanes. The list is alphabetical (skipping Q,U,X,Y, and Z) and alternates from male and female names. Prior to 1979, there was a naming list that only had female names on it. There are six naming lists and we are currently using naming list number 4. They are rotated every year. (2017 used list 3, 2016 used list 2, etc.) If a name is associated with a lot of death or destruction, the name will be retired and replaced with a name starting with the same letter. Think Hurricane Katrina- it was replaced with the name Katia. If a naming list runs out (Fun Fact: that happened in 2005) then the NHC (the national hurricane center) will name any hurricanes that form after Greek letters.</p>
<p>Each hurricane is tracked from formation to dissipation, thus preventing any mix-up. Once a storm reaches winds of up to 40+ mph, it will get a name (the next name on the naming list) and once it reaches one minute sustained winds above 70+ mph, it is classified as a category 1 hurricane. If a hurricane reaches sustained winds of up to 110+ mph, it will be classified as a Category 3 Major Hurricane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short the US National Hurricane Center has a list of names <a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnames.shtml" target="_blank">NHC Hurricane Names</a> in alphabetical order determined by the World Meteorological Organization. They use one list per season and there are six lists. A storm is named when it reaches tropical storm strength and maintains that name until the storm's rotation is no longer visible or discernible. When a storm's name is retired by the WMO a suitable replacement is inserted into its place. The criteria for retirement is basically if the storm was infamous because of high damage totals or large loss of life, the WMO retires the name to avoid confusion of a later storm that might be just as severe if not more. The WMO page on naming does not give any details on how a replacement name is selected. <a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/About-us/FAQs/faqs-tropical-cyclones/tropical-cyclone-naming" target="_blank">WMO page on TC names</a></p>
<p>As for how the names are chosen, I do not know if they are randomly chosen, but I do know that the names on the lists are alternated between boy's and girl's names. For instance, these are the first six names on the list for the 2018 Atlantic Hurricane season; Alberto, Beryl, Chris, Debby, Ernesto, Florence. Before the beginning of the 2019 Atlantic Hurricane Season, the WMO will announce what names are being retired. Florence and Michael are two names that are highly likely to be retired as they have caused significant damage. </p>
<p>As for how they keep the storms separate, that's actually fairly easy. At the very basic level two low pressure tropical systems have a hard time joining each other. They actually have a name for this, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujiwhara_effect" target="_blank">the Fujiwhara effect</a>. It basically states that two tropical cyclones will rotate around each other instead of joining because their winds are fighting against each other. This effect is most pronounced if the two storms are of the same size and intensity. If one storm is stronger, the stronger storm could eventually absorb the weaker storm, at which point I believe it would keep the name of the stronger storm.</p>
<p>tl:dr So, yes, hurricanes are easily named and keep that name throughout the duration of the storm. They are named when they form and are easily distinguished from other hurricanes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meteorologists long ago learned that naming tropical storms and hurricanes helps people remember the storms, communicate about them more effectively, and so stay safer if and when a particular storm strikes a coast. These experts assign names to hurricanes according to a formal list of names that is approved prior to the start of each hurricane season. The U.S. National Hurricane Center started this practice in 1950. Now, the World Meteorological Organization generates and maintains the list of hurricane names.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process first came from military officials that tracked the hurricanes in the early to mid 1900s. They named the storms after their wives, but they did it only around of top officials and it then slowly caught on until someone decided to make a registered list like people have said above</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have a list of names that they cycle through every 6 years i think it is. If a hurricane causes a lot of damage or loss of life, etc then that name will be retired and they will put another name into that rotation. If you go to the National Hurricane Center's website they have the list of names that they use. I'm not sure how or why they pick the names, or if its just random.</p>
<p>As far as how they separate them, I'm not sure if I understand what you mean. Each hurricane that forms this year for instance will get the names on this years list. If you mean like if they re-use the names how are the separated, they will usually put a year in front of it like Hurricane &quot;insert name&quot; from 19XX.    I'm not sure if that answered your question?</p>
