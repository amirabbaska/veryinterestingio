		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider the volume of air in your room to the volume of air outside. Imagine how many rooms full of air there are within just one square mile and compare that to all the smog that China has. Now consider how much coal they would need to burn to power just one giant purifier and how that would impact its cleaning effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your room is an enclosed space. The air circulates easily. </p>
<p>The outside air is not enclosed. It circulates globally, but local airflows arnt easy to purify. The smog my be reduced in a certain area, but you'd need multiple systems to cover a large enough area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
