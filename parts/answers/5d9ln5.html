This appears as a blue/gray color. When they're cooked, the protein, crustacyanin, denatures and the astaxanthin becomes unbound. The unbound astaxanthin's color is the red that you see. It's also what gives salmon and shrimp their red colors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pigments are small particles that absorb some colours but reflects others. This is the way how most of everyday objects get their colour. </p>
<p>The shell of the crabs contain the (red!) pigment Astaxanthin. To be precise, there aren't some small Astaxanthin particles in the shell of the crab, but they are the main compound of a much bigger protein (crustacyanin),  which acts as the main pigment in crabs. Those crusracyanin pigments are responsible for the blue/greyish color of crabs. </p>
<p>Now comes the interesting part. We all know what happenes to an egg, if you heat it up? The transparent stuff gets hard and ends up white. This is because the proteins inside of the egg denature, they get destroyed. The same thing happenes to crustacyanin, upon complete destruction the astaxanthin pigments are the (more or less) only thing left of the crustacyanin proteins, so that's the only thing we can see. And, as we saw in the beginning, those are red, therefore the whole crab gets red too.</p>
<p>Fun fact: in german proteins are called Eiweisse (egg whites)</p>
<p>Tl;dr By cooking it, you're simply destroying some proteins, revealing the crabs &quot;true&quot; color</p>
<p>Edit: mixed up degenerate and denature, sorry</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I could add that it's not only the release that magically turn the astaxanthin in an other color. The bounding to the protein is imposing a particular shape.
The color of this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astaxanthin#/media/File:Astaxanthin.svg" target="_blank">molecule</a> comes from the 2 exterior rings. Basically those rings can twist along the long chain and that affects their properties for &quot;coloring&quot;.</p>
<p>The molecule changing from twisted to untwisted lead to color changing.</p>
<p>My laboratory is working with <a href="http://www.unige.ch/sciences/chiorg/matile/probes" target="_blank">this lab</a> that work a lot on those kinds of molecules that could act as sensors of how twisted they are, reflecting the nature of their surroundings. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
