		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a myth. </p>
<p>If you observe a water droplet, with some basic understanding of magnification, you'll see the focal point is below the leaf. Since we're probably not all scientists, how about this? </p>
<p>Imagine that you're holding a magnifying glass. You're trying to burn some paper with sunlight! Now, holding the lens right up the paper does nothing, why? The light needs to be more tightly focused, and the lens can not redirect enough light into a small enough area at that distance. </p>
<p>The same is true for water on plants. The droplets can not focus the light intensely enough on the leaves at the distance they are from them (directly on top). </p>
<p>This myth stems from the fact that intense summer heat will cause plants to dry out and get burned. This happens naturally when the sun is too strong for the plant and when the plant is not well watered. However, many people will water at the strongest sun, thinking it would help. The plant is burned by the sun anyway, and they inaccurately attribute it to the water. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't.  The silly idea that water acts like a magnifying glass is just an urban myth.  Even if it did act that way, it would absorb most of the heat.  Watering can boost the contrast, making your dead grass more visible.  And it can be a waste, because much of the water will evaporate under the hot sun.  </p>
<p>Quite simply, if your grass is having issues with the heat, it needs more water.  The best way is to water after the sun goes down to ensure more of it goes into the soil than the air.  The risk of this is that it will allow some mushrooms/fungus to grow as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Watering in and of itself will not &quot;burn&quot; your lawn for reasons others have already noted.   However, I have seen people &quot;burn&quot; lawns and gardens by spraying them with very hot water.  Take a long section of hose, filled with water from previous waterings, leave in hot SC sun all day, voila.  It only takes one or two of these experiances before they learn to run the hot water out of the hose before turning it on plants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Best time: just before sunrise</p>
<p>Also less water use in the morning than the evening, so better water pressure</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it is not a myth,  but to quote &quot;The Firm's&quot; song &quot;Star Trekkin'&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>you cannot change the laws of physics.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we have to look, what does cause the effect and what not. the waterdrop itself will not harm the leaf it sits on, because the focus point is farer away than the leaf itself.</p>
<p>when the sun is after rise or before dawn, it comes from the side, focusing through any sitting drop, and the focus point may hit another leaf and burn it there. as one has not the power to prevent rain - and therefore waterdrops - on every grass on the planet, every grass would be burnt everytime it rains after sun rise or before sun dawn. this doesn't happen, so there are other factors to watch for.</p>
<p>01.) the cut. get a cylinder mower for a perfect cut. other mowers hurt the grass too much. when the upper end of single grass leaves becomes brown, it is dehydrated due to the higher amount of vaporating water in the cut section compared to the amount of water that can be brought up from the roots - even if enough water is in the ground.</p>
<p>green grass will not suffer from magnified sunlight throu water drops. only brown, dry grass is in danger.</p>
<p>02.) have the grass long enough. here in central europe, we have an average climate and in summer i never get below 5 cm of length. in dry areas one needs longer grass, Great Britain is wet enough for 3 cm only. when the grass is long enough, it gives some shadow to itself. sun directly on the ground is drying up the ground's biosphere.</p>
<p>the shorter the grass is compaired to the climate, the more you have to do for it. one can have a 12 mm golf green grass for sure, but you gotta mow it twice a day, you need to find out, what te floor needs and so on.</p>
<p>03.) have the grass tight. aside from the lenght, it needs to be tight and bushy. remove all the weed and make sure nothing else exept grass grows. in spring hatch the lawn. this will cut some of the roots and the weak plants, that are not deep and strong enough in the grass will be removed. the other plants will grow better.</p>
