		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a question of whether the photons of a given wavelength/frequency/energy interact well with a material. Gamma radiation is too high-energy to interact with atoms other than just blasting electrons completely free, which ionizes the atom (hence the term &quot;ionizing radiation&quot;). Radio photons are too low energy to do anything on a photon-atom level, but a radio wave can affect large numbers of atoms in something like a conductor.</p>
<p>Visible light is a particular range which tends to correspond to atomic orbital energy levels. An electron requires a specific amount of energy to jump up one orbital, and releases a specific amount when dropping down one. The amount of energy absorbed/released by those processes tend to be around the visible range. So, visible photons are happy to be absorbed and/or emitted by atomic matter. That's why we evolved to see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add a little image: You can imagine the electrons connected to their atoms with little springs. When the wave passes through the oscillating electric field will try to make the electron oscillate with it. Different frequencies of the oscillations affect the electron on the spring differently, if you've ever looked at the forced oscillations in classical mechanics. </p>
<p>Thus, when the frequency is too high the electron can't follow on its slow spring. But when the frequency is similiar to the eigenfrequency of the spring, the electron will move accordingly and absorb the energy with 'friction'. When the frequency is too low, nothing much happens again. </p>
<p>This is of course just a rough analogy, but can explain some properties of light in a material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not just that the electrons are excited. It is not like your wall starts glowing with an emission spectrum.</p>
<p>It is more that the interaction of waves and particles has to do with the wavelength and the size of the object. Reflection as much as absorption and emission. </p>
<p>A very small wavelength (less than an Angstrom, aka shorter than 10^-10 or so) meters is able to pass through the atoms because they are able to sort of dodge through without interacting with anything. If they are wavelengths significantly larger than the atoms they dodge around the edges of objects smaller than them (which is why radio waves go through windows and around mountains, but you lose them in valleys). They actually don't go through super solid walls all that well, which is why you put the TV antenna on the roof.</p>
<p>This is why you can only see things in the micrometer range with visible light that is reflected, need an electron microscope to see things an the sub-microscopic level that visible light will not have enough resolution to show you, because the visible light and the electron wavelength are different lengths. It is also why your car antenna is about half a meter long in order to most easily pick up the resolution of radio waves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
