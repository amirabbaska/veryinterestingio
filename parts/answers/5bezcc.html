		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MD here. This question has been asked many times on ELI5 and has generated many highly suspect answers. If you read through all of the various answers each time this is posted, occasionally someone will do the right thing and actually look this up on PubMed or the medical literature. What they find is that this phenomenon isn't well studied or understood by medicine. It is a multi factorial problem that involves blood vessels, pigment deposition, subcutaneous fat, genetics, and hormones. Most answers on this page are overly simplistic. Some things are just poorly understood by medical science and this is one of them. If you want the right answer it is this: it's not well understood. </p>
<p>EDIT: Well, I posted this when there were already hundreds of comments and I thought no one would read it. Props to the reddit algorithm and the ELI5 community for digging my comment out of the dirt. I wish I could provide a more interesting answer but I suppose the boring truth is better.</p>
<p>EDIT2: That cortisol answer is completely wrong. Here's a tip: when someone can't spell the name of the hormone correctly, they probably don't understand the complex hormonal axis it belongs to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone gets bags, some people get dark shadows under their eyes instead, in any case, it is genetic. If your mom has them, then you will have them, tired or not. The fluid is not draining out. Also, iron pills help. Menstruating women lose a lot of iron so some have a tenancy for dark shadows. It also helps to get at least 8 hours of sleep,But technically, bags under your eyes indicates that you have fluid collecting in the loose skin or a filling of the fat deposits in that area &quot;creating shadows&quot; and causally, you have bags under your eyes or dark circles under your eyes.</p>
<p>Just some other couple of factors</p>
<ul>
<li>Vitamin-deficiency </li>
<li>Poor diet </li>
<li>Overexposure to sunlight </li>
<li>Overuse (number one culprit: long-term pc monitor-reading) </li>
<li>Sleep deprivation </li>
<li>Allergies </li>
<li>Genetics/heredity </li>
<li>Cigarette-smoking </li>
<li>Disease or illness (or organ damage) </li>
<li>Natural aging </li>
<li>Stress </li>
</ul>
