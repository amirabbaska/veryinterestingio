		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing really.</p>
<p>We already knew different genes can express differently depending on the type of stress the individual is in.</p>
<p>Frequent or long term starvation/malnutrition for example can result in pronounced changes to how the body handles growth and development. It's one of the reasons why when a society transitions to one in which food is consistently readily available, average height of the population increases each generation for a while.</p>
<p>So the &quot;change in DNA&quot; touted is a predictable result of the unique long term stress of weightlessness. A cool headline, but something we expected before we ever sent him up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This NASA Twins Study is really interesting, but it has led to a lot of misconceptions. </p>
<p>Primary point - DNA did NOT change by 7%.
I quote the NASA article (first link): ''Researchers now know that 93% of Scottâ€™s genes returned to normal after landing. However, the remaining 7% point to possible longer term changes in genes related to his immune system, DNA repair, bone formation networks, hypoxia, and hypercapnia.''</p>
<p>This does not talk about 'genes', it talks about gene expression. The genes themselves have not changed. Another paragraph taken from the Twin Study Findings (second link):
''Whole genome sequencing was completed and showed each twin has hundreds of unique mutations in their genome, which are normal variants. RNA (transcriptome) sequencing showed more than 200,000 RNA molecules that were expressed differently between the twins.''</p>
<p>In other words, the DNA sequences did not change (other than the telomeres, which is still very interesting), but the expression of these genes did change, likely in adapting to the unique environment of space. </p>
<p>So to answer the question, I don't think that this changes anything that we know about DNA, because this study is actually talking about genetic expression.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's important to remember that this experiment wasn't controlled for crappy space food. </p>
<p>A leader on the NASA twin study now works at my cancer center and just presented this. They couldn't get the ground twin to eat freeze dried for a year (suprise)! Given how intricately linked diet, immunity, ageing, and gene expression are - we don't know which part of space affected the telomeres. Could've just been the food ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, it didn't actually change any of his DNA.  Like the sequences aren't now different from what they were when he went into space.  The only thing that changes is how those genes are expressed, which is old news.  They teach you about how this sort of thing happens in Molecular Cell Bio, which is a third year college course in Biology programs.  The only thing new about it is that the journalists who wrote about it were just familiarized with the phenomenon for the first time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;DNA has been changed&quot; is very misleading. The DNA is essentially the same sequence and unchanged. It is the expression of genes of the DNA that has changed, likely due to epigenetic modification which is how the cell adapts protein production based on outside influences. For example, if you are starving to death, your cells will begin to produce proteins by gene expression in a way to attempt to cope with these changes, at least temporarily. Well, when your body is in space, your cells will attempt to adapt to these changes and the expression of the genes will likely change, as they did here.</p>
<p>To say they are no longer twins by their DNA is a bunch of clickbait BS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
