		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you generally have an idea of where your body parts are located. however, in the case you describe, i think you feel the torque applied to your body. if your arms (or hands) are at the same location on the surface (but opposite sides), and you push your arms together, your body should experience no net torque. however, if your arms are in different locations, pushing on the surface would apply a net torque to your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have some specific nerves in your muscles that register their contraction. So for example of you would squeeze your biceps really hard with your eyes closed, you can still determine in which angle your elbow is in. When you combine all these receptors in all of your muscles you can estimate where you expect your hand will be. Together with your vision and experience in seeing your own arms in front of you this makes you quite precise in estimating where your hand will be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of perception (through various senses) and training. The hands are frequently used together, so you are probably training this particular skill on a daily basis with mundane activities like buckling a belt.</p>
<p>More interesting is how easy it is trick yourself through false perception. Google &quot;tactile illusions&quot; and you will find all sorts of ways to trick your mind about where a body part is or what it's sensing. Like optical illusions, they demonstrate that our senses are not machine-like data processors. They are optimized through evolution for certain functions and can be extremely misleading in other situations.</p>
<p>For example, this article describes how your mind can be tricked to believe a rubber hand is actually yours...</p>
