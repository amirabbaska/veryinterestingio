		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Home dishwashers are made to stretch the wash cycle out to save money, using less water in short bursts, stuff like that. If your dishwasher is a newer model, it should have several options. One of those should be a quick wash, which you would use if you need the dishes washed in a hurry, more like a restaurant's. Only use that one if you're in a hurry, though. It's better to use the regular one to save energy and money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally a post on my inordinate and unwanted expertise and I'm probably too late! Here goes anyway:</p>
<p>As a former restaurant dishwasher for about 2.5 years, these machines would be <em>hugely</em> inefficient for home use. The home dishwasher is made to be more water and energy efficient, as /u/IllyriaGodKing said, while the industrial sized machines are made to be efficient over many, <em>many</em> uses.</p>
<p>Firstly, in the case of the one restaurant I worked for, the machine wasn't owned by the restaurant, but leased from the company that made it. This gave us access to their repairmen when things inevitably and frequently went wrong. Paddles sticking in the on position, paddles sticking in the off position, not drawing on any soap, using too much soap, drain clogs, power failures, heat failures, nearly everything that you could imagine to go wrong did at one point. You need access to these professionals or all of their tools and knowledge.</p>
<p>Second, these aren't made for you to cook throughout the day, load up all your dishes at once, and be done in three minutes. I want one myself for that reason, because that kitchen spoiled me as far as quick and easy cleanliness. What they're made to do is fill up a large, multiple gallon tank of water in the morning, keep it heated all day, wash many large loads through the day, and empty and clean out at night. This is how they become efficient and affordable for a restaurant; they actually have a quantity of dishes to call for it as a need. At home, we'll waste gallons of water and lots of energy.</p>
<p>Finally, all the maintenance that isn't covered by the aforementioned professionals: regular ass cleaning of this giant ass machine. You'll need to do it <em>a lot</em>. Solid food waste will get stuck in the drains, the water jets, the gratings below the wash area. The presence of large quantities of water on rust resistant metal will cause lime to build up in great amounts. In my nearly 3 years at this restaurant, we spent many efforts trying to get all that gunk off, and I never once saw it completely lime-free.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I asked this once when I was working as time worker, and another time when I saw a way bigger version for a work canteen with lots of people coming through.</p>
<p>The smaller versions:</p>
<p>Blast the dishes with high preassuer and lots of heat. Only certain lipsticks dont come off with those. These are used if at &quot;smaller&quot; concert halls with &quot;fine dining&quot; (champagne, red wine, salmon). They basically are cupboards with high pressure system in it that starts as soon as you close it.</p>
<p>These are normaly only used for glasses and small plates, not for cutlery.</p>
<p>The bigger ones in canteens, have conveyor belt system, and are nasty deathtraps. They work with several high pressure nozzles, very high temperatures (if I remember right &gt; 100Â°C ) and also need quit agressive cleaning detergents, and have 3 compartments, cleaning, rinsing, drying. </p>
<p>They get everything from the plate, glass, cutlery. They proably would destroy and finer porclain. </p>
<p>For why deathtraps: sometimes  compartments with dishes in them get stuck, you need to step in and manually correct them. They are high enough to stand upright, but the visibility is quite low from outside towards service. As with the others, closing the hood starts the process. If you don't lock that down, and somebody starts with you inside the world of pain starts.</p>
<p>Had this happen once in one of our canteens (before it was &quot;ours&quot;) after hours, no more customers; closing down. Kitchen helper hops in to fix something, &quot;assigned dishwasher&quot; closes the hood, &quot;kitchen head&quot; saw the hood closing and rush over to hit the emergency shut of while at the same time calling an ambulance, all withing seconds.  That guy almost was cooked alive in a man sized pressure cooker. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Restaurant models also are more like sanitizers in my experience.</p>
<p>You've got someone washing dishes roughly then they get run through the dishwasher as a final measure. It also helps them dry as it's so hot.</p>
<p>If the dishwasher (person) doesn't rinse properly you'll get bits of food stuck to the dishes when they comeout of the machine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
