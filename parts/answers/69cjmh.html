		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So actually declaring war and breaking off diplomatic relations are two separate processes. You can cut off diplomatic relations with someone without declaring war on them and you can declare war on someone without cutting off diplomatic relations. In actual fact usually you cut off diplomatic relations with someone in order to warn them, and avoid a war; once war is joined that strategy clearly hasn't worked and so you actually start to rebuild diplo relations, because you need them to negotiate peace etc..</p>
<p>Often you don't want to lose face by reestablishing relations in public with your enemy and so the first diplomatic contacts will be secret. So for example Kissinger's secret first talks with North Vietnam.</p>
<p>The UN is different though. One of the great values of the UN is that even when countries aren't willing to have relations with each other, they both have relations with the UN. And so the UN becomes a mechanism for enemies to talk. Mostly indirectly, but occasionally ambassadors will chat in the corridors, or address each other in/through GA or committee meetings.</p>
<p>Edit: you might hear people talk about &quot;track one&quot; and &quot;track two&quot; diplomacy. Track one diplomacy is official discussions between nations. When those nations are at war track one isn't really possible except by formal peace talks. Track two is informal discussions, or discussions by non-state actors (NGOs academics etc..) on the state's behalf. Most peace processes start as track two initiatives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no set procedure.  Sometimes they avoid each other, somethings they refuse to be in the same room to try to make people pick sides, sometimes they try to provoke each other.  Occasionally, they even act like adults and engage in diplomacy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have to have their fellow representative buds with them constantly, so if they ever encounter the other warring country, they can make a big fuss pushing and shoving trying to get to the other guy while their buds pretend to do all in their power to hold them back. This way a fight never actually breaks out, no damage is done in the UN chambers, however everyone's bro cred remains in tact. </p>
<p>It's all basically bro theater in the UN.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ties at the UN are with the UN. If the two countries are on the same committee, they will likely go to the same meeting so as not to 'lose face' and to keep an eye on the other one. </p>
<p>The embassies in each others countries are the ties that would get cut. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
