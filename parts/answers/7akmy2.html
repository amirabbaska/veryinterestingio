It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Projectively_extended_real_line" target="_blank">Projective Real Line</a>, and it, and its brother the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_sphere" target="_blank">Riemann Sphere</a>, are used all the time in math and physics. The only issue is that it's pretty abstract, there are a lot of nonstandard arithmetic rules that you have to keep in mind when using it, and it deals with infinity in a different way than you see in Calculus, which is via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_real_number_line" target="_blank">Extended Real Line</a>. (Working with infinity on the Extended Real Line compared to the Projective Real Line is analogous to treating +0 and -0 as different things.)</p>
<p>Even more abstractly, there is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheel_theory" target="_blank">Wheel Theory</a>, but I've never really ever seen it used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other comment basically nailed it, but i may as well give my two cents.</p>
<p>The fundamental issue is that, once you divide by zero, you lose information. In the complex plane, there are an infinite number of paths to infinity, which is analogous to the fact that there are an infinite number of paths to the origin.</p>
<p>The useful information is stored in <em>what path is taken</em> to infinity, and you lose that information by going all the way to infinity. So the best tactic is to do what they teach, to work around it by modifying the expression in ways that avoid dividing by zero.</p>
<p>We can talk about dividing by zero to reach <em>the point at infinity</em> or <em>approaching division by zero from the left, 0-, or from the right, 0+</em>, but these conditions need to be managed carefully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's nobody stopping you from defining an arithmetic with division by zero, but if you do, division and multiplication will lose an important relationship. Specifically, they won't really be inverse operations anymore. Take any three nonzero numbers a, b, and c (or, if working in the type of algebraic structure called a ring, take three objects that are not zero divisors) and imagine you have the equation ac=bc. Then it's fine to conclude a=b, which we can show by dividing both sides by c. If we were to take distinct numbers a and b, then certainly a<em>0-0-b</em>0, but we can't conclude a=b. Division by zero would allow for this, unless we changed multiplication or division so that it's no longer the case that a/a = 1 or (ab)/c = a(b/c). Then something may work out, but you still have to change a lot more than adding a value for 1/0.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people focusing on the zero; I'd like to focus on the imaginary numbers.</p>
<p>An important thing to realize is that imaginary numbers aren't really imaginary.  They are real and they have a purpose.  It's just a really bad name for them.</p>
<p>A good way to think of imaginary numbers is to think of a number line.  One, two, three, and so on...  If you go backwards, you end up using negatives (which were difficult for some societies to comprehend).  This line helps with 2D math of adding and subtracting and multiplication, but in multiple dimensions like electric and magnetic interactions we need more numbers.  So the imaginary numbers are on a different dimension, like x,y axis.</p>
<p>. . . . 2<em>i</em></p>
<p>. . . . <em>i</em></p>
<p>-2 -1 0 1 2</p>
<p>. . . . -<em>i</em></p>
<p>. . . -2<em>i</em></p>
<p>So when you multiply by 2, it doubles your position on the number line.  If you multiply by <em>i</em>, it rotates 90^o on the number line.  That's why <em>i</em>^2 = -1, because it flips 90^o twice!</p>
<p>So &quot;imaginary&quot; numbers are still actual numbers that you can do math to like any other number, while zero is nothing and dividing by nothing creates problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can. The trouble is, unlike the case where you extend from the real numbers to the complex numbers through the imaginary numbers, in this case you have to sacrifice something. (Well, actually you do have to sacrifice something going from real to complex, namely the ordering of the line, but you gain a lot more in return, and in this case, the sacrifices are bigger, deeper, and more fundamental.)</p>
<p>There are 2 ways this can be done: One is called the projective reals, the other is called wheels. Actually, the latter represent a generalization of the former.</p>
<p>The former is built up by defining that a/0 = infinity, when a != 0. This new &quot;infinity&quot; element (whether you want to call it a &quot;number&quot; or not is up to you), is defined so that -infinity = infinity, which is different than one might at first think: the same infinity is approached in both directions (positive and negative) along the real number line, so the reals now go like</p>
<p>infinity &lt; ... &lt; -2 &lt; -sqrt(2) &lt; -1 &lt; 0 &lt; 1 &lt; sqrt(2) &lt; 2 &lt; ... &lt; infinity</p>
<p>in a loop. (To actually describe the order structure on this you need what is called a <em>cyclical ordering</em> which is a <em>triadic</em> relation on three extended reals: &lt;(a, b, c) instead of a &lt; b. This is because the usual dyadic order now becomes degenerate: we have that whenever a &lt; b, b &lt; a, because b &lt; infinity and infinity &lt; a so b &lt; a by transitivity. The triadic relation allows us to establish a clear &quot;direction&quot; in which we're pointing along the circle. So you now have &lt;(a, b, infinity) but &lt;(b, a, infinity) is not the same thing - note how the infinity establishes a &quot;baseline&quot; against which we can compare a and b.)</p>
<p>But when you do this, you now <em>lose</em> a lot of operations, that is, a lot more operations now become _un_defined. You trade one exceptional case for many. For example, 0*infinity cannot be defined sensibly. Nor can infinity/infinity, or even infinity - infinity, or <em>even</em> infinity + infinity. And that last one is really bad, because addition is usually considered a fundamental operation, and the closure (that you can add two things in the set and always be assured to attain a third in the set) is a fundamental property of not just reals but most structures in abstract algebra, and so dispensing with it is a serious penalty indeed.</p>
<p><em>Wheels</em> follow this idea further, and define that 0/0 = nullity, along with 0*infinity and the other undefined cases above - &quot;nullity&quot; is a second element we introduce to patch them all up. In that case you now have a closed system again, but when you do this, you really start to mess with the algebra rules like your division now becomes a unary, and not binary, function: the symbol &quot;/a&quot; is what you need, which corresponds to a generalized notion of multiplicative inverse (namely /0 is not inverse, but /a = a^-1 when the inverse a^-1 exists), and multiplication now ends up with a rather more complicated distributive law (and some other laws, too.).</p>
<p>The whole reason for this is that if you naively go about applying the field laws (the ordinary algebraic laws you learned in school, essentially), you get nonsense, like this:</p>
<p>a = b</p>
<p>a^2 = ab.</p>
<p>a^2 - b^2 = ab - b^2.</p>
<p>(a - b)(a + b) = b(a - b). (A)</p>
<p>a + b = b. (B)</p>
<p>2a = b (since a = b)</p>
<p>2a = a</p>
<p>2 = 1.</p>
<p>Oops. The division by zero occurs in moving from (A) to (B) (since a = b then a - b = 0 and thus we canceled zeros on each side.). Thus the assumption of the ordinary field laws leads to a contradiction. Indeed, this should be expected, because you can prove from them that zero has no multiplicative inverse (reciprocal). Thus if you try to treat it like it has one, you end up with nonsense from the principle of explosion (everything - or nonsense - follows from a contradiction, at least in classical logic. Which of course suggest another way out, dink around with the underlying logic :) Not sure anyone's tried that out but yes in mathematics you can even dink around with logic! And no that's not silly, or dumb; indeed a whole field called &quot;constructive mathematics&quot; is based in large part around the consequences of rejecting the idea that &quot;either something is true or it is not true, there is no middle ground.&quot;, expressed by the logical meta-statement &quot;|- P or NOT P&quot; (meaning &quot;(everything) entails P or not-P&quot;, that is, P or not-P is tautologically true.)).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
