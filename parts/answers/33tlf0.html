		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tlwr; Yes and No, depending on the rules.</p>
<p>In acoustics class this problem was on the second homework.</p>
<p>Assume a Cabernet bottle, the kind with &quot;neck and shoulders&quot; not the tapered kind.  It makes the math easier.</p>
<p>Basically you model the air in the neck as a mass.  Model rest of the bottle as a spring.  The frequency goes as SQRT(area/(length*volume)) for a neck of a given length and area.</p>
<p>There are some fringing effects so you should probably add 0.6 the diameter of the neck to the neck length to account for the mass of the air that is near but not in the neck.</p>
<p>So, if you knew dimensions of the neck of the bottle, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_resonance" target="_blank">yes you could figure it out</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Engineering student here and a musical enthusiast. Different shapes produce different notes/tones. So no, you wouldn't be able to determine the volume this way. Also the design of the opening determines the frequency of the tone produced as well as intensity of your blowing. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Since a lot of people are telling me that bottles that contain water at different volumes make different tones, that is true, but you have to think, if you place the same volume of water into a another bottle of a different shape but the same volume,you will produce a totally different tone. </p>
<p>Also, you can test this by simply blowing into a bottle that contains some water and as you blow change the angle of the bottle and you'll notice you produce a slightly different tone. This is because the shape of area you are blowing into is changing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you only want the volume and not the shape, then theoretically, yes, this is Weyl's law (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_law" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_law</a>)</p>
<p>I don't know about 3d shapes but there are 2d shapes that are isospectral (they &quot;sound&quot; the same) without being isometric (so they're not the same shape) (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_the_shape_of_a_drum" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearing_the_shape_of_a_drum</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: not unless you know the neck cross-section area and length.  Yes if you do.</p>
<p>Such a bottle is simply a Helmholtz resonator, which to first order can be described as a mass spring system, where the column of air in the neck is the mass and the spring is the compressible air inside the main volume of the bottle. What you get is a dependence of the form fres ~ sqrt(A/(L.V)), so if you know the neck parameters L (length) and A (cross-section area), you can solve for V.  Google &quot;Helmholtz resonator.&quot;</p>
<p>Some caveats apply, such as the bottle length has to be significantly smaller than the resonance wavelength, and if the shape of the neck is not cylindrical, you have to go back to the derivation and you'll get an answer in terms of neck volume (easy enough).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
