<p>Your heart gets stronger through 2 methods: hypertrophy and <strong>contractility</strong>. Typically through exercise the latter happens - your heart doesn't get more muscular so much as it gets better at squeezing out the blood that's there. This is why elite athletes heart rates slow down, to even the 30s-50s when you look at cyclists - their <strong>stroke volume</strong> (how much blood the heart moves with each pump) improves. </p>
<p>In normal exercise conditions your body mass and cardiac health increase 1:1 (ish). This becomes untrue if you build muscle through anabolic steroid use, which also has its own independent negative effects on the heart, hence why increasing muscle mass rapidly through non physiologic methods is unhealthy.</p>
<p>In obesity, your heart undergoes hypertrophy to compensate for the added work. However, this works against the heart because not only does it have to pump blood, it has to <em>relax</em> to let blood fill. Imagine you have a cup that suddenly becomes 2 inches thicker on the outside <em>and</em> inside - suddenly the cup holds less volume, and the heart actually has to pump faster to put out the same volume as before. Again, typically the way you gain bodily muscle mass involves exercise, so the exercise has its own effects that puts people on a better path.</p>
<p>The things other commenters are talking about - hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (sudden death from heart muscle that is too thick) - are unrelated to your total body mass, these are typically genetic conditions that affect both athletes and non-athletes (it just tends to kill you at moments when your heart is working harder).</p>
<p>Edit: here's an excellent diagram of the different types of cardiac hypertrophy. Notice that in the athlete's heart the muscle gets thicker <em>and</em> the chamber size widens. In the obese and diseased person the muscle just gets thicker without that compensatory dilatation. <a href="https://www.msdnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sudden-death-in-hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-rarely-associated-with-exercise-Science.jpg" target="_blank">https://www.msdnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sudden-death-in-hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-rarely-associated-with-exercise-Science.jpg</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Long answer: Extra muscle does need oxygen and nutrients, so there might be some strain to the body, and that is why you need to work hard to keep that extra muscle. However, fat tissue also needs oxygen and nutrients, but that is not the main source of stress on the heart. Fat can be accumulated near vital organs, blood vessels and even the heart, making it hard for them to do their work. Even worse, if you are fat enough you may start having fat deposits <em>inside</em> your veins and arteries, which on top of putting additional strain may also form clogs, leading to heart attacks or strokes. This is why excess fat is so dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would actually think up to a point of muscle building the heart can compensate-in many athletes there is natural hypertrophy (“thickening/enlargement”) of the heart muscle that is compensatory to account for the activity the person is posing and is good. The thicker the walls the stronger the heart can push blood. However, there’s a point where that compensation can fail leading to cardiomyopathies. I would think this “point” would be hard to reach in athletes though. It’s also very common in race horses to skip beats or have natural hypertrophy as they are essentially running machines. </p>
<p>However, with that being said I know many body builders die of cardiomyopathies and cardiac-related deaths- I never thought of this as a possible cause but it makes sense- muscle requires a lot more vasculatization and blood flow to operate and if you have too much muscle your blood volume may not be able to equilibrate for that much mass. </p>
<p>Really interesting question- I’ll do more research and let you know if I find anything too! </p>
<p>Edit: Here’s and article on athletic hypertrophy: <a href="http://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2014/10/14/11/02/the-athlete-grey-zone-distinguishing-pathologic-from-physiologic-left-ventricular-hypertrophy" target="_blank">http://www.acc.org/latest-in-cardiology/articles/2014/10/14/11/02/the-athlete-grey-zone-distinguishing-pathologic-from-physiologic-left-ventricular-hypertrophy</a></p>
<p>Also, from what I’m reading it’s because of steroid use (anabolic steroids) that body builders have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physiology professor here. So the extra muscle requires increased oxygenation and nutrients. No big deal at first. But, there are conditions where the cardiac muscle keeps growing and can get substantially larger. It's usually doing this as an attempt to make up for other heart muscle that isn't working at full capacity. The problem is, usually the reason the heart muscle is failing to produce the contractile force necessary to act as an effective pump is because it's not getting enough oxygen (perhaps because of a clog). This means that by adding more muscle tissue, you're essentially adding more mouths to feed in the middle of a famine.</p>
<p>I'm sort of assuming you are asking about extra muscle on the heart rather than around the body. If you mean around the body, yea the heart has more work to do, but in a fit individual this really shouldn't matter. The problem arises when your myocardial tissue isn't getting enough oxygenation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The load on the heart is its average power. As muscle mass increases the blood flow it demands increases, especially during exercise. Cardiac output, the flow rate in Liters/minute goes up. The average power is mean arterial pressure times cardiac output. So both factors go up and so does the load on the heart. Adipose tissue has low capillarity and low metabolic activity and thus low blood flow; it add little to cardiac load other than a blob that needs to carried up steps and the like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
