		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your ears had a period to adjust</p>
<p>If you go from silence to loud music your ears are going to be in high sensitivity mode and will hurt</p>
<p>If you go from moderate volume to  loud noise your ears will be in low sensitivity mode and the shock won't be as hurtful</p>
<p>It should be noted that no matter how much adjustment time you give your ears, you will still damage them after a certain volume</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe this analogy helps:
When you're in your dark room for longer time (e.g. sleep), your Iris gets bigger, thus more light enters your eye and it will be more sensitive.
But when suddenly a lot of light floods your room (e.g. you switch on the lights), you will have that uncomfortable feeling, that it's too bright. But after some minutes your getting used to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your ears can change their sensitivity somewhat. When you hear a loud sound, immediately followed by silence, it almost hurts more going back to silence than it was when it was loud because your ears suddenly adjust wildly to loud and back to quiet. You can almost feel them straining. </p>
<p>When a loud sound is transient, like a gunshot, the body can't react fast enough to prepare for it but when the loud sound is continuous and built up to it, it has time. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons why it is possible to damage your hearing without realizing it. If you listen to loud music over a period of time, eventually it will not seem that loud and you might be tempted to turn it up further. </p>
<p>When doing hearing critical things like mixing music, or live audio monitoring, you have to be careful to know exactly  where to set the volume, and then leave it there. Otherwise you may be listening at too high a volume and not realize it. </p>
<p>By way of example, listen to a sound at an uncomfortable volume for a few minutes, and then turn it back down to a level that is normally reasonably, and it will sound too quiet. Mute it for a minute, then play it at that same low level and it will sound loud enough again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the ear senses sound due to sound's vibrational nature. an object that creates sound causes the air pressure between it and your ear to go through slight compression, and then decompression (otherwise known as <em>rarefaction</em>).</p>
<p>think of a <a href="http://www.school-for-champions.com/science/images/sound_transverse.gif" target="_blank">sound wave</a>; the x-axis represents time, and the y-axis represents whether the air pressure is currently undergoing compression or rarefaction. the line in the middle represents a point where the air pressure is neutral. </p>
<p>when you are listening to a song, the sound wave is constantly going up and down, representing the level of compression and rarefaction. however, because it is a continuous line, it is smooth and doesn't attack your ear too sharply.</p>
<p>however, if you pause the song in the middle of a cycle of compression (the <a href="https://www.learner.org/courses/mathilluminated/images/units/10/1854.png" target="_blank">top or bottom</a> within the wave, and then un-pause it, your ear is going from a neutral compression level to an extreme one. this sudden jump is what causes your ear to react violently, and if intense enough, can cause SERIOUS damage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
