		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bit late to the party and I think /u/AgoraiosBum summed it up well, but I'd like to add a little more. I realize this goes a bit beyond &quot;ELI5&quot; but I think the issue also goes a bit farther than poor drinking water and is worth talking about. China is currently investing in some of the largest and most expensive engineering projects in world history to deal with their water issues, and these projects could have impacts outside their borders. Here's a few key points:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>China has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yu_the_Great" target="_blank">thousands of years of history</a> in creating (and destroying) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Canal_\(China\)" target="_blank">water-management infrastructure</a>, the combined effect of which has been the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_resources_of_China#cite_note-1" target="_blank">severe depletion of groundwater</a> reserves and increasing desertification in some parts of the country. The most visible effect of this has been the <a href="http://chinawaterrisk.org/opinions/yellow-river-changing-course/" target="_blank">changing course</a> of the Yellow River. In modern history there have been several years where the river has not reached the sea due to overuse and drought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Industrial waste and fertilizer continue to pollute several major waterways, especially the Huai River system which is home to the famous <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/04/china-villages-cancer-deaths" target="_blank">&quot;cancer villages.&quot;</a> Over 80% of China's remaining groundwater is also contaminated, <a href="http://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1935314/80-cent-groundwater-chinas-major-river-basins-unsafe" target="_blank">primarily by toxic metals</a> from industry and fertilizer runoff. Incidents usually get cleaned up but because economic development is so important polluters often get away with minor punishments and end up polluting again. Part of the problem is that it's currently cheaper for many factories to pay the fines than to follow environmental regulations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Northern China (including Beijing) has a much bigger problem than Southern China. A major part of the infrastructure being created to deal with this problem is the [Southâ€“North Water Transfer Project] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%E2%80%93North_Water_Transfer_Project" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South%E2%80%93North_Water_Transfer_Project</a>). The basic concept is to divert water from the Yangtze River Valley to help alleviate shortages in the North. The not-so-basic part is that it has already cost over $79 billion dollars (over twice as much as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Gorges_Dam" target="_blank">Three Gorges Dam</a>), led to the resettlement of over 300,000 people, and only one of the three main routes has been completed. That route has already begun pumping about 10km^3 of water per year to the North, which is expected to rise to between 12 and 13km^3 by 2030. It's also worth noting that <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/02/world/asia/02water.html?pagewanted=all" target="_blank">as the impact of the project has become clearer</a>, new projects have had to be started in order to compensate for environmental damage and water loss along the canal routes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some solutions have the potential to become diplomatic issues. China controls the headwaters of the Ganges, and <a href="https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/4349-Diversion-debate" target="_blank">some discussion</a> has occurred among academics about diverting Tibetan waters in order to deal with the crisis. So far though these are just hypothetical plans for what could happen if the crises becomes significantly worse.</p>
</li>
<li>Desalination is a <a href="http://www.waterworld.com/articles/wwi/print/volume-25/issue-6/regional-spotlight-asia-pacific/market-report-developing-desalination.html" target="_blank">growing market</a> in China, and makes sense since a huge portion of the population lives along the coastline. While desalination plants have been slow to spring up due to huge investment costs, over time more plants might become viable and help ease some of the burden off of natural freshwater systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall the question of &quot;how bad is it?&quot; is difficult to answer at this point because a lot of solutions are still panning out, and new policies are being created and tested. If you'd like to learn more about the history of water crises and water management in China, I recommend <em><a href="http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058248" target="_blank">The Yellow River</a></em> by David Pietz, which was published in 2015 and is pretty up to date.</p>
<p>Edit: I guess I should mention I'm getting a M.A. in China Studies and this was part of my research for a paper on environmental litigation</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The are building a lot of infrastructure to help convey water from places that have it to places that need it, and working on cleaning up the pollution. But a lot of people will be drinking bad water in the meantime. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Jiaxing, Zhejiang (about 30 minutes west of Shanghai on gaotie).  Last year I edited a paper by a professor who had been studying the water quality of the area.  As I recall, there were something like 5 levels of water quality and the water quality of Jiaxing was so bad it didn't even make the scale.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's bad. There are no safety or environmental standards in China and where there are, they are either ignored, data is misreported or monitoring equipment is manipulated. Toxic waste is just dumped, on land, in rivers or at sea because it's easier and less expensive. On land this eventually gets into the water table causing any water to come up from it to be polluted in some way. </p>
<p>The food, water and air are all poisoned. To give you some idea of how bad the air is, the PM2.5 air partical scale only officially goes up to 500 because the people who made it couldn't conceive of a place on Earth so awful. In the Winter, you can regularly see levels go as high as 1000. 150 is considered hazardous. </p>
<p>You're seeing a lot of news about green China is right now, I can assure you it's all propaganda and promises to do something eventually. And I expect to get a lot of down votes by people who have never lived in China or Hong Kong. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
