		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5:</p>
<p>Imagine you're in a courtroom, and you're guilty of a crime. You owe an exorbitant fine, and you can't pay it.</p>
<p>Then a man comes along and offers to pay it for you. This is the only man with enough money to pay that fine, and he pays it in your place, satisfying the legal requirement.</p>
<p>That's what Jesus did.</p>
<p>Every human who sins is guilty, and (according to the bible), deserves death. One of us cannot take on the death sentence for another, as we all have our own death sentence. In other words, I can't die for your sins because I have to die for mine.</p>
<p>Jesus is the only human who never sinned, being God in human flesh. Since He had no sin, he could take the place of others. He willingly was tortured and killed, and God placed our sins on Him. His physical death paid the 'fine' for us, freeing us from court and from everlasting death.</p>
<p>Jesus was a perfect scapegoat, without any spot or blemish, and by accepting him and respecting his wishes for what he did, we are saved by his payment.</p>
<p>TL;DR A perfect man died, so that he could pay for the sins of imperfect men. Read Romans 1-6 for the full explanation, as well as how to take advantage of the payment.</p>

<p>Edit: I am glad to see the interest, and thanks for the gold and the discussion! A lot of questions that people have are legitimate, and I'm glad to see that some other people helped out while I was sleeping. Since this is the very simple ELI5 version, I left a lot of the details and the whys out of my explanation.</p>
<p>Since the thread is locked, feel free to PM me or one of the others in this thread. I promise, I will respond with civility, and no question is a bad one.</p>
<p>Second edit: I've read the comments, and oh I wish I could respond! Circumcision, God's motives, justice, scapegoats, the possibility of being saved without Jesus, Spiritual death vs. Physical, etc. I'd be happy to answer any questions I can! And hopefully in as simple of terms as I can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are interested in an ELI30, graduate-level answer, you could do worse than to check out the writings of Rene Girard, especially <em>Violence and the Sacred</em>, and <em>Things Hidden Since the Foundation of the World</em>. </p>
<p>In his later life he became somewhat of a catholic apologist, although a kind of heretical one, which succeeded in pissing off a lot of people. But he started his career with a fairly scientific/analytical approach towards trying to understand why some myths &quot;took&quot;, while others did not. I.e., why did thousands or millions of people fight and die for this or that idea, and not for this other one. </p>
<p>At the core of his theories is a hypothesis that human societies require an enemy and scapegoat, and periodic sacrifice. I.e., that human organizations are held together by unification against external threat, and by someone to blame for whatever is wrong. He presents no small amount of evidence in support of this theory, from all kinds of primitive and early-historical societies, and ties it into his larger theories of mimetic desire, which gets a lot more complicated. </p>
<p>Skipping over a lot of stuff, Girard theorized that the Christ-myth was unique in making the scapegoat/enemy also the deity, and thereby <em>exposing</em> the mechanism of outward enemy as unifying force, and allowing for new, more sophisticated social structures that did not require opposition, conquest, or war against external tribes, cultures, or supernatural forces. </p>
<p>To grossly over-simplify, Girard saw &quot;primitive&quot; religions as those which imagined vengeful, jealous, capricious gods, who demanded subservience and sacrifice, like a supernatural &quot;boss&quot; or &quot;big man&quot;. Judaism, uniquely among ancient religions, in his view, had a deity which required not just prescriptive behaviors and sacrifices, but also recognized nuances of intention and desires. The Jewish God not only forbade taking another man's wife, he forbade even thinking about or desiring it.  </p>
<p>In Gerard's system, societies always need a sacrificial scapegoat. If they cannot find an external one, they will find an internal one. This mechanism enforces tribalism and small networks. The theory is that the Christ-myth exposes the need to scapegoat, and provides a universal scapegoat, and negates the need for constant supply of new sacrificial victims, by making the deity himself the universal victim. </p>
<p>We all killed God, we are all the enemy of God, and yet he forgives us, and dies for us whenever we sin. The barbarian at the gates is ourselves, and we cannot defeat the enemy except by being better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>Great question.</p>
<p>The questions is asking according to the Bible, and I do not see to many responses answering in that form.</p>
<p>There are multiple texts which seem to indicate different reasons why Jesus had to die to save humanity. But to answer the question, we must first discuss what we needed saved from. The answer can be found in Genesis 3 where Adam and Eve disobey God. This event is teased out by St. Athanasius in his book &quot;On the Incarnation&quot; where he shows that in Genesis, God said if you eat of this tree, you will surely die. </p>
<p>I would add this to the top comment. The top comment focuses on &quot;forensic&quot; righteousness. Or a righteousness viewed in light of the law/ a legal decree of God. This Biblical position, which complements a forensic righteousness, is called recapitulation. Humanity was under the headship of Adam, the fallen man. </p>
<p>Romans 5:12-21 discusses this, along with any passage that talks of humanity now being under Christ. in summary, Romans says, &quot; For if because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ. Therefore as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men. For as by one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous.&quot; (quoting vs 17-29).</p>
<p>These views are not exclusive. I hold to both a forensic and recapitulation view. </p>
<p>Another view which I do not see represented here and has a lot of biblical traction is the idea of Ransom. If you have ever read/watched the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis, then you saw a ransom theory. That God had to &quot;buy&quot; us back from the devil who owns us. This is close to the forensic view, but puts more of an weigh on the cosmic battle between God and the Devil. Biblically, Jesus says it in Mark 10: 45 &quot;the son of man has come to give his life as a ransom for many.&quot;</p>
<p>I gotta run, but hope this is helpful! Lots of great reasons. Sorry I was not able to address the change on earth aspect or the why did he have to die. Each of these perspectives would nuance the reason differently, but all are pretty cool!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So these answers aren't the whole story as far as I can tell. There are different &quot;atonement theories&quot; that answer this question in different ways. I'm sure someone is going to tell me no, there's only one way, but I feel like regardless of your personal beliefs OP deserves to know there are many ways to think about this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The one I saw most in this thread, (substitutiary atonement) - humans are bad, Jesus is good, we deserve to die, Jesus takes our place and we're forgiven. </li>
<li>&quot;Moral Exemplar&quot; - Jesus teaches us how to be the best people we can be by being a moral example. Why did he have to die? To show us how our sinful society naturally kills the innocent. He makes the earth better by the example he sets. </li>
<li>&quot;Christus Victor&quot; - In the grand battle between God and evil, evil holds humans as slaves. Jesus steps in and by dying and rising defeats evil and opens eternal life.</li>
<li>Eastern Christians have complex beliefs about how God became human (Jesus) to sanctify every stage of human life. He had to die because death is a part of life. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Jewish religion was based around the idea of sacrifice: if you did something wrong, you had to pay for it. You would take a sacrifice to the temple -- depending on how much you had and what you had done wrong, this might be some grain, or perhaps a couple of birds, or something bigger like a lamb or an ox. The idea was that you had to make amends.</p>
<p>If the sacrifice you brought was a live animal, it was slaughtered. In those days, people believed that the life of an animal was contained in its blood (not surprising, given that if you bleed a lot you can die), so it was the blood that somehow made everything work and got you forgiveness from God.</p>
<p>Sacrifices were made on other occasions, too. One of the most important was the festival of Passover, when Jews would slaughter and eat lambs. This goes back to the story of the Exodus, when the Israelites escaped slavery in Egypt: according to the legend, God sent the Angel of Death to kill all the Egyptians' first-born sons, but the Israelites smeared the blood of slaughted lambs on their doorposts so the angel would spare them.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to the time of Jesus. According to the Bible, he said some nasty things about the religious authorities, saying that they were exploiting ordinary people. He suggested that there was no need to make sacrifices: God would forgive you anyway. The religious authorities didn't like that, so plotted to have him killed. Of the four Gospels, two of them say he died the day after the Passover, and one (John) says he died at the very moment the Passover lambs were being slaughtered. </p>
<p>A bit later, St. Paul joined the movement Jesus had started, and developed a theory about Jesus's death and why it was necessary. Blood, he said, was necessary for the forgiveness of sins. Jesus was the ultimate sacrifice: as he was &quot;the son of God&quot; (however you interpret that phrase), his blood was enough to grant forgiveness for us all. There was no need to bring any sacrifices to the temple, and no need to convert to Judaism.</p>
<p>It seems a bit weird to us now, but that's because we're not used to a sacrificial cult. It was really St Paul's attempt to give Jesus's death some kind of symbolic meaning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
