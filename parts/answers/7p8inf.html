		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>capsaicin and sinigrin, the spicy components in chilis and mustards respectively, can oxidize when exposed to oxygen and lose some of their spice. </p>
<p>edit: for a little more detail, capsaicin binds to very specific neuronal receptors in the body that are related to pain and heat. When the capsaicin molecule binds, it acts like a key opening a lock. The action of opening the lock causes your brain to experience it as heat or pain, because that is the specific type of lock (receptor) being opened (activated). When the capsaicin molecule is exposed to excess oxygen molecules for extended periods of time, its structure can change, thus the &quot;key&quot; may no longer fit into the &quot;lock&quot; and you experience less pain/heat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
