		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary way is stocking. People love to stock sport fish like trout and have been doing so in mountain lakes for over 100 years by now.</p>
<p>A lot of these ponds would have historically been dominated by aquatic salamanders and inhabited by frogs, which trout quickly wipe out via predation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just watched a documentary the other day on something similar to this. There is a golf course in Australia that has a good size (landlocked) pond as one of the hazards. One day a golfer went into the clubhouse and said he swore he saw a fin in the water. The management chalked it up to just a drunk guy seeing things. </p>
<p>After numerous complaints they finally started to look into it. Lo and behold there were a bunch of bull sharks in the pond.</p>
<p>I guess back in  <del>90's</del> 2011 the course got flooded really badly and a few bull sharks managed to make it from the river next to the course into the pond. Now they have signs warning golfers not to go fishing for their golf balls. Pretty wild.</p>
<p>edit:words and also I didn't think anyone would read this but it seems to be getting some interest so here is a <a href="https://www.golfdigest.com/story/throwback-thursday-golf-course-sharks-pond" target="_blank">link</a> describing the incident. I was kinda drunk while watching the documentary so some of the dates in my OP might have been off haha</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since lakes, rivers and other bodies of water can get cut off from their sources over time, the fish found in many mountain lakes are likely the offspring of older generations of fish who stayed in the waters as natural processes took place to separate it from its source. Just a thought. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of eggs are sticky, they could travel on birds and aquatic mammals.  Flooding could also allow fish to swim upstream.  This is neglecting fish introduced by man.  It would take a while but over thousands of years it could happen, getting closer to the lake, little by little.  Say a cormorant regurgitates some food for a chick and drops some eggs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
