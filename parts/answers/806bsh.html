		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Napa winegrower here.  99% of quality winegrapes in California are picked at night...or very early morning.  The vast majority of lesser quality fruit is also picked at night...or very early morning.  Picking during the heat of the day during the late summer would mean the crop would enter the winery extremely warm and would actually begin oxidizing or fermenting on the truck...then need to be cooled in the winery anyway for winemaking.  There are also traffic considerations...hundreds to large double trailer trucks moving on the roads during rush hour would be a bad idea.  During harvest, most winegrowers and industry workers sleep during the late day and work all night...for 2-3 months...starting early with champagne and ending with the dark reds like Zinfandel or CabSauv.</p>
<p>Update: Yes by champagne (or sparkeling wine for sticklers) I am referring to Chardonnay, Pinot noir, and Pinot munier...it's just a whole lot easier to say champagne...again, this is Reddit...not winemaking 201)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants in general (including grapes) accumulate more sugar during the day due to heat and sunlight (this is also why you might see horse pastures with grass picked clean out in the open, but still growing decently in the shade of a tree). At night time when it's cooler there is less sugar and the acidity is more &quot;balanced,&quot; which can affect the flavor. For wine production, producers may prefer this night-time chemical profile to give the desired flavor of their product. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a wine tour of Northern California during harvest a few years ago and everywhere we went harvested at night. I recall the primary explanation we heard mentioned was to reduce the amount of juice that gets wasted, as the temps were still over 100 degrees (F) during the day in autumn. </p>
<p>But here’s an article that mentions the sugar and several other considerations. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here’s the reason: </p>
<p>Grapes harvested at night come into the winery at a cooler temperature. That means it takes them longer to naturally start fermenting, and even as they start fermenting (usually in the first 2-7 days), the rate is much slower than if they come into the winery at 80+ degrees. This supposedly means that the yeast struggle more to ferment the grapes, they have more time and contact with the grape skins (where most of the color, tannin, flavor comes from), other strains of bacteria (which in a certain quantity is ok) have time to start the fermentation process adding additional characteristics to the wine. </p>
<p>That said, the classic joke in the industry is this:</p>
<p>How many winemakers do you need to ask to get an opinion about the right way to make wine? Two. And each will have at least two opinions about it a piece. </p>
<p>So... take it with a grain of salt. I know fancy pants winemakers who SWEAR by inoculating with lab grown yeast ASAP so that they don’t get any “off-flavors” I know other fancy pants winemakers who SWEAR that they would never inoculate their wine (and then inevitably do when the odd-ferment fails to start and they don’t want it to become vinegar). </p>
