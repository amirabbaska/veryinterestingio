Not everyone can say that. So: congratulations for looking at the world through a scientific mind!</p>
<p>Sure, there are atmospheric tides. There are solar tides although not in a gravitational sense, but a day-night radiative cycle. They play a very important role in atmospheric motions and mixing of air in the different layers of the atmosphere. For the moon tides, in the first place, keep in mind that when the oceans rise and sink, the atmosphere suffers the inevitable rising-sinking consequences too. However, there is an intrinsic gravitational atmospheric tide not coupled with the oceans. Lunar tides can be observed in the pressure pattern (once all other perturbations are eliminated) although they are very, very small (0.01% of the surface pressure). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
