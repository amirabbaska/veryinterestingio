		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow! Something I can actually answer. I do a lot of translation work for news articles and documents for this in China, so my scope will be limited to China and some of its own cities and their sister cities.</p>
<p>The sister city program is a way for smaller cities (usually not Tier 1, which was a lot less until a few weeks ago) to get their name out in a country or region by pairing with another city in some way or another, promising better rates and opportunities for business, investors, entrepreneurs, and other notables between the two cities. It helps to foster a bond that will hopefully reap economic benefits sometimes in the near future.</p>
<p>They provide opportunities for students and other citizens with potential to visit schools and universities in their partner to help foster studying abroad and communication that, again, they will hope will foster economic connections and benefits later.</p>
<p>One of the more notable ones is Lodz, Poland (I think) and Chengdu being sister cities, which led to the first direct train route being built between the two cities, allowing for a lot more trade to happen between the region and Chengdu, which being a Tier 2 city, did not get some of the benefits cities like Beijing or Shanghai were privy to. Then, more direct routes from their respective airports opened up and have led to a more direct connection, both metaphorically and physically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many years ago I ran the Sister Cities program for a major US city that had 6 sister cities. In that city, at least, the programs were initiated by groups of citizens who wanted to create exchanges, each for different reasons. Most were cultural, but some involved business exchanges. Some groups petitioned the city to make new Sisters in order to make a political statement.<br />
At that time that I was there, the city put very little money and effort into supporting the exchanges, which were mostly arranged and financed by the citizen groups running them. So each program was only as active as the citizen group.<br />
The Sisters in other countries had differing levels on interest, too. In some, the Mayor's office was very interesting in the exchanges, spent a lot of money and worked very hard to promoted the connection. In other cities you could barely get anyone from the Mayor's staff to answer the phone.<br />
In my time at that job I helped to coordinate student exchanges, performances by artists from the Sister Cities, a couple of trade shows. The program was not very active.<br />
The bottom line is that each program is different, depending on the parties involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sister cities, as mentioned elsewhere, are about joint economic growth and partnership. I won't delve into that because there's already been a great response on it.</p>
<p>Twinned cities don't always mean anything besides diplomacy, if that. Certainly in the UK it's largely just a hangover from the war, where it was believed that getting two countries heavily involved with one another would make another war less likely. Twin <em>cities</em> will often promote cultural and commercial links and perhaps even international business links, but for the most part twin <em>towns</em> (and villages) don't really have any connections besides in name.</p>
<p>E.g. my hometown of Crawley, population ~100,000 in the UK is twinned with Dorsten, population ~80,000 in Germany. And yet, I'm guessing maybe 1 in 20 people from either town would be able to tell you that.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with how the concept of the EU came about - fostering cultural and financial ties between nations in order to encourage peace and not have another war in Europe - it's basically the same thing at a more local level, although each twinning program is independent and don't necessarily mean anything at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a way to create greater diplomatic connection on a local level.</p>
<p>It is something that became popular after WWII with the general idea being that people would be much less likely to violently murder each other if they knew the people on the other side as more than faceless enemy.</p>
<p>They created partnerships between towns in different countries and organized cultural exchanges on a local level.</p>
<p>Usually the partner towns are similar in size and have something in common. Sometimes the something can be that both towns have an economy based on the same industry. Sometimes it can be something like the reason Coventry and Dresden became twin cities: They were both bombed a lot during the war.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually had a first hand experience with city twinning. I was part of a cultural artist exchange program between the cities of Detroit and Turin, Italy. The cities are sister cities due to their respective relationships to the auto industry. The project was officially endorsed by the cities mayors and universities. The universities funded our travel. It was an exchange between musicians and visual artists from the two cities. I went to Turin twice and hosted a photographer from Italy here in detroit several times. It was one of the amazing experiences of my life. It lasted a few years and by the time it was over we had put on some concerts and exhibitions in each city, and I made great new friends in Italy who I later revisited and stayed with. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
