		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravitational binding energy is given by U=3GM^2 /5r. Pluto has a mass of 1.309E22 kilograms, and a radius of 1185000 meters. This gives a gravitational binding energy of 8.130691E39 joules. This is a ludicrous amount of energy. It would take over 3.5E22 Tsar Bombas to provide that much energy. I did this on a napkin and my phone, so if I'm off by an order of magnitude, my apologies. It's still more energy than we could harness. </p>
<p>Edit: formatting. </p>
<p>Edit2: I'm off by a lot of orders of magnitude because I used the wrong value for radius. It's still more energy than we can conceivably harness at 5.8E27 Joules. Sorry about that error. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While we could certainly turn the surface of a planet into a radioactive wasteland, unfortunately we simply lack the means to destroy the structure of Pluto due to the massive amounts of energy required to do so.</p>
<p>That is why we chose the cost-effective solution of declassing Pluto from planet status, thus breaking her heart and devastating her.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, follow up question; since flat out destroying Pluto wouldn't be realistically possible, what COULD we do with the tech we now have?</p>
<p>Perhaps nudge it on a collision course or eject it from the solar system? What could we do to realistically get rid of Pluto?</p>
<p>[Purely hypothetical, don't worry Pluto, we certainly don't want to get rid of you ;)]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would tend towards nudging other celestial bodies into a collision course with Pluto, such as asteroids or comets.  There is also no timescale specified, so there is the possibility of initiating a chain of events that over thousands or millions of years, results in the eventual destruction of Pluto.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
