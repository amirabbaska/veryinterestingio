		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! Notice that for the 2D curves you describe, they take the form F(x,y)=k for some function F and a constant k (e.g. x^2 + y^2 =1 is the unit circle). The restriction on the values of the function F set up a relation between x and y that gives us the specified curve (and we get the x and y by selecting all the x and y values that satisfy the relationship (1^2 + 0^2 = 1, so x=1 y=0 satisfies the relationship)).</p>
<p>Now think about the function F on its own, without any restriction on its value. We have no relation between x and y, but we can look as the range of values by graphing the 3D figure z=F(x,y). We can set up many different relations of x and y by selecting z=k (same as F(x,y)=k, like before). (These are called level curves of F)</p>
<p>But now let's consider a function G(x,y,z). We could look at the range of values by setting up u=G(x,y,z), but we can't look at a graph of that because we have for variables so we need a four dimensional figure to set it up. But we could set up the level curves of G and have a relationship between values of x, y, z. We can graph that relationship (and we might get the paraboloids you were talking about). In the same way we select values of x,y for F to get circles, we can restrict the values of G to get values of x,y,z that make spheres. </p>
<p>The important difference is that we have no 4D graph to cut out from to get 3D graphs, while could cut 2D graphs from 3D ones. In terms of equations though, it all works the same. </p>
<p>I'm going to come back with some links soon when I get off mobile.</p>
<p>EDIT: Rereading your question, I now need to answer specifically for Conic sections. So let's apply my arguments for that.</p>
<p>Lets work with the classic conic sections. F(x, y)= sqrt(x^2 / a^2  ±   y^2 / b^2) (Where, if you are not familiar, ± means it could be a plus or minus sign). <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?t=crmtb01&amp;f=ob&amp;i=graph+sqrt(x%5E2+%2B+y%5E2\)" target="_blank">Here is a picture of z=F(x, y) for simple a, b and the plus sign</a>. We can get different conics depending on how we choose a, b and the ±. We get the &quot;standard form&quot; or conics by selecting F(x, y) = 1. So let's look at G(x, y, z) for the next dimension up. </p>
<p>The form of G(x, y, z) is similar; G(x, y, z) = x^2 / a^2 ± y^2 / b^2 ± z^2 / c^2. We certainly get the same result if we take G(x, y, z) = 1, where we can manipulate the values of a, b and the ±'s to get the different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric#Euclidean_plane_and_space" target="_blank">quadric surfaces</a>. But we can't call z = G a 4D cone right off the bat, can we?</p>
<p>Let's see if the identifying features of the 3D cone are the same as the 4D one, and for simplicity, let's consider a standard, right cone (a = b = c = 1, all ±'s are plus). One identifying feature is that cones are flat, or rather the rate of increase as we go straight out from the center is constant. Mathematically, we look at the direction and magnitude of the gradient vector of the function, which points in the direction of greatest increase. The gradient points straight away from the origin and always has magnitude 1, so it constantly gets wider, and at a constant rate. That's all we need. (If you want to know the vector, it's (x / sqrt(x^2 + y^2), y / sqrt(x^2 + y^2) ). </p>
<p>Let's look at the 4D cone and look at the gradient vector for that. Direction? Straight away from the origin. Magnitude? 1. So as far as we can tell, it's a cone. We can't graph it to make sure, and more math would get complicated quick, and in my case, it's overkill.</p>
<p>So yeah. The quadric surfaces are cuts of a 4D cone just like 2D conics are cuts of a 3D cone.</p>

Algebraic Geometry is taking a look at the graphs and surfaces when you set F(x, y) = 0, but when F only involves powers of x and y (no e^y, sin(sqrt(x)), etc.). More generally, it looks at the &quot;solution sets&quot; to polynomial equations of many variables. The solution sets, with other conditions, are called &quot;algebraic varieties.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's just a bit harder to think about because we don't normally see 4D shapes around us.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, some surfaces are sections of a higher dimensional cone, similar to how some curves are sections of the normal cone.</p>
<p>However the normal cone is special in the sense that <em>all</em> curves defined by a second order polynomial (one containing only terms like x, y, x^(2), xy, y^(2), for more info see '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conic_section" target="_blank">conics</a>') but when you generalize to higher dimensions those kind of surfaces (called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadric" target="_blank">quadrics</a>) <em>aren't</em> all sections of a higher dimensional cone.</p>
<p>In general you need slightly more shapes to take sections from to get all possible quadrics. These shapes are all defined by an equation of the following form: 0 = X_0^2 + X_1^2 + X_2^2 ... + X_(n-k-1)^2 - X_(n-k)^2 - ... - X_n^(2), where 0&lt;k&lt;n/2.</p>
<p>When n=2 there's only one such shape, the one defined by x^2 + y^2 - z^2 = 0, which is a cone. For n=3 there are 2 such shapes, one is the higher dimensional cone x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - w^2, but there's also the shape defined by x^2 + y^2 - z^2 - w^(2), which is somewhat hard to visualize but if make one of the coordinates constant then it becomes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperboloid" target="_blank">hyperboloid.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
