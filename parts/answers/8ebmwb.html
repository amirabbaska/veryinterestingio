		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pimples cause inflammation of the surrounding tissue and it's this swelling that causes the pain. The skin of your face and back is loose and able to stretch so the swelling is tolerated better. </p>
<p>The nose and ears are cartilage and there is much less give to the skin there, and also a lot of pain receptors. The pimple puts pressure on the pain receptors and since there is less room for the swelling, the pressure, and pain, are higher. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurophysiologist here:  </p>
<p>The correct answer:  </p>
<p>The density of somatosensory (sensation, which includes pain) receptors is higher in the face (and particularly around the mouth, eyes, and nose) than in other parts of the body.  </p>
<p>Nostril pimples (and pimples on/near the lips) hurt more than in other areas because local inflammation caused by the pimple is activating more pain nerve endings than pimples located in other areas of the body - because of the higher density (pain endings per surface area of skin) of somatosensory receptors in this part of the body.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
