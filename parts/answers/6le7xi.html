		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trade for the most part is not between nations but between companies and people.</p>
<p>Governments don't really get all that much involved much at all on trade inside the EU anymore than US states would be involved in intrastate commerce in the US.</p>
<p>The EU as a whole negotiates deals with other countries or unions of countries. for the most part those aren't deals like selling a certain quantity of some product, but setting down the rules by which corporations and people in the countries can trade with each other.</p>
<p>Agreements are between the EU and foreign countries are negotiated as a whole because there is strength in numbers.</p>
<p>The EU collects due from its members and uses that money for various projects in the EU. The poorer countries in the EU mostly get more money invested into them locally by the EU than they pay into it.</p>
<p>As for defence, the majority of EU nations are also in NATO and the EU treaty itself has mutual defence clause in Article 42.7. If a member country gets attacked and invokes this article the rest of the EU would support them. A war that was waged offensively by an EU member would more ambiguous but also far less likely.</p>
<p>There are currently movements in progress to further unite and integrate the militaries of the countries with one another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>How does trade work between the 28 members of the European Union internally...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The EU is considered a &quot;single market&quot;. This means everyone uses the same rules and standards, and there are absolutely no trade restrictions or barriers between EU members. Everyone can trade with everyone at all times.</p>
<p>In many respects this is just like how US trade works between states.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>...and (more importantly) as a group with the rest of the world?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Trade agreements with other countries (or trading blocs) only need to happen one time. The EU negotiates as a single trading bloc (again the &quot;single market&quot;).</p>
<p>While the initial negotiations are more complex (since all 28 members must agree to the same deal) - once you have the agreement, you can trade freely with all 28 EU members.</p>
<p>The upside is of course since the EU is such a massive market, it can negotiate favorable trade deals (since few if any countries want to be left out). It also simplifies trade with the EU in the long run, because you only have to negotiate it once (rather than 28 times) and you only have to meet the one common standard (for example safety regulations) rather than 28 different sets of regulations.</p>
<p>It also greatly benefits smaller countries, since they can all go &quot;to the front of the line&quot; along with all the other members. So Estonia gets the same great deal as Germany, but Germany also gets a better deal because everyone combines their economic clout as one entity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who contributes which goods/services and how much?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is no such agreement on specific goods and services - it's a free trade agreement. Anyone can produce something, and sell it to another EU member as if it was their own country. The differences in production really come down to differences in cost of labor, infrastructure quality and capacity, local environment, and various other factors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Who makes proposals and agreements and who can shoot them down?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The EU does, or at least its institutions, one of the most important being the European Comission.</p>
<p>Also any single member can shoot it down. Everyone has to agree on new rules and agreements.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How are resources pooled between the 28 countries?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All members contribute a percentage of their GNI (gross national income) which is around 1% - and this is used to fund EU activities. Larger economies obviously pay more, and less developed countries may receive more funding in return than their contribution. The general idea being that all of Europe is better off if we help make sure development across the bloc proceeds more rapidly than if left alone to their own devices.</p>
<p>Other than that, all countries keep their own taxes / funds / resources.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Would a war between one of the 28 and another nation (say spain/argentina) effect how the other 27 trade with either?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, that defeats the purpose of the single market. For example, if you recall the 2nd gulf war - the UK and Poland were official belligerents against Iraq - yet intra-EU trade did not stop or even get reduced at all. Despite protests from other EU members</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well the 28 countries function as a union with a pre agreed tariff free access to each other's markets. By doing this they are able to regulate and streamline the process. What this means inflation is under control among those countries and market are efficient. Now as a union of 28 countries trade, internationally is much simpler than having individual trade agreements. It's a win win situation, where the union manages to get a good deal as they are a bigger organisation and the exporters get to export and take part in 28 countries as opposed to just one :) hope I have answered your question </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
