		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well subspecies is a rather nebulous term. See when a two population of the same species become separated geographically, they won't exchange genetic material through breeding. If they are separated for long enough of put under enough pressure, they will genetically change enough that they will eventually become different species. But it's a long process so you have some population are that in between. Meaning they become different enough that they are clearly not the same species, but didn't change enough to be clearly two different species. But you probably don't talk about that, because there isn't that many subspecies. You probably talk about species that look similar, like how there is like 8 different species of bears.</p>
<p>Now it depend on what you consider human. Are human only homo sapiens or all Homo are humans? Because there was something like 16 different Homo Species. Some went extinct by their own, but other were assimilated or killed off by home sapiens. The difference between other animal and us is our intelligence. The intelligence that allowed us to spread to the whole globe very quickly. See usually animal don't spread as much and if they do, it take them a LOT of time. So by the time they reached another continent, they already became a new species. We spread so quickly, that by the time we covered all of the planet we were still the same species and competed with all the other Homo species for resources and we won all over the world. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your definition of &quot;human&quot;, but it is not unfair to say that neanderthals were human, or that homo floresiensis or rudolfensis should be considered human. Neanderthals died out 30,000 years ago, and floresiensis were around as recently as 12,000 years ago (with the very first cities being as much as 8-9000 years old, this is surprisingly recent). So you could say that up until very recent human history, there were human subspecies which we interacted with. We even mated with neanderthals.</p>
<p>Now, why humans currently are the only ones left is a matter of speculation. It could be that we simply killed off the others, or that we out-competed them in the struggle for resources and food. Or something else. We simply do not know.</p>
<p>If you are interested in this and don't want to dig into really hardcore anthropology, I can recommend the book &quot;Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All modern humans <em>are</em> a subspecies, <em>Homo sapiens sapiens</em>. There is an ancestral subspecies also defined, <em>Homo sapiens idaltu</em>, and some taxonomies propose classifying Neanderthals as a subspecies of <em>Homo sapiens</em> rather than a separate species.</p>
<p>A major objection to classifying human racial groups as subspecies is that the variation in smooth and different features vary in different ways. To identify subspecies it's usually expected that there is distinct uniformity within each subspecies and clear differences to the others and that's not the case for humans.</p>
<p>Evolutionarily, the ability and willingness of humans to cross all sorts of geographic barriers is probably what's prevented the races from becoming clearly distinct subspecies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many examples of animals where there is only one living subspecies, humans are not unique in this regard.</p>
<p>There were other subspecies of <em>Homo sapiens</em>, but there are not extinct.</p>
<p>We don't consider human races to be subspecies, because in general, there is more genetic diversity within a race than between races.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we killed all of them.</p>
<p>There used to be a time where there were a few different human-type beings that lived concurrently. Homo Sapiens weren't the strongest of the bunch, rather, we were the smartest, so we were able to conquer the other species of human-like beings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
