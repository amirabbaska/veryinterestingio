		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paper is weighed in sheets before it's cut to size because there are different sizes. Standard office paper is called bond paper, which is 17” x 22” uncut, so 500 sheets of 17” x 22” paper weighs 20 lbs, which can be cut down to 5 sizes, the most common of which is 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;. Just to make things confusing, different stocks (types of paper) have different sizes their weights are measured from. Having no standard size for the uncut paper makes it hard to compare different weights. Thankfully there's a alternate way to measure paper weights grams per square meter (gsm). Since the size is always one meter, you can reliably compare the weight of any type of paper in any size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I the UK we use gsm.  Note it's not specifically the thickness as you could have a thicker but less dense paper having the same 'weight' as a thinner denser sheet.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The term GSM refers to the substance weight of paper and card. GSM is an acronym for “Grams Per Square Metre’ which means how much a single sheet of paper measuring 1m x 1m weighs. The lower the GSM the lighter the paper and the higher the GSM the heavier the paper. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The paper you buy in the store is cut from larger, standard sizes of paper. Imagine one big sheet of paper. You could cut it in half, or into four pieces, or more. This is where we get other &quot;typical&quot; paper sizes, like 8.5&quot;x11&quot;. </p>
<p>Before cutting paper down to the sizes we're used to seeing, we have big sheets, and those have been standardized. This includes width, length and thickness. Because width and length of these big sheets don't change (actually they do but it doesn't matter for this explanation), the easiest way to measure thickness is by weighing stacks of these large paper sheets, because thicker paper weighs more.</p>
<p>So the standard is to stack 500 big sheets of paper, weigh it, and then cut it however you want. In your case, you bought paper that came from a stack that weighed 20 lbs before getting cut. Since they cut it down into multiple stacks after weighing it, your stack weighs only a few pounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a single piece of paper the size of a single's tennis court (the inner lines, not the outer ones).</p>
<p>A piece of paper this big would weigh 20 lbs.  Then you cut it into smaller pieces.  So the weight of 500 sheets depends on how small your sheets are, but the &quot;20lb&quot; is based on this one giant sheet.</p>
<p>^^Note: ^^The ^^comparison ^^isn't ^^perfect, ^^but ^^it's ^^close.  ^^Half ^^of ^^a ^^basketball ^^court ^^also ^^works</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>GSM makes a lot of sense because once you figure out it means grammes per square metre, you have your answer.   </p>
<p>That said, it's not easy to visualise the weight of a square metre of paper, personally I'd probably prefer microns of thickness or something. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
