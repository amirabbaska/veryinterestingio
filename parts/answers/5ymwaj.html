		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially it works the same way. <a href="http://www.ee.columbia.edu/~dpwe/papers/Wang03-shazam.pdf" target="_blank">Here's</a> a paper by the people behind Shazam where they detail a part of their method. By taking small snippets of waveforms and frequencies, they can compare them to every song in their database with similar waveforms and frequencies. </p>
<p>For example, if you're humming the star wars theme it will see where your volume increases and decreases and map a basic waveform that it can search against most songs to eliminate them since 95% of music won't be similar to that pattern right off the bat. From there, it looks to see if your volume is increasing at the same time as the songs it believes you're humming.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: This is a bit of speculation combined with knowledge of how the original music matching from Shazam works. The specific process is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_by_humming" target="_blank">Query by Humming</a>. <a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/zeno/Papers/humming/humming.html" target="_blank">Here's</a> a neat paper from Cornell that goes over the process in way more depth. A lot of it is just pattern recognition based on pitch and a hundred other measurable variables.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
