<p>If so, could the perchlorates be getting picked up on the surface of Mars? </p>
<p>And... IF SO... (sorry, lotta hypotheticals), we could hypothetically drill down and find a healthy pH water?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>But I guess we should still be able to electrolyze it pretty easily if we want it, and if its a steady supply?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
