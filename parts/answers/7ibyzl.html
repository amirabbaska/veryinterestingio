		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun is fusing hydrogen to helium right now and has trace amounts of other elements from the original solar nebula. In about 5 billion years so much hydrogen would have been converted  to helium that hydrogen fusion will stop and the sun's helium core will collapse under gravity increasing temperature and pressure until helium can fuse to carbon. The higher temperature causes the outer layers to expand into a red giant. The sun is not massive enough to fuse carbon. So, a star the size of our sun can't run on carbon or heavier elements.</p>
<p>More massive stars will fuse carbon and with sufficient mass all the way to iron. At which point the core collapses to a neutron star or black hole, typically with a super nova.</p>
<p>Since, iron has the lowest energy per nucleon element no energy can be produced by fission or fusion, so clearly the Sun cannot run on any material because it clearly cannot run on iron.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you throw something onto the surface, you increase the mass of the Sun, while the core will continue to fuse hydrogen - just faster than before. What you throw in doesn't matter as long as it has mass.</p>
<p>If you magically manage to mix your new stuff in: If it has hydrogen, you supply the Sun with more fuel (and more mass). Basically everything organic has hydrogen in it. Without hydrogen, you make the hydrogen burning faster (from the increased mass), after it runs out of hydrogen it will fuse helium to carbon. If you supply enough new matter, it will also be able to fuse carbon with helium to oxygen, and oxygen with helium to neon, and possibly a few other reactions. Nitrogen plus helium to fluorine would be an exotic reaction, but with enough nitrogen it should be possible. That means all the main components of organic matter can be used as fuel - if the star is heavy enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, only lighter elements can fuse in the gravitational conditions of a star. Hydrogen is the most common, but heavier stars also &quot;burn&quot; a fair bit of helium, lithium, and so on. But when the available fuel gets up to iron, that's where stellar fusion can no longer happen, and the star will die if only iron and heavier is available.</p>
<p>OTOH, when a very massive star goes supernova, the energy produced is sufficient to fuse smaller nuclei into heavier elements, all the way up to uranium, the largest naturally-occurring element. ALL naturally-occurring elements heavier than about lithium were created in stars, mainly supernovae.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun as a whole has tons of other elements in it but itâ€™s source of energy is hydrogen fusion which occurs in the core. A star begins to die when it starts to run out of   Hydrogen and it starts to fuze helium. This is the red giant stage. This reaction keeps escalating until Iron is produced in the core. At this point fusion stops and the star dies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
