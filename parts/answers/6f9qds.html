		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an Infrastructure Issue.</p>
<p>Chip Cards have added Security Features. These features are meant to make forging a Chip Card <em>incredibly</em> difficult, even if you manage to get a Skimmer working for them. However, more complex security features require more Computer Processing to verify and authorize.</p>
<p>The Chip Cards are new, and they're running on the older hardware made for Swipe Cards. This hardware isn't fast enough to do Chip Cards as quickly. You've basically traded some Time for Security.</p>
<p>Chip Card Transactions <em>will</em> become faster as the Infrastructure is improved. It's just a matter of waiting for companies to get that Infrastructure set up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right, chip cards do take longer. According to the <a href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-how-chip-cards-work-htmlstory.html" target="_blank">Chicago Tribune</a> here's why:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The delay is due to the added security features, the primary reason for using the technology. Specifically, the chip in the card is generating a unique encrypted message between the store and the bank's network.... All of this is more secure than the old slide-card technology </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mag stripe is an info dump.  Machine reads the stripe, grabs what it needs, then throws that up to the processor who gives the thumbs up or thumbs down.</p>
<p>Chip and Pin is more complex.  Behind the chip there is a computer, and the computer needs to encrypt the message.  Due to this there are two trips that need to be done to the processor.</p>
<p>So in short, there's more going on when you use EMV (Chip and Pin) than with a mag stripe.  This more stuff takes more time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
