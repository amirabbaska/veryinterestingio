		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phenomena is triboluminescence.  It's not entirely understood by science, but what we think is happening is that when the tape is peeled, it creates charge (e.g. one surface keeps an electron when they're ripped apart).  That charge quickly recombines, which--in air--ionizes the air and makes light.  Absent of air, it seems the charge leaves as X-rays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>X-rays come from high voltage in a vacuum, where any flying atoms aren't stopped by air.  Charged atoms and free electrons are always present, and they always speed up because of high voltage (because of electrical forces.)  In air, this barely can happen, because flying particles are mixed in and become part of the air.  (We can't create 10,000KPH wind.  But it's easy to create 10KPH individual atoms.)  </p>
<p>When in a vacuum, single particles stay alone, and they don't create any wind when moving.  Without the air-drag, they can speed up enormously.  They can impact surfaces with extreme energy, and they spit out x-rays during those collisions.  So, to make some penetrating radiation and x-ray photos, we just need some high-voltage well above roughly 15,000V (above 30KV is even better.)  Rug-scuffing can't do this.   We'd need a VandeGraaff or a Wimshurst generator, or a step-up transformer with an extreme voltage step-up ratio.  (Back in 1910, hospitals were using Wimshurst generators to power their x-ray machines.  VandeGraaffs and HV transformers came later.)</p>
<p>So, a vacuum chamber always gives us an accidental, unexpected x-ray tube.   Just apply some high enough voltage inside it.</p>
<p>But with tape-peeling, where does the high voltage come from? This was discussed in a 1994 Science News article: <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=in+the+peel+zone+tape%27s+electric+gooeyness" target="_blank">In the peel zone: Tape's electric gooeyness</a></p>
<p><em>&quot;Peeling a strip of adhesive tape off a smooth surface is a violent process. As the adhesive stretches into strands, or fibrils, that suddenly snap apart, electrical activity is generated at the tape-surface juncture, often accompanied by a flickering glow visible in a darkened room.&quot;</em></p>
<p>Peeling tape creates opposite charges, with the adhesive charging with one polarity, and the tape-back getting the opposite polarity.  (This is the &quot;tribo&quot; effect which is poorly understood.)   When peeled, tape can generate some tiny sparks and create a couple thousand volts ...when in air.   </p>
<p>When in vacuum, the sparks are gone.  The sparks were conductive, and were shorting out the opposite charges.  With no air and no sparks, the opposite charges just keep growing higer.  The tape's voltage rises over 10x higher when in vacuum.   Rather than a slight blue glow, the tape gives off a slight glow made of high-energy EM emissions: x-rays.</p>
<p><strong>tldr;</strong>  in vacuum, sparks are impossible.  (Sparks are plasma, air-plasma.)   Remove the sparks, and your tape-peeling creates 30,000V rather than just two or three thousand volts.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The adhesive in tape is an amorphous liquid and is mostly held together by covalent bonds. These bonds consist of electron pairs and together they are in equilibrium. When you break such a bond they will adjust to the new situation and lose the bond energy which is converted to light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
