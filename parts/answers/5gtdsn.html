		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's probably easy to see why this happens if you consider what the boiling point really is. If you look at any liquid, molecules will constantly be leaving the liquid to go into the vapor phase and vapor will re-condense into the liquid, <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OYBAVfJ.jpg" target="_blank">as shown here</a>. If you cover the liquid container, eventually you will reach an equilibrium. At that point, an equal number of molecules will go from the liquid to the vapor phase as in the other direction. The vapor will then have a certain pressure, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressure" target="_blank">vapor pressure</a>. Now as long as the external pressure is larger than the vapor pressure, it will be favorable for some molecules to stay in the liquid phase. However, at the point when the vapor pressure equals the external pressure, all liquid molecules can start to spontaneously go into the gas phase. This point is the boiling point.</p>
<p>So to reiterate, the boiling point marks the point where the vapor pressure equals the external pressure. Now you can imagine that if you reduce the external pressure, the boiling point will also drop. You can clearly see this from a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/08/Phase_diagram_of_water.svg/700px-Phase_diagram_of_water.svg.png" target="_blank">phase diagram of water</a>. As you decrease the pressure, the boiling point keeps decreasing, until it reaches 0.01 Â°C at the triple point of water (the lowest pressure at which liquid water exists).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure and temperature are the two factors that determine an objects current state of matter. An excessive amount of pressure will turn water into ice at room temperature. Consequently, zero pressure, like in a vacuum causes water to immediately turn into gas. This is why water boils in a vacuum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many people have already posted about how and why water will boil if exposed to a sufficiently low pressure, but I haven't seen anybody mention that this isn't why the water inside the chamber at your high school and/or college is bubbling! What's really happening in this initial stage of bubbling is the gases that had previously been dissolved in the water are being released. Gases will dissolve in a liquid (this is how fish breathe and carbonated beverages work). As the pressure drops, the gases dissolved inside the liquid will bubble and leave the gas (again, like with a carbonated beverage).
This bubbling happens well before the water will start to boil. Next time your instructor tries this demo, ask them to leave it on for a while and the water will stop bubbling!</p>
<p>tl;dr: You can boil water by decreasing pressure but this isn't what happened in your science class</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Low pressure/no pressure allows the molecules to drift apart and become gas. The lower the pressure the lower the temperature needs to be and vise-versa. So in a vacuum water can boil at a far lower temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A vacuum has no air, so there's no pressure keeping the water molecules together in liquid state. Boiling water is basically passing an energy threshold to transform from liquid to gas state. When you boil water conventionally by giving it heat, you give molecules energy break hydrogen bonds and vaporize. When you put water in a vacuum, you are doing the opposite of this by lowering the required amount of energy for water molecules to free itself from hydrogen bonds, thus it vaporizes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
