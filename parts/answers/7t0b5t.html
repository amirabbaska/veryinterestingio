		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Columbia was in a different orbital inclination than the ISS, orbiting at a 39 degree tilt relative to the equator vs. 51.5 degrees for the ISS. That doesn't sound like a lot, but the Shuttle did not have nearly enough fuel to rendezvous with the ISS, so that wasn't an option.</p>
<p>After the disaster, future Shuttle missions not going to the ISS had a backup Shuttle prepared for a rescue mission while they were in space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They knew there was a potential problem, but didn’t consider it a serious risk.  And preparing a second shuttle takes weeks.  They didn’t have time to wait on that.  And they had space lab docked in the payload bay, so they would have had to eject that to use the airlock.  And they didn’t have the robot arm on that mission, so even ejecting the lab would have been difficult.  And they may not have had fuel to get to the ISS.  And the ISS may not have had room or supplies.  And I’m not sure the ISS could dock two shuttles at once.  And the second shuttle couldn’t carry everyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure this has already been answered but Columbia had nowhere near enough fuel remaining on board to reach the ISS. </p>
<p>There was a theoretical rescue plan to rescue the crew of Columbia using shuttle Atlantis but it was considered unrealistic due to the logistics involved. </p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/02/the-audacious-rescue-plan-that-might-have-saved-space-shuttle-columbia/?amp=1" target="_blank">This is a brilliant article on that rescue plan that never was.</a></p>
<p>As a side note, after Columbia, no shuttle launched without a rescue sortie on standby, and all subsequent missions carried enough extra fuel to reach the ISS if it was deemed necessary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That completely WAS an issue that was discussed, worked out, thought about, planned a bit and more. The idea was scrapped. So were some other safety ideas for preserving at least parts of Columbia and all of her crew. There is a bad guy (actually a bad girl, bad woman) in this story too. A some what maligned and very much villainized belt tightening type of Project Manager. I hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't read the whole thread, but there was a rescue plan cooked up.  Part of the problem was the size and singular access door in Columbia's bay.  Plus, getting enough space suits available for her crews.  There were size problems too, regarding the space suits, cause some of the Columbia's crew were smallish.  A second shuttle could had been launched, and then it would have been like complicated game of checkers, people hopping back and forth, in and out, suiting and unsuiting; open hatches doors, closing hatch doors..... It was decided there was too much risk in losing both crews.  However, man of the astronauts thought they should have done it!  They wanted to&quot; let it hang over the edge; push that envelope.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
