Also a lot of diseases can have incubation times or even be dormant for decades like in the case of TB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://whatif.xkcd.com/book/" target="_blank">xkcd-book</a> has a section about this, and the answer comes down to: Almost, but not really.</p>
<p>The common cold is usually caused by some variant of the rhinovirus, which is eradicated from the human body by a healthy immune system after about a week. And since this virus doesn't cross species, and can't infect anyone due to the isolation, it should die out.</p>
<p>The problem is that not everyone has a healthy immune system, and therefore a few strains of the virus will survive beyond the quarantine. And so they can spread across the population again, and the 2 months of isolation would have been for nothing...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised that no one has mentioned abiotic reservoirs. Some viruses can exist outside of organisms. For example, influenza particles have detected in water and ice. Even if we eliminated it entirely from humans and other animals, there would be a chance of someone picking it up from the environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Flu? Not at all. Humans aren't the only carriers, and isolating us alone won't eliminate the reservoirs in other species. As soon as we get out, one strain or another will mutate and cross the species barrier, and we'll be back where we started.</p>
<p>The common cold, on the other hand, might be doable. Many rhinoviruses are human-specific, and we only take a week or two to adapt to them, becoming immune and killing off the population within our own bodies. After two months, they'll all be gone.</p>
<p>In the majority of people.</p>
<p>And that's the problem. Not everybody has a working immune system. Anyone on immunosuppressant drugs (for an organ transplant, for example) or with a reduced immune system (through diseases such as AIDS, or just natural variation) might well <em>still</em> be showing cold symptoms after two months. Once they're brought back into contact with the rest of humanity, it won't take long for those reservoirs to spread to a batch of uninfected people, where they can mutate and infect the rest of us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The influenza virus is not unique to humans, different strains are able to infect different animal species (that's where the &quot;avian flu&quot; and &quot;swine flu&quot; names came from). These viruses use these species as their natural hosts until coming into contact with people. Quarantining people for two months might decrease worldwide incidence, but the virus would still be present in these natural hosts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
