		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, I've got a question for Dr. Ritterbush. I've always wondered, since humans haven't explored more than 5% of the ocean (That's what most reports say so I have assumed this to be accurate), the Marine creatures we've assumed to be extinct might have adapted to live in the unexplored regions, and there might be some which the world has never seen. What are the chances of creatures we presume to be extinct to have adapted and survived in different conditions which we haven't explored yet? Is it not possible for Marine creatures to be trapped under polar ice blankets, still have a chance at survival?(My knowledge of this comes off an article I read about Japanese researchers who managed to revive microscopic creatures after having frozen them for 30 years). Have you personallyâ€‹ encountered any such species which was deemed extinct but was rediscovered whilst exploring new regions (or species which have been frozen for millenia) in your years of research? If so, what species were they?</p>
<p>P.S.- I haven't studied biology much(I will be taking up physics) so please forgive me if any of the my questions seem obnoxious to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any hypothesis as to why Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, and a few other countries where women are generally treated with less equality have a higher percentage of women entering STEM fields than the U.S.? (Saudi Arabia, 50% of STEM graduates are women, compared to 20-25% in the U.S.).</p>
<p>Also, I am a white male high school science teacher. What can I do to encourage minority and female students to continue in STEM fields, without being condescending or overbearing? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every time that I stumble upon a panel on a symposium or see a note about &quot;The role of women in science&quot; I think to myself &quot;Well... Their role is to make new science isn't it&quot;. What am I missing? </p>
<p>I may not be aware of the gender problems in science because I've worked with female researchers since my time as an undergraduate and continue to do so now. As any scientist, these women are obsessed with their work and when I asked, they didn't care much about this &quot;women on stem&quot; movement. Do you think female scientists have a responsibility to support these movements actively? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
