		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Varying the frequency would not be practical, as the slice of the frequency band that would be considered ‘microwaves’ is actually really narrow. </p>
<p>(The prime length of a microwave is about four inches in length, which is why they can’t escape from the microwave, especially the front. The waves are too big to get through the front grate and will bounce back into the microwave.)</p>
<p>It’s true that most current models of commercial microwaves have fixed magnetrons, which can unfortunately lead to a microwave having hot and cold spots. </p>
<p>This has necessitated the invention of the rotating plate, which has solved the problem of these spots pretty handily. Sure, an aging microwave will tend to develop more cold and hot spots, but that’s to be expected.</p>
<p>Sometimes a microwave will manage to bounce back into the magnetron, and cause slight degradation (essentially the microwave will ‘cook itself’) </p>
<p>So it is best to heavily shield the magnetron, this very same shielding would make it impractical to make the magnetron the moving part of the microwave.</p>
<p>Also moving the magnetron would also have the consequence of placing said magnetron into the path of its own microwaves more often, risking even more damages over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm an RF engineer. The frequency at which a microwave oven operates is fixed for several reasons. One is that the frequency is optimized at the resonant frequency of the water molecule to maximize the energy transfer to the food. The second is that the magnetron is a tuned cavity resonator, so it would be impractical to modulate the frequency because its output frequency is determined by the dimensions of the cavities. The third is that the magnetron gets RF energy into the oven cavity via a waveguide and horn antenna, which is also a narrow band device if you want to transfer the maximum amount of RF power without absorbing it or reflecting it back into the source. Older microwave ovens, and some commercial ovens have a hidden &quot;stirrer&quot;, which is a reflective metal fan blade that sits in the output horn of the waveguide and reflects some of the energy around the oven cavity to even up the power transfer. Other ovens use a somewhat more effective turntable to move the food instead. Some food is just really difficult to heat evenly if the water content isn't distributed in a homogeneous manner, so in that case it works better to use a lower power setting and a longer cook time. It is also better to place the food off-center on the turntable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As usual, there is no one simple answer, but rather a number of reasons which lead to the current solution being hard to beat.</p>
<p>Microwave ovens generate their radio energy using a magnetron, which is a relatively cheap device to manufacture. The magnetron's physical properties determine the resonant frequency and therefore the frequency of its output. It directly generates relatively high-power radio waves from a DC power input, rather than being an amplifier of lower-power signals as you might find in a (more expensive) transmitter that can vary frequency and modulation.</p>
<p>The other major factor is regulatory requirements and reducing interference to other devices. The 2450 MHz frequency chosen was available for industrial, scientific and medical (ISM) use worldwide, where some other possible cooking frequencies were only available in certain regions.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that long after the introduction of microwave cooking, this band was also used for cordless phones, wireless networking (WiFi), Bluetooth and similar uses. While microwave ovens do cause significant interference to these services (as those services also do to each other), further varying the frequency during cooking would almost certainly make this situation much worse. Your microwave oven might completely wipe out your WiFi network while cooking, rather than just slowing it down, perhaps.</p>
<p>In fact the design of many microwave ovens does make some effort to disturb the standing waves by using a &quot;stirrer&quot; - a fan-like object in the waveguide leading from the magnetron to the cooking chamber to disturb the wave patters to some degree. This is effective on a small scale, but large items still benefit from moving around the chamber on a simple turntable.</p>
<p>Edit: Clarified a comment about interference which /u/heeerrresjonny pointed out was ambiguous.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Other posters have commented about the fixed frequency being required as it is related somehow to the &quot;resonant frequency of water molecules&quot;. This is a misconception.</p>
<p>The mechanism of heating relies on the fact that the water molecule is a electrical dipole - that is it has a more positive charge at one end and a more negative charge at the opposite end. A wide range of electromagnetic waves (not just microwaves) can cause it to flip back and forth, it does not need to be resonant for this to work. The reason it works better on water than on some other molecules is more about how strongly or weakly dipolar they are, compared to their molecular weight, than any particular resonance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know the answer in general, but one important thing is that you couldn't just vary the frequency small amounts to move the nodes slightly. To have standing waves in the microwave, you need to continue to have nodes on its walls, which severely restricts the number of frequencies that are possible. There are a variety of wavelengths that would allow this, but they're limited and slightly changing the frequency wouldn't cut it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big problem most people have with these platters is they sit their food in the middle. Rotating in the middle of a platter means you don’t move around the microwave, you spin in place.</p>
<p>If you have a platter, put your plate on the edge of it so it actually does laps around the microwave. This will eliminate a lot of hot/cold problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
