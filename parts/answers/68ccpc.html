They appear a blue/violet-white because of the blackbody radiation they emit as a result of their temperature. This is the same reason incandescent lights and our sun emit light. <a href="http://highered.mheducation.com/olcweb/cgi/pluginpop.cgi?it=swf::800::600::/sites/dl/free/0072482621/220727/Blackbody_Nav.swf::Blackbody%20Radiation%20Interactive" target="_blank">This</a> site is great for showing how the color of light an object emits changes with its temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>there are basically no electrons at all in the outside of it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Actually, this is not quite correct.  The exterior layers of neutron stars are composed of (neutron-rich) nuclei and free electrons.  This outer layer is called the <a href="https://physics.aps.org/articles/v7/30" target="_blank">crust</a>.  Only deeper in the interior of neutron stars do the higher pressures make free neutrons stable.</p>
<p>Since the surface of a neutron star will always be composed of &quot;regular&quot; nuclei and electrons, you never get a direct view of the sea of free neutrons in the interior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've had the same question for years, but I'll be a little more specific about my question: &quot;When a neutron star cools down completely, so that it is not glowing of its own heat, and assuming the surface is pure neutrons, and not some crust of electrons, what color would it be if I shown a white light on it?&quot;  I've gone to public-friendly Physics lectures at the University of Michigan solely to ask this question of a physicist.  The first time the lecturer thought I was trying to ask him a trick question, and got angry at me.  A few years later I asked another lecturer, and prefaced my question with the statement that I'm not trying to be a wise guy.  When asked the question, he beat around the bush and tried to throw the question back at me.  I am genuinely curious, since the answer, I believe, would be the answer to the question &quot;What color is a neutron?&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
