<ol>
<li>
<p>It is not necessary to send your password to the server to grade it. That can be done client-side.</p>
</li>
<li>It is not necessary that a server <em>persistently</em> stores a password in plain text, even though it may be sent to it as such.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, if a client sends a password in plain text to a server and it is received, then it is necessarily true that <em>at some point</em>, it exists in plain text at the server. The idea is to minimise that amount of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean when the webpage tells you that the new password you're creating is good, fair, strong, or something similar, then that operation is typically performed right there in your browser. It is very common for sites to use a scripting language (e.g.JavaScript) to evaluate how strong the new password is compared to their rules, through regular expressions. In short, no, typically websites are not sending your password to the server for grading. That would be incredibly inefficient.  That being said, a website could do that if they wanted to, but I would question the true intent of any website that did.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net" target="_blank">How Secure Is My Password</a> is a great example of this. They use a Java Script (<a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/app.0638f8f6.js" target="_blank">this one</a>) to analyze your password. It looks like a wall of text, but basically, every time you change the text in the password box, it runs that script, which checks length, complexity, and runs it against a word bank to check for common passwords. Since the script is downloaded onto your computer when you load the webpage, and run on your own computer, your password never travels over the internet, making it impossible for them to store, let alone see it.</p>
<p>You ask about a &quot;Spectre type attack&quot;. This is pretty difficult, though not impossible <a href="http://fortune.com/2018/01/05/spectre-safari-chrome-firefox-internet-explorer/" target="_blank">(poor source)</a>, but also completely useless. For that to work, the attacker would have to run an advertisement with the Spectre attack in it, which would likely get picked up by the advertiser, the website owner, a savvy client or even your web browser. An alternative attack would be to compromise the web server and modify the script to send a copy of the password to a server under the control of the attacker, but that again involves an extremely challenging task because you can't just &quot;hack into&quot; a server.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most systems do transmit a plain-text password from the client to the server, both in the password-change operation and the password-verify operation.  Among those systems, the good ones will store only a hashed version of the password, which cannot easily be reversed, the the bad ones will store the plain-test password itself, or an equivalent.  Some hashes, like those used in Windows prior to Active Directory, were plain-text equivalent.  (This may be a serious concern if your run any SMB file server, such as Samba, and use password-protected shares, but aren't using Kerberos.  The NT and LM hashes that Samba uses are the equivalent of the users' plain-text passwords.  If those leak, they can be used to authenticate to the SMB server.  They don't need to be reversed.)</p>

<p>There are a few authentication protocols that do not send passwords or equivalents.  Kerberos and SRP are good examples:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer: No. The code used to judge how secure your password is exists only on your machine. Granted that code gets sent by the server, but nothing gets sent back until you click submit. After that, your password is salted, hashed, and stored in a secure database. It really depends on how the developer created the function, though. This is just how I'd do it.</p>
