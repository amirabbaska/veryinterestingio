		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That white fluid is in the skin. The skin has capillaries, or microscopic tunnels, for liquid to flow through. Much the same way that trees get water from the roots up to the leaves, so that when you tap a Maple tree, sap flows out.</p>
<p>When you put the ends together, you create a seal between the flat parts. When you slide them, water tension causes the fluid to stick to itself and to the cucumber solid. This pulls a tiny bit of fluid out of the capillary, which sucks against the rest of the fluid in the capillaries like sucking through a straw.</p>
<p>The foaming is just an effect of the fluid being slightly sticky. It's not water, it's plant juice.</p>
<p>The bitter flavor is in that juice, you're removing it. I know you know that, but I have to include it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Next time you cut and rub the slice, taste the froth that ensues.  It will not be bitter.  Now if you happen upon a bitter cucumber, do the same, and then taste the froth and the resultant cucumber.  The bitter cucumber will remain bitter.  Unless someone has tasted before and after and noticed a difference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
