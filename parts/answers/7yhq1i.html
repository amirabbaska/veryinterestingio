		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where two ends of the bones meet, they form a synovial joint. Basically a sac encloses the joint with fluid inside called synovial fluid. Low barometric pressure can increase the pressure inside of the synovial joint, indirectly increasing pressure on the ends of the bones.</p>
<p>EDIT: Someone rightfully corrected me, low pressure will cause the pain not high. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17466654/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/17466654/</a></p>
<p>Here's a study that sought out to answer that question. My understanding is that when it rains (low-pressure system), there's less force (atmospheric pressure) exerted on your knee joint. Which means everything inside your knee joint is going to expand slightly because of this loss of external pressure. When tissues expand inside a finite space, like during an inflammatory response, structures like nerves are going to be compressed, which causes pain. </p>
<p>Not sure how it works in practice, they just took subjective assessments in this study.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
