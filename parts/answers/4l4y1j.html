So what is the most important information that has come from this data from a person outside of CERN? Or was all this data processed internally before being made publicly available? Just seems like a lot of data to go through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can you give a rough estimate of the factor by which filesize shrinks when going from &quot;level 4&quot; raw detector data to &quot;level 3&quot; reconstructed physics events? </p>
<p>Does enough spare capacity already exist on EOS to host all of the level 3 data from Run 1 in a publicly accessible way?</p>
<p>Lastly, can you say how much bandwidth has been consumed by users downloading data through the Open Data portal? I'm really curious to know how much this is really being used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
