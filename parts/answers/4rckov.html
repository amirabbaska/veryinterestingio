		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. First, we have satellites that orbit the sun from near this point, <a href="http://stereo.gsfc.nasa.gov/where.shtml" target="_blank">they give us a stereo view of the sun.</a> If there was a planet at the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Lagrange_points_simple.svg/500px-Lagrange_points_simple.svg.png" target="_blank">L3 Lagrange point</a> (the point directly opposite the sun from the earth) these satellites wouldn't be able to stay put.</p>
<p>Additionally, while on the topic of orbits, the gravity from the planets affects each others' orbits, changing the precession of the perihelion of their orbits. This has been measured to incredible accuracy, especially for Mercury. If there was an additional planet hiding in the inner solar system, it would have shown up in these observations of orbital perturbations. </p>
<p>Lastly, the L3 point is generally not a stable point to orbit, so any planet hiding there wouldn't stay put very long. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Similarly, other planets were proposed to explain other orbits we didn't understand. Planet Vulcan was proposed to explain mercury's orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The two wouldn't stay perfectly stable with each other - the other planets (notably Venus,) would perturb the orbits, causing them to approach each other.</p>
<p>They would likely end up in a similar situation to Saturn's moons <a href="http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2006/janus-epimetheus-swap.html" target="_blank">Janus and Epimetheus</a> where they &quot;swap orbits&quot; every so often.  (The two moons orbit at <em>nearly</em> the same orbital distance, one that they could, in theory, crash in to each other; but instead, as they approach, they swap orbits, causing the one that was &quot;catching up&quot; to instead start falling behind, and vice versa.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a cool movie that this was the basic concept. They were almost an identical race as we are except for some of the smaller things, such as they used the left hand to shake in a greeting and such, our &quot;hero&quot; was known by their security services to have crash landed, but as he looked like one of them and he was slowly and fairly easily picking up on the subtle differences between them and Earth, it was a very interesting movie to watch, also, can any of you who have seen it, remember the name of the movie, it might of been a made for TV movie or from a really long time back, it might have even been a B &amp; W movie as it has been decades since i saw it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
