		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Engineering answer.. There is a practical speed limit called choked flow that occurs as the fastest streamlines approach the speed of sound. It basically says you can't increase the mass flow rate by decreasing the pressure downstream. If you increase the pressure upstream you are increasing the mass flow by increasing the density of the fluid. You can get to supersonic internal flow within a well configured nozzle (e.g. rocket throat/nozzle) but the pressure of the fluid is rapidly dropping in order to do so. Managing the shock waves and structural loads on tubing and valves gets nuts pretty fast, typically internal flows are kept subsonic for this reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably the best you could get from a practical device is about 4700m/s with liquid aluminum driven by a hydraulic ram through a steel tube with a diminishing inner diameter. The exit diameter would have to be calculated for an exit velocity at the speed of sound of the liquid medium for the amount of pressure you can produce, and care would have to be taken not to allow the liquid to boil since the speed of sound in a gas is lower than that for a liquid. For sure, there are more difficult materials like boron that you could use to improve on this, but it would be, um, difficult. </p>
<p>What could you do with such a device? Well, for sure you could cut through any damn thing. Another thing you could do is to use it as the anode for an extremely intense source of x-rays by directing it across the path of an electron beam powerful enough to vaporize the liquid as it exits the tube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Since you're usually transporting water and pipe diameters are standardized, they have empirical tables that define this:<br />

<p>Water velocity starts to level off before 15 ft/s (~10 MPH or ~16 KPH).</p>
