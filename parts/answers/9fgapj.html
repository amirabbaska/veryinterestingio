		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I am aware, the citric acid only interacts with the tannins and not the caffeine.
In hard water areas the tannins oxidise to for what is known as tea scum. The addition of a slice of lemon disrupts this process so it no longer forms. This also affects the harshness of the stains formed on the surface of the cup.
Caffeine content is also affected by the type of tea used and the hardness of the water.
From what I know I don't think you can ever calculate the amounts of citric acid needed exactly as a tea brew contains far too many compounds to fully quantify it all.
Culturally in Britain lemon is put in tea like Earl Grey to enhance the flavour. It is not necessarily to change the caffeine content. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reducing the pH makes tannins less soluble because they are acidic. Lower pH means less deprotonation of the tannins making them less soluble in water. It would be very hard to quantify this without knowing levels of tannin (and tannin is an undefined mixture).</p>
<p>Ca2+ won't really oxidize tannins because you'd need a rather strong oxidizer for that which Ca2+ is not, but it can undergo interactions, possibly precipating out negatively charged tannin as was mentioned. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
