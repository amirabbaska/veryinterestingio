		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, to start off, muscle memory is not in your muscles, it's in your brain. Muscle memory is essentially your brain learning what to do to make a certain movement happen. </p>
<p>When you start off trying to learn a new physical skill, you often know what you want the end result to be (I want the ball to wind up over <em>there</em>), but you don't know exactly how to make that happen. You try to make the right movement, and over time your brain learns exactly what sequence of individual muscle movements (and what visual / bodily feedback to use) will produce the result you want. </p>
<p>Essentially, in the process of learning a motor (movement) skill, your brain creates a new &quot;program&quot; that it can run whenever it's needed. When it's time to throw a ball, your brain can activate the &quot;ball throwing program&quot; instead of having to consciously figure out exactly what movements to try, like you do when you're first learning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not exactly my field but in short it's neural, not muscular. When your brain issues a complex command correctly, like playing a sequence of notes, or swinging a baseball bat, or executing a maneuver in a videogame, there is a reward signal that serves to strengthen connections between neurons in that pathway. Eventually the process becomes more like this: The higher functioning part of the brain sends a signal to &quot;do that thing&quot;, and it's so encoded in the downstream pathway that it kind of just takes it from there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how in pictures of the brain there's this spaghetti-like lump at the back? That's the cerebellum. The cerebellum is a <strong>cybernetic control machine</strong>. I've yet to see a textbook explain how fascinating it really is. Let's take a look.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>About 75% of your neurons are located in your cerebellum. Some researchers estimate <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776484/" target="_blank">that it contains 100 billion neurons</a>, all packed into that ball of spaghetti. Because of this, you'd be right in assuming that the cerebellum is the brute-force mechanism of the brain in terms of information processing.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>So what does it do?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>I've used the word &quot;machine&quot; to describe it, which might sound odd to you. In 1967, a trio of researchers published <em>The Cerebellum as a Neuronal Machine</em>. Therein, they argued that the cerebellum was analogous to a computer. This idea has persisted and has been expanded on by others.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The cerebellum performs error correction; it reduces the discrepancy between intended and actual movements. When you reach out to grab something, you rely on proprioceptive feedback signals to adjust your trajectory. Motor plans originate in the motor area of the cerebral cortex. Signals are sent down to the spine and to relevant muscle fibers. At the same time, a copy of the motor plan travels to the cerebellum. Signals from the motor fibers head back up to the cerebellum. There they converge. The cerebellum can adjust the movement so that becomes nice and smooth rather than &quot;jerky&quot;.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, the motor plans and the error correction is fine and all, but there's an important question we haven't considered: <em>should</em> you reach out to grab something?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The basal ganglia can be blamed for your habits, good or bad. It is believed to be highly involved in <strong>habit-formation</strong>. What's more, it is thought to evaluate and scrutinize motor plans.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The motor cortex is, in fact, at all times inhibited by the basal ganglia. The basal ganglia frees cortical neurons from inhibition when it has been decided that the motor plan is appropriate. In a sense, the basal ganglia is the sculptor of behavior. Actions that lead to good consequences are encouraged (less likely to be inhibited) and actions that lead to bad consequences are discouraged (more likely to be inhibited).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>As the basal ganglia is involved with value, it has been suggested that its goal is to maximize reward. <em>Skill</em> simply means you are able to more efficiently carry out a task, which means you can collect rewards faster.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now, this all seems nice and dandy. There are some issues, however. People with cerebellar ataxia, meaning their cerebellum is screwed up, are just pretty clumsy. They aren't flailing around in misery. When treating Parkinson's disease, DBS is often used to essentially put the basal ganglia out of commission. And it doesn't seem to affect people very negatively. So if these two structures are so incredibly important, why do we seem to manage so well without them? I have no idea.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Some researchers argue that the basal ganglia in humans mostly controls the <em>vigour</em> of movement. I'm not sure what I think about this idea.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>One idea I'd like to leave with you with is the idea that automatization of behavior is remarkably similar to organizational structures in human groups. There's a leader, like the prefrontal cortex, that decides on the overall goal and how it should be achieved. The leader shouldn't concern itself with minute details, just the overall progress toward the goal. Similarly, humans tend to &quot;space out&quot; when their attention is not required. What I believe actually happens is that attention moves where it is most useful. While lower brain areas steer your car towards your destination, you engage in (relatively) incredibly complex simulations of the future, such as planning what you will be having for lunch. This is beyond the scope of most organisms on the planet. You are acting not on the actual world, but on a model of it that is so exact that you can treat it as a substitute for the real thing. This should blow our minds more than it does.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Acquiring &quot;muscle memory&quot; is the process of delegating trivial motor activity to subconscious processes so the conscious part can focus on more important issues.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's precisely what concert stage musicians rely on to perform so perfectly. The constant practice in repetition of musical notations produces an addiction symposium in the brain. Musicians literally addict themselves to the exact notational patterns by repeating over 300 times. The brain co-operates by creating a neural netting of synapse and each time the passage is played correctly, the synapse is further emphasized and electrified.
With the pattern well-defined in the brain, the cluster of muscles fired-up and necessary to perform with the instrument, follows in sympathy to the already familiar neural passageways in the brain.
On-stage concert performances of many selections having complicated muscular movements are delivered by memory -- many musicians have prepared totally by rehearsing their entire repertoire blind-folded! That's complete muscle memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every answer so far has discussed neural adaptation. But sometimes when people use the term &quot;muscle memory&quot;, they're referring to the phenomenon wherein it's usually faster to re-build muscle, than it was to build muscle mass the first time around. This is because of the greater proliferation of <em>satellite cells,</em> which are what initiate the production of muscle tissues in response to resistance training. Once you make more of these, you always retain them, and thus have an easier time regaining your gains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
