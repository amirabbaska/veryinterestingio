		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about how nuclear fission works. You take heavy atoms and split them. The original uranium (U-235/U-238) used in a typical water reactor is a relatively weak alpha emitter overall. </p>
<p>When you split uranium, you get two or three smaller fission products. There is a distribution of products that you can get (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_product_yield" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fission_product_yield</a>). But these smaller atoms are often formed with energy distribution states and neutron to proton ratios that are not along the &quot;line of stability&quot; and can be extremely radioactive. Additionally these fission products are all contained in the fuel rods, essentially being concentrated. </p>
<p>The fission products are what tend to be dangerously radioactive. If you could separate the remaining U238/235 from the spent fuel, those portions are still very weak alpha emitters only. It's some of the new stuff that was created in the process that has strong radiation emissions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Once the uranium nuclei have undergone fission, they are no longer uranium nuclei. Fission reactions produce many lighter nuclides, many of which will be unstable.</p>
<p>Spent nuclear fuel contains some of these radioactive fission products. They need to be stored for a long time so that these radioactive fission products can decay away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the fission products the other top-level comments mention, there are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transuranium_element" target="_blank">elements heavier than uranium</a>. They are produced when uranium captures neutrons and does not fission, but decays to neptunium, plutonium, americium and so on. Their half-life is typically of the order of thousands of years. Too long to wait for them to decay on site, but short enough to have a high activity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like asbestos, It's a solid rock and a few little piece may break off but generally is pretty harmless so long as you don't lick it. If you start smashing it to all the little pieces and releasing all the small pieces it will get into your lungs and cause all kinds of problems while in there. That is why Asbestos is dangerous on jobs sites because it is being demolished/broken into pieces. </p>
<p>Uranium has all kinds of potential radioactive energy but its stored in a tight knit bundle that isn't very harmful unless you basically lick it. Smash it to pieces and all the energy gets released which also creates the harmful Beta and Gamma rays. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
