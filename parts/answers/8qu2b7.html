		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because - in order to slow down viral multiplication - your body increases the thermostat of your body. So what normally feels comfortable suddenly feels cold.</p>
<p>Update: That's also why you sweat when you're recovering. The body lowers the thermostat back to normal temperature. Everything feels more hot as when you were sick. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that I didn’t see mentioned that should be said: When you have the chills a part of your brain (hypothalamus)  is telling you that you’re cold, even when you aren’t. It leads you to perform a lot of heat-seeking behaviors like getting under a blanket or taking a hot shower. Your heat-seeking actions are helping your body to spike the fever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You aren't actually able to sense absolute temperature. Only the temperature difference between yourself and other objects.</p>
<p>So if the other object is cooler than you, it feels cold</p>
<p>Edit: /u/JDFidelius points out that it's more precise to say that you sense heat flow. This not only incorporates the sense of temperature difference, but also characteristics specific to the material you are touching. This is why for example a piece of metal feels colder than a piece of wood, even if they are both at 70º F.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why does cold hurt so much? Is it because the contrast is too big?</p>
<p>Also I find it weird how one or two degrees (C) can affect your feeling of warmth so much, but if the room temperature raises one or two degrees it is not a big deal</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine that your perception of cold is just the difference between the temperature of your body and the temperature of your surroundings. When you increase your temperature due to a fever, you increase the temperature gap between your body and the surroundings, giving you the <em>perception</em> that the bath is colder than it should be, when in actuality you are just warmer than you should be</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
