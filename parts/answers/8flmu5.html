		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One minor correction in your thinking: it's not that pollen and other foreign objects <em>are</em> antigens. It's that their antigens do not match your own antigens.</p>
<p>An antigen is any molecule that is capable of causing an immune response. Your own cells are <em>covered</em> in antigens. In fact, your cells are deliberately covered in unique antigens, coded in your DNA so that your cells produce antigen proteins that do any number of things to signal to your immune system. For instance, there are some are like dead-man switches, telling your immune system that they <em>aren't</em> cancerous. If the cell's DNA gets damaged in a way that could cause it to become cancerous, <em>hopefully</em> the sequence creating that antigen will also be damaged, so it won't make that antigen anymore. Your white blood cells will then attack that cell and kill it before it can cause cancer.</p>
<p>Your immune system is accustomed to seeing the antigens in your body. Anything that doesn't match what should be in your body is attacked as being foreign. Normally for things like pollen, your body simply cleans them up and removes them, no big deal. Allergies happen when your body freaks out and declares total war on the invader, ramping up parts of your immune system that are dangerous to yourself. It's like if some Canadian tourists lost their passports, and instead of putting them in jail the government sent in the national guard and starting attacking the tourists with tanks.</p>
<p>IIRC - and not being a medical professional - that's one of the reasons titanium is used for medical implants. It forms a protective oxidized layer around the metal that doesn't allow any other chemical reactions to the titanium. Because it isn't reactive, the chemical sensors used by your immune system can't be activated, so your body can't recognize it as being foreign. As a result, your immune system doesn't really attack it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing would happen. An allergy is when apart of your immune system reacts inappropriately to a substance that is harmless, as if it were dangerous.  Anyone without that hypersensitivity experiences absolutely no symptoms or benefits.</p>
<p>Eventually the harmless substance would be broken down into chemical components by your body and anything it can't use would be discarded as waste. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends what you mean.
1) what if our immune system didn't recognize any antigens ? It would mean that your immune system doesn't work so you would get very serious infections at the same time and die very quickly.</p>
<p>2) what if our immune system didn't recognize popular allergens as antigens ? People wouldn't have allergies.</p>
<p>3) what if the part of our immune system that causes allergies didn't work ? The part of the immune system that causes allergy is the part of the immune system that also fights parasites. So you'd get some worms in your stomach to say the least and probably die an awful death (I am perhaps a bit dramatic here).</p>
<p>Hope it helps...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One though thought.  If your body didn't recognize things that weren't part of you as antigens, most of your active immune system would be doing nothing.   You might need to be a bubble by or die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
