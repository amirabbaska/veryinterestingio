		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of scrap aluminum from the U.S. is actually recycled in other countries. So it's being recycled, but in the trade statistics you'll see exports of aluminum scrap as well as imports of aluminum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s still cheaper to have other countries recycle and make aluminum and ship it here than it is to pay Americans a living wage to do it here. It’s cheaper to make new shipping containers and send them to the US than it is to ship empty containers back and reuse them. It’s stupid cheap to make things in 3rd world countries. A person here would make like $30 an hour making steel. In China it could be $3. If they get hurt you bring in another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US Recycling system is not as great as everyone thinks it is. I'm gonna use my city as an example. We are having a scandal right now because for the last 10 years we thought we were recycling but turns out the City has been dumping the recycling first than putting trash on top of it while taking all our money for the recycling fees</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recycled aluminum also contains impurities that make it unusable for certain applications. For instance in aluminum engine blocks it can create a porous case and cause oil to leak directly through the block. A lot of aluminum needs to be imported to fill the need of non recycled aluminum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recycling programs are very hard to automate, and require huge amounts of labor. It's cheaper to ship all that to China and India than do it in the US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
