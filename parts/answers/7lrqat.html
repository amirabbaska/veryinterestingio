It boils down to the assumption that depressed people see something about the world that the undepressed can't see, or maybe overlook. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human brain has all kinds of ways of tricking you into believing that you have more control over yourself, your environment, and your fate, than you really do. It's the basis for a lot of logical fallacies. A depressive realist is not fooled by as many (or possibly any) of these fallacies. As a result, they tend to have both a more realistic evaluation of life, and also be more depressed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depressed realists see things more practically sure, but they're depressed alright, and depression can be a strong influence in making impractical decisions. So although they do see things practically, that doesn't always mean they act practically.</p>
<p>As someone who has a depressed realist for a lover, this is what I've seen and have been wanting to say so thank you for opening this subreddit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A theory is as follows:</p>
<p>The depressed mind is severely hindered in making new connections. New connections between new experiences and memories are how we function and grow as people. We're wired to crave novelty and to learn. We are also pattern-matchers without peer. </p>
<p>Unable to make connections, the depressed mind turns to pattern-matching instead. Every sad and horrid thing that happens just confirms to the depressed mind that the world is a horrible place. Everything that might challenge that is dismissed or written off as a fluke. This is called confirmation bias, and it is a very powerful thing. And nothing challenges it, because they cannot make the new connections necessary to shift their thought process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
