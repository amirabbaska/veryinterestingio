		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Deuterium/Helium-3 mixture produces approximately 384 TJ/kg. Compare that to Uranium which produces 80 TJ/kg. Yearly Uranium consumption is about 60 million kg, if you wanted to replace all of that with Helium-3 you'd still need thousands of tons each year.</p>
<p>From 1955 to 1996 only 225 kg of tritium were produced in the USA. 150kg of which have since decayed into Helium-3. So no, tritium decay would probably never be able to meet demand. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Very little means something like 1 kg per day for a potential power plant. That is tiny compared to what other power plants need (coal power plants need thousands of tonnes), but it is still significant if you compare it to the amount of tritium we produce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
