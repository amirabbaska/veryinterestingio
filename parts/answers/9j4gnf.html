		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work as a research assistant and I routinely bloodfeed mosquitoes as part of my job. If you heat blood to roughly 37 C and then provide a membrane through which the mosquitoes can feed on it, they will definitely (and often enthusiastically) go for it. A living creature isn't necessary as the object of the feed.</p>
<p>We typically use parafilm or hog's gut as a membrane, wrapped around the opening of a water-jacketed glass feeder. We pump heated water through the feeder to hold the blood at a consistent temperature, and the mosquitoes then penetrate the membrane to feed on the blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
