		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thanks for joining us! For years, we've heard about hydrogen fuel cells becoming used in cars but that hasn't yet happened. Is it still a matter of expense? Industry pushback? Efficiency?</p>
<p>Also, what are the other applications that people are thinking of for these fuel cells? Since portability is key I suppose, it's mostly in transportation uses? Or are there lots of other plans for these? Thanks again!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

What would it take for them to be adopted widely enough to significantly impact carbon levels and thus help limit climate change?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
