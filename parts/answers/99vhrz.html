		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are confusing two phenomena: boiling and evaporation.</p>
<p>Liquids are in equilibrium with their vapour phase. This means that water will evaporate (change phase from liquid to vapour) until the surrounding medium (air above the water) is saturated with water vapour, that is, when equilibrium is reached. Another way to state this is that water will evaporate as long as its vapour pressure is higher that the partial pressure of water vapour above it.</p>
<p>It is important to realise that this is purely a <em>surface</em> thing: the liquid is in equilibrium with the vapour on the interface. This is what sets it apart from boiling, which happens in the bulk of the liquid.</p>
<p>Boiling happens when the vapour pressure of water exceeds the <em>total</em> pressure of air above it, because this is required for a bubble (consisting of pure water vapour) to form in the bulk of the liquid. In reality, even a little more than that is required: the bubble also needs to overcome the hydrostatic pressure of the water (depends on the depth of the water) and some nucleation barrier I won't get into.</p>
<p>In conclusion: water can evaporate (at the surface) below the boiling point, and this will happen as long as the air is not saturated with water (e.g. lower than 100% humidity).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The temperature of a substance expresses the average kinetic energy of the components of the substance (in this case the water molecules). But the actual kinetic energies of individual molecules will vary, some will have lower energies, others higher and this changes continuously due to interactions between molecules.</p>
<p>So while the bulk of the molecules may not have sufficient energy to escape the liquid in cold weather, there are some that do and if they reach the surface of the liquid, they escape / evaporate. When that happens, the average kinetic energy of the liquid decreases a little bit, which means that the temperature of the liquid decreases a little bit. But since the liquid is in contact with other materials and substances, it'll snap back into thermal equilibrium by drawing some heat from its surroundings. This process continues until (almost) all water molecules have evaporated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The boiling point is not when the liquid <em>starts</em> to evaporate, but when it's evaporating quickly enough to form stable bubbles. At that point the evaporation happens much faster as it's no longer just evaporating from the surface but also from the surfaces of the bubbles, but there is some evaporation happening at any temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water boiling is when the vapor pressure is equal to the surrounding atmospheric pressure resulting, among other things, in the violent phase change we see. But let's step back.</p>
<p>Temperature is the average speed of all the molecules that your measuring. It can be graphed as a bell curve with the majority of molecules being close to the temperature but some have really high speeds (or kinetic energy) and some have really low speeds.  </p>
<p>The ones with really high speeds sometimes have enough speed to overcome there intermolecular forces (the forces between the individual water molecules, not between the two hydrogens and oxygen) and become gaseous, or evaporate. So water doesn't need to boil to evaporate or we wouldn't be able to sweat. Water just needs enough kinetic energy to break the hydrogen bonds and become gaseous.</p>
<p>The water vapor rises and as temperature decreases they condense to themselves and whatever dust particles are in the air and form clouds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
