		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different countries have different ways of writing their currency symbols. Some write it before the number, some after. Generally, people write it a certain way because that's how people before them wrote it. In the US we write the sign before the number because that's how the British wrote the pound sign before us.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to writing the $ before the number. It makes it harder for forgers to modify numbers. You can't change $100 to $2100 by adding a number because there's a dollar sign in the way. Also it's easy to read the difference between dollars and cents on a sign, because the cent sign is written after the number. It's written like $3 and 50¢. Also if you wrote an amount as a decimal, 3.50$ the dollar sign is next to the cents values, and that could get confusing. </p>
<p>But there is little to no evidence that any of these were the reason that way of writing currencies became standard. Language, symbols, and writing systems are constantly evolving, and their origins are too old to know with any certainty. People tend to keep doing what was done before unless there is a good reason to change. That's why we write the dollar sign before the number. Any more specific explanation is speculation at best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, when books were kept physically in paper books you would write $1,000.00 in the ledger, because it makes it harder to modify the entry. If it was written as 1,000.00$ it would be easier to forge it to become, for example, 91,000.00$ by appending a single digit in front. </p>
<p>It's the same for say, the thousand separator which separates groups of digits in three so that not only they're more easily readable, they make even changes from say, $1,252,001.- to $1,2152,001.- easily detectable. </p>
<p>Source: I dunno, googled some and this here was an explanation that more or less sounded sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is &quot;history&quot; and the slightly longer answer is &quot;nobody really knows.&quot;</p>
<p>The US uses the English convention for writing currency symbols: the symbol of the primary currency unit goes before the number. So it's not just $50 but also £50, €50, ¥50 etc. Other languages do this differently, so saying that it's to reduce forgery seems like pure speculation: there is no good reason to suppose that only English-speaking businessmen saw a greater need to reduce forgery in this way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't find anything concrete to confirm it, but I think it may be something that English borrowed from Latin and then stuck with. Certainly the symbols for pre-decimal British currency are derived from Roman currency. Some (most?) other languages put the currency symbol after the number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In French, the dollar sign is always after the amount.</p>
<p>In English $123.45</p>
<p>In French 123,45$</p>
<p>I have no idea why the English put the sign first.</p>
<p>[ Edit : When I wrote 'French', I meant 'French Canadian' ]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
