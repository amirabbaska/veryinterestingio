		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't necessarily true... permanent disease and the notion of &quot;dry drunks&quot; is more of an AA philosophy, although I absolutely believe the more strongly addicted people will have permanent problems and might not be able to drink at all.  This is true of almost any addiction like gambling and sex addiction too (CP perhaps being a prominent example).  I can vouch for four people in my family who drank heavily 10-20 years ago and got help a long time ago, and avoid alcohol now but can still drink several beers socially with no problem.</p>
<p>AA is not the only answer, unfortunately this is exclusively what is embraced by the US legal and psychiatric system. There are alternative recovery programs for alcohol.  Moderation is a possibility, though the tragic story of Audrey Kishline needs to be read as a cautionary tale.  I personally don't think it's possible to go from alcohol abuse to moderation without a long period of sobriety, and even then it's risky. </p>
<p>Alcohol is extremely addictive and it does bring the danger of a permanent ruinous relationship, but for those who haven't been burned too bad by the addiction I am 100% sure it is possible to regain a normal relationship with it, but only after a couple of years of sobriety and after a lot of your Maslows Pyramid stuff is fixed.  You simply can't go back into social drinking when you've got relationship problems, no job, and without interests that fulfill you.</p>
<p>I'm not advising anyone to start drinking, but if all that stuff is addressed then your life is in a very secure place and alcohol is not that much of a risk. But if you had previously been drinking for 10 years and had failed marriages, DUIs, and rehab as a result of drinking, then you're a lot further along on the addiction spectrum and it's probably better to stay away regardless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Recovered sex addict here. Just wanted to add that while it is true that sex addicts learn to a way to have sex, then it's much more complicated than that. There are in many cases things that we stay away from forever just like alcohol. What these things are differ from person to person but the main idea is that some things will for a fact get a sex addict back into an addictive pattern while healthy and natural sex won't. Also it's not just something that comes easy so it requires continuing work to stay on the right path. Sex addicts have to rediscover a way to have healthy sex.
Since alcohol is not similarly complex then it's hard to say that some parts are healthy and some are not.
Completely removing yourself from anything sexual is not healthy. Just like food addicts can't just quit food but needs to figure out what works and what triggers binging. Alcohol is not a necessity and therefor it's easier to just cut it out. I do however believe that it is possible but since it's not easy then people just tend to not take the risk. Cause even recovered sex addicts have relapses and it's just easier to avoid relapses with alcohol by staying away completely. There is not really a good reason to drink so they don't. Long story short - it can be done if you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certified addiction treatment counselor here. Alcohol and other drugs are chemical addictions. Acts like sex, gambling, stealing are called process addictions. Chemical addictions and process addictions both change the way your brain is wired in similar ways and both cause your brain to release various chemical messengers that makes you feel good. However, chemical addictions have a far more severe and widespread effect on how your brain functions and cause much much higher levels of these chemical messengers than process addictions do.  The less severe impact process addictions have on the brain allows someone to continue doing something they were addicted to without it getting back to the place where it was so out of control or causing severe problems. With chemical addictions, the severity of the effects on the brain makes casual drug use almost not possible, which is why statistically speaking, abstinence based programs are the most effective in treating addiction/alcoholism. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone believes that alcoholics must abstain from alcohol for their entire lives. There are groups that support learning moderation:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.moderation.org/" target="_blank">http://www.moderation.org/</a></p>
<p>Alcoholics Anonymous is very popular but it is not necessarily the only way to recover. I know more than one alcoholic who recovered via abstinence and at a later stage in life took up alcohol in moderation (&lt;5 drinks per week) happily and can now socially drink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will start by saying that I am an alcoholic and not a sex addict. I am 2 years sober after many years of struggling and desperation. I got sober and stay sober through AA. For me, that is the only way, but I know it's not for everyone, and that's fine. I am also a part of Toronto AA which is predominantly atheists and agnostics. I went to AA to get sober and I stay b/c it makes my life better. As an alcoholic I am allergic to alcohol, in that the physical alcohol in the body sets off an obsession for wanting more. While most people can stop after a few, me being an alcoholic, will always want to continue drinking. I tried for many years to learn to drink in moderation, but even when I didn't drink until I blacked out, I was always obsessing about wanting more. I can only share my story here about why I can't moderate as it's not my place to discuss other alcoholics or sex addicts and their stories.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
