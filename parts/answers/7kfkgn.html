		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Freakin' magic, that's how!</p>
<p>In a nutshell, a polaroid is a little envelope that contains all the chemicals needed to develop and fix the picture.  Light hits chemicals that are sensitive to light, which react with reagents in a different layer that cause dyes to migrate into the first layer and become visible.</p>
<p>Developing a photograph takes time (the chemical reactions aren't instantaneous), and the first process to do instant color prints didn't work very well.  The solution was to add another layer of chemicals that opacify soon after the exposure to light.  This makes it dark inside the layers, and allows the time necessary for the developing and fixing process to happen without being exposed to more light.  That opacifier breaks down and becomes clear after a period of time.   That's what you're actually seeing when the polaroid comes out grey and image slowly shows up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the other posters have covered the developing process well, but I would like to add one thing. The white section down at the bottom contains many of the chemicals in a little pouch. When the photo is taken and comes out of the camera, it passes through rollers which pop this pouch and press the chemicals along the picture. The chemicals are still contained within internal layers so they don't get everywhere, though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's already been covered pretty well, but for those who are wondering how its possible, it works basically the same way as regular film works, just in one package.  Here is a very ELI5 version:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>There are chemicals in the paper that are light sensitive, such as silver.  Imagine it like a sun burn, you can place a stencil on your body, then expose it to light and you will have a darker skin color inside the stencil.  When silver is exposed to light it gets darker, this is why we have a negative when we take a film photo.  The brighter the light, the darker the silver becomes, so its giving the opposite effect of what we see with our eyes, so it needs to be reversed into a positive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even in polaroids, the exposed image starts as a negative, but the chemicals in the developer bleach out the negative and you are left with a positive.</p>
</li>
<li>The white tab you see at the bottom contains the developer, when the polaroid is ejected, the developer is squeezed out over the exposed image, which stops anymore exposure and also starts to develop the image.  After the image is developed and stopped, the negative gets bleached out after it leaves its imprint as a positive.  </li>
</ol>
<p>BONUS: When dealing with chemicals, temperature has an effect on developing times and the effect of the development.  If you have the chance, put your polaroid/instax in the freezer and then go outside and take a picture.  Then leave it out in the sun and take the same picture.  There will be a noticeable difference, such as different color-casts or exposures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/bazmonkey covered it well, but two things I will add:</p>
<p>Polaroid photos only need time to develop. &quot;Shake it like a Polaroid picture&quot; was something of a nervous tick we developed as a society. Shaking it did not help the photo develop at all.</p>
<p>Another thing; if you use something with a point to draw on the photo as it's developing (a screw driver, a nail, etc) you can get a pretty crazy effect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is how the old 600 film used to work, <a href="https://petapixel.com/2011/05/18/how-polaroid-instant-film-works/" target="_blank">Each instant photo contained chemical pouches at one end</a> I remember as a kid when the photo was taken my grandfather would put them face down in a small cardboard box that he carried the camera in to help keep them away from light as they developed.</p>
