		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Practice. It doesn't happen naturally. As others have said, it takes a lot of practice to even throw a specific weapon a specific distance. Practice long enough at different distances and you can learn to be reasonably effective. In an actual combat situation a thrown weapon is either an act of desperation or distraction.</p>
<p>A few suggestions for those idiots that are going to try this at home without expert supervision:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Don't. If you want to learn then find an expert willing to teach you. Renaissance Faires or historical reenactments are good places to look for a tutor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you aren't going to listen to the above advice then for the love of Thor make sure that no one else is at risk. People behind the target aren't safe, people next to the target aren't safe and people next to you aren't safe. Seriously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Weapons bounce back. Some will land blade first and you'll feel awesome, some will partially land blade first but will bounce off, most will land in an awkward mess handle first, but then occasionally it will hit this perfect polar opposite of a sweet spot at the edge of the bottom of the handle which will cause it to bounce back at your face. When you are learning this happens often enough to be a very real risk, but infrequently enough to catch you by surprise. Be ready for this. Don't set your target to close. And take the next advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start with a screwdriver. Seriously. They are a good first step for learners. Still treat it as a weapon, so all the above points still apply. Practice until you are sinking the screw end into the target every time and then work your way up to more deadly weapons. an added bonus is that now you know how to turn a common household tool into an effective thrown weapon. Cool.</p>
</li>
<li>Don't drink and throw. Ever. I know, it helps lift your game at pool, but pool balls don't cut your face in half when you get it wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: Suggestion of eye-wear is a good safety precaution too. Although there are other parts of the anatomy that are also vulnerable to flying knives and hatchets. Also others have suggested using proper practice knives instead of screwdrivers. That sounds like a good idea. I was taught to practice with screwdrivers before moving on to hatchets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is that they don't.</p>
<p>Thrown weapons are designed to give you the best chance to hit with the blade, but it takes a lot of practice and even then it isn't a sure thing.</p>
<p>People who throw knives or axes at fairs and circuses and such are entertainers working in more or less the same conditions every time. With lots of practice they can get good enough throwing <em>a specific weapon at a specific range into a specific target</em> that they can land the shot most of the time.</p>
<p>In TV and movies they're straight up cheating. They have as many tries as they need to get the shot right, or they use special effects. You only see the end result, which makes it look like thrown weapons are extremely accurate and deadly in the hands of a skilled user, when the reality is it's more of a toss-up.</p>
<p>The only exceptions would be weapons like throwing stars, which are designed to be sharp from every angle. Even then, they were hardly ever used as a primary killing weapon. They would instead be thrown as a distraction, or stuck in the ground in the hopes an enemy would step on them. But they were rarely, if ever, thrown at an enemy with the intent to land a killing blow.</p>
<p>While I'm sure there were a handful of people throughout history that got extremely good at throwing sharp things and used this skill in combat, for most people throwing a knife or axe in a fight just meant you were throwing your weapon away. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually teach throwing knives for a living (2 months a year) and do have a lot of insight into this.</p>
<p>They will hit tip first about 20% of the time.  There is no trick to it, the knives are as center balanced as can be or they are crap they sell to the uninformed.  Note that 20% is kind of misleading but under &quot;sterile&quot; conditions is accurate because 20% is the amount of the rotation that is capable of sticking into the board.</p>
<p>The way a practiced person does it is based on distance.  If you can properly gauge the distance then you can adjust your throw to rotate the right number of times.  My style of throw does 1 1/4 rotations per 10 feet (blade up on release).  So if my target is 15 feet I will release the knife at a different angle or hold by the other end to adjust how it hits.  My personal average is about 5/7 within a 5&quot; circle at about 12 feet.  When I change range I drop to about 50%.  Rinaldo of the danger committee can hit within about 1/4 inch from 10 feet and within about an inch from at least 20, but my god is that man talented.  Seen him cut a cucumber in half sitting on his partners forearm.</p>
<p>The average person will land 1/14 without instructions, some people get lucky some people have a knack for it but without help or practice you are bound to suck at it.</p>
<p>If you have questions I would be happy to answer them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well... As someone who has trained with throwing knifes for a bit... I think they landed blade first about 5% of the times i threw them for the first few hours... They land blade first because the people throwing them are really good at what they are doing, or because hollywood is cheating, depending on where you saw them </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to learn to judge distances. As the knife/ax travels it spins. So if you can accurately distance yourself from the target it should hit the correct side first. For example I throw a knife and 3 feet away from me it is oriented forward, then the next two feet it's not as it spins, then at 6 feet it is once again oriented correctly. As long as you distance yourself in one of these &quot;openings&quot; you should be able to strike the target with the knife correctly oriented.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
