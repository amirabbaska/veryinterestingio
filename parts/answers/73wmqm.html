		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before I go on, there are a few little things that make a big difference. Plastic is the cheapest. Glass is the most expensive. Cans are effective and still relatively cheap, and flavor issues aren't much of a concern as there's a small coating of plastic inside the can. Cans and glass bottles can also hold carbonation much more easily, hence why they're more likely to be the choice for beer and pop.</p>
<p>Beer: cans and glass bottles don't 'leak' oxygen through the walls, which spoils the beer. Bottles are usually heavily tinted and cans block all light which helps keep it from degrading, as some wavelengths of light break down flavors in the beer and make it taste pretty gross. </p>
<p>Pop: Cans, glass, and plastic. almost anything goes because they are sterile already and don't have to worry about the flavors spoiling like beer. Cans are relatively compact and fairly durable, but more expensive than plastic bottles, and glass bottles can help preserve the taste more, since cans have a thin plastic coating on the inside to prevent the aluminum from altering the taste. Glass bottles are the most expensive and most people don't notice or don't care enough to spend twice as much on a bottle of pop. </p>
<p>Water: Water, well, water. It doesn't have the flavors to worry about, so the cheapest option is chosen: plastic bottles. By using only one kind of bottle they can also further reduce the cost because the economies of scale are a beautiful thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The container cost is the majority of the cost of bottled water. Plastic resin as thin as possible is the cheapest container for water. Carbonated soda typically is also sold in a plastic container, albeit thicker to withstand the pressure of carbonation.</p>
<p>Some drinks, (Gatorade, Powerade) have fermentable sugars and have to be &quot;hot-filled&quot; to kill the bacteria that would allow fermentation to continue in the bottle. Those containers have to be even more substantial to withstand the heat of the product.</p>
<p>Beer could potentially be sold in plastic in an enclosed cardboard carton to eliminate light spoilage (they sell clear glass-bottled Corona and Miller Hi-Life) But from a marketing perspective, nobody wants their beer in plastic, so it's glass or aluminum</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beer comes in glass bottles or cans because certain wavelengths of light can damage ingredients in the beer and make it taste bad, and plastic doesn't block those wavelengths like aluminum and glass.</p>
<p>Aluminum cans could be used for water, but a bit of the aluminum does dissolve into the drink. Sodas typically have enough other flavorants that you don't notice the aluminum taste, but it would make plain water taste unpleasantly metallic. You'll notice that soda often gets stored in plastic bottles as well. Glass is more expensive than either, however, so you see that least often.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbon dioxide diffuses (escapes) through plastic faster than through metal, which is why it is preferred to store carbonated drinks in metal rather than plastic (this extends their shelf life before they go flat).  This is not a concern for water, so plastic is chosen because it's cheaper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is not photo sensitive nor is it pressurized. Cans are cheaper than glass and easier to recycle but beer (or soda) tastes better in glass. Plastic though is cheapest of them all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
