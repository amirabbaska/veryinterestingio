<p>Short answer seems to be that they don't know. </p>
<p>There are a number of factors (prey density, metabolism, hunting strategy) that are all pretty speculative, making it difficult to get something approaching a real answer. There's even <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4108409/" target="_blank">some evidence</a> of social behaviors - pack hunting remains a possibility. Hard to be very sure of specific animal behaviors from <del>150</del> 66 million years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know, I have always been a bit bothered by the ecology in Jurassic Park, especially as it's supposed to contain entire herds of sauropods.</p>
<p>Anyway, your comparison of tigers to dinosaurs is based on the faulty assumption that they have similar metabolisms, and so require similar amounts of food. There is mounting evidence that dinosaurs had a higher metabolic rate and were more active to their reptilian ancestors, but that doesn't necessarily mean they were as active as modern mammals. T. rex is a bit of an odd example, because as Tyrannosaurs evolved and got bigger, rather than extending their growth period, they just grew faster over the same period; which implies that, at least through their adolescence, they had a fairly high metabolism compared to their ancestors. On the other hand, their sheer size at adulthood would have meant that they didn't have to spend as much energy on maintaining their body heat (if anything keeping themselves cool would have been more of an issue).</p>
<p>There are also several ecological factors that could foul this comparison; the density of potential prey in the region, the amount that varies across the year, the difficulty in taking down the prey, competition from other predators, etc.</p>
<p>As to finding mates, bear in mind that T. rex had its head pretty far off the ground, which would have made it easy for it to see and hear other individuals at a distance. Such a large animal could probably roar pretty loud if that's how they communicated, and I've read at least one paper suggesting that the need to be seen at a distance played a role in determining theropod cranial anatomy.</p>
<p>So in terms of your question, I don't really know, and I'm not sure anyone can make a confident estimate without knowing a good deal more about T. rex and its ecosystem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Isle Royale National Park is approximately a half million acres and has been inhabited by upto 50 wolves and 500 moose. The cycle never stabilized and is highly studied.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an assumption here that the Tyrannosaur is a predator.  While not nearly as glamorous, there is evidence the animal was a scavenger.  Scavengers are more common than predators.  Work by paleontologist Jack Horner sheds light on this theory.  The animal could not run very quickly, so it is unlikely it chased prey like the dinonychus, etc.  It had a huge nasal cavity, like a vulture.  Its large body could have intimidated and run off the raptors that did the killing work for it.</p>
<p>Jack Horner looked at the population density.  He found a lot more Tyrannosaur remains than velociraptor, etc.  This is in line with current observations of scavenger/predator population ratios.  Don’t take my word for it!  Look up Jack!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
