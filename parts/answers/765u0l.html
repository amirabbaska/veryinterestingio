		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey there</p>
<p>I work for 2 major broadcasting companies in Canada, and in one (where I currently am, on a 10 hour shift) I am the person who ingests, quality checks, and approves all the commercials we air across all of our 7 channels.</p>
<p>So in Canada and the US, there are laws dictating how loud content is allowed to be. This includes both the actual show you are watching/listening too, and the commercials that are in between. Basically, the government says &quot;the maximum output allowed by anyone is _<strong>__</strong>&quot; and we all have to abide by that. My companies policy is that commercials must be withing -24  +/-2  LKFS (LKFS is a measurement of loudness). So every night I get a sheet of 40-150 commercials that need to be ingested, and I adjust their levels to be within this range.</p>
<p>So the best way to think about this is that the commercials themselves are not what are loud. Everything else is quiet. A standard has been set for everything across the entire network, and commercials are always safely within the margins. However, since the content you are actually trying to watch is dynamic, with loud and quiet spots, you likely are listening to it slightly louder than that standard would want you to so its easier for you to hear dialogue, or quiet parts in the show/music. This is especially noticeable if you constantly ride the volume level on your stereo or television when something loud happens. Since commercials generally want to be heard easily, and typically don't have dynamics, they seem to be much louder than everything else.</p>
<p>Side Note: There are ways that commercials can actually be slightly louder than others. Since the volume standard we use is an average over the entire spot, a quiet commercial with a loud portion at the end or a commercial of just straight dialogue vs dialogue over music can come out with different averages. Generally I adjust the volume of spots like this that seem super loud so they are more in line with the standard.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It’s not that the commercial is louder, it’s that the commercial is set to the highest volume point of the show, so while the show changes volume to add drama by raising it for shouting scenes and lowering it for somber scenes, the commercials don’t change along with the context of the show. This is the real reason commercials seem louder than the show.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Commercials come in louder because the advertisers want to ingrain their product in your mind and make sure you hear loud and clear what they are selling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our ear judges loudness as an average of loudness over time. A dramatic tv program will naturally have peaks and troughs in volume as different situations unfold (building tension with silence before a big scare in a horror movie for example). </p>
<p>Advertisements are “compressed” ie the loudest sounds are made quieter, the quieter sounds are made louder, and the general volume of everything is increased and pushed to the max. This is because they want your attention. </p>
<p>Generally you’ll find that radio sound levels are pretty regular as they’re made to be heard over the sound of your car, and no station wants to be quieter than the rest so they all pump it up to the max. You’ll also notice no difference in volume when the song goes from acoustic intro to anthemic Rock chorus. </p>
<p>As for podcasts, even some very popular ones have pretty sketchy audio production but that’s generally improved over the last few years. In my opinion, unskippable ads will probably start infiltrating soon and they will become more monetised, in which case they’ll fall into line with radio standards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not at all HARD; and there is a whole marketplace of tools for measuring and mitigating loudness due to the CALM act passed in 2010... it's just that these standards are only applied to broadcast/cable signals and the tools are expensive so not everyone uses them.</p>
<p>But there are ABSOLUTELY standards for normalizing volume (within reason; dynamics are a natural part of audio and not everything should be mixed to sound great in your car) and there are rules specifically governing programming and commercials-- ask anyone working in audio for broadcast and they'll tell you a HUGE portion of their life and budget in the last decade has been devoted to loudness and level requirements.</p>
<p>That said these rules are not in place for podcasts or services like hulu so those are a bit wild still- but if you're hearing extreme variation on broadcast commercials REPORT IT, they will issue a fine: <a href="https://www.fcc.gov/media/policy/loud-commercials" target="_blank">https://www.fcc.gov/media/policy/loud-commercials</a></p>
<p>I've written extensively on the topic of the CALM act and the LKFS system used to measure TV and broadcast loudness:
