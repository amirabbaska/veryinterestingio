		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Faces are processed differently in the brain than other visual stimuli (objects, other body parts, etc.). There's some thought that this evolved due to our closely-bonded social history as a species. Being able to accurately and quickly process faces even in low light / bad weather is important when identifying family vs strangers, opponents in a chaotic group fight, etc. We are also very emotional and communicative as a species and so there's a need to process facial expressions and fleeting microexpressions, requiring very high-resolution processing of faces.
It is currently hypothesized (with evidence) that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fusiform_face_area" target="_blank">fusiform face area</a> in the brain is a physical structure specialized for face processing. A patient with visual cortex damage was unable to recognize any regular objects, but could still recognize faces - supporting that they are processed differently. Interestingly, he couldn't recognize upside-down faces that the healthy participants could - the upside down face doesn't have the right arrangement of features to be &quot;processed as a face by the face-processor&quot; and got handled as an object instead, in his case poorly.
Returning to the question, faces are particularly hard to convincingly render in CGI because they're processed by the brain at a different higher level of detail. It's harder to fool our specialized FFA and easy for things to look &quot;just a bit off&quot; aka obviously a reconstruction.    That being said, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjHiC0mt4Ts" target="_blank">we're getting pretty close, even in 2014</a>. Most CGI isn't to that level of detail due to artist time / rendering time / budget considerations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You do realize you don't know about the times you did see a CG human and didn't realize it wasn't real.  This happens in movies far more often than you realize.  They map a CG face over a stunt man all the time.  So this thread is telling you why the ones you caught failed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Micro-expressions.  Faces are the first thing we learn to focus on as infants.  Tiny facial movements we subconsciously expect are missing, and the little sub-c guy that lives inside us starts sending out warnings.  Eventually software will take this into account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subsurface_scattering" target="_blank">subsurface scattering</a>.</p>
<p>Skin is partially transparent. Light passes through the surface of skin, where it is scattered inside and some of it passes back out of the skin in other places. This gives a soft look to skin.</p>
<p>Rendering skin so that that light is reflected only from its surface gives the skin an artificial, plastic look because this doesn't accurately represent the way light interacts with skin.</p>
<p>To make skin look more realistic, it's necessary to simulate subsurface scattering, but this more computationally expensive (that is, it takes longer). In a game, there may not be time for this extra processing, and faces are usually not the most important part of the graphics anyway.</p>
<p>If there is time to do this extra processing, as in a movie, the results become <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=face+render+subsurface+scattering&amp;safe=active&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbo=u&amp;source=univ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwoN3-uL_UAhXrA8AKHSL8CTEQsAQIJQ&amp;biw=1643&amp;bih=700" target="_blank">eerily realistic</a>.</p>
