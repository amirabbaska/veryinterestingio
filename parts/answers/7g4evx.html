		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly a missconception that mosquitoes transmit diseases by allowing virus infected blood of one person to be innoculated into another. What happens ia that some virus actually infect mosquitoes (they actually multiply inside the mosquito gut and salivary glands), from which the virus is then innoculated in another person (usually, but not always) through the mosquitoes saliva. So why some virus can be transmitted by mosquitoes and others can't? Because some virus infect mosquitoes and thus survive and multiply inside the mosquito, those that dont infect the mosquito are just digested with the host's blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>AIDS, hepatitis etc can only infect humans (with the exception of some Hep strains that can also infect pigs)</p>
<p>Malaria, Zika, Chagas, West Nile are all caused by organisms that can infect two or more species. It isnt like a dirty needle where the infected blood is transported from one person to the other.</p>
<p>Malaria for example is present in an infected humans blood. The mosquito drinks the blood, the malaria infects the mosquito and begins to reproduce in its gut. The parasite then travels to the mosquitos salivary glands so it can be passed into a human when the mosquito eats. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It boils down to whether or not a given pathogen has adapted to include mosquitoes in it's life cycle, such as Plasmodium Falciparum. </p>
<p>When a mosquito is included in a pathogen's life cycle it has to play host to it. Therefore it must be susceptible to being infected by it. The diseases that aren't transmitted by insect vectors can't properly infect these insects. </p>
<p>Also AIDS can't be transmitted by mosquitoes because AIDs isn't a pathogen, it is a condition. AIDS stands for Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome it is the consequence of the body battling for a long time with the Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) .</p>
<p>People with HIV don't get AIDS straight away, maybe decades later, or if at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
