		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because batteries do not store electricity.</p>
<p>They store chemicals. And when those chemicals react they MAKE electricity to power your phone.</p>
<p>Plugging your phone in doesnt fill your phone with electrity, its using the electricity to move the chemicals back to where they were.</p>
<p>And when that happens, the battery is able to make electricity again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, charging is a chemical reaction. The speed of electricity is irrelevant. </p>
<p>Charging can be sped up to a point, but cells have current and voltage limits. The current limit prevents the cell from overheating. The voltage limit prevents metallic lithium from forming in the wrong place, which will lead to dramatic cell failure. The devices which have been recalled for lithium batteries exploding or catching fire have almost all had overcharging problems. </p>
<p>The charge of a nearly empty lithium cell is done with a constant current at first. This is the fastest part of the charge. </p>
<p>When the cell reaches 4.2 volts, the charger keeps the voltage at that level. This phase is slower because as the cell becomes charged, its open circuit voltage approaches 4.2 V and the lower voltage difference means less current flows. When the current reaches a low level (around 5% of the initial current), the charging is complete. </p>
<p>Other cell chemistries like Ni-Cd and lead acid can take full charging current for the whole charge cycle, but must be terminated before cell damage occurs. </p>
<p>TLDR: They charge slowly to protect the cell from damage. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, electricity is not that fast down a wire. Electromotive Force is fast, but the electrons themselves are slow. </p>
<p>If you imagine a wire as a tube filled with blue balls - as soon as you put a fresh red ball in one end, a blue one will fall out the other end. However to get that red ball to fall out the end will take some time. </p>
<p>So, when you are charging a battery you are removing electrons from one end and pushing more into the other, via the chemical reactions others have mentioned. These electrons move at a speed measured in centimetres per hour. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of the battery like a swimming pool. To charge it up you gotta fill the pool with water. Even if I use a garden hose with the water shooting out really fast, it is still going to take awhile for the pool to fill up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simply? Two reasons.</p>
<p>First, moving electricity causes heat, so we need to only put a little in at a time so things don't melt.</p>
<p>Second, think of filling a jug with a tap slightly on vs full force. Less water at a time allows the water in the jug to settle and make room for the incoming water. At full force it interferes with itself and you make a mess. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
