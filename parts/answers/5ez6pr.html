		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The connector you mention is a C13/C14 connector.</p>
<p>The female part is a C13  and the male part is a C14.</p>
<p>They are part of an international standard called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEC_60320#Appliance_couplers" target="_blank">IEC 60320</a> that also includes the two pronged razor type connectors (C1/C2) and the three pronged &quot;mickey mouse&quot; style connectors (C5/C6) as well as bigger connectors for larger devices like the (C19/C20) and variants of these common connectors for things that get really, really hot like waffle irons and kettles.</p>
<p>The idea behind these connectors is that, most countries have different sort of wall-plugs and if you make a product that is going to be sold world-wide and hardwire the cord into it you are going to need dozens of different versions of your product.</p>
<p>If you make them with these standardized connectors instead you can make only one version and just include a cord that fits for the region you are shipping it.</p>
<p>You can even take your device to a different region and simply switch out the cord to use it there.</p>
<p>In the old days that would sometimes lead to danger because some countries run on 240V and others on 110V but modern computer power supplies don't care about that anymore. </p>
<p>The power supplies transform whatever AC you give them into the right sort of DC, so they really don't care about what region you are in and what voltage and frequency your electricity has or what type of wallplugs you use.</p>
<p>In fact if you go into a real server-room or data-center you will find that the wallplugs of whatever region you are in are really non-existent, all the electronic devices connect directly with C13&lt;-&gt;C14 extension cords into the power supply of the server-rom usually redundantly and with some sort of emergency power in case of blackout being involved.</p>
<p>The plugs of the IEC standard have sort of become universal for that sort of equipment.</p>
<p>As for the specififc shape of the plug and outlet. there are three prongs because it is earthed and the shape is so that you can only plug it in one-way because it allows for polarization. (Of course that doesn't mean that the other end that plugs into the wall will have to also have these features).</p>
<p>The plugs are compatible with the inlets of the unearthed version of the standard (C17/C18) and the inlets are compatible with the plugs of the higher temperature versions of the standard (C15(a)/C16(a)).</p>
<p>They are rated for up to 10 ampere and incompatible with the plugs and inlets of the standards for more or less Ampere.</p>
<p>All that is designed to keep people from accidentally frying their equipment, themselves or burning their house down to easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: IBM used medical power supplies in their first PCs, they used that cord. Once a standard was picked there was no reason to change.</p>
<p>Lots of people have explained the cords and why we use detachable ones, but if you are wondering why that specific cord. It's because when computers where first being made by IBM they where choosing off the shelf parts, and the only power supplies that existed that where powerful enough and small enough where used in medical equipment. The power supplies they choose used that cord and while no one uses PSU from medical equipment anymore, once that cord style was picked there was no reason to change. </p>
<p>EDIT: PC should read micro-computers. Those where the desk sized machines that came before PCs. Some people have rightly pointed out that IBM had the power supplies made for PCs specific, however they used all the standard from the micro-computer which where using power supplies made by medical equipment manufactures because they already had the capacity to make the power supplies. We can nit pick more details if we want but the cord comes from the fact that IBM used 3rd party manufactures for lots of equipment and power supplies for DC power where easy to order from medical equipment manufactures, so they did. That's why it uses that cord.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It allows computers &amp; their components to easily be used in other countries.  A modern computer power supply can handle American 110V@60Hz power or European 220V@50Hz sources without even having to flip a switch.  In the old days, they could still be switched with a single switch.</p>
<p>Most consumer electronics are built to be sold in massive quantities and be as cheap as possible.  The large sales figures allow you to have hardwired connections &amp; the low prices means you don't want to deal with the added cost of a connector.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other comments do an excellent job of explaining why the detachable cord is useful. However if like to point out that it's not just computers that use this type of connector. TV's, computer monitors, speakers, and printers also use the same one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said you can change them when you visit countries but they'd also be a pain in the arse to fit if the plug didn't detach, most cases have mesh where the psu goes and only enough room for the socket. Same thing with tvs, if you wall mount a TV you're better off with a 90Â° plug. It's easier to fit if you can change the plug at the base, you can also buy longer plugs if you have a strange layout without having a massive extension cord on the floor. Pcs and tvs are also easier to transport and package flat rather than having wires coming out from the backs which could get damaged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
