		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally, when you eat food, you taste the flavors when you're chewing it in your mouth. Once you swallow it, it goes into your tummy and gets broken up into tiny pieces and mixed around, and then your body takes those tiny pieces and puts them into your blood to make sure your whole body has the good stuff it needs. Usually, after this happens, the stuff that makes food taste good or bad has been broken up and doesn't have a taste anymore. Some food, like garlic and onion, have special little pieces that don't lose their flavor  after they are broken up and put in your blood, so when the blood takes them from your stomach to your lungs, you taste them again when you breathe out. Also, these same pieces can be sucked up by your skin. To try this out, if you put some cut up garlic in between your toes, you can taste it after a little while.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a compound in garlic called allyl methyl sulfide (AMS). It is a gas which gets absorbed into the blood when you are digesting the garlic (and onions and shallots). From the blood it is transferred to the lungs where it is then exhaled. A big part of flavor reception is through the nose so you get that lingering taste that way.   Some of the AMS compound is also released through the skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this is allowed but small LPT I read on reddit once upon a time.  If your hands smell like garlic and the smell doesn't come off with soap try rubbing them against the steel sink and wash them again. Apparently the steel does something to neutralize the odor.  </p>
<p>I didn't believe it but it totally works!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
