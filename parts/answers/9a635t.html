Two-phase power is equivalent to a two-pedal bicycle, and there are moments&mdash;when one pedal is all the way up and the other is all the way down&mdash;when pedalling is really hard and inefficient.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Available power. With no phase ever crossing zero at the same time, you get a better delivery of constant power.  NOT DC, but the availability to do work in a more efficient manner...Specially when spinning things in a circle like motors. </p>
<p>More than 3 would nor necessarily be worth the expense, and less is just not as efficient. So like all orher good engineering practice 3 phase balances all the up-side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Transmitting power over three phase is very copper efficient.  If you have a single phase generator then you have two wires coming off of it(hot and neutral) which both carry the full current.  If your generator is 100V and supplying 10,000W then each wire needs to support the 100 A of current.  If you have a three phase generator still supplying 100V L-N then it has 3 big wires coming off of it(Phase A, B, and C) and each wire only needs to support 33A.  This just dropped you from wire that is 7.3mm in diameter(1 gauge) to wire that is 3.25mm in diameter.  You need 3 wires now instead of 2 but your wires are now 20% the weight of the other ones so you've saved a crap load of copper saving power companies a ton of money</p>
<p>That's why we transmit three phase power from power stations</p>
<p>For industrial generators and motors, the reduced current through the wire again means smaller wire, and smaller wire means more compact generators and motors which means a smaller/lighter piece of equipment that takes up less space on the floor and costs less overall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you picture a sine wave: 2 phase hit zero volts at regular inetervals. 3 phase does not. </p>
<p>Think of it as: 3 phase is working all the time. 2 phase is not. </p>
<p>Therefore: 3 phase is more efficient</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With AC current, the voltage produced and the power output is not constant between any moments in time. So if you only have single phase AC current, this means whatever's hooked up to pulses on and off. So that lightbulb above you is actually turning off 120 times a second. To fast for you to see visually since the brain just sort of averages it out, but if you've a video camera with the wrong frame rate you can actually see this happening. Although some places like stadiums actually use three phase for lighting, it's how they get around that flickering when using proper slow motion cameras for replays.</p>
<p>This is just fine for many uses, and you can split a single phase off a three phase line with a little bit of extra work, which is why the current in your house is single phase. In many other cases, this isn't acceptable, industrial motors are a common example. A single phase AC motor experiences that power pulsing on and off, just like the light does, which leads to inconsistent torque, more vibration, less efficient and needs to be run off a higher voltage (which means thicker more expensive wires in transmission)  to compensate. </p>
<p>The simplest way to get around that issue is to add another AC current into the mix, but slightly offset from the first one which gets you 2 phase AC current. unlike with single phase, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Elementary_Two_Phase_Alternator.jpg/1024px-Elementary_Two_Phase_Alternator.jpg" target="_blank">the voltage suppplied by two phase is never quite equal to zero</a>. Where the voltage in phase A is at zero, the voltage in phase B is at a peak and vice versa. And throughout a lot of the early 20th century, 2 phase was pretty common, and you can still find it in a few places </p>
<p>2 phase has a few downsides however. Where single phase only needs two wires for (source and neutral), 2 phase needs at least three wires, one for each source plus the neutral, and the neutral needs to be able to handle up to 50% more current due to that point where Phase A and Phase B intersect, which means a larger and more expensive wire. You Can get around that by running a pair of source and neutral for each phase, but then you're running four wires instead of three, which means increased cost and complexity. </p>
<p>Enter 3 phase. It turns outs that by offsetting 3 AC currents <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/3_phase_AC_waveform.svg/548px-3_phase_AC_waveform.svg.png" target="_blank">like this</a> , you can create a balanced circuit without the need for a neutral wire, the other source wires can instead do this job. Which means that you can get the same benefits of a two phase system, but only using three wires, all of the same thickness. This means a 3 phase system costs a lot less to run than a 2 phase system. Infact it costs less than single phase, because you can transmit the same average power but using lesser voltages, which allows for less thick wires and conductors. </p>
<p>We can go further and higher phase order systems have been built, (usually in multiples of three. So 6 phase, 12 phase etc), however the improvement over 3 phase is far less dramatic  however they require more wire, more equipment and so on, which makes them more expensive to build. Generally speaking, the improvement is in no way worth the cost, so no one bothers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
