		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of Queens, Queen Regnant and Queen Consort.</p>
<p>Queen Regnant inherits the position from the previous monarch, and is the ruling head of state</p>
<p>Queen Consort is the wife of the current monarch and has no official role within the state.</p>
<p>There is no equivalent King Consort, so Philip could only be Prince Consort instead. Ruling Queens have avoided naming their partner as King to avoid appearing weaker or not in charge.</p>
<p>The only occasion where a Queen Regnants husband was styled King was as a result of the glorious revolution when Mary replaced her deposed father on condition that her husband be allowed to rule jointly with her</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Wife receives the female equivalent of her husband's title<br />
A Husband receives nothing from his wife's titles, and just uses his own title, if anything.</p>
<p>So the wife of Sir Patrick Stewart is &quot;Lady Stewart&quot;, but the husband of Dame Helen Mirren is just &quot;Mr Hackford&quot;</p>
<p>The Wife of the Earl of Wessex is &quot;the Countess of Wessex&quot;, however the husband of the Princess Royal is &quot;Sir Timothy Laurence&quot;</p>
<p>So the Wife of King George was Queen, because she adopted the female equivalent of his title. The Husband of the Queen however just uses the highest of his own personal titles, which is currently Prince.</p>
<p>Philip was born a Prince (though of Greece and of Denmark, not of the UK) however he renounced those titles prior to marrying the Queen (or Princess Elizabeth) as she then was and became just been &quot;Mr Mountbatten&quot;. To Avoid the future queen legally being just &quot;Mrs Mountbatten&quot;, George granted Philip the title of Duke of Edinburgh on the eve of his marriage, so that she was The Duchess of Edinburgh. After she became queen, she gave Philip the additional title of Prince, but that was her gift, rather than him getting it automatically</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This does not applies to UK. It's just some fun fact I remembered. When Poland was ruled by a woman she was called a queen. But officially she was a king. It's always confusing for Polish kids &quot;how can a woman be a king&quot;, but she was. You can check Jadwiga of Poland in Wikipedia. But a problem appeared. She got married. Her husband became king as well. The queen already was a king, you cannnot take the title from her. What now then? Simple. Until her death, for 13 years, Poland had two independent kings at once. Luckily for Poland they were smart enough not to give contradictory orders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reasons for this are perhaps a bit sexist, but it basically boils down to the fact that people have historically tended to think of kings as &quot;outranking&quot; queens - they're higher values in a pack of cards, after all. And up until very recently, a male prince would be higher in the order of succession than his older sister(s).</p>
<p>Because the authority (or at least, the kabuki theatre of ceremonial authority which is the modern British crown) of the monarch should not be undermined by their spouse, the female spouse of a reigning male monarch is a queen and the male spouse of a reigning female monarch is a &quot;Royal Consort&quot;.</p>
<p>Like pretty much everything to do with the British monarchy, it's all a bit old-fashioned and anachronistic, rooted more in tradition than in modern sensibilities and logic.</p>
<p>as /u/flooey correctly mentioned however, that tradition is subject to change and it may be that &quot;consort&quot; becomes the permanent title for the monarch's spouse from now on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
