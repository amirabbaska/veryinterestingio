		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the specific case of air in a whistle and water in a whistle, the what’s actually happening is this: the shape of the whistle causes a rapid rise and drop in air pressure inside the whistle. This is the vibration — sound. In text form the pressure goes HiLowHiLowHiLowHiLowHiLow. </p>
<p>Unlike air, water does not compress and decompress. Because water won’t compress, it won’t generate the same kind of vibrations — especially if you use the same whistle. In text form the pressure goes SameSameSameSameSameSame — no vibration here.  </p>
<p>If you picked a denser medium, but one that still compresses (say, sulfur hexafluoride) the whistle would still work — I would expect it to sound deeper.   </p>
<p>The difference here is not about how sound <em>travels</em>, it’s about sound <em>gets created</em>. </p>
<p>Edit: should have said sulfur hexafluoride (Not sodium)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><del>The noise is not caused by the air in the first case. It's caused by the air being forced through the whistle... and it's the interaction with that solid object that causes that object to vibrate and therefore give off noise.</del> <strong>REDACTED - this is incorrect</strong>. I learned something new today.</p>
<p><del>Other, denser mediums like water that are going through a contained pinch point in a way that that creates a vibration create noise as well. Go water your lawn with a garden hose to hear a common example. And putting your ear next to the hose as you spray it proves that the medium (the water in the hose, or the hose itself) also transmits that sound.</del></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is? Like your shower head makes a high pitched sound, or think of hose too. The air is less dense and takes less energy to vibrate so its pounder than the thicker water but if you pushed the water through strong and fast enough it’ll make a high pitches sound too </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do, in that they create vibrations. However our ears only hear a specific range of vibrations. Which in itself is probably its own ELI5 but I assume it's to reduce noise and as such improve clarity/detection of pertinent sounds. IE that which is important to our survival, like fellow human voices. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
