		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they don't make any money. They rely on public funding. A good employee at a for-profit company helps bring in more money, so the company has incentive to pay them more. A good teacher or police officer doesn't bring any more money to the school or police department, in most cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several reasons:</p>
<p>1) There are lots of people who want those jobs. That good feeling you get when you help someone can be referred to as non-monetary compensation.</p>
<p>2) The benefits are related to the number of people they are directly interacting with. Compare this to a TV star who can entertain millions concurrently through technology.</p>
<p>3) Overall efficiency hasn't gone up much. That is, technology doesn't allow teachers who used to teach 20 students to now teach 500.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is my opinion. I hope I don't get too downvoted - instead I welcome someone to show me other ways to think of it. When measured against the metrics that determine whether they did a great job or a poor job their &quot;value over replacement&quot;, or how much extra value they bring over an average person, is low. I pull this theory a bit from sports but hope it makes sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
