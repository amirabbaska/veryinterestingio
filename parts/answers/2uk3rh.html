		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would guess - I'm not entirely sure - that your lamp detects changes in its capacitance. The capacitance, easily said, is the amount of power you need to charge the lamp fully. If the lamp stands by itself, it has a certain capacitance. If the cat sits on it, that capacitance changes, because the cat is now part of the system. <del>That means when the cat initially sits on the lamp, the lamp should toggle</del> (Actually there might be a threshold the cat doesn't meet. That's probably to prevent evil cats from strobing your bed light). Now when you touch your cat, you add to the whole system's capacitance even more. The lamp detects that and toggles.</p>

<p>Edit: proper wording, thanks</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With a touch lamp you can make a daisy chain / train of people. As far as it goes all the people will act as the touch surface. So if 10 people are connected to the lamp the 11th person will be able to use any part of the 10th person as a button ;).  Similarly, if the first person is electrocuted so will all the rest. Just saying. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Relatedly, here's a fun thing to do if you work with data or telco cabling-</p>
<p>There's a tool called a fox &amp; hound. You attach the fox to a wire with alligator clips and it sends a tone down any continuous electrical path. You can then go to the area where you suspect the wire comes out. If you wave the 'hound' in the vicinity of the wire, the tone is picked up by inductance. There's a pointed part(actually a short antenna) so you can identify single wires easier.</p>
<p>If you have a real rat's nest of cabling built up the fastest way to explore is to hold the 'hound' in one hand and poke around in the wire with the other. The conductivity of your skin is surprisingly good. You can reach into an area with no visibility and grab a piece of cat-5 and hear the hound light up. Then, you already have the cable in your hand and start pulling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
