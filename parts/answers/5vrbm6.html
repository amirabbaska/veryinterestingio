<p>You'd have wet coal.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite being quite heavy, the ocean is WAY too little pressure to turn coal into diamonds. </p>
<p>For diamonds, we're talking 237,000 to 1,300,000 atm. The bottom of the Mariana Trench, one of the deepest parts of the ocean, has about 1,070 atm.</p>
<p>So we don't even need to get into the trouble of retrieving stuff from the deepest part of the ocean, because it's just gonna be wet coal. </p>
<p>As something of an aside, most diamonds are not actually formed from coal. Much of the carbon that went on to form diamonds likely predates any of the living material that would form coal altogether.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So. In keeping with the spirit of the thread and not engaging in trollery, the followup question is:</p>
<p>If on the bottom of the ocean, the carbon is just &quot;wet coal&quot;, HOW DEEP of a (completely theoretical) ocean would be needed to provide the necessary pressure to form diamonds?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Edit: a lot of people seem to think I'm commenting on the rarity of diamonds, and that I am hatching a grand scheme of deep diving to my diamond trench to live alone with my riches while you are left to fight amongst yourselves for your slowly disappearing supply of diamonds. I assure you I just had a random shower thought, and this is not a commentary on &quot;Big Diamond&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
