		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a bunch of different factors, but here's a rough list:</p>
<p>Type of milk.... cow? Goat? Sheep? A mix? Does the animal eat mostly green grass? Hay? All of these change the flavor, fat and protein content of the final cheese. </p>
<p>How hot you get the milk during the initial stages, before you add the rennet (curdling enzyme). </p>
<p>Water content: Do you loosely pack the curds and let them drain? Do you &quot;cheddar&quot; them by heavily salting them and pressing as much of the whey out as you can? Again, this has a profound effect on the final cheese. </p>
<p>Inoculation: The bacteria, molds, etc used to ferment the cheese. This can be a function of the temperature and humidity you choose, the location, the salt content, and of course you can <em>literally</em> swab it on the cheese, add it in, etc. </p>
<p>&quot;Other&quot;: So... some cheese have spices or seeds added, or they're packed in straw, or aged in a dry cave for years, or swabbed with bacterial sponges every few days (muenster, yum). Is it aged for a few weeks, eaten fresh  (like haloumi), or aged so that the original cheese has been almost completely converted? Cheese mites also can play a role, and many other fun organisms. </p>
<p>Finally... in the high end you have &quot;post-production&quot; known as &quot;Affinage&quot;. This is a matter of taking your cheese to a master cheese &quot;ager&quot;, who probably has a little cellar with ideal conditions, and a ton of expertise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ingredients are not really pretty much the same. </p>
<p>The species of animal giving the milk, the kind of feed that animal gets, if you skim the cream off the milk, the kind of rennet you use to start the process, the kinds of bacteria you use to culture the cheese if it is cultured, the kind of fungi you use, the kind of herbs and spices you use, the amount of time you age it, the condition you age it in, the amount of moisture you press out of it, etc all change the flavors of the cheese. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The age of the cheese, the milk used, the cooking process, and the bacteria/fungi used can all vary which gives cheese different flavors and textures. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
