		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, when someone gets a tattoo, ink is injected deep into the skin. It goes below the epidermis, which is the layer of skin where cells are constantly growing and sloughing off, and into the dermis, where things are more stable. Cells do get replaced in the dermis, but dead cells are not sloughed off like in the epidermis. Rather, the remnants of dead cells are eaten up by other cells. </p>
<p>In other words, what's in the dermis will stay there unless removed by cells. Tattoo ink cannot be eaten or broken down by the body's cells, so it will sit in the dermis forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surprised nobody has really given the entire answer, and I'm not even an expert in tattoos or biology (a little worrisome). </p>
<p>Tattoo &quot;ink&quot; is really just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heavy_metals" target="_blank">heavy metal</a> particles too large for your white blood cells to remove.</p>
<p>Tattoo fading (and hence why touchups are oftentimes sought out) are due to some parts of the ink not having large enough particles to defend against the white blood cells.</p>
<p>Even though cells are being replaced, there's nothing to physically remove and expel the heavy metal particles.</p>
<p>This is why tattoo removal is painful (it requires a laser beam to rapidly heat the particles, causing them to explode into tinier pieces to allow for white blood cells to remove them) and thus why different types of lasers are required to remove different colors (pigments or metal types).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0B7F5UbTOQ" target="_blank">Here's a really good video that explains a lot of this.</a> I generally dislike that particular channel but they did a good job with this one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you get a tattoo, you're not placing all the ink inside of cells. You're getting the ink all over under the skin, so you have bits of ink between cells. The fading of tattoos is not so much due to skin cells being replaced, but more because of white blood cells removing particles of ink from the body.</p>
<p>Destin at Smarter Every Day did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0B7F5UbTOQ" target="_blank">video on laser tattoo removal</a> which might be helpful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>tattoos are made of ink stuck inside your body, surrounded by cells. this is a very rough metaphor, but imagine a plastic bag filled with water, and you replaced all the atoms of the plastic bag one by one. technically its a new bag, but the water is still being held inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
