		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a difficult question to answer because we have very few planets to observe. We have observed thousands of exoplanets, but most are far enough away that it's difficult to ascertain detailed data, and we only know of a handful of rogue planets (planets outside solar systems).</p>
<p>In short, I'll say that yes, it's possible. There are a few possibilities as to how a rogue planet could generate enough heat for the surface to be habitable. I think the most likely option would be a system of two bodies (planet-planet or planet-moon) whereby <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_heating" target="_blank">tidal heating</a> warms the secondary. (Tidal heating is essentially heating due to deformation of the planet from tides. It's similar to how a metal coat hanger gets hot when you bend it, except on a much larger scale.)</p>
<p>Another possibility is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geothermal_energy" target="_blank">radioactive decay</a>. This is where a lot of Earth's heat comes from. I'm not knowledgeable enough to say as to how viable/likely this is, or whether or not there are other side effects from a planet with strong radioactive decay.</p>
<p>A third possibility is that the planet is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_dwarf#Low-mass_brown_dwarfs_vs._high-mass_planets" target="_blank">sub-brown dwarf</a>-sized. In this case, the planet would be gaseous, so it doesn't quite qualify, but a very high mass gas giant/low mass brown dwarf would be capable of sustaining life-giving temperature. Of course, without a solid surface, it's not known if life is possible or what it would look like, but scientists and sci-fi writers have speculated about life on a gas giant.</p>
<p>Edit: Paper in the Astrophysics Journal proposing exactly this: <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/735/2/L27/meta" target="_blank">http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2041-8205/735/2/L27/meta</a></p>
<p>The author proposes that a thick ice layer would insulate the planet enough to retain it's internal heat. Other researchers have suggested that either ice or a dense atmosphere would provide adequate insulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without a sun, the planet would have to have a continuous thermal gradient from the centre outwards. The core is hottest, the crust is solid but warm. And the atmosphere would be warmed only by the ground/geothermal vents. This would mean any life would have to live in caves, probably, as the atmosphere would be very cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is hypothesized that objects are ejected from planetary systems in gravitational interactions, and that this sometimes happens to planets. If an Earthlike planet were ejected, almost all of the life on the surface would die. There would be a few places where geological activity continues to sustain moderate temperatures. If the planet had had a large moon that helped maintain geological dynamism, and that moon had been lost in the gravitational encounter that ejected the planet, then after a period of adjustment, the hot spots would occur less frequently. Underground life would carry on much as before. As the planet's core cooled, it would contract, and stresses would create fractures into which water would accumulate. There would be a range of water temperatures, with higher temperatures at lower depths. Gradually, water would be lost to freezing at lesser depths, and the fissures would become filled with gas, with just a little water at the bottom. Life would evolve to exploit all these niches. If intelligent life evolved, it might discover its natural history, and develop technology to explore the frozen surface, where it would discover the sky.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surface? I don't know. However, there <em>are</em> organisms on Earth that survive without the sun, only getting energy from geological chemical sources.  However, given a hot enough core I don't see why not. We don't know what sort of conditions life can live in, but theoretically there's nothing stopping an entire ecosystem developing from geothermal energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
