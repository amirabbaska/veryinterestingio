<p>So why is 8 hours recommended?</p>
<p>Wouldn't that logic suggest that either 6 or 9 hours would be ideal?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain has something called Circadian Rhythm, and sleep cycles. One full sleep cycle is 90 minutes, and that's enough time to wake up and feel fully refreshed. This goes in intervals as well. For example, three hours of sleep would feel great, but four hours and you'll wake up groggy, because you're waking up mid cycle. </p>
<p>It's said that philosophers like Aristotle and Da Vinci literally lived around the clock on 90 minute &quot;power naps&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just based on a 90 minute cycle, you probably woke up half an hour into a second cycle at 6:30.</p>
<p>Side note: I did the exact same thing at the same times this morning. Also felt good at 4:30 and shitty at 6:30</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you experienced what is known as &quot;sleep inertia&quot;</p>
<p>The 90 minute cycle is really only a guideline. The level of recommended sleep is somewhere between 6 and 8 hours and there is a lot of contention about what the proper amount is, and why sleeping is a biological imperative for us.</p>
<p>Non-rapid eye movement (NREM sleep) is sleep where you do not (usually) dream. When I first started my psych degree there were 4 stages of NREM but they have since been consolidated into 3.</p>
<p>Note that dreaming usually occurs in REM sleep but has been known to occur outside of it in some respects in EEGs</p>
<p>Phases of NREM in order of descending brainwave frequency:</p>
<p>1 - Lightest sleep just after you nod off. This usually lasts less than 15 minutes. Brainwave frequencies are close to awake brain activity in this stage.</p>
<p>2 - Lower frequency brain waves with occasional spikes in brain frequency. Transition phase and has split characteristics</p>
<p>3 - Deep sleep. This is sleep that is difficult to interrupt and if people are interupted in this phase they will have a hard time waking up until their brain frequency catches up.</p>
<p>Sleep is only somewhat understood and the brain less so
but our models and theories show that a typical sleep cycle goes like this</p>
<p>A - Awake
R - Rem sleep</p>
<p>A 1 2 3 2 1 R (1 or 2) 3 2 R 1 2 3 2 1 A</p>
<p>It is believed that stage 3 does what ever &quot;repairing&quot; our body needs as far as consolidating memories, replenishing the myelin sheath etc.</p>
<p>If you are awakened from stage 3 you will most likely feel very fatigued and tired. </p>
<p>While some level of confusion may be present if you are awoken from REM sleep this is a higher frequency state and you are more likely to vividly remember your dreams if you wake up from REM or stage 1.</p>
<p>After you went back to sleep, you most likely descended back into P3 or P2 and your brain frequency was likely still slowing.</p>
<p>Sleep inertia happens when you are awakened either in REM or deep sleep</p>
<p>Your brain was saying &quot;Hey, you need to go back to sleep we didn't finish the cycle&quot;</p>
<p>That being said, while sleep and our brains dominate our lives, we still understand very little about their function and utility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At 4:30 your body had completed it's sleep cycle and because of which you woke up. Where as at 6:30 you went on to sleep just because the laziness had kicked in. Whenever next time you wake up naturally try starting your day at that time itself instead of going back to sleep. In my experience you will feel much more fresh throughout nthe day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
