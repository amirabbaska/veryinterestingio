		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey! Something I am actually qualified to answer! I actually started a <a href="https://blog.birchfinance.com/newbies-beat-the-banks/" target="_blank">beginner's guide/series to reward programs</a> on my blog and <a href="https://birchfinance.com" target="_blank">my startup built an app</a> that helps you optimize your credit card rewards and find the best cards for your spending.</p>
<p>There are two main parts that make up credit card reward programs:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Earning rewards  </li>
<li>Redeeming rewards  </li>
</ul>
<p>There are three types of reward currencies you can earn  </p>
<ul>
<li>Cash back  </li>
<li>Points  </li>
<li>Miles  </li>
</ul>
<p>(points and miles are virtually the same and vary depending on what that specific reward program wants to call them. A lot of Airlines will use miles because you're &quot;flying a certain number of miles when you travel&quot; and others use points because they tend to be more generic - hotels, specific bank branded credit cards etc.)<br />
Let's break down each type of program:<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Cash Back</strong>  </p>
<p>Cash back is pretty simple - you earn a fixed cash percentage back on your credit card purchases based on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_category_code" target="_blank">mcc code</a> multiplier or a specific merchant (like Target or Banana Republic). For example, the <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/blue-cash-preferred/" target="_blank">Amex Blue Cash Preferred</a> earns 6% cash back on groceries, 3% cash back on U.S. gas stations and department stores, and 1% cash back on everything else. You can read the Blue Cash Preferred <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/personal-card-application/terms/blue-cash-preferred-credit-card/36501-10-0/?pznOfferCode=PIWG-3PBEQC-25WM-9O4&amp;print#offerBenefitTermsDisclosures" target="_blank">Terms and Conditions</a> and <a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/content/rewards-info.html" target="_blank">Reward Terms</a> to see which MCC codes are included/excluded and also learn about every other limitation/quirk this card has.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The complicated part</em><br />
The biggest complication with cash back cards are the limits/caps the issuers put on how much you can earn each year. With the Amex BCP, you only earn 6% on groceries on the first $6000 in grocery spend each year, then 1%. Some cards offer <a href="https://www.discover.com/credit-cards/cashback-bonus/cashback-calendar.html" target="_blank">rotating categories</a>, like the Chase Freedom and Discover It cards.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Points &amp; Miles</strong>  </p>
<p>I'm bucketing points and miles together because although they have different names, they are effectively the same thing - a virtual rewards currency. Any non cash back reward program will be either points or miles. These include airline, hotel, car rental, supermarket, gas station co branded cards and more, as well as bank specific non cash back cards like the Chase Sapphire Cards where you earn Ultimate Rewards and Citi ThankYou cards where you earn ThankYou Points.  </p>
<p>Instead of earning a cash back % for each $ spent, you instead earn a points/miles multiplier on specific categories and merchants  - The <a href="https://creditcards.chase.com/credit-cards/chase-sapphire-preferred" target="_blank">Chase Sapphire Card</a> (CSP for short) earns 2x points on travel and dining and 1x for everything else. Of course, there are exclusions in the terms and conditions.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The complicated part</em><br />
Redeeming points &amp; miles is extremely variable, and the $ value for what the rewards are worth changes depending on a whole lotta factors. For example, if I redeem Ultimate Rewards from my CSP card for Travel I &quot;get 25% more value when you redeem for airfare, hotels, car rentals and cruises through Chase Ultimate Rewards. For example, 50,000 points are worth $625 toward travel.&quot; &lt;- Directly from Chase's site. That means if I redeem my points for non travel, they're worth less. The Points Guy does <a href="https://thepointsguy.com/category/points-valuations/" target="_blank">monthly reward valuations</a>, but IMO they're a bit too simplistic and I'm not sure he uses a big enough data set to make super accurate calculations.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But, in this case above, if I can redeem 50,000 points for $625, that means each point is worth $.0125 each. Meaning that if I earn 2x on travel and dining and redeem for travel, I effectively am getting <strong>2.5% back</strong> per $ spent.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To take it one step further, I'll use United's MileagePlus program. (In light of current events I still enjoy flying United, personally have their CC, and fly 3-4 flights for free each year). The miles on United's program vary depending on the airports you fly to/from, the time of day you fly, how far in advance you book, seat class, etc. This holds true on many other airlines as well. And even though United is a <a href="https://www.united.com/web/en-US/apps/mileageplus/awards/travel/awardTravel.aspx" target="_blank">tier structure</a> - if you select North America as your departure and arrival location it will show you the 10k, 12.5k, 25k chart - the flight values vary, so the more expensive flight I can get for 12.5k miles on way, the more my rewards are worth. Most recently I flew Orlando -&gt; San Francisco and redeemed my miles for around 2.9cents each, so on each purchases where I earned 1x mile I got 2.9% back effectively, and any purchases with multipliers I got 5.8% back, effectively.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get even more complex, I can <a href="https://www.valuepenguin.com/chase-ultimate-rewards-transfer-partners" target="_blank">transfer my Chase Ultimate Reward Points</a> as a 1:1 ratio to United. So purchases made on my CSP card at travel and dining and redeemed for the reward example above would net me 5.8% back.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take this system of changing reward rates above and apply it to hotels and other redemption types and it gets tricky. This is why a lot of people choose cash back cards with a flat 2% cash back, like the <a href="https://www.citi.com/credit-cards/credit-card-details/citi.action?ID=citi-double-cash-credit-card" target="_blank">Citi Double Cash</a>, but many of us enjoy racking up points and miles and getting higher value when redeeming for travel (usually the highest).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is not a complete list, and there are so many more things to consider like annual fees, foreign transaction fees if you travel abroad, cards that offer airport lounge access, anniversary bonuses, spending bonuses, other caps and exclusions, sign up bonuses and more. And if you travel, you earn rewards just by flying the airlines and staying in hotels, so you can rack up points beyond just what the credit cards offer.<br />
&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>So who pays for rewards?</strong>  </p>
<ul>
<li>Interchange Fees: The credit card issuer takes a cut of your purchase when you pay at a retailer. The rate on this varies but is usually higher then the redeemed value % on that purchase (plus a lot of rewards just sit around and are never redeemed)  </li>
<li>Credit card debt: The interest that revolving card holders pay will fund reward programs much of the time. That's about half the US population.  </li>
<li>Annual fees: The annual fee you pay on the cards will sometimes offset the reward value earned  </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tl;dr: You earn rewards a variety of different ways and redeem for different reward types where values change. Cash back is just a % back on your spending. All have exclusions and limitations to look out for. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've gotten several excellent answers to &quot;how&quot; rewards work, but there are also interesting reasons &quot;why&quot; they've grown in popularity.</p>
<p>About 10-15 years ago, when airline &quot;miles&quot; were still the dominant credit card reward, the IRS decided that these rewards from credit cards would not be treated as income and, thus, would not be taxable.  This is different from traditional interest on a savings account, for example, which is still taxed as income.</p>
<p>The rationale is that credit card rewards are earned only when you purchase something, and so they operate like rebates or even simple price reductions.  In other words, if you used a coupon at the grocery store for 2% off your entire purchase, you wouldn't have to pay income tax on the 2% that you saved; and if you went to the grocery store, and a week later they sent you a rebate check for 2% of your purchase, same thing; and if you went to the grocery store, and paid with your credit card, and later you got 2% back on your credit card statement ... well, same thing, says the IRS.</p>
<p>Now, add this to the fact that interest rates on savings have been at rock bottom for nearly 10 years now.  Banks couldn't attract new customers with higher savings rates because, frankly, the economy just wouldn't support paying out interest.  So instead, the IRS revenue ruling has created something of an arms race as banks use bigger/better credit card reward programs to attract customers.</p>
<p>Finally, it's not just the banks.  Many popular cards are co-branded with specific companies (the Southwest cards offered by Chase are a popular example), and those companies not only get a cut, but they use enhanced points and perks to drive up their own business.  Southwest recently reported in an earnings call that their credit card revenue is the fastest growing source of revenue in their company!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to point out that whomever invented the credit card rewards system was an absolute genius. That made credit more valuable than cash/check to huge numbers of consumers. It seemed like free money to the consumers, and it kind of was since those rewards were being indirectly subsidized by cash users and people who carry credit balances. As a result, <a href="http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/payment-method-statistics-1276.php" target="_blank">credit card usage has really grown quickly</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Credit card companies make money in 2 main ways;</p>
<p>1) If you do not pay of the balance at the end of every payment period (usually a month, but there might be cards with other terms), they can charge interest. Usually this is a rather high rate.</p>
<p>2) Companies that want to accept payments from credit cards must pay the credit card companies for this. For this reason credit card companies give you gifts for using their cards. If you want those rewards, you'll use your credit card more often, which means companies must pay your credit card company more.</p>
<p>A little more color on #2.
Retailers that take credit cards from your mom and pop shop all the way to Walmart pay about 2.9% per transaction. This is what is used to subsidize your rewards program. The retailers pass this fee onto you via higher cost of goods.
On average, rewards program values are around 1% of your transaction.</p>
<p>Lots of retailers are starting to push back on this since they are the ones subsidizing the rewards program of these credit cards. In addition, for low margin businesses like grocery, their typical profit margin is between 3-5%. If they didn't have to pay the cc transaction fees, they could double their profit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>How Reward Systems Work.</strong> Reward cards offer a variety of rewards in different ways. Some give cash back on all purchases, some give bonuses if you meet a spending threshold (such as 50,000 airline miles for $3,000 spent in the first 3 months), and some give other perks.</p>
<p><strong>Why Some People Get More/Better Rewards.</strong> Some people get more points or rewards because they qualify for rewards that other people don't. Just like qualifying for a loan, card companies offer different cards (with different rewards) to people based on their credit worthiness. A reliable consumer qualifies for better reward cards with better perks just like a reliable borrower qualifies for better loan terms. </p>
<p>Also, the amount of rewards you get is based on the amount you spend on the card. So if you have a card that offers 1 mile per dollar spent, but you only spend $500, you only get 500 miles. If I spend $15,0000, I get 15,000 miles.</p>
<p>(Source. I've used credit card rewards to pay for about 80-90% of my vacation expenses for years, and regularly cycle through cards to farm rewards. The only reason card companies offer these cards is because: <strong>1.</strong> People qualify for the card but don't end up meeting the minimum spend, <strong>2.</strong> People let the points expire, and most importantly <strong>3.</strong> People incur enough fees that the amount they pay in interest or fees exceeds the value of the offered rewards. (And because card companies make a little money on each transaction.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
