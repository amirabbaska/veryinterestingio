		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Fat is stored in cells in many forms, for instance <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride" target="_blank">triglyceride</a> which is basically 3 fatty acids connected together with a glycerol molecule. When your body needs energy your fat cells use Lipase to break apart the fatty acids and release them into your blood. fatty acids move into other cells from the blood just like sugar does where hey are consumed by mitochondria to produce ATP through beta oxidation. That's where they are combined with Oxygen and release Carbon Dioxide + energy for your cells.<br><br><strong>In other words</strong> your body tears the fat molecules down to their individual carbon atoms, attaches them to oxygen and you exhale them.<br><br><strong>TL/DR</strong> You exhale it. When you exercise and you breath heavy you are literally exhaling your fat ass.<br><br><strong>[Edit]</strong> Thanks for gold! Please don't try heavy breathing as a weight loss technique. That's like repeatedly flushing your toilet to cure constipation, except it can result in raising your blood pH.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Simple answer, you exhale them.  CO2 leaves the body at the end of the Electron Transport Chain that your body uses to get energy from food.  Oxygen is inhaled, a carbon attached and then it is exhaled.  Interesting tidbit, trees grow in exactly the opposite fashion, by taking carbon from the air and &quot;fixing&quot; it to make larger molecules.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>So many people talking about CO2 this and CO2 that, but CO2 isn't even <em>half</em> the story. Fats are not only metabolized to CO2 but to water as well. In fact, the humble kangaroo rat doesn't need to drink water at all; The metabolism of fats in seeds produce enough water to keep them alive. <br><br>On a side note, the oxygen you breathe in goes completely to water! The oxygen in the CO2 comes from water, not molecular oxygen.  It's kind of cool how much we rely on water, isn't it?<br><br>Source: <em>Lehninger Principles of Biochemistry - ed.6</em> Nelson, David; Cox, Michael<br>              2012, W.H.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>very simplified answer....<br><br>1. Fat gets converted to Sugar<br>2. Sugar combines with Oxygen to create energy with the by product being CO2<br>3. CO2 gets carried by your blood to your lungs<br>4. CO2 get exhaled.<br>5. Your fat leaves your body via your breath.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>You always have the same number of fat cells, the difference in fat and skinny people is how much material is actually being stored in the fat cells. They are all pretty empty? You are skinny. They all holding a bunch of stuff? Chubby. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
