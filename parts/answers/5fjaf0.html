		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body doesn't the baby does. When the baby starts to get cramped for space it gets stressed and releases the stress hormone cortisol. The cortisol from the baby then starts a cascade of events in the mother that leads to birth.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Initiation of labor is signaled jointly by the mother and the fetus. Maternal events include: bleeding and infection. Fetal events include compression. </p>
<p>Absent bleeding and infection, labor is typically initiated by a cascade of chemical signals that start with fetus releasing cortisol when it senses that it's outgrowing the uterus; cortisol crosses the placenta and leads to maternal secretion of oxytocin, which leads to labor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
