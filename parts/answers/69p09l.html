		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just one of those quirks of the English language. &quot;Won't&quot;, for &quot;will not&quot;, adds an 'o' before the 'n', which makes even less sense. Languages change over time, and clunky pronunciations like &quot;doon't&quot; or &quot;willn't&quot; get smoothed down to easy pronunciations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a technical term for it,  which I believe is known as euphony.  This basically means that words have pleasing sounds and as such,  hearing something pleasing is generally better to hear or easier to speak. In a sense,  it's about laziness,  which is how contractions became a thing in the first place.  </p>
<p>One of the basic goals of language is to quickly convey information with as little effort as possible. So changing words to be easier to speak and hear is the next step on evolving language. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds develop differently depending on their surroundings.  For instance, the s at the end of students is pronounced differently than the s at the end of lasers because they are colored by the sounds adjacent to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have no clue what the history is here, but one of my favorite subreddits, r/linguistics, deals with all kinds of quirks in languages. They usually can give pretty decent explanations in layman's terms. I've been following that sub for at least a couple of years now so I can learn about the answers to random questions like your own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question is back-to-front - a better way to think about it is: Why do we spell both 'do' and 'don't' with a single 'o' when they are pronounced so differently?</p>
<p>The answer is simply that English does not have phonetic spelling. That is, there is not a perfect relationship between spelling and pronunciation. See the other answers for some examples.</p>
<p>Some languages do, however, have phonetic spelling. For example Romanian. You can learn the pronunciation rules for Romanian and pronounce (almost) every word perfectly without having to hear it spoken first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
