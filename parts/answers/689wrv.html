		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I tend to disagree with the premise of this ELI5 on the whole. Specifically, I believe there may be a stigma about the goal of 'getting drunk' in certain groups, but there are certainly those who 'party hard' for the sake of being drunk as a group. Age has nothing to do with it. I've been out with 40 somethings that party harder than I can handle. And frankly - That's ok. As long as they aren't a public nuisance or a danger to themselves/others... have fun!</p>
<p>Cultures also vary. Someone mentioned pulling out a joint at a party of kids - it has a stigma associated with it in some circles for the same reason that (at least today) smoking cigarettes around kids has a stigma. But there are also groups who don't care about that either...</p>
<p>I also think that lumping all recreational drugs into a singular 'getting high' and separating out alcohol as a different state (i.e., 'drunk') does a disservice to the positive aspects of certain drugs. Caffeine, for example, is a drug that is almost universally socially accepted. The 'wakefulness' is its high, and the impacts on productivity are dramatically positive, and there are (as with all things) some negative aspects that have to be considered on an individual basis. But we don't see headlines about the epidemic of coffee addicts in this country, because on the whole we perceive it as a positive thing. </p>
<p>I think another perspective I disagree with are the comments on the 'historical societal value' of alcohol vs. other drugs. While there is going to be some fundamental truth to the fact that the flavor and experience of drinking an alcoholic beverage is inextricably linked to culinary culture, I think comments like that seem to dismiss the appreciation that cultures have had in history for those 'other recreational drugs'. There are numerous accounts of creative people who have found themselves better able to find that sense of 'flow' when they've smoked pot. Some liken it to the ancient greeks 'muses', and there are many ancient historical references to the use of cannabis in Greece (<del>Bacchus</del> (thanks /u/Hixhen) Dionysus knew how to party - yo.)</p>
<p>It might also help to separate out unproductive 'stoners' from 'marijuana enthusiasts' because that distinction is lost on most people, who seem to lump the two together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Getting drunk is the goal, just as getting high is. The only difference is that there's a level above drunk when you take it too far, which is getting wasted, which is not the goal (usually). With alcohol, people are searching for that perfect level where you lower your inhibitions, it's easier to socialize, everything seems very fun and you're still in control of yourself for the most part. When you take it too far, it becomes decidedly un-fun and downright dangerous, which isn't something that happens with weed. When you smoke too much weed you just kind of &quot;green out&quot; or &quot;get couched&quot; but it's really not dangerous to your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like drinking culture encourages getting drunk, just like stoners get high. Then you have the regular drinkers and medical or occasional tokers who consume responsibly and would place that stigma on those who over-indulge. I'll assume that is what you actually meant.</p>
<p>With getting drunk, the likelihood of a negative event is much greater (bodily harm, embarrassing or immoral acts, drunk tank, etc). That is why we placed more stigma around that than the dude who got too high and fell asleep on the couch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I belong to neither culture, but I have been drunk and I have been high. </p>
<p>Every time I get drunk, the situation varies. Most times, say like 80%  I get super happy, super outgoing, and become just a generally jolly guy. Say about 17% of the time, I get super emotional, crying, laughing, crying more, yadda yadda. Then say about 3% of the time I get angry and mean. This is rare, and generally it's based on some stimuli, like the time my ex picked a fight with me that led to her being my ex. </p>
<p>Now, every time I've gotten high, the same thing has happened: I get super mellow, have a brief moment of panic, then I get mellow again, and I enter a chill mode. I've never gotten angry, I've never gotten sad, it's always basically been chill. </p>
<p>I've hung out with people you could say are part of drinking culture.  For some of them, the end goal is to get drunk. For most though, it's just to get buzzed. I've also known people who just like to drink a beer or some type of liquor for the taste. </p>
<p>I don't know if this is what you were looking for but I hope it helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
