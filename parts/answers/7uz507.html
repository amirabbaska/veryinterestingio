		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Calories should stay exactly the same. Mineral content will also be exactly the same. Some vitamins can be changed by various environmental factors including temperature. Vitamin C, for example, is degraded by exposure to oxygen. Freezing can actually help protect against oxidizing since liquid water more efficiently transports oxygen than frozen water. I honestly don't know chemistry details on most of the other vitamins, so hopefully someone else can weigh in there.</p>
<p>Freezing will primarily change the texture of food. This happens mostly because cell walls and other microstructures in the food get destroyed by the expansion and crystallization of water when it freezes. This is why thawed frozen fruits are almost always more mushy than fresh fruits. This destruction will make the food degrade <em>very</em> fast after the food is thawed. This is why most frozen foods are meant to be eaten directly after defrost and often instruct you to avoid refreezing them.</p>
<p>With frozen meals, the makers know that freezing will change textures to be less palatable. This is often alleviated by making meals that are heavily dependent on sauces which usually means adding considerable salt and simple sugars. Carb-heavy foods like potatoes are also more likely to reheat deliciously than most meats, fruits, and some veggies. This can make frozen meals tough to fit with some diet goals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Frozen fruits and vegetables often contain more nutrients because it is possible to let them reach full ripeness before harvest. Fully ripened they would never be able to survive transport without rotting completely, and a disturbingly large amount of our food is shipped in from other countries. Ever had a tomato in January? It most likely came from Mexico or somewhere south of the equator.  These are then chemically ripened after shipping with ethelyne gas or chemicals like calcium carbide. Nom nom. If you are truly interested in getting the best nutrition/flavor from your food buy your produce from local farms and eat what is in season for your area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None at all. Freezing does not reduce nutritional value, though it can alter textures of foods to make it less appealing. In fact most fruits and vegetables are frozen quickly after harvesting which makes them more nutritious that food that has been allowed to get old and is close to spoiling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was an Analytical Nutrition Technician for several years. (For details see: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/57ljeg/eli5_how_do_food_and_drink_companies_work_out_how/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/57ljeg/eli5_how_do_food_and_drink_companies_work_out_how/</a>)</p>
<p>I never, at any point, observed a trend of lower nutrition in frozen food products. Nor am I aware of any documentation about this for Macro Nutrients (Sugars, Fats, Salt, Fibre, Protein).</p>
<p>I did not test for Vitamins, and it may be that there are some vitamins that will be damaged by freezing. However, as vitamins also degrade over time and may be less damaged by freezing and then not degrading that waiting around to be shipped to you.</p>
<p>Sugars in plants also convert to starch after harvest, so frozen food may have a high sugar content.</p>
<p>Processed foods, frozen ready meals ect. will have a much different nutrition profile than a fresh meal, but that's not due to the freezing process, but rather, the stuff they make the meal with being different. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
