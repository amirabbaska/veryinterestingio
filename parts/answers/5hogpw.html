		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The dutch lost control of the new york colony in the Anglo-Dutch war around 1664. However the dutch influence in the area was still around, most people in the area spoke the dutch language for 200 yrs. In 1764 preachers began to use english in church. During the mid 1800s the dutch language was present in brooklyn, which caused the origination of the brooklyn accent. Forms of Dutch were still being spoken in the 1900s, but somewhere between the 1920s and 1950s &quot;Jersey Dutch&quot; died out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assimilation.</p>
<p>It happens with any small community in the middle of a larger one.  At first, it's distinct, and it has distinct customs and maybe even a distinct language.  Over time, that community gets less distinct.  People marry out, and the kids are raised outside the community.  People move around the country.  People speak the language of their neighbors instead of their own.  Eventually, it disappears; all of its members have joined the larger culture or died.</p>
<p>Sometimes, there are exceptions.  For example, the Jews have always been small communities in the middle of larger ones for most of the last 2600 years or so, and yet we have managed to not only survive but preserve our traditions, to some extent.  On the other hand, while many American Jews used to speak Yiddish (before the waves of Eastern European Jewish immigration to New York, there were many Sephardim in the US, who wouldn't have known Yiddish; indeed, the poet Emma Lazarus, who wrote the poem on the Statue of Liberty, was Sephardic), very few do now, and they're the most orthodox of the Orthodox.  Most American Jews today are virtually indistinguishable from other Americans, the only difference being the religion, but it wasn't always like this.</p>
<p>Well, the Dutch community didn't have anything specifically keeping it together in the face of massive pressure to assimilate, so they assimilated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would guess the advent of radio pretty much sealed the fate of Dutch as a spoken language; people listened to radio back then for news, entertainment, etc. much as people now watch TV, or browse the internet.  And it was pretty much all in English in the US.  Children growing up in Dutch speaking households were probably at that point exposed to more English than Dutch in their homes after the spread of radio.</p>
<p>Radio has been attributed to why French died out as a spoken language in certain areas of the US, like Vermont, where there were pockets of French speakers.</p>
<p>This is also why the Quebecois in Canada are so &quot;aggressive&quot; about protecting the French language.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that there's more to NY than the city.  If you head north of the Catskills you see plenty of Dutch influence.  Even then name of the mountains (Kaatskills) is Dutch.  I'm in the Albany area and we have towns and cities like Guilderland, Rensselaer Schenectady that have heavy Dutch influence in their names.  A lot of the creeks up here are called kills.  Also Albany (formerly Beverwijk) has an annual tulip festival.  Just because the the English seized the New Amsterdam colony from the Dutch, didn't mean that everything got anglicized.  So the Dutch influence is pretty apparent up here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a fascinating book about the Dutch history of NY called &quot;The Island at the Center of the World.&quot; Dutch influence is everywhere, but with the English as victors, it was hidden or actively squashed, and the history overwritten. </p>
