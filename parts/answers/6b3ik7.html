		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mainly because  humans don't eat like most other animals.<br />
The stuff animals eat usually has water in it.<br />
It could be blood from flesh or juices contained in leafs or fruit.<br />
Humans eat alot of dried, preserved, salted and/or cooked food, that doesn't have that much water in it.  </p>
<p>Secondary to this is the fact humans sweat more than other animals. We're adapted for running down prey by having an more effective means of eliminating heat through sweat, it also means we lose more water that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

So I'm guessing humans are just pretty bad at it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
