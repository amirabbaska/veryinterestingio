		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Terrorism is the pursuit of political aims by way of violence.  Typically, terrorist groups aren't large enough, or trained well enough, or armed well enough (or any combination of all three) to take on domestic armies, meaning that a military coup or invasion is impossible.</p>
<p>Terrorist groups try to spread their ideas through violence against the easiest potential targets, which has two factors working for it.  Firstly, the chance to succeed is much higher - if you want to drive an HGV through a military base, you're likely to be stopped fairly quickly.  If you drive the same HGV through a civilian crowd, you can do significantly more damage before being stopped.</p>
<p>Secondly, the military expect to be targets.  Civilians do not.  When civilians are subject to attacks, the population (in theory) becomes afraid.  Imagine if a country was subject to one terrorist attack per week, which killed ten people.  The entire population would learn to be afraid of the next attack, because who knows who's going to die next.</p>
<p>This leads to cries for politicians to take action to help.  By attacking &quot;soft&quot; targets (targets which are relatively unprotected, like public transport/spaces), the terrorists are ensuring that there's as little chance of stopping them as possible.  It becomes difficult, therefore, for the politicians to change <em>domestic</em> policy in a way that prevents further attacks.</p>
<p>In the eyes of the terrorists, the rational response here would be for the government to change their <em>foreign</em> policy to make the attacks stop.  The easiest way to do that?  Stop doing whatever you're doing that's upsetting the terrorist groups.</p>
<p>That's effectively what the aim is.  It becomes more problematic when you're looking at things like IS, whose goals are more nebulous.</p>

<p>As the name &quot;terrorist&quot; implies, they just want to terrorize the population. It's not so much a military strategy as an extremely violent form of protest.</p>
<p>I think it's publicity .. they want their face in the the news and what they did and the reason why they did it ... sadly enough, the media often gives them exactly what they want</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But what do they want? I can understand the logic behind &quot;Give us $10 million or we will bomb a subway,&quot; but they seem to be perpetrating violence without a message.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Terrorists attack civilian targets, hurting people who have no power anyway</p>
</blockquote>
<p>watching current events you should be seeing that in actuality people hold a lot of power. </p>
<p>ask yourself if you think brexit would have happened or trump would be president if it were not for the threat of terrorists. </p>
<p>you could very well argue that in what has been a prolonged 'war on terror' when you compare what each side has achieved, the terrorists aren't doing a bad job.<br />
We are currently seeing a global move towards nationalist ideas which break down the strength of coalitions with inward thinking. This isn't just happening by chance, the people are demanding it because they see terrorism on the news and they see Islamic refugee coming to their countries, and it scares them. </p>
<p>it's not a well-educated disposition, but the people hold all the power in their vote, and there are enough people that buy into the terror as seen by brexit, la pen, trump, Party for Freedom etc etc. . </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Terrorism was originally a term referring to &quot;the Reign of Terror&quot;, where the french revolutionaries used fear to reshape the french mindset regarding governance.</p>
<p>In practical terms terrorists are people too powerless to pursue actual war. So they incite fear (terror) in the population (civilians) to get that body to force it's own government to shift policies to make the bad men go away.</p>
<p>What is hoped for is &quot;appeasement&quot;.</p>
<p>For example after the terrorist act of killing cartoonists for drawing pictures of some particular guy, lots of governments and corporations outlawed drawing pictures of that guy by fiat because the people were all afraid of getting in trouble for laughing at that guy.</p>
<p>Terrorism relies on irrational biases. When we hear about one incidence of something dangerous happening we tend to fear it disproportionately.</p>
<p>For instance, when Jaws was released people were afraid to go to the beach because of sharks, but they weren't afraid to jump in their steel death carriages that kill tens of thousands of people a year to go to the mountains or the mall instead of the beach.</p>
<p>The United States was particularly well suited as a target for terrorism because we are surrounded by oceans and just the two very nice neighbors. So for many decades most other countries had atrocities every year. But when our weak leaders (Bush et al) decided to ring the bell of appeasement as an excuse to push a jingoist agenda the fear took root and flowered effusively.</p>
<p>Note that the fear fire wasn't fanned after Oklahoma because the white christian men weren't sufficiently &quot;the other&quot; to be useful, and the leadership was stronger, or at least less unified in an authoritarian goal.</p>
<p>So the point of terrorism is to make all the sheep run in one direction (away) and so force-or-allow the shepherds to get the sheep all into a line.</p>
<p>Even now, drawing a picture of that one guy is verboten, and that lasting victory has caused a lot of me-too, I want to make a difference, radicalization to take place world-wide.</p>
<p>If I can make you not draw that picture, then maybe I can make you wrap your women in sheets, or make you put ten-commandment monuments in your schools, or stop buying GMO ice cream.</p>
<p>Whatever my petty agenda, if I can make you see me as a boogy-man I can get <em>you</em> to demand that your lawmakers take me and my bullshit seriously.</p>
<p>Back when the IRA was bombing London, nobody said that Catholics were dangerous and should be deported. Everybody knew that terrorism was just a few cunts that need to be opposed. If enough people were like-minded they'd have raised a real army not a clutch of dick-bags with truck bombs.</p>
<p>So terrorism is the use of popular fear as a force magnifier to get otherwise stupid and unpopular goals into the public mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Civilians are weak and cannot fight back. Attacking military or police forces or other non-civilian group/organization won't likely gain the same attention as attacking those who are most likely not trained to go into danger. Killing non-civilian people and only that side is affected, it's unexpected and scared and terrible, but people as a whole would go on with their lives as usual. Politicians are civilians too, but since we're talking about normal people, they gain ten times as much security as military and police personnel. Of course, the use of illegal or immoral violence in order to galvanize the politicians' attention to their cause is an act of terrorism, but mostly likely, attacking civilians means that going after them affects the entire society and the government would do anything, even beyond legitimate measures to protect them. Civilians who have 20 times more population than any group and who have no role in politics and going about their daily lives are gonna be affected by those who have a grudge against our government's role in certain activities domestic or abroad.</p>
<p>The World Trade Center bombing in 1993, the Oklahoma City bombing, and the airliner filled with mostly civilians strike on the WTC on 9/11 caused the U.S. government to take permanent measure to prevent the incidents from happening, with bad consequences. The TSA exists out of 9/11 and is already the worst federal agency in regards to moral of its employees and civil rights in the name of fighting terrorism. More TSA agents have been arrested and convicted that terrorists. Then you have the unlimited spying power, which is decried by civil rights advocates and people having paranoid fear would likely reduce civil rights reform in a desperate hope to catch terrorists. Neither that is really possible. You have government agencies giving unlimited military equipment to local and state law enforcement agencies without a proper oversight to their abuse. Then you have Donald Trump who is elected to &quot;make America great&quot; by outright banning Muslims from six specific countries and use anti-privacy measures in the night of fighting terrorism, which puts us in anger. That gave people the idea that the effects of terrorism really worked and its ramifications can never be or hard to be put down.</p>
<p>Hope this really helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
