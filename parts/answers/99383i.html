		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Does everyone normally have fresh breath all day? I feel like my breath starts to taste bad after just an hour or two.. I brush correctly and even use a tongue scraper.  I've been self conscious about my breath and brushing my teeth for years, and I've never felt like I could keep my breath fresh without mints or gum. I just thought that it was normal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When asleep you stop producing as much saliva and that leads to propagation of bacteria, while awake there is a lot that happens automatically in your mouth to clean them a bit (the saliva, the tongue over teeth, the sucking saliva through your teeth and swallowing it).
It's most important that you brush your teeth before consuming food or beverage, afterwards is not as important.</p>
<p>It's the point where you have the most bacteria alive while adding a lot of sustenance for them and through 'food in mouth dynamics' end up in all kind of places that'll be harder to reach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
