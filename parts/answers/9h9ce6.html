		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Steel is about 92 - 98% Iron.</p>
<p>Iron will selectively rip sulfur off of other molecules to create iron sulfide and iron sulfate. This is an exothermic reaction and requires initial energy.</p>
<p>These &quot;Metal soaps&quot; however are made of stainless steel, and are famously inert. They do not react with sulfur. There is no published proof that they work.</p>
<p>Baking soda, Sodium Bicarbonate, NaHCO3 is much better at this. Most Lipids will break down into acids during decay, the NaHCO3 will absorb them and create various gasses and salt + water.</p>
<p>However, only activated charcoal can actively trap smells, everything else will try to mask it or convert it.</p>
<p>90% of Metal Soaps work is done by water, the other 10% is you rubbing your hands together under the water.</p>
<p>EDIT: Forgot this part, you nose will adapt to most foul odors in about 30 seconds. Or just about the amount of time it takes to rub your hands on something metal after first smelling the odd smell. Go ahead and get onion juice all over your hands, use a dry metal soap, then smell it in an hour after not washing it in any way. Will still smell of onions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/SIMoss88 has answered. I'll just weigh in to say that this is a property of stainless steel...it doesn't need to be soap-shaped like some home goods stores try to cash in on.</p>
<p>Just get a slab/chunk of SS for 1/20th of the cost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
