		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Couple of different answers to this. This is a bit long, but it should help. It mostly has to do with avoiding predators and not being eaten. Consider the Rabbit - their movements are either big and strong, fast hops and leaps. Or when are still, only their faces, where their sense organs are, tend to move around quickly, to scan the area and make sure that nothing of danger is around them. </p>
<p>As to why some motions are larger and stronger than others, you have to go into a bit of muscle biology, a bit advanced for a 5 year old...</p>
<p>Animal muscle fibers are catagorized in two types - Red and White Muscle Fibers. These types are based off of the amount of Glycogen (White) and Myoglobin (Red) that is found in the individual muscle cells. These fibers coexist in all musculature, in humans and animals.</p>
<p>Red Fibers, those higher in Myo, can carry more O2 to the cells, and are built for long, steady action. Thighs, Legs, Glutes - weight supporting muscles White fibers are higher in Glycogen, a sugar molecule, which gives quick bursts of energy when used, but doesn't have the same overall energy carrying potential that HgB heavy cells would. Muscles more responsible for quick movements than supporting weight</p>
<p>This is why Chickens have White and Dark meat. The dark is the Thigh, carrying the whole weight of the bird. Take a biopsy of it and you would expect to see a higher concentration of Red fibers. the white is the Wing; doesn't really do too much except the occasional flap, it will have a lower % of Red fibers, and more White fibers. But no tissue is 100% of either. </p>
<p>So, now that we have addressed these 2 fibers, we can actually answer the question.</p>
<p>&quot;Small Animals&quot; say, a Rabbit  is going to have greater concentrations of those White Fibers in some muscles, and Red's in others.  The hind legs of a rabbit are going to have  more Red fiber, while its facial and frontal muscles would be more of the White type - fast reacting, short spastic movements</p>
<p>So, these animals move by launching with these strong Red Fibers, giving off massive shots of energy to move as far as possible in one motion.</p>
<p>Other movements, like twitching, sniffing, anything else cute that little bunny rabbits do - those are all based off of the White Fibers. They move in quick little twitchy - in fact, their other name is <strong>Fast Twitch</strong> fibers (the Red fibers are <strong>Slow Twitch</strong>). They can move around without expending too much energy. But if a rabbit has to escape a wolf or a hawk? it just has to get from point A to point B as fast as possible, in one single motion, to avoid being eaten. But do it for 20+ minutes and it'd be exhausted. Different types of movement </p>
<p>Have you ever shivered in the cold? Your body is putting itself into a Fast-twitch Overdrive to burn as much energy as possible and keep its temperature elevated. Little furry animals do the same. Quick movements to heat up the body, based off the rapid firing of White Fibers. Now, throw in things like Sight and Smell to avoid predators, instinctively being afraid of larger animals, you can see put together the puzzle of why these animals would move around the way they do. </p>
<p>SO! And finally, here's the answer to the question. Small animals are twitchy, because;</p>
<p>It takes more energy for them to move (a rabbit hopping vs a large dog casually walking), so they tend to save </p>
<p>The  way rodents and other small mammals twitch their noses around, or seem to focus from point to point with ninja-like concentration but ADHD-like speed, is because those movements are controlled by muscles that are predominantly White fibers. Or in some cases, to conserve or produce heat, the way we shiver, or how we blink to produce tears. While the larger motions, such as moving legs, would be done by muscles with a higher concentration of Red fibers. </p>
<p>They just don't have the dexterity for fine movements, so to us, they seem twitchy and spastic, like a dog scratching itself</p>
<p>I understand that this is ELI'ing a little more than 5 years old, tried to put it as simple as possible, if you have any more questions feel free to ask</p>
<p>Here are a couple of sources that will give you some more info on Red v White Fibers</p>

<p>Edit: Obligatory &quot;Thanks for the gold&quot;</p>
<p>other users have been mentioning Mass / Force, and they are correct; the muscles of some small animals don't have to be as strong and delicate as those of larger animals -&gt; consider a cow's legs vs those of a gerbil. One is going to be a lot more Red than the other, simply because it needs 1000's of times more energy (O2) than the smaller animal's related muscles would.</p>
<p>And, a very common question; Humans have both of these fibers in all of our muscles as well. Your glutes would have a different composition of red and white than your pecs would, as would your triceps from your palmar muscles. Lebron's calves would have a different makeup of the two fibers than Messi's, or Bolt's. The exact makeups are not exact and are subject to change in every individual</p>
<p>as for the user who asked why I Capitalize every Other word? Because I can't gesticulate over the internet and that's how I add emphasis in my text. Eat it :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party, but the muscle fiber answer is not all that relevant. I don't study this specifically, but have done some work on animal locomotion and sensing. </p>
<p>So... if small things don't move in quick, twitchy movements because for some random reason small things have white muscle fibers (this isn't true in all cases, and even if it were it wouldn't be the <em>reason</em> they have that)... <em>why</em> do small things move fast and then stop?</p>
<p>There are a lot of parts that go into it, but I think they mostly boil down to three basic reasons:<br />
1) It's easier for them to move fast<br />
2) Moving fast is still hard<br />
3) They need to know what's going on around them</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Small things have much less mass relative to the amount of force they can generate, and can do things much faster because of it. This is the same reason that ants can lift big things. Muscles generate force based on the cross-section of the muscle (area, r^2 ), while inertia changes with the volume (r^3 ). That means bigger is, all else being equal, slower. If you are interested in how scaling affects living things, I highly recommend Haldane's essay <a href="http://www.physlink.com/education/essay_haldane.cfm" target="_blank">&quot;On Being the Right Size&quot;</a>. It's a great read, and still basically accurate even though it was written in 1928. We've known about some of this stuff for a <em>long</em> time. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It costs more energy to run at a high step frequency (how many steps you take per second) than to run at a low step frequency, even after you take size into account! This sucks for small things that have to take many steps to cover distance quickly. Mouse muscle, for example, uses 6 times as much energy per gram as horse muscle when they are both running. <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/138/1/301.short" target="_blank">Here is a paper about it!</a> So you can take steps fast, but they cost energy. </p>
</li>
<li>Okay, but how do you control your movement while you do this? Small things see at about the same speed as fast things: it takes ~1/10th of a second to perceive a change, or about 100 milliseconds, almost no matter your size (a few animals are a little faster, like 70-80ms if I'm remembering right, but same ballpark). This means, among other things, that when you're jouncing around taking many steps every second, it is much harder to compensate for the movement of your eye. A mouse takes nearly 10 strides per second at full speed (same paper I linked earlier); that means that each stride takes barely over 100 milliseconds! It is very difficult to figure out what you need to do on the next stride before you take it at this scale, especially with your eyeballs bouncing around very fast. You are mostly relying on faster senses for this, but vision gives you much better long-distance information. So, if you want to move effectively, you want to know where you're going. What's the best way to do this with the slow visual system? Stop running around and take a look! (Weirdly, because hearing is faster but sound takes time to travel, it looks like bat echolocation works on about the same time scale.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<p>Basically, if you are small, there are several things you want. One, you want to get where you're going, and you can move very quickly for your size! Two, you want to not use up all your energy at once, and that's hard when you take a lot of steps fast! Three, you want to stop and figure out what's going on around you occasionally! </p>
<p>So what's the solution? You can take a lot of steps very quickly, then stop and breathe and look, then take a lot of steps very quickly. This also is probably good for avoiding predators, as some other posters have mentioned. It also probably means you're going to want to use a little more fast-twitch muscle, as the current top post mentioned. And seriously, every person who has worked with small animals will be able to tell you that they actually do this, even on treadmills! That paper I mentioned above looks at running at difference sizes, and has this to say about small animals: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It proved very difficult to obtain data from small animals walking at a constant average speed on the treadmill. The mice, chipmunks and white rats normally maintained slow average speeds by running to the front of the treadmill, stopping, and riding to the back. The animals sustained these oscillations for long periods without utilizing a steady speed walk.</p>
<p>From <a href="http://jeb.biologists.org/content/138/1/301.short" target="_blank">&quot;Speed, stride frequency and energy cost per stride: how do they change with body size and gait?&quot;</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This really is inherent to how small animals move; they <em>love</em> to go fast then stop, then go fast then stop, and even when you really, REALLY try to get them to do something else, they won't do it! It's not just fear, either: people have tried a <em>lot</em> of ways to get them to run at a constant speed. They are built for this!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because small animals can have much stronger bones and muscles proportional to their mass, compared to larger species.</p>
<p>This is related to something called square-cube law. If the size of something is changed by a factor of k, its surface area is squared (k^2) and its volume is cubed (k^3). As an example, if something is doubled in size (retaining its proportions), its surface area is increased by a factor of four, and volume by a factor of eight.</p>
<p>The strength of bones and muscles is, roughly speaking, defined by their cross-sectional area. In essence, if a bone or muscle grows twice as thick, its strength is quadrupled, but at the same time the mass of the animal is multiplied by eight, so in actuality the bone and muscles have become weaker relative to the mass of the animal.</p>
<p>This means that, not only are the bones of small animals typically much stronger than those of large animals - which allows animals like mice, rats, squirrels, monkeys, or small children for that matter to survive falls and impacts that would be easily fatal to a large animal or a grown human - their muscles are also proportionally stronger for their mass. That means they can produce higher acceleration, either as movement of limbs or head, as part of their locomotion.</p>
<p>To use a bigger scale factor, if you have a small animal and another similar animal, but eight times as big, the large animal is 64 times as strong but 512 times as heavy. That means, if the small animal can achieve jump acceleration of 20g, the large animal can only muster about 2.5g jump acceleration.</p>
<p>And, because they <em>can</em> jump and move with higher accelerations, why shouldn't they?</p>
<p>This propensity for quickness is also compounded by the fact that since these animals <em>can</em> move in this fast, twitchy fashion, they also benefit more from fast muscle fibres, which makes them capable of even more twitchy hoppy movements. Though in actuality, they might lose some muscle mass if they don't actually need to jump at 20g accelerations as a survival factor - if they can afford to lose some muscle mass, it may be beneficial to do so since maintaining muscle tissue can require a lot of energy, and being very small animals, they can still move quite rapidly even with proportionally less muscle.</p>
<p>And, by comparison, larger animals often need to have stronger bones, different bone structure, and more muscle mass in order to be capable of walking, moving, and obtaining enough food to maintain those bigger muscles. Thus, size is one of the more interesting variables in terms of evolution - both big and small sizes have several advantages and disadvantages. Small size usually means fast breeding cycle which means the species evolves fast and rapidly bounces back from population depletion. Large size means the animal is less vulnerable to predators and can have access to foods that smaller animals literally can't crack, but as a downside it takes a long time for a specimen to mature, taking care of the young becomes a major resource drain, and population upsets have a far more severe long term effects because the population can't replenish as fast as smaller species can.</p>
<p>As a funny anecdote, when the developers of Kerbal Space Program were designing the Kerbals and animations for these little green menaces, they found that their initially specified size for them made their animations look unnaturally twitchy and fast, and they had to enlarge them a little bit to make them more relatable and to get the animations to look good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I get the feeling you're referring to the full-body movement of something like a mouse or squirrel, but my first thought was the twitchy movement that birds make when examining their environment. This is done to aid in their depth perception. </p>
<p>Because their eyes are on the sides of the head, they're unable to use the fact that one eye sees the same scene slightly different from the other as we do, something known as parallax. In order to compensate for this, they examine a scene, then move their head quickly to get another perspective. Their brain is able to use the two images to give a rough estimate of depth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
