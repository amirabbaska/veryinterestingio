Most people know moving water can't freeze, but in real life scenarios, there's always a spot where water comes in contact with a solid surface (The rock or ice) that momentarily brings the fluid to a stop, in that short amount of time it has to be cold enough to freeze the water, this spot is called a nucleation spot (where things start).  From there it just basically builds outwards until the whole thing is frozen, the water freezing like a column as it flows down and hits the ice below, layer by layer.</p>
<p>Edit: I am surprised by how many people find this interesting/upvoting, it's ice to see so many people take an interest</p>
<p>Edit 2: Now my highest up-voted comment, with my lisp I never thaw that coming</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For my little ice climbing experience, sometimes only the outer layer of the waterfall freeze and liquid water is still flowing inside (That's really impressive to ear the noise of water). I've also seen some &quot;artificial&quot; ice fall made for climbing. Basically they spray water over a wall. The Water will ice on the ground or in contact with the rock, Then the water passing over will freeze on the first layer of Ice and slowly you get a fully frozen waterfall... </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>If the water is continuously falling at a rapid pace</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In many places where you get fantastic frozen waterfalls, the water is not falling at a rapid pace but is instead a slow trickle that keeps building and building from a single icicle into an entire frozen wall. Keep in mind that river levels will drop when temperatures are below freezing since there is no runoff to feed it, so they won't be running full tilt just prior to freezing.</p>
<p><a href="http://merge.canada.travel/sites/default/files/styles/page_gallery_main/public/photo/exp/se098_01rr_mike_gere_photo_mar_08_366.jpg" target="_blank">Maligne Canyon in Jasper, AB Canada</a> is a good example of that. If you go by in the summer time the walls are leaking but there is no waterfall there. In this case at least, there are parts of the river &amp; karst system that run underground and keep the water warm enough that it will continue flowing to the surface even when temperatures are -20C and colder.</p>
<p>Of course, when something huge like Niagara Falls freezes, that's a different story and u/Skaffer's explanation covers that scenario better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A waterfall gets the water from many small water bodies upstream from the waterfall itself. </p>
<p>If the area with the waterfall was the only area with freezing temperature, the mass of water would move to quickly to freeze. But this is not the case. As it gets colder the smaller streams upstream freezes. And all the water in the ground that eventually would make it to the river freezes solid in the soil. This brings the river that leads to the waterfall to also have less water, and eventually this also freezes. </p>
<p>This again reduces the amount of water feeding the waterfall, making it easier for the low temperature to take hold of the water and slowly freezing it bit by bit. Where it eventually is just a trickle of water reaching the once majestic cascade, that is now a solid frozen pillar of ice. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
