		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body has a circadian cycle, meaning that certain hormones are released at certain times of the day. For example, melatonin (what makes you feel sleepy) is released at night, and is inhibited by the light.</p>
<p>Similarly, other hormones, such as cortisol (the stress hormone) is released in cycles during the day, including a spike early in the morning that helps you wake up. If you try to sleep during a spike, you won't have as good sleep.</p>
<p>Your body's circadian rhythm can change, but it takes time. If you choose a sleep schedule and stick to it, after a few days, your body will adjust. If you keep changing your schedule, your body can get confused and it will impact how restful your sleep feels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two mechanisms controlling sleep.  Circadian rhythm, which responds to light stimulation and issues wake / sleep hormones accordingly, and also a &quot;body clock&quot;, which generally keeps track of how long you've been awake, to pressure you into sleeping if you've exceeded ~16 hours or so. </p>
<p>Circadian rhythms sort of become fixed when we're teenagers, and some people's are more flexible than others'.  The rhythms dictate when you produce cortisol, a hormone that induces wakefulness and alertness, and melatonin, a hormone that triggers sleep. </p>
<p>And this effects many other systems in the body, including digestion, &quot;core temperature&quot; (your internal body temperature), brain patterns, etc.  If you're forcing your body to try to go to sleep when its in wake mode, the sleep you get is generally much lower quality, because you're not entering deep sleep and REM.</p>
<p>For people whose circadian rhythms are flexible, you can generally go to bed within a wide range of times, and experience relatively little effect.  But some people (like me) have a disorder called Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome.  Basically, my circadian rhythym is VERY rigid, and what's worse, I feel tired around 4AM and want to wake around 12PM.  Deviating from the schedule makes me feel like garbage.  And because it isn't flexible, it takes a herculean effort to &quot;retrain&quot; my body, and the effort is all wasted the moment I stay up a little too late, and my body &quot;snaps back&quot; to the previous configuration.   </p>
<p>When you put me in a sleep study, and I go to bed at 11, even though I will &quot;fall&quot; asleep, its basically restless, crap sleep, until around 3 - 4AM, when suddenly the graph shows me drop into very deep and restful REM sleep.  </p>
<p>So even though I <em>think</em> I'm getting eight hours, because I closed my eyes at 11 and woke up at 7, in reality, I only get about 3.  And this is very common for people with DSPS, and most people don't even realize they have it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm sure a doctor will pop in with more info later, but your body operates on a schedule called the circadian rhythm.  Long story short is your body expects to have a certain amount activity/rest throughout the day, and on a fairly regular schedule.  So deviating from that will throw it off slightly.  It is also not on a 24 hour cycle, I think the last I read was it's actually a 25 hr schedule, so your body, if left unchecked would have you go to bed a little later  each night and sleep in a little more each day (but sunlight and other factors prevent the sleeping in later as a great time for sleep).  When the sun is up your body wants to be up, that's why you need blackout curtains to sleep well during the day.
So, going to bed an hour early is not going to upset your established circadian rhythm because your body is still going to expect to get up at your normal time, plus it should be during night hours so no morning light to mess up your sleep.
Also, if you're planning on sleeping more than usual keep a glass of water next to your bed, that overly groggy feeling from 'too much sleep' is usually just dehydration.
I know I have skipped over a lot, experts of sleep please feel free to throw in the gaps/correct as necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>I was told I should go to bed earlier, which I'm sure is sound advice, but how does it make a difference when I sleep the same length of time anyway?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm sure they didn't intend you to sleep the same length, they probably intended you to go to bed earlier to get more sleep.</p>
<p>Still, even if you go to bed earlier and sleep the same length, we were awake for a shorter time that one time you started, and should need a little less time to recover so in practice you still do get a little more sleep than you needed that one time...</p>
<p>But that is minimal, the main advantage if you both go to sleep earlier and wake up earlier is that you give yourself the margin to sleep a little extra (to the usual time you went up before) when it's needed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
