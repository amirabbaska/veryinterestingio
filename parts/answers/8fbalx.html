<p>Steps: </p>
<ol>
<li>Use dipole force to trap (i.e. levitate) a particle.</li>
<li>Use circularly polarized light for your trap.</li>
<li>The particle will rotate. </li>
</ol>
<p>Of course one needs to check the equations of motion to see what is exactly going on, but you get the idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without transforming it into another form of energy is a very restricting limitation. In that sense we can only use the photon momentum (the push), which is tiny by itself - tiny enough that you don't recognize it in your day to day life even though it's everywhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The photon pressure is very low. To produce 5 Newton force in the space near earth, you need direct sunlight upon a 800 x 800 meter panel. So, if you want something smaller you need to use a high energy laser beam. However, there is a limit to it as the ultra high energy laser beam may evaporate your mini windmill. Can someone do the math for us? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This thread looks like a lesson in scientific communication. Ideally the questioner would have a well defined question, but that's usually not the case. And ideally the scientifically minded would reshape the question with common sense assumptions the OP didn't know enough to consider.</p>
<p>Seems pretty reasonable as a non-expert scientifically minded person to reread the question as: &quot;Is there a way to cause rotation of an object using light as a direct energy source rather than as an intermediary where light energy is first transformed through another medium (like nuclear energy for example doesn't create electricity, but rather heat that can be used to create electricity indirectly via heating steam in a turbine)&quot;.</p>
<p>It's pretty clear they want to know if you can shine a light at something and cause it to rotate. From what others have said, the answer seems to be &quot;yes&quot; but minimally so due at terrestrial conditions because the forces involved are tiny compared to other forces.</p>
<p>I'm confident the answer is &quot;absolutely&quot; if you're talking about in the vacuum of space, because there are theories floating around about creating tiny space drones that are brought up to near light speeds by focusing lasers on them for propulsion. Anchor something in space around an axis and hit it with lasers and it would rotate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
