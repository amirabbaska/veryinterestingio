		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a condition know as <em>situs inversus</em>, and about 1 person in 10,000 has it.</p>
<p>If all the organs are reversed, the body functions completely normally, and it is not unusual for it to go undetected.  The main issue is making sure medical providers know about it, especially in an emergency.</p>
<p>In some cases, the reversal is imperfect, and this can lead to a number of health problems, with the most common being cardiac problems.  Also, situs inversus can be caused by Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia, which results in improperly formed cilia in the body.  Other symptoms include sinus and lung problems, and male infertility.  These are chronic conditions you would have already had.</p>
<p>Finally, situs inversus can complicate organ transplants involving asymmetric organs like the liver or heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have noted, if it's complete, if every organ in your body is flipped, it's not <em>that</em> big a deal, as long as your doctors know about it. However, it can be a very big deal if you ever need an organ transplant, because a normal heart won't fit correctly in your chest. So take care of your ticker; you'll be especially tough to find a donor for if you ever need one.</p>
<p>On the other side of that coin, please sign up to be an organ donor if you're not already. Other people in your situation are hoping for a matching organ every day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have an uncle that this condition saved his life.  He was in a tavern sitting at the bar talking with some friends, and a guy came in and mistook him for another man that had been sleeping with his wife. I don't know, maybe he was. Anyway the man swung him around and stabbed him in the chest on the left side with a hunting knife, but his organs were switched and it missed his heart. He didn't know either until that day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have this. It's not been a big deal for me, although my heart is plumbed imperfectly and that's not good. </p>
<p>Make sure this is added to your medical notes wherever you go. A lot of your organs are asymmetric so it's important to know. Make sure your SO knows so they can tell medics if you can't. A medical bracelet is a good idea. Also fill in the emergency medical details on your phone. It's a good idea to have a rough idea where your appendix should now be, just in case you get weird stabbing pains in your stomach. </p>
<p>I had fun with this when I was a kid. I was a subject for the finals at a medical school. I remember the colour draining from one young soon-to-be doctors face when he couldn't hear my heart, then the look of relief when he tried the other side. Lol. Got paid too, about Â£15 I think. Which was a lot in the early 90s. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
