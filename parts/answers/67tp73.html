		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a motor is turning, that rotation generates a voltage, a 'back EMF', that acts against the flow of current. It is this voltage, not the resistance of the coils, that restricts the amount of power the motor draws. And as this is an impedance, it doesn't generate heat. The power - the current in the motor pushing against this voltage - is what turns the motor.</p>
<p>When the rotor is locked, there is no back EMF to impede the flow of current through the motor. All the electricity flowing through the motor is converted to heat by the resistance of the windings. This quickly overheats the wiring, melting insulation, creating shorts, reducing the resistance and further increasing the current, until some wiring melts and blows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason this happens is because the rotor is locked and there is no rotation to induce counter electromotive force (EMF) in the motor. I see others have called it &quot;back EMF,&quot; but it is the same thing.</p>
<p>To understand counter EMF, think of Newton's Third Law. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. When a rotor rotates, it induces an electromagnetic force opposite of the direction of rotation. In an ideal situation the two forces balance out when there is a constant load and that is how you get your running current. Starting current is much different. As others have pointed out, before the rotor begins to turn and generate counter EMF the stator (armature) windings are essentially a short circuit. Those windings are not rated to handle that amount of current outside of starting surges. Because of a phenomenon called copper loss, all conductors generate heat as current flows through them. The amount of heat generated is proportional to current and calculated as P=I^2 * R. As you can see, the power dissipated (heat) grows exponentially with current. With nothing to limit the current flow in a locked rotor it is only a matter of time before any stator (armature) windings heat to the point of failure. If you are curious, there is a document that exists that explains a lot of these principles. The &quot;Applied Engineering Principles Manual&quot; can be found at <a href="http://www.navsea.navy.mil/Portals/103/Documents/NNPTC/Electrical%20Eng/applied_ee_v1.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.navsea.navy.mil/Portals/103/Documents/NNPTC/Electrical%20Eng/applied_ee_v1.pdf</a> and you would want to start reading at around page 23 or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://ctms.engin.umich.edu/CTMS/index.php?example=MotorSpeed&amp;section=SystemModeling" target="_blank">This</a> is a good description of a typical motor model.</p>
<p>If you look at the diagram, you see the armature circuit. That's what you connect your power to. It has a resistance, an inductance, and a back EMF. The back EMF is proportional to the rotor speed. The resistance is typically small. The motor I have here on my bench measures around 4 Ohms. </p>
<p>If you put in a constant voltage, you ignore the inductor part. If you hold the rotor steady, you ignore the back EMF part. All that's left is the armature resistance; input current is V/Ra. </p>
<p>This can be a problem because 1. 100% of that energy is dissipated in the winding, when some of it was supposed to be put out as mechanical energy, vibration, noise, rotor friction, etc. That's more than the armature is typically built to handle. And 2) it is, by definition, the maximum current the motor can handle. You're maximizing power in and minimizing efficiency, meaning the power goes to things it wasn't supposed to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electrical current will continue to increase trying to force the motor to move and you will hopefully blow a fuse or pop a breaker before burning up a motor. What is actually happening is that the spools of wire inside the motor, although they look like bare wire, are insulated and too much current causes the wires to heat up and the insulation melts and shorts the wires together. The smell of a bad motor is the plastic insulation having melted and one or more if the &quot;legs&quot; has grounded out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with the counter EMF that allows more current that many people have mentioned, the motors typically have a small fan to cool the motor components also. This is usually a problem when you use a VFD (varies frequency of power going to the motor to speed up or slow down the motor) on a motor not rated for that use.</p>
<p>So basically more amps and less cooling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
