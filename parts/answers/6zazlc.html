My understanding of it is that with kids, you don't really have to worry about what they think of you, because most kids really don't care about who you are as a person with socioeconomic status, moreso how interesting the things you talk about are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because shyness is a side effect of low self esteem and low confidence. You're not worried about children judging you or what they think of you, so you can more easily be yourself. This is proof that your shyness is in your own mind and that there is an issue with how you see yourself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Socializing might be difficult for individuals due to a sense of inferiority to others, confidence is important. You have fears of regret, exposing yourself, being vulnerable by opening up puts you at risk being wrong and embarrassing yourself.</p>
<p>With children, the risk is nearly zero. Kids are below us as adults, we are just better than they are and it's not hard to be confident in that. They might be smart even for their age, but they will never be our level until they invest a few more years learning as they should.</p>
<p>With adults, you're vulnerable to being proven wrong or being viewed as the bad guy. We all have different fears that take priority in conversation, for you it might not be fear of being wrong but saying the wrong things, who knows. Adults are our competition, our competition , who we are compared to when judging where we are in life. As social creatures, no matter how ridiculous this all is to us on paper, some of us are just wired to care a bit more than we should.</p>
<p>Work on your confidence and suddenly talking to a higher level of &quot;competition&quot; will suddenly be less overwhelming. Learn to forgive your imperfectness and to observe other's flaws.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you probably know it doesn't matter what kids think of you. You will never be good friends with them so you probably don't care for their approval.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
