		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is missing a lot of key points, and many are flat out wrong. It's not lobbying in a legal sense and it's not a campaign donation. </p>
<p>The money being pooled is almost exclusively to be used by 501(c)(4), which are &quot;social welfare organizations&quot;.  These organizations cannot donate directly to candidates for federal office.  </p>
<p>What these organizations do is make &quot;independent expenditures&quot; which benefit candidates. Legally these have to be done without coordination with the candidate or the campaign.  </p>
<p>What that means from a practical standpoint is that they run an ad that says something like </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Healthcare reform was a critical factor in making sure residents of Wisconsin.  Paul Ryan was a champion of smart, sensible health care reform.  Tell Paul Ryan 'thank you' for being a strong voice for Wisconsin.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[note, I don't agree with that... just using it as an example]</p>
<p>The advertisement would clearly be in support of Paul Ryan, but Citizen's United v. FEC made it legal for social welfare organizations to participate in certain types of speech without falling under normal campaign limits.  Theoretically, these social welfare groups can spend unlimited money running those kinds of ads.  </p>
<p>So what the Koch brothers essentially did was say &quot;hey, we're going to spend a ton of money supporting Republicans through our network of 501(c)(4)'s.  If you vote no, we won't spend any of that money in your district&quot;.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly they are doing it in public.. Not behind closed doors. Secondly they termed it as a campaign donation which many people do.</p>
<p>This is what they did. Copy and pasted from CNN</p>
<p>The advocacy groups helmed by Charles and David Koch have unveiled a new pool of money for advertisements, field programs and mailings that would exclude those who vote for the health care bill they oppose on Thursday. The effort, which they described as worth millions of dollars, is an explicit warning to on-the-fence Republicans from one of the most influential players in electoral politics not to cross them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I want to know, is why are the Koch brothers doing this? I understand their position is that the bill doesn't go far enough towards repealing obamacare, but they throw out some contrived shit about replacing it with better healthcare that Americans deserve. I highly doubt the koch brothers are worried about their healthcare expenses...or those of average Americans. So what do they stand to gain? I'm sure it has to do with money, because apparently they don't have enough already...but what specifically?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
