		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both penile erections and ejaculations are under the control of the autonomic nervous system. The erection in a man's penis is controlled by the parasympathetic and ejaculation is under the control of the sympathetic nervous system. Upon reaching a threshold of neuronal stimulation from the penis the sympathetic nervous system is triggered and thus ejaculation commences.  </p>
<p>EDIT (People complaining my original answer is too technical so here a simplified answer: Jizzing isn't controlled consciously, Your brain takes care of it for you in the background like it does with controlling your heart rate or breathing.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sciency enough to explain this but I don't think the ejaculation originates in the penis. It would be like asking how the hose knows to turn off. The penis is a pipe for this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
