		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once came across <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/tetrapodzoology/2010/06/15/most-inconvenient-seal/" target="_blank">this article</a> that tackled this very question. Even though the article is written for a broader audience, its author is an expert in the field (and it's well sourced to boot). The gist is that at present (at least as of a few years ago) there was no clear consensus. Instead, there were two key hypotheses about where the Baikal seals came from.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Seals from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paratethys" target="_blank">Paratethys</a>, that huge ass sea in southern Eurasia tens of millions of years ago, could have wondered north reaching what is now Lake Baikal. Just how exactly that could have happened is quite spotty since it would have required the seals hopping through multiple rivers and lakes across a long distance.</p>
</li>
<li>Alternatively, the seals could have moved north to south from the Arctic. Essentially the idea is that the seals would have moved down through the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Yeniseirivermap.png" target="_blank">Yensei/Angara Rivers.</a> eventually reaching the waters that formed Lake Baikal.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since this is not my field I am not sure if there has been any new research on this topic that may give a more conclusive answer. But it sure is a fascinating question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine mammal paleontologist here: it's a subject of debate in the literature, and to be clear, my focus is typically on walruses (Odobenidae) and sea lions (Otariidae) but I have dabbled in true seal phylogeny/paleontology (Phocidae). </p>
<p>Phocinae - specifically the Phocina tribe (Pusa + Phoca - Baikal/ringed/caspian seals + harbor/spotted seals, respectively) are a relatively recent, completely post-Paratethys diversification (likely during the Pliocene). The whole Paratethys idea is bunk and based on some rather antiquated Ukraine/USSR/eastern Bloc-centric ideas of seal evolution from the 60s/70s (Chapskii, Grigorescu, 'reanimated' by Koretsky).</p>
<p>My own preferred hypothesis, and I hope this is covered in the literature (if not I've got an easy paper to write!), is that these seals colonized the Caspian Sea and Lake Baikal via the West Siberian Glacial Lake during the Pleistocene - a huge pond of meltwater at the edge of the Siberian ice sheet. This would have been semiconnected to the ocean by rivers of meltwater. Our own Great Lakes are the remnants of these lakes around the perimeter of the former Laurentide ice sheet (though the ground is depressed due to glacial isostasy - literally, the weight of the ice sheet compressed/depressed the earth's crust). Matter of fact, the Champlain Sea (now only lake Champlain) in New York/Vermont/Ontario/Quebec is now mostly dry but deposits of this glacial 'sea' are rich in now-Arctic marine mammals (beluga, ringed seal, walrus, etc.).</p>
<p>So yes, technically a seal could swim up a river nowadays but during certain periods of the Pleistocene it was much easier owing to the vast lakes of meltwater along the edge of the ice sheet - just like the Champlain sea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have links off hand, but I understood lake Baikal to be very ancient in relation to other major lakes and All the fauna of the lake to be different not just seals.</p>
<p>As for the Great lakes they were blocks of ice first and fresh water fish populated it. Lake Baikal was not glacially formed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm more familiar with the Caspian seals, but <a href="http://web.corral.tacc.utexas.edu/UAF/arctos/2011_08_16/Palo_etal_2006_The_enigma_of_the_landlocked_Baikal_and_Caspian_seals_addressed_through_phylogeny_of_phocine_mitochondrial_sequences.pdf" target="_blank">in terms of their ancestry and apparent timing of separation from their closest relative in the open ocean, the Baikal and Caspian seals often are discussed together</a>. As much I've continued to follow this story, it does seem like the hypothesis that they come from the Arctic (as referenced in this article and by several other comments) seems to be the most supported. Not sure of Baikal's history, but in the Caspian, the rough timing of the separation of the Caspian seal from its source population corresponds with a massive highstand (the Akchagylian stage for any Caspian chronostratigraphy buffs out there) in Caspian sea level where the mapped extents of deposits reach near (but don't quite get to the) Arctic ocean. The base-level history of these internally drained lakes (e.g. Caspian, Baikal, Aral, etc) can get real wacky, the Caspian for example had base level variations in excess of 1 km <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018213002836" target="_blank">(e.g. this paper I wrote a few years back assembling a sea-level curve for the Caspian)</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
