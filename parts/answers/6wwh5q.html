		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chickenpox is caused by the varicella zoster virus and smallpox by the  variola viruses.  Vaccina and variola are poxviruses, varicella zoster virus is not - so it is not surprising that vaccina immunization will not confer any immunity to chickenpox.</p>
<p>&quot;Pox&quot; is an old term dating from the time before we had knowledge of infectious agents and was used to describe a number of diseases that seemed to spread easily and cause skin lesions. For example syphilis was once also known as the &quot;great pox&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's mostly just a name. Pox means getting a rash of pimples. So anything that causes a rash of pimples could have been named xxxxxx-pox. Smallpox, cowpox and some other variations are all caused by very similar viruses. In fact infecting someone with cowpox was the first way to vaccinate someone from smallpox. Because they are so similar, our bodies antibodies work similarly on the multiple viruses. If the viruses are not similar enough, the body will not recognize them and therefore won't fight them off as readily. Chickenbox is not related closely enough to smallpox for one vaccination to work against the viruses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pox was just a term for pustules back in the day. Anything that made it regardless of how related it was could get the name. It's like how hepatitis viruses cause... Hepatitis... But aren't related viruses. </p>
<p>The Great Pox is actually syphilis. The Small Pox is smallpox. Chicken pox is unrelated to smallpox and is a herpes virus called Varicella Zoster virus. Vaccinia is a closely related true poxvirus (a class of viruses by that name) and things like Cowpox are in fact true poxviruses as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically the cowpox and smallpox are closely related pox viruses that share similar protein structures. So your immunity learns to fight both with one exposure. </p>
<p>Chicken pox is VZV a herpes virus (that just means it is double stranded DNA and envelope). It doesn't share any protein structures with poxvirus family. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey OP, was just learning this stuff:</p>
<p>Chicken Pox (Varicella Virus/VZV) belongs to the Herpesviridae family. They're actually more related to Herpes Simplex Viruses, HSV as these are all alpha types that remain latent in neurons. Shingles is varicella zoster virus VZV, the same exact virus that reactivates later in life. &quot;Pox&quot; is related to the pustules/rashes - classification has gotten much better since the golden ages. Symptoms wise, small pox will have all pustules simultaneously at the same stage whereas chicken pox will have postures in different stages. They're related by symptoms and observation but when you look at virus classification, they're different. </p>
<p>Tldr: chicken pox is a completely different type of virus (look up HHV/human herpes virus for more info) whereas vaccinia is <em>practically</em> an &quot;attenuated&quot; form of small pox that is similar enough to elicit an applicable immune response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
