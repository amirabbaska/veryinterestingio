		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With regards to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/64m8lg/why_is_rvideos_just_filled_with_united_related/" target="_blank">recent situation involving United Airlines</a> it wasn't that the flight was overbooked, but rather it was full and United needed to transfer four employees to another airport and therefore needed space on the plane.</p>
<p>They took <del>the last four passengers to book the flight</del> four passengers chosen randomly by a computer and asked them to leave. They are allowed to do this.</p>
<p>This is my understanding, anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given this is probably inspired by the United thing, I'll answer off that first. It was handled in a way that was completely wrong. In my 200 flights in the last year and a half I have NEVER seen it handled like that. They completely fucked up and it's a bad example of how it's supposed to work. I think what happened is they boarded and then realized they had to get a crew of four to another city so they could be the crew members on another flight because of the recent storms that stranded a ton of people for days. </p>
<p>What should/usually happens is pre boarding they ask for volunteers to give up their seat. Continually raising the amount in vouchers they'll give you. They generally don't board the plane till this is figured out. Usually this is caused by overbooking or stand by passengers who missed a connecting flight because of weather/other unforeseen events. Once they have enough volunteers they have them wait and not board, asking them to sit off somewhere. Then about 20-30 later once they have boarded everyone else they'll either tell none/some/all the volunteers if they need them to board or if they'll put them on another flight. If the airlines lucky a few people don't show to the flight or missed a connecting so those volunteers will still get to go home. If they need those seats they'll cut the volunteers a voucher and schedule them for the next available flight to their destination. You're told in advance when the next flight you'll be put on when you volunteer so it's not a guessing game. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Given that Louisville is about a four and one half hour drive from Chicago, it is not clear why the extra flight crew had to fly to their destination. It also seems exceedingly odd that an airline would consider it acceptable to have a customer wait about 18 hours to take a half-hour flight which could be driven in under 5 hours. The airline may have been within its rights but United was sorely lacking in commonsense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a flight is overbooked, the flight attendant on the ground asks you nicely if you'd rather fly a different flight and they will compensate you economically. If they can find enough people to do that, it's fine. If not, the last ones to come are placed in a different flight, but still compensated economically for it (or given free flights). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
