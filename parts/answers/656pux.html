		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a sailor's perspective, we're envious of how easy space is. </p>
<p>Since the vacuum of space is transparent, Houston can see exactly where their ships are going. For exploration that's a big fucking deal.  Unlike Columbus they don't leave Europe thinking they're going to hit India. With undersea exploration it's the same problem. The points of interest in the sea aren't bright shining stars or planets that you can see from across the solar system. Biologically, eyes work in space but they don't work underwater. The technological challenges to observe and monitor phenomena are harder when you're blind.  Yes, the seafloor is just a few miles away, and not in the Andromeda galaxy, but for all intents and purposes it might as well be on the moon. It's more difficult to observe and monitor with Hubble-like clarity.</p>
<p>Because of eyes and the emptiness of space, all Galileo needed was a $50 telescope and an abacus or whatever. As a space explorer, he not just mapped the solar system but he modeled the orbits. He mapped both distance and <em>time</em>, space-time.  Exploration-wise, that's like the whole ballgame. Since things move and change, it's important to be able to plot where stuff will be and what the conditions will be in the future.  It's difficult to engineer solutions without reliably predicting that stuff. </p>
<p>Since most of space is, well space, devoid of matter, the is no friction and water mass moving things around, just gravity. The math and physics of gravity are so simple Galileo could do it and Apollo could do it with slide-rules. But the ocean, like the weather, is governed by fluid dynamics as well as gravity. This is a much more computationally intensive type of physics to math out. It's hard to the measure and describe dimensions of a blob of liquid.  Validating a model of how a blob of water moves in relation to temperature and gravity is more difficult than watching a few individual planets interact gravitation-ally.  So if you want to know where an undersea current is going to move a sandbar or a fishery in the water column, you can't simply plot its orbit with relatively simple arithmetic.  So mapping and modelling is a big problem. With today's super computers we've just barely begun to create reliable 'Galileo-level' weather models. Hydrodynamic models are a unconquered frontier of science and computational power. </p>
<p>Communication is another line of sight problem. Apollo can phone anyone on Earth from the moon with radio signals because he can see the whole thing. Radio doesn't work underwater terribly well. On the surface you need to bounce off satellites to get around the curvature of the Earth.  It sounds like a dumb, solvable problem but the physics of a large mass of water between you and where you want to go is a stubborn, unrelenting obstacle. Yeah, the vacuum of space sucks, but it's kind of a stable, unchanging environment compared the the dynamic, interacting, multi-factorial oceangraphic, geological, biological, meteorological ocean processes.</p>
<p>While escaping Earth's gravity is difficult, once you're in space, the frictonless travel means you can cover great distances in orbit without an ongoing expenditure of energy. Unmanned probes need more care and feeding at the bottom of the ocean. Things at great depth on the seafloor fail because the forces exerted by the water are greater than those in a vacuum. Think of the failure of the Deepwater Horizon's blowout preventor. Difficult to say whether the oil companies have a bigger budget than NASA when it comes to undersea exploration for oil...</p>
<p>So I would argue that we don't necessarily spend more money on space exploration or have more success colonizing space. It's just that the money we do spend generates a lot more exploration than a similar expenditure can achieve at exploring and monitoring the undersea environment. Like exploration is more than just getting there. You have to be able to write home and describe how the New World works. Want me to send my ship to an ice moon? Better know how geysers and shit works.  You have to be able to understand its forces to engineer operational solutions. You need to be able to leverage its advantages for your gain. </p>
<p>We've explored ways to do that at the surface. But blindness underwater is a stubborn problem. Yes the abyss feels close, but it is much less logistically inhabitable than the International Space Station.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The exploration of space is for multiple reasons : </p>
<ul>
<li>Having a backup plan if the planet Earth is not habitable anymore.</li>
<li>Using the planet to put all the factories and other things that pollute to have a clean earth and have atmospheric layer on this planet.</li>
<li>Having a way of pression in case of war (a missile laucher in space would be pretty scary).</li>
</ul>
<p>And probably more...</p>
<p>The oceans on the other hand are smaller in size than a planet and have a lot of pressure (that's in part why we didn't explore them, we don't have the equipment to handle that much pressure yet). Also, there is no natural light in the deep water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There has to be a way to build and live there, create sustainable energy from it, and turn it into drinking water.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can do all of these things. Underwater structures exist. Hydro-power exists, and desalination exists. There's not a particularly large base of people clamoring to live under the sea however, so the market doesn't really exist.</p>
<p>Also I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;more money on exploring space.&quot; space exploration is limited to relatively few entities, mostly governments.</p>
<p>All kinds of entities, public and private, are exploring the oceans. For instance, energy companies attempting to exploit underwater mineral content. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am just confused why we are constantly looking to space for future answers, when we still have 70% of the world left for possible expansion.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We aren't really exploring space for &quot;Expansion.&quot; There's still a fair amount of room simply on the surface of the Earth that <em>isn't</em> water. There are no realistic plans in the foreseeable future for a significant portion of the Earth's population moving to another planet or Moon, and any sort of movement that actually put a dent in Earth's population is just about logistically inconceivable, no matter how good our technology. </p>
<p>We explore space for <em>information.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need to understand the objectives of space exploration vs deep ocean.</p>
<p>Astrophysics provides insights on how the forces of the universe work leading to new materials, manufacturing methods, etc. Things we use today vs a misguided notion of extra-terrestial colonies (I'm all for trying to put humans on Mars but that's just a small extension for space exploration).</p>
<p>Experiments in zero gravity have yield a vast amount of new tech and medicine that have improved lives. Satellite have expanded globalization, understanding of climate and environment. </p>
<p>Deep ocean exploration is designed to understand how life evolves in different environments, and that (so far) can't be done in space. There's significant breakthroughs in understanding of life forms and evolution with deep sea exploration.</p>
<p>But while worth to be explored, deep sea imposes serious physical barriers. The pressure alone is a major deterrent. It's easy to pressurize a space station but the human body can't live for long periods under sea pressure as the higher density of air will cause pulmonary toxicity. Even life under 40ft would cause devastating long term damage to the body.</p>
<p>Underwater habitats would not be practical considering waves, currents and storms. The danger of physical harm outweighs any desire to pursue further, specially since there are terrestrial alternatives still being explored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Ever since humans started having a concious mind, people have pointed up at the moon and stars, and each night they looked, they were in awe by the beauty of the sky. Soon, questions arose: &quot;What are those twinkles in the sky?&quot;, &quot;Are <em>we</em> a twinkle?&quot;. And then the creation of us also became a question. What made the other planets? Are we alone?</p>
<p>There are more planets and solar systems than there are oceans on our world, and we humans enjoy a good adventure. Everyone can go swimming in the ocean, and everyone knows whats at the bottom. Fish, and different types of fish and water creatures. No one wants to hear about a new fish, but everyone wants to know about a potential for life millions of miles away from home. Our ocean, like the universe, is vast, but nowhere near as vast as the home to all things known to man, space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
