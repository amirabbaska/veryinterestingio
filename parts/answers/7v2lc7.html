		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>headaches, whatever their underlying causes, are usually the result of irritation of the important systems in and around your head, including muscles, nerves, and blood vessels. much like stretching your back when you have a crick in it, straining the muscles in your neck and head by shaking it is likely to further irritate the muscles causing the problem or cause your neurons to fire off more signals in your already over-stimulated neural pain pathways. headaches can also be caused by a buildup of pressure in the head (like when you get a sinus infection) and shaking your head around can cause sudden changes in pressure that make your headache worse. all that said, give your head a break when it's aching!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uhhhh, my head hurts if I shake it all even if i don't have a headache. I used to have a trampoline as a kid and after having the trampoline for years, my head would hurt if i was jumping on it for a short amount of time even, and ever since then my head hurts if I shake it. Anyone have any explanation more than that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
