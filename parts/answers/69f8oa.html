		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can observe that the universe is expanding, so the hypothesis was that the universe used to be more compact in the past and expand.</p>
<p>So what they do is that they run back the clock. We have a density of mass and energy currently, if things were more compact in the pass, then the density would be higher. Higher density of mass and energy, change how matter react and temperature go up. </p>
<p>So you can test what happen to matter as you increase mass/energy density and temperature. All matter emit thermal radiation. The higher the temperature of the matter, the smaller the wavelength of that thermal radiation will be. But when atoms are hot enough, they lose their electron, atoms become ions and the material become a plasma. The thing is that plasma is really good at absorbing thermal radiation. That's what happen to the sun. It's a big ball of plasma and thermal radiation created in the core of the sun take thousand of year to get to the surface.</p>
<p>So if our hypothesis is right as the universe become colder, as some point it went from a universe of plasma made of ions to a universe cold enough for electron and photon to form atoms. Like I said, Ions absorb very well thermal radiation, but atoms don't. So at some point the universe became transparent and released a lot of thermal radiation in a relatively shot period of time. And we can see that. That's the CMB or Cosmic Microwave Background radiation. </p>
<p>But at some point the Universe was so dense and high in temperature that we don't know how matter behave. We don't have any example in nature. So we build particle accelerator. We made particle collide so fast that it show us how matter react in super high density and temperature. As we increase the speed of the particle that we acceleration, we simulate farther and farther in the past of our universe. </p>
<p>There is a lot of example like that about how scientist figure out how our universe expanded. Each are rather unique. Like how they realise that the CMB is way too smooth, meaning that the universe had to expand drastically at some point, which they call the Inflation. They calculated during how much time the universe was dense enough to make fusion and with that info, they calculated the ratio of hydrogen to helium and it match perfectly the ratio we see in our universe, we call the Big Bang nucleosynthesis.</p>
<p>But at some point, the universe was so dense that even the fundamental forces of the universe break down. So at that point we simply don't know how to understand how the universe behaved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is like seeing a ripple, and tracing it backwards to figure out what kind of a rock someone through into the pond.</p>
<p>We know the laws of physic and about how much energy and mass there is in the entire universe.  If we put all that in one place, we can make some reasonable guesses as to how it much have behaved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This among a lot of other things are merely theories which bend math as more of an artistic expression rather than mathematical ones. Take everything you can't observe yourself with a grain of salt, scientific facts are debunked every year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
