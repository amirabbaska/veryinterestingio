		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, there is no absolute limit. However due to relativity and laws of causation there actually is a limit given by the speed of light. That is to say if Earth magically doubled in mass in an instant(t=0) observers at varying distances from Earth would feel the increased gravity a some time t&gt;0 depending on how far they are from Earth. Thus there is some distance limit on the effect of gravity if you include time. This concept is actually the basis for the <del>theorization</del> explanation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave" target="_blank">Gravitational Waves</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_wave" target="_blank"><del>Gravity Waves</del></a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The force between two objects is calculated as F=GMm/R^2, where:
-G is the universal gravitational constant, 6.674*10âˆ’11 N-m2/kg2
-M and m are the masses of the objects in kg
-R is the distance between the objects' centres of mass, in metres.</p>
<p>Because the numerator of this rational expression is non-zero, there is no real value of R that would make the value of the expression 0. However, as R grows larger, F does rapidly decrease, and as R approaches infinity, F approaches 0.</p>
<p>Far enough away, the force would be negligible for practical applications as the objects would be affected by other, greater forces (think riding into a headwind while someone blows on your ear).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is very little science in this thread. Both Newtonian gravity (attraction between planets, stars, us, etc) and the expanding Universe <em>are solutions to general relativity.</em>  </p>
<p>Their difference lies in the scale of interactions which you consider. If you take GR and make approximations appropriate to describe a person standing on Earth, you get Newtonian gravity. If you zoom out to beyond superclusters, so that you can't really see nearby galaxies, clusters, etc, as distinct, the the Universe is basically smooth and homogeneous. This is the approximation to GR that gives rise to the expanding Universe.  </p>
<p>These approximations aren't wrong, they're just only valid in the realm where they hold. We don't see the Universe expanding within the solar system because Newtonian gravity (for the most part) dominates --- it is the best approximation within the solar system (galaxy, etc.). The effects of Newtonian gravity diminish once you get to the scale of 100's of mega parsecs, where it's all homogeneous and isotropic expansion. Expansion doesn't touch the solar system; we don't touch expansion.  </p>
<p>So <em>technically</em> Earth is pulling on distant galaxies and clusters, but the effect is unfathomably tiny. When we use GR to describe the expansion of the Universe, Newtonain physics is not included. The range of gravity is infinite in the sense that there's no place where it suddenly drops to zero. However, causality is a true, physical limit, and the furthest effect something can have is within it's own Hubble patch (no further than a Hubble length away).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From the perspective of the most fundamental maths related to the universe... yes gravity's range is considered infinite. Gravity is the most variable part of our equations related to the expansion of the universe(and thus size).</p>
<p>The Hubble parameter(which defines the  rate of the expansion of the universe) is, in part, defined by the Robertson-Walker scale factor.</p>
<p>Robertson-Walker scale factor is defined as the relationship between gravity and energy(more specifically mass and radiation) on a universal scale.  Photon pressure(expansion) is losing the battle to gravity(contraction), but dark energy(expansion) will become dominate in a few billion years.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the dimensionless scale factor to characterize the expansion of the universe, the effective energy densities of radiation and mass scale differently. This leads to a radiation-dominated era in the very early universe but a transition to a matter-dominated era at a later time and, since about 5 billion years ago, a subsequent dark energy-dominated era</p>
