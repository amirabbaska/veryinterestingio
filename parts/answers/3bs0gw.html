		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slightly on topic most deli meats are basicly SAUSAGE right? </p>
<p>I mean that butterball deli turkey ..is basicly just ...a BALL of mechanically seperated turkey ..pressed together into a shape ..and then sliced. </p>
<p>So its cheaper to do it that way right and I am correct? because if you COOK A TURKEY ...Slice it ....and put it on a sandwich ..it has a very dry texture and the grains of the meat are obvious and it has a very strong taste. </p>
<p>Why are all deli meats so WATERY and &quot;slimey&quot; </p>
<p>Is it just a perception due to the thinness of the slices? If I got SUPER THICK SLICED turkey ..would it be more like &quot;Actual&quot; turkey to my pallate? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP here. Just so we are all clear. I'm talking about a <a href="http://www.moreflavorperpound.com/images/big_roast-beef-cut.jpg" target="_blank">hunk of unprocessed meat</a>  not some processed, formed, <a href="http://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/assets/4841314/spam1.png" target="_blank">&quot;meat&quot;</a>.  So far the most logical explanations seem to be that a thinner cut, combined with the air pockets created by layering more slices exposes more surface area of the meat to the air for my nose and to my tongue. Thanks everyone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd love to hear a scientific explanation for it.</p>
<p>One time, we decided to make Reuben sandwiches and I accidentally bought thicker sliced corned beef once. Hubby (who worked in a deli many moons ago) declared it unsuitable and I had to go back for the thinly shaved kind. I couldn't understand why we couldn't just use the thicker cut, fewer slices. <em>NO. Back to the store.</em></p>
<p>And honestly, the sandwiches made with the thinly shaved batch were 10 times better than the thick. (They came from the same source at deli, absolutely the same beef.)</p>
<p>I was amazed -- never would have guessed it would have made that much difference. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they <em>are</em> different!</p>
<p>In essence, texture is a major part of taste (along with flavor, aroma, etc). Since the thinly-sliced turkey shifts differently when exposed to the forces of your tongue, you can sense a different texture. That makes your brain interpret them differently, so you get a different taste sensation!</p>
<p>You can equate it to other food form differences (corn on the cob vs corn kernels vs creamed corn) or, more abstractly, other aesthetic differences (people feel different levels of attraction to thick men and women than thin ones, even if it's the same person).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
