		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is something I can answer because I did intermittent fasting awhile back and still do it today (though not as rigorously) and I lost close to 50 pounds. </p>
<p>Intermittent fasting is simply eating within certain windows of time. It is NOT starving yourself like some people think. At one point I was doing an 18 hour fast with the 6 hour eating period. With the way my schedule was at the time, I would start my first meal around 11am and stop around 6pm or so (depended on the day). Like most people, I hated going to sleep hungry so I pushed my window further into the day because I could tolerate being hungry in the morning but I could not tolerate it while trying to sleep. Like some other people have already stated, your body WILL adjust and every day it becomes easier and easier.</p>
<p>Now onto breakfast. Remember that technically speaking, breakfast is the meal where you literally “break your fast”. I know traditionally it means the first meal you eat within an hour or so of waking up but honestly you have to ditch that mentality. You can never truly skip breakfast. You just change the time around from when you eat it. So when people say they are “skipping breakfast” because they are doing intermittent fasting, they’re really saying “I can’t start eating until later in the day” (past the traditional time frame of when breakfast normally is).</p>
<p>So intermittent fasting and skipping breakfast aren’t really that comparable honestly. Intermittent fasting is just being more stringent on WHEN you eat food. So some people absolutely HAVE to eat early in the morning and that’s totally fine. But if you’re serious about the fasting then you have to stop eating earlier in the day and you’ll probably get hungry during the night. It sucks but your body will adjust after awhile; you just have to stick with it. Consistency is more important than dedication (as dumb as that sounds). You have to stick to it day in and day out. Pair the fasting with good exercise and the weight will fall off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Literally none. The whole &quot;breakfast is the most important meal of the day&quot; schtick is bogus. You'll be hungry in the mornings for a while but it's not gonna hurt you. Once your body gets used to the schedule, it'll be even better. Just remember to count calories as well as fasting, you won't lose weight if you're still eating more than your tdee.</p>
<p>Edit: credit to u/intensely-human:</p>
<p>There is one wrinkle here, which is that if you're prone to anxiety then you'll be a little more prone to it when you're stomach is empty.  </p>
<p>Probably worth it as part of getting the positive effects of fasting, but it's worth being aware of.  </p>
<p>I was doing nothing but coffee with butter and coconut oil for breakfast and when I switched to five eggs every morning suddenly getting through my day was easier because I didn't get overwhelmed and give up getting work done.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Intermittent fasting generally refers to consolidating your eating into a 8 hour window of the day. This could be done in the evening, or it could be done in the morning. Or the middle of the day, so long as it's one contiguous 8 hour window.</p>
<p>Different people operate differently and different lifestyles generally change how important breakfast is. If you sit at a desk at work all day, skipping breakfast really isn't going to be much of a problem. You might be a bit hungry during the day but you eventually get used to it. If you do a bunch of physical labor during the day, it's probably going to impact you more as you have no energy reserves to work with and your body's forced to dip into fat stores.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While an afternoon eating window where you would not eat &quot;breakfast&quot; is the most popular for intermittent fasting (IF) it is not the only option. IF is simply eating all your daily calories within 8 hours or less and then not eating any calories the remaining hours of the day. You could eat in the morning and still follow IF by not eating in the afternoon or evening. Also, IF isn't really skipping meals it's just eating that food at a different time. Plenty of people are not trying to be in a caloric deficit while following IF so they are not skipping anything. Even if they are in a caloric deficit, they are still eating the same amount in the shortened window as they would have eaten when eating the three traditional meals while in a deficit. They are just not eating at the normal times and for some reason that is seen as skipping meals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do intermittent fasting basically by accident, as I'm a teacher and cut out breakfast time as sleep is more important, and I am too lazy to make lunches for the day. So I end up eating everything from 4pm-10pm basically. I dunno if this is good or bad, but it seems to work fine for me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
