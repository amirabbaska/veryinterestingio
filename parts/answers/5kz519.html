I had to look and a .22lr is doing between 140-260 Joules of energy on impact. Do you have a plan to try this with larger caliber rounds?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I was wondering about the failure mechanism of most of the drops. It seems like the drop weathered the bullet strike, but the force that it absorbed resulted in the tip of it breaking off somehow. Was this due to the transfer of force along the drop, or was it from it being suspended by the tip on the line and the bullet jostled it enough to cause it to break?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
