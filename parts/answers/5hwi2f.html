		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know a surprising lot about the topography and landforms, through radar interferometry which can &quot;see&quot; throught the cloud cover from the Venera 15 and 16 probes in the 80s and from the Magellan probe in the 90s. Russian landings also have provided some data in the 70s and 80s. </p>
<p>From surface measurements, we know that surface is mostly basaltic (see : <a href="http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0034-4885/66/10/R04/meta;jsessionid=9D3EE4C32DCF20D5F6211EB70672ECCE.c2.iopscience.cld.iop.org" target="_blank">Basilevsky, A. T.; J. W. Head III (2003). &quot;The surface of Venus&quot;. Reports on Progress in Physics. 66 (10): 1699–1734</a>). This fits with the landforms outlined by the radar imagery which are quite explicitely volcanic (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/92JE01273/epdf" target="_blank">Head, J. W., Crumpler, L. S., Aubele, J. C., Guest, J. E., &amp; Saunders, R. S. (1992). Venus volcanism: Classification of volcanic features and structures, associations, and global distribution from Magellan data. Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets, 97(E8), 13153-13197</a>) and quite diverse. </p>
<p>However, these volcanic rocks may be reworked by surface processes and coated with other substances such as iron sulphides (pyrite) which might be stable in the existing atmospheric conditions, at least locally at high altitude in the Highlands (<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sim/3116/sim3116_pamphlet.pdf" target="_blank">Ivanov, Mikhail A.; Head, James W.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A Venera probe landed there and took some photos! It's just a rocky wasteland. The atmosphere is around 96% carbon dioxide and the vast majority of the acid in the atmosphere doesn't quite make it to the surface. </p>
<p>SO although its extremely hot and extremely high pressure, it's not all that bad there for rocks to just chill out for 300 million years or so. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stone is very good at resisting the action of most acids and if there were any acids in the Venusian atmosphere that could react with stone they would have done so long ago and been used up.  Likewise stone is very resistant to heat and pressure.  If the air of Venus were much hotter than it is the worst that would happen would that the rock would melt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a semantic point, but I wouldn't use the word &quot;withstand&quot;. Venus' landscape is the by-products of its corrosive atmosphere, not things that are impervious to corrosion, per se. This is not uncommon. Oxygen is highly reactive, causing rust and fire and tying up otherwise free elements into alkaline salts and weird, useless gases. The surface of Earth is full of oxygenated by-products, not things that withstand oxygen. Earth is remarkably lacking in clouds of methane and ammonia found on other planets, specifically because oxygen burns them into by-products like guano and carbon dioxide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All something needs to &quot;withstand corrosion&quot; is ... to be the results of that corrosion. When iron &quot;corrodes&quot; on Earth (oxidizes), it turns to rust (iron oxide). Does it really make sense to say that rust &quot;withstands&quot; corrosion/oxidization? Now lets put rust into the Venusian atmosphere which has some hydrochloric acid in it, producing iron chloride and water. Does it make sense to say iron chloride &quot;withstands&quot; hydrochloric acid?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
