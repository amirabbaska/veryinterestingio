<p>Just stopping by to post a reminder that all top level comments (direct replies to OP) are restricted to explanations and further on-topic questions. If you have an anecdote or other type of comment, please feel free to post it as a (relevant) reply to another comment, otherwise it will be removed.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I'm afraid this thread has run its course. The matter in question has been thoroughly explained and all the new comments are either a copy of what was already said or a non-explanation - I've been constantly monitoring the thread and every time I refresh the page I have to remove half a dozen comments. As a result, we've decided to lock it. Thank you to everyone who contributed with a great explanation or further questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The actual cause of Alzheimer's is not clearly known.  However there are two common changes in the brain of an Alzheimer's patient.  </p>
<p>First, your brain is made up of nerve cells and the road-like pathways between these cells are very important for relaying signals for just about anything you want to do from raising your arm, to chewing your food, to aspects such as breathing.  Alzheimer's is a disease where there is either too much of a <strong>sticky</strong> protein part (called beta amyloid) made or not enough &quot;thrown away&quot;.  This leads to a buildup of these sticky proteins and it tends to cause a traffic jam and block the signals to be transmitted.  </p>
<p>Over time, the more and more plaque deposits block various pathways, slowly causing the person to be able to function less and less.  </p>
<p>The second part occurs inside of the cells in the brain.  There are parts that are like strings (neurofibrils) that are held together by tape (tau proteins) in a particular pattern normally.  You can see these under a microscope.  With Alzheimer's, the tape becomes tangled up on itself and allows the strings to tangle (neurofibrillary tangles) and is the main way they diagnose the disease.  It is the bundle of tape that is toxic to the cell.  </p>
<p>This being bad for the cell (and a lot of cells getting sick), there are an increase in certain cells in the brain that are responsible for throwing the trash away.  This leads to the brain getting smaller, which also causes the person to lose function over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Your brain wastes away and ceases to function properly on any level. It's not just memory that goes, it's everything. You can see in the pic how the AZ brain is smaller and emptier and full of holes. </p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>There is a very beautiful story about a woman who was diagnosed with alzheimers and made the decision to end her own life before it progressed too far. It details her experience and her decision making process to live as much life as possible while ending it before she lost the capacity to do so:</p>
