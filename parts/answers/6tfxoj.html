When you're awake, normal blinking action keeps that stuff moving and working itself out via ducts.  When you sleep, though, it just sorta sits there and thickens up a bit, maybe gathers a little dust, etc.  In the corner of your eyes where it dries completely, that's what the crusty stuff is, too.</p>
<p>Anyway, once you're awake for a bit, your blinking clears it up again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
