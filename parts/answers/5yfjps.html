		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is political theory, and there is just what people call themselves.  </p>
<p>In theory, one can describe three ideological axes (or more, but these three are relevant to this question): Liberal vs. authoritarian, conservative vs. radical, and progressive vs. regressive.  </p>
<p>Liberal means power is distributed while authoritarian means it is concentrated, but does not speak to how the power is used.  Conservative means change should be minimized while radical seeks extensive change, but does not speak to what the change should be.  Progressive seeks to distribute material resources (or more nebulously, social value) while regressive seeks to concentrate material resources (ditto).</p>
<p>&quot;Libertarianism&quot; would in theory be liberal, conservative, and regressive.  &quot;Socialism&quot; in the old Soviet sense would be authoritarian, radical, and difficult to define on the third axis because while material output is distributed the capital is concentrated all into the hands of the state.  <em>Democratic</em> socialism would be liberal, radical, and progressive.  </p>
<p>&quot;Conservatism&quot; as defined in US politics would be authoritarian, radical, and regressive, while &quot;liberalism&quot; in US politics would be liberal, conservative, and progressive.</p>
<p>&quot;Liberal&quot; in European politics does not refer to power in general, but rather specifically to minimization of economic regulation, but does not particularly concern itself with other forms of power.  It is somewhat of a synonym for &quot;neo-liberal&quot;, although this term is nebulous in itself.  &quot;Conservative&quot; in Europe usually means authoritarian, conservative (as opposed to US &quot;conservative&quot; radicalism), and regressive.</p>
<p>In other words, to answer your summary question, Liberal and Progressive in US politics are often used as synonyms, but <em>can</em> be used to distinguish between someone's issue emphasis - whether they are focused on economic distribution and social equality, or on fighting authoritarian government policies.  People who see both as highly important will just call themselves by either name, or even combine them as liberal-progressive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't really like replying to threads on big subs when there have been so many comments already, but I feel obliged to since all the comments are lacking in one way or another (e.g axis theories of political ideology are hack because ideology does not lie along a neat spectrum.)</p>
<p>There is a difference between 'progressive' and 'liberal', which is based in what each stand for. <strong>As a general rule of thumb, from a technical perspective all liberals see themselves as progressive, but not all progressives see themselves as liberal</strong>. This does not apply in all circumstances but is generally true enough to hold.</p>
<p>First, a quick caveat to get out of the way - the US population is bad at political terminology, and as such 'Liberal' is basically synonymous with 'more left wing (whatever that means - it can vary massively depending on the person) than the current regime'. </p>
<p>However, the very concept of Liberalism, worldwide, refers to an ideology which values human liberty and equality. 'Liberty' and 'equality' are both very vague concepts, however, and as such Liberalism tends to be an umbrella term which can refer to almost diametrically opposed ideologies. The biggest split is between those who value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_liberty" target="_blank">Negative liberty</a> (heuristic: 'the freedom to fuck people over without constraints'), and those who value <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_liberty" target="_blank">Positive liberty</a> ('the freedom to not be fucked over', and to achieve one's personal will). Generally speaking, those two camps are referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_liberalism" target="_blank">classical liberals</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_liberalism" target="_blank">social liberals</a> respectively. However, despite both being liberal ideologies, the two can often disagree more than they can agree.</p>
<p>For example - take something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dakota_Access_Pipeline" target="_blank">Standing Rock</a>. A classical liberal might argue that Dakota Access should have the liberty to build it's pipeline. However, a social liberal might argue the opposite - that the pipeline will damage the liberty of the residents. Hence classical liberals tend to oppose state intervention, whereas social liberals are much less scared of it.</p>
<p>[A quick interjection: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressivism" target="_blank">Progressivism</a> states that advancements in technology, science, etc - but, most importantly, social justice - are key to increasing human happiness. It's not really a true political ideology due to it's vagueness, but it's in opposition to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactionary" target="_blank">Reactionary politics</a>, which favour a return to the past, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservatism" target="_blank">Conservatism</a>, which generally defines itself by opposition to change. I only realised once I finished this post that I hadn't defined these, and I couldn't slot it in anywhere else, but it's kinda important to know.]</p>
<p>Both ideologies of classical liberalism and socialism liberalism, however, are united in their defense of the economic system of Capitalism. I could write for a long time about this, but to cut a long story short: Socialism, as an umbrella of political ideologies (like liberalism), was born from Liberalism and considers itself to be more dedicated to human emancipation from suffering by virtue of opposing Capitalism, which Socialists see as exploitative. Hence some Socialists consider Liberals of every flavour to be anti-progressive, since they support Capitalism. Some liberals (especially some classical liberals, who tend to ally more with the Right wing) may in turn suggest that Socialists are anti-progressive - but in general terms their objection is more the bog standard 'nice in theory not in practice' tedium rather than because they perceive Socialism (which, again, is extremely broad - ranging from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libertarian_socialism" target="_blank">Libertarian Socialism</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism" target="_blank">Marxism-Leninism</a>, aka Stalinism) as not Progressive. </p>
<p>As such, in this sense, we can <em>generally</em> say that <strong>all liberals consider themselves progressive, but not all progressives consider themselves liberal</strong>. </p>
<p>Specifically with respect to Clinton, I think she was just expressing a personal preference or personal definition more than actually adhering to either of these ideologies.</p>
<p>Let me know if you have any further questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glad to see some discussion on this. As an Australian living in the US, I'm constantly having to explain it when I'm talking about politics and happen to mention that the Liberal Party (in Australia) is actually the most conservative/right wing of the major parties. In the US, people think &quot;liberal = progressive or left wing&quot;, but it's not that simple.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party in Australia is called that way because they are <em>economically</em> liberal. They are laissez faire capitalists, believing in open and free markets and minimal government intervention in business. The party who leans towards lower taxes, less red tape and restrictions on companies etc. Freedom from government ... that sort of thing. This aligns them more with the Republicans in the US. But that's liberalism to us, or rather, economic liberalism. But they aren't socially liberal. They are conservatives on that front.</p>
<p>I'm constantly having to intersperse comments like &quot;the Liberal Party, <em>which by the way is conservative</em>&quot;. This comes up often in the usual debate over gun control, in which it is noted that the Prime Minister that enacted Australia's current gun laws was &quot;Prime Minister Howard of the Liberal Party&quot;. People in America go &quot;well duh, of course liberals would support such a thing&quot;. No, the Liberals are conservative and PM Howard was one of our most conservative prime ministers ever.</p>
<p>A quick Google suggests that Canada is similar to the US, in that the incumbent Liberal Party is a socially liberal and economically progressive one. The equivalent in Australia would actually be the Labor Party ... and the Liberal Party would be their opponents.</p>
<p>TLDR: the meaning of the word liberal has been twisted in the US and doesn't mean the same thing as in (some) other places. You're better off using 'progressive' instead if you want to talk about the kind of socially progressive policies espoused by 'liberals' in the US.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a ton of great answers here explaining the philosophical and historical definitions, but most are ignoring one important aspect: barely anyone in the general population (in the US) uses those definitions.</p>
<p>Back in the 2000s, &quot;liberal&quot; and &quot;progressive&quot; were used interchangeably by most people, with most people defining those concepts based on political party lines. &quot;Liberals/progressives&quot; were Democrats while &quot;Conservatives&quot; where Republicans in the eyes of the common man (&quot;moderates&quot; were simply those that had views from both parties nearly 50/50). It was really that simple, though very inaccurate.</p>
<p>Why has that changed? Well, because Bernie Sanders ran on a platform further left than Hillary. At his rallies Bernie said that Hillary shouldn't consider herself a progressive due to her relatively moderate views. Of course, Hillary and her supporters disregarded this as a frivolous attack.</p>
<p>Now, the Democratic party is somewhat split and undergoing change (just as the Republican party is). Bernie supporters, self-proclaimed &quot;progressives&quot;, see the term Liberal as too far right, as a representation of the Democratic establishment (and everything wrong with it in their eyes). Hillary supporters still see the two terms as interchangeable, just as Hillary did.</p>
<p>This is why &quot;Liberals&quot; are willing to call themselves as Progressive while &quot;Progressives&quot; usually reject the term Liberal.</p>
<p>Again, other people explained the philosophical definitions perfectly, but this is how I see the dynamic in the US. You should go back to your friends and see which ones voted for who during the primaries, because I'll bet that the dynamic above applies to your social group.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're not actually meaningful descriptions, in the context of Western politics. They're labels for party affiliation, rather than being actual descriptions of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberalism" target="_blank">philosophical position</a>. The reason Hillary eschews the term liberal is because in the 1970s, a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbionese_Liberation_Army" target="_blank">violent</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weather_Underground" target="_blank">radicals</a> took the label and applied it to themselves, making it very, VERY unpopular with people who are now in their 60's and over.
Really, all domestic policies devolve into two simple questions: 1) Should the government intervene to address <issue X>. 2) If so, how? Issue X can be any controversial domestic question: Gun violence, poverty, abortion, internet peering policy, growing sugar, terrorism, flag burning, import competition, drug abuse...</p>
<p>Each party's position (of whether to intervene) will change radically, depending on the issue, and they'll even trade positions over time. That's how the Democratic party has found themselves defending free-trade policies passed by mostly Republican votes. At the time, it was a bipartisan bill which encountered most of its opposition from Labor Unions, a group which aligns itself with Democrats.</p>
<p>Political parties are brands, and their job isn't to be philosophically consistent, their job is to appeal to voters, while differentiating themselves from the other brand(s).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
