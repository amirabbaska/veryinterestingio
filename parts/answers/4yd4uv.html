		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two basic reasons. Cockroaches have a slightly rounded and greasy back, and a flat body that helps them squeeze and hide in narrow cracks and crevices. Their long legs give them a high center of gravity, meaning they carry most of their weight around their backs. When a cockroach is dying of old age, its high center of gravity pulls its back toward the floor, and its rounded back and weakened muscles prevent it from righting itself, particularly on smooth surfaces.</p>
<p>The insecticides we use to kill roaches can have the same effect. Most of these insecticides are neurotoxins â€“ poisons that can trigger tremors and muscle spasms, eventually causing the cockroach to flip on its back. A healthy cockroach can easily right itself, but the tremors, lack of muscle coordination and, again, the rounded back and high center of gravity cause the intoxicated cockroach to get stuck that way.

<p>The essence is the legs spasm when a cockroach dies, flipping them over.  This has nothing to do with fluid pressure, as many will no doubt say, because many are under the false impression that insects use hydraulic pressure to power limb movement.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the causes for becoming upsidedown described by others, there is also the sampling bias: a cockroach that can still walk will head for shelter, so even if it dies sheltered and rightway-up, you wont see it (nor will the cleaners), and it will be eaten by ants, etc. before its body is revealed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
