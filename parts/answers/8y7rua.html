		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So let’s scrap the classic image most people have of electricity where you have an electron source pushing out electrons towards a positive pole. Instead, let’s think of this like gravity and water. Your negative source is at the top of a hill, and the positive sink is at the bottom. If you dump a bunch of water on top of the hill, the water doesn’t just flow straight down the hill to the bottom, it flows in all directions, but most of it goes straight down to the hole as gravity <strong>pulls</strong> the water down. In reality the positive pole sends out a field, similar to a magnet, that pulls on the electrons in the source, pulling them towards the positive terminal. As the electrons are pulled, there are infinitely many paths they can take, but each path has its own resistance. Also, because these paths are different but leave and arrive at the same place, they are called parallel and follow an important law of circuits. Namely that the amount of current (electrons) flowing through an individual branch of a parallel circuit is inversely proportional to the resistance of that branch. So the electricity actually is moving through all the paths, because the field generated by the positive source pulls along all the paths, but the amount going through the higher resistance paths is so small we essentially ignore it because of the law mentioned above. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't follow the shortest path. It follows all paths which create a circuit.  The amount in any path is determined by the resistance of that path. If there are two paths and they have equal resistance,  then half the current flows in each. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like water, if theres a bend in a river and we dig out a canal, the waters going to move through both, but since the canal is the shorter path, it will tend to have more water moving through it over time, even if both paths flow at the same rate.</p>
<p>The water doesn't <em>choose</em> to go down either path, it just gets pushed down one randomly, but at a larger scale we can observe more water moving through one path than the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Current is looking to follow the path of <em>least resistance</em>. The 'shorter' path is only assumed to be the path of least resistance when let's say comparing two identical conductors with one being shorter than the other.  The current is not going to choose which one though, it's going to choose all conductors.   </p>
<p>Pretend like you have a bucket of water with small tubes connected to it to drain the water. Let's say there are 5 tubes all of varying sizes. When the water aka metaphorical current is draining, it's not using some physical means to assess which is the easiest path, it's just draining through all of the tubes at once, it just so happens the largest tubes are going to drain the most water or metaphorically have the most current.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best analogy I can come up with is that you'd have to compare electrons to people that stink very badly. Throw them in a room and they all want to get away from each other as quickly as possible. Now image another room with people who smell great but they can't actually move around so their smell just radiates out. Now imagine all these people are put in a maze at the start and your good smelling people are at the finish. As you start this scenario everybody starts running away from each other frantically. But some people will get stopped  by dead ends. People will in general tend to stay a certain distance away form each other so that they are hardly bothered by the smell. So you will have some very few people occupying all the dead ends. People will not tend to go in there because it just smells and there is no movement. The only direction to go in where there is a constant lack of bad smell is through the path where people are going to the finish. Similar to how water would move if you'd pump it in a maze. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
