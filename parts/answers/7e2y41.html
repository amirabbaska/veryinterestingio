<p>The link between the Earth's rotation and the number of big earthquakes was unclear,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Beyond the clickbait, there's your needle in the haystack.  The Earth's rotation has been declining progressively since its formation due to the persistent influence of the tides, the wind, and the Moon.  That is a glacially slow process involving more than 4 billion years.  That is the scale of geological time involved.  According to the scant details in the article, the research only looks at seismic events since 1900.  That is less than the blink of an eye in the proper context.  Paint me skeptical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Earth doesn't rotate at constant speed. Each day has a different duration depending on multiple factors. Here's the official site, and a table of average lenght of day (LOD) per year, since 1623. Before 1955 those figures were estimates; since 1955 the data come from atomic clocks:</p>

<p>The US Geological Survey has a complete database of earthquakes. It's possible to build and download customized tables of earthquakes according to magnitude, location, and date:</p>

<p>Bilham and Bendick authored a paper: &quot;Do weak global stresses synchronize earthquakes?&quot; which was published by the Geophysical Research Letters, August 2017:</p>
<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL074934/abstract" target="_blank">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL074934/abstract</a></p>
<p>Here's the abstract of Bilham's presentation at the GSA Annual meeting, October 2017:</p>
<p><a href="https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017AM/webprogram/Paper300667.html" target="_blank">https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017AM/webprogram/Paper300667.html</a></p>
<p>At the GSA presentation, as well as in several interviews with the meedia, Bilham claims:
1) Increases in the annual number of strong earthquakes (maginute 7 or more) coincide with a slowing down in the rotation velocity of the Earth;
2) Periods of high seismicity are preceded by deceleration episodes by 5-6 years.
3) In periods of high seismicity, there are between 25 to 30 intense earthquakes a year; the rest of the time the average figure is around 15.
4) The Earth is currently in a deceleration episode that began in 2011; therefore a period of high global seismicity of at least five years is expected.</p>
<p>By plotting the data obtained from IERS and USGS, we can test his assertions. What do we get?
1) Nothing. No correlation at all.
2) Nothing. No such thing.
3) From 1900 to 2016, the average number of major earthquakes in a year was 11.4, and the maximum was 24.
4) There was no deceleration episode that began in 2011.</p>
<p>Conclusions:</p>
<p>In their original paper, Bilham and Bendick were very cautious about their methods and findings. They even presented it as a question: &quot;Do weak global stresses synchronize earthquakes?&quot;. In her webpage, Prof. Bendick acknowledges: &quot;I am working on temporal patterns in the global earthquake catalog, especially ones suggestive of earthquake cycle synchronization and entrainment. This is brand-new work, and we have lots to do on it!&quot;.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Prof. Bilham has completely distorted the original paper's methods and findings, makes countless mistakes, and speaks in terms of absolute certainty. His assertions don't pass a basic test of scientific rigor. And his tone confims what his colleagues in India said of him: &quot;He's kind of a scaremonger&quot;.</p>
<p>This is a terrible disservice to science and society.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I really wish these articles linked the actual papers they talk about.</p>
<p><a href="https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017AM/webprogram/Paper300667.html" target="_blank">https://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2017AM/webprogram/Paper300667.html</a></p>
<p>Why does it seem like junk science? They literally explain their theory in abstract.</p>
<p>Roger Bilham apparently has an insane amount of citations to his name (top25 in seismology in the world) so it seems he might be of the credible kind.</p>
<p><a href="https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=fr&user=ha3PY_0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works" target="_blank">https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=fr&user=ha3PY_0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works</a></p>
<p>So yes, I would say it's NOT junk science. Now is the theory valid or close to what really happens? We'll have to wait for some papers to be published that address that question. Anyway it made a prediction, which can be verified in the next few years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earthquakes do in fact affect the rotation of the planet.  They 2004 earthquake in Indonesia speed up the rotation of the Earth by making it slightly more compact.</p>
<p>Earthquakes are themselves they result of plate motion that is affected by magma flows and, to a much lesser extent, tidal waves from the moon and Sun, which tidal waves do have to do with the rotation of the Earth since it is not yet totally locked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
