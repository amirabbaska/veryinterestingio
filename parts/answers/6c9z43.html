		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If there's an s next to it, I believe that is referring to the isentropic process. When there is no s, entropy changes (usually goes up). Look at the lines with &quot;Xs&quot; on the end of them. They should be vertical on the T-S diagram. This shows no entropy change. It might help to compare an actual to a theoretical cycle. S goes straight up while no s goes up and to the right (usually). </p>
<p>Edit: changed isotropic to isentropic</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taking a thermodynamics course right now, it indicates the process from state 4 to 5s was isentropic (s for entropy). Check in some T-s diagrams and you'll see.</p>
<p>In contrast, actual processes are not isentropic, and are indicated as 5a (a for actual). These curve towards higher entropy, again see a T-s diagram of a process to see what I mean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What these two have said is correct. The s denotes a theoretical state the working fluid came to via a theoretical isentropic process. This is usually in cases in which we assume the ideal machine model, in which the device  (turbine, compressor, pump) is adiabatic and reversible, and thus isentropic. In reality, friction and heat transfer (irreversibilities) occur in the device, and so the machine is not isentropic, and would put the working fluid through a process that would bring it to a different state (sometimes this state will have an &quot;a&quot; subscript, for &quot;actual&quot;). As previously stated, the entropy will increase across the device. When analyzing these devices, we often calculate the isentropic efficiency of the device, which compares the actual performance of the device to the theoretical isentropic performance of the device. Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first we need to define entropy. Entropy is a measure of the chaos of a system. It's rooted in the second law of thermodynamics, which essentially states that thermal energy cannot transfer from a lower temperature substance to a higher temperature substance. </p>
<p>When we have thermal reactions in a compressor or turbine, or throttling valve, we're going to expect some inefficiencies. Some energy is going to be irrecoverable, so we're going to need to do more work. The s in the diagrams showcase this inefficiency, and demonstrate how the actual, real world p v cycles will look. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The s denotes the state that would exist if there was no change in entropy (an isentropic process). Typically this is calculated first using thermodynamic tables and formulas and then the actual state is calculated using the isentropic efficiency of the component through which the process is happening </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
