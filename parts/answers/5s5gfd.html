		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I think other explanations are neglecting to mention is the change in machine learning.  Automation has been a thing for a very long time, but computers have not been powerful enough, and we haven't yet had the methods to <em>teach</em> computers to do tasks.  <em>That</em> is what is so different about automation today.</p>
<p>Before machine learning techniques were implemented, automation was very limited.  You tell a robot arm to go to <em>this</em> location, execute <em>this</em> command (like close the grabbing arm), then go to <em>this</em> location and do <em>this</em> command.  If the part the machine is supposed to be grabbing is out of position, the robot doesn't know or care.  It executes its command regardless, which means it might fail to grab the part, or grab it the wrong way and crush it, or drop it in a position on the other end that jams the entire assembly line.  For that reason, every step of the process had to be very precise.  Human workers are usually employed to check the parts and align them correctly for the robots to function properly.  It's not a very glamorous job, but it's still a job.</p>
<p>Then, we started making robots smart enough to recognize simple changes in position with cameras and settings so that a robot could take the place of a human fixing the alignment of parts.  That takes a lot of computing, because it takes recognizing that the part is out of place, then computing the changes made to put it into place, how to execute that, and then doing it.  That's not easy for a simple robot, but our technology has advanced.  Suddenly, even just standing at the assembly line realigning parts isn't a guaranteed job.</p>
<p>Then we figured out true machine learning, where we can teach robots to do complex tasks.  This requires more intricate, complicated computer networks because it isn't very efficient.  The robot has to &quot;think&quot; about all of the inputs and all of the past inputs to make a decision, which requires a lot of computing power and a lot of memory to store the data of past actions.  It also takes a lot of complicated coding to tell the computer how to do all that.  Those things are all relatively new.  Our computers haven't been sophisticated enough to handle that until recently, and computer memory is getting much faster and bigger to store the data required to do it.</p>
<p>Think about automated driving.  You can't just tell a car to turn left <em>here</em> and turn right <em>here</em>.  It has to react to pedestrians and cyclists in the road, it has to react to drivers doing the wrong thing, changing traffic lights, changing traffic patters, detours, all the actions of all the cars around it.  That's a <em>lot</em> of data to process, and there's no simple formula to tell the car what to do.  Every situation is different, every situation needs a decision instead of a command.  The ability to do that didn't exist a decade ago, or at the very least, it wasn't commercially available.  Now it is.</p>
<p>Now you really don't need <em>any</em> humans on the assembly line, except one technician to service the robot.  Humans don't fix the mistakes made by the robots, they fix the robots so they don't make the same mistakes.  Those jobs are gone.</p>
<p>And with machine learning, we can teach computers not only to act in complex ways, but also <em>to create new things</em>.  Computers are now composing music, and it's not even bad.  It's not Mozart, but it's not bad.  We have computers that can take big sets of data and output the next step in manufacturing.  Need a new car design?  Used to be you needed a guy to think up a concept car, some more guys to check the aerodynamic efficiency, some guys to consider the market and what people are interested in buying, some guys to custom build a concept model for review, then custom build a full scale concept...  Now you can have one guy feed a computer an Excel spreadsheet with sales on every car for the last ten years, and you don't even need 3D models of those cars, you <em>don't even need to Google image search them</em>, you just tell the computer to do it and it does, and builds its own 3D models.  Then the computer automatically compares trends and looks at numbers and sales and what was popular and spits out a design for you, which you can then feed into a 3D printer that builds the scale model, then feed some instructions into an assembly line that doesn't need to be told how to custom make this car, it just figures it out and makes it.</p>
<p><em>That</em> is what's different about automation these days.  Tasks that were once considered far too complicated or delicate for computers to figure out are routinely done by computers these days, or getting very close to it.  We once believed that humans with our infinite, <em>living</em> creativity would always be solely capable of coming up with new, innovative ideas, but computers can do that now, too.</p>
<p>It certainly hasn't been a fast process, we've been automating for generations now, but there's always been other things to fall back on that computers and automation couldn't handle, like driving a truck or flying a plane for the military.  Turns out, computers are taking over those jobs.  The only jobs left are menial labor, and those jobs either don't really exist because mining coal is terrible for the environment, so we stopped, or no one is willing to take the job because it's too physically demanding.  And service jobs (retail, waiting tables, etc.) but those don't pay enough.</p>
<p>The only real jobs left are super technical jobs that require years of formal education and probably more years of experience in the field (like, ironically, designing better robots).  The aging population doesn't have time, money, or inclination to get those skills, which has made unemployment so much of a contentious issue.</p>
<p>Edit: &quot;But we've had this technology for decades!&quot; But it hasn't been commercially available. We haven't been using it to automate jobs like we are now.</p>
<p>&quot;This is a hyperbolic vision of the future of automation!&quot; On the one hand, yes. I did that deliberately to emphasize how changing technology is affecting the economy. On the other hand, Trump was elected on promises of employment. The problem is real. And even a few years ago self driving cars were still thought to be pipe dreams and no one was considering their impact on the economy. Now they're not even widespread and we're already talking about how they'll devastate trucking jobs. Automation isn't evil, it's inevitable. I don't think it's bad, but you can't deny that it's happening.</p>
<p>Edit^2 : I'm not saying machine learning advances are the sole reason. Other people have brought up the aging factories taking the opportunity to replace old equipment with better technology that has already existed, and I think that contributes as well. At time of writing I had not seen any answers adequately delving into machine learning, though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a medium sized, family owned company. The same family has owned it for over 50 years, the founder still comes into work almost every day, that sort of thing. Really good people who really know their industry. </p>
<p>Our product has always been made with <em>machines</em>, and while the industry has been slowly moving towards automation as technology has advanced, it didn't change the fact that these machines are huge, heavy, and expensive (millions of dollars with little to no automation). Not the kind of thing you could just replace. You get good crews, you make improvements where you can, but you still have to have five or six guys running each machine, and since everyone in the industry is doing the same, you can compete just fine. </p>
<p>Now the last 10-15 years or so, that has started to change. These big, expensive machines are getting older, and they are breaking. When they break, an arms race of sorts starts to emerge. One company will buy a new incredibly fast machine that is extremely automated. One or two guys run the whole thing that six used to, and they still output twice as much as the old machines. A couple companies do that, and their labor rates drop like a rock. They charge less. Now the next time something gets to be even slightly screwy, EVERYONE just wants to replace it with one of these fast, super efficient machines. It becomes a cycle. Your competitors are getting faster and more automated, so you have to as well. </p>
<p>Now back to the company I work for. We are very much behind the times. Being the family owned, good natured people that that the owners are, they have hesitated to modernize and put people out of work. Sure, we have a few new machines for additions and new product lines, but we are also still using machines they bought 50 years ago and along the way. However, it is getting to expensive for them to run those anymore. Our competitors, and even other product lines in our own company can run the product for half the price! So while they have been squeezing every ounce of life out of those old machines, there just isn't anything that can be done. When we sell product made on those machines, we effectively break even. It keeps the crews employed, but we don't make any money. We make money off of the automated operations. As time continues, and people retire or quit, or the machines just beak, we will shut them down for good. If that doesn't happen in the next five years, we will probably be losing money on those machines, so we will be forced to shut them down and find other work for those employees. </p>
<p>The point of my little anecdote is that we are at a tipping point. It's not just big automotive companies or high-tech manufacturers that have begun automating, it's the companies that make commodity products, like boxes (which is what we do). There is probably a box plant in every city and town in this country. Thousands of them. They all will either be extremely automated, or they will close their doors in the coming years. The pressure from the larger companies has made the midsized companies automate (my company), and in turn, we will make the small companies go the same route to compete and keep up. Any that can't afford to simply won't make a profit and will go under or get bought out for pennies on the dollar of what they were worth in their prime. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are right that there has been a general push toward automation particularly since the industrial revolution. In general this has improved quality of life. It is also true that since them there have been people worried about what automation was going to do to jobs, and jobs adapted.</p>
<p>There does seem to be a difference in what is happening now in both quality and quantity. In terms of quantity, the speed with which individual technology is threatening to wipe out huge swaths of the labor market is basically unprecedented. The breadth the kinds of automation that is quickly becoming available is as exciting as it is frightening  (computers are already writing short journalism pieces, driving cars, trading stocks, assisting surgery, etc.) The idea that &quot;computers will help us do the lifting but humans are always goimg to need to do the thinking&quot; is looking more and more naive.</p>
<p>Perhaps most importantly, the gap in skills necessary to take the &quot;next job&quot; is growing. It is easier to teah a former sewer to now operate a bobin on a loom than it is to teach a former lomghaul trucker how to be a coder programming that truck. This is causing fear of a thinning out between the highly skilled and the low wage worker.</p>
<p>Or 50 years from now we could be looking back on this moment as the turning point toward a golden age in humanity. Telling the future is hard.</p>
<p>Edit: this got a lot bigger than expected. So to respond to a few comments.</p>
<p>1) this isn't prescriptive, just descriptive. I don't advocate &quot;holding back progress to save jobs.&quot; This is just a description of why people are concerned. It is easy to wave ones hands and say &quot;well, yeah, some people will be hurt and they'll just have to get with the program,&quot; but that ignores the social and political influence that that hurt and fear have.</p>
<p>2) i did not mean to minimize the huge disruption that was the industrial revolution. As a commenter pointed out, you had about 25% of the country change jobs (using the responders figure) and living location in about 3 decades. It is hard to tell if automation will have that big an effect. But if you are looking at 2050, it is very possible that we will have automation solutions for every current job that involves driving, fast food, the supermarket floor, manufacturing, increasingly detailed physical manipulations, and cooking as well as increasingly brain-intensive processes like banking, surgery, writing, accounting, etc. It is really hard to tell what will catch on and what won't. It will also be interesting to see if remote work will do anything to change the past century's flight to the city or not. </p>
<p>3.) As pointed out, this tech also has an enabling effect. Cafe press let everyome be a tshirt manufacturer, square space lets people gett simple websites up. 3d printing could drastically lower the bar in small scale prototyping and botique manufacturing.</p>
<p>4) Basic Income is one solution people go to, greater socialistic tendancies is another (and related to the first). That's possible. It's also possible that the next wave of jobs we haven't dreamed about is coming. Schools in 10 years could be teaching aduino programming in middle school and graduating students who have to take 1 foriegn language and 1 computer language as a basic requirement. Girl scouts of 2050 might be able to take a flavor profile and custom build your personal cookie delivered by drones (though if there is one thing we've learned, its that the flying car is never gonna happen).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Controls engineer here (the guy programming this stuff). </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It got more flexible, so now it's cheaper to change a machine from making product A to making product B. If you were making small batches, changing products annually, or just juggling orders for different parts and you spent most of your time converting your production line, you would automate less. Now your machine automatically adjusts to handle a range of products with inexpensive change parts and actuators. Also, touch screen controls can be reconfigured way easier than buttons and dials. Think fun size candy bars vs regular or king size and Snickers vs Payday; you don't want a dozen different machines that only handle one thing, you want an easily adjusted machine that does all of them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It got faster. High end automation is working in single digit microsecond reaction times and tens of microseconds for full program/network cycles completely deterministically. Back to candy, if you need 10 lines to fill the world supply of Snickers, that's a bit pricy compared to two that can fill the world supply of Snickers and Payday and have time to cover 100 Grand too.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Motion is way better. CNC is fine and all for hard coding a path for a tool, but multiple levels of electronic camming with profiles calculated on the fly is normal now. Robotics is easy now and when you add machine vision, it replaces anyone that ever picked stuff up on a production line. The tools and program functions to do this stuff exist and are easy and flexible to use (on some automation platforms).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Machine vision exists now. Cameras are better and the software you use to program them is better and more versatile. We aren't checking if the print is good enough for OCR or finding where a pancake is on a conveyor anymore. We're making complex visual analysis. Self driving is whole other level with mixed vision and fucking L<del>A</del><em>I</em>DAR.</p>
</li>
<li>It costs less now. To the point there are clear ROI for all but the most complex, low-skill work. I see people doing things they think are just too hard or expensive to automate (driving is a good analogy here) all the time... While I install and test their replacement that will pay for itself in 6 months. </li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, the limit to automating everything is time to figure out and write the program; mechanically, humans are pretty easy to replace and processor speeds are no object.</p>
<p>EDIT: *LIDAR, I'm in machine/process automation, not self driving or defense. I just assumed they replaced &quot;radio&quot; with &quot;laser&quot;, but apparently it's &quot;light&quot;, resulting in LIDAR instead of LADAR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The number of things you can automate is drastically growing, since we are no longer limited to automate the &quot;muscle&quot;, we are now starting to automate the &quot;brain&quot;.</p>
<p>In the past we had machines and robots already, but those were limited to precisely repeating tasks. All their movement was either pre-programmed or hardwired into the mechanics. If something unexpected happened, they couldn't react, they had no sensors or cameras that could tell them what is going on or ways to react to it. So you always needed humans around to monitor them and do the tasks that the machines couldn't do. If you look at those &quot;How stuff is made&quot; videos from the 80s you always see humans around the machine, as there are always steps in the production that the machine can't do.</p>
<p>This is changing now. Better cameras, sensors and AI means that we can now automate those last steps that still required humans. The robots can now <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPTd8XDZOEk" target="_blank">react dynamically and are no longer required to follow a hardcoded track</a>. That kind of use is however still limited to the factory and not quite that revolutionary.</p>
<p>Where it is starting to become really interesting is outside the factories. Most obvious this is with self-driving cars. If you wanted to automate transportation in the past, you could, but you had to lay train tracks and have big control centers regulating it all. Today you can just take a car and have it drive itself. You do not need to change the environment to suit the machine, you can put the machine into a human environment and it can work it's way around. This open up a lot of areas to automation that historically didn't allow it, since there were no robots flexible and safe enough to handle those environments.</p>
<p>It also doesn't just stop with robots, a lot of jobs are already digital in nature, humans entering data into the computer and such, all of those jobs are open for grabs by AI, which has made rapid progress in the last few years and started to match human level performance in a lot of tasks. AI might still be a few decades away from passing the Turing test, but for a lot of jobs you don't need something indistinguishable from a human, but something that is good enough for the specific tasks and AI starts to be getting there.</p>
<p>All that said, it's worth keeping in mind that such revolutions in the job market don't happen overnight. A technology that has been demonstrated in the lab or on a trade show might still take decades until it is common place in every factory and often it might require to build a new factory from scratch to take full advantage of the automation that is already possible. When you look at newly build factory lines, such as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCgnWqoP4MM" target="_blank">Steam Controller</a> or what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_lfxPI5ObM" target="_blank">Tesla is doing</a> you will see a lot more automation than in factories that have been around for decades.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> We are approaching a point where the machine can do almost all tasks just as good or better than a human. Thus making the human unneeded on the job market.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
