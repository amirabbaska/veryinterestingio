		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The charge of individual particles is a fundamental property of the particle.  All fundamental particles have charges that are multiples of 1/3rd the elementary charge unit, which is the same amount of charge an electron or proton have.  Insofar as can be determined, this value never changes, attempts to change it change the particle not the charge, and all particles of the same type have the same charge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>But in regards to the positive or negative particles that determine charge, what determines <em>their</em> charge?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As far as we are currently aware, nothing.  Charge is an intrinsic property of the particle, with no separate cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right now, the best explanation for any fundamental property of particles is unknown; particles simply possess certain characteristics. However, string theory takes our current knowledge a step forward by proposing that particles are actually very small &quot;strings,&quot; and the way that each string vibrates, much like a vibrating guitar string and its associated note, determines the properties of the particle/string. String vibration, and hence properties, can be influenced by their passage through very small curled up extra-dimensions. String theory is very difficult to prove, and without being technical, is too broad and the math too difficult to solve at the moment, but appears to do a good job of describing physics at a fundamental level. Here's a link to some light reading from Brian Greene, a well-known authority on the subject: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/theory-of-everything.html" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/physics/theory-of-everything.html</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im certainly not an expert on the subject, but it surprises me nobody has mentioned quarks yet. The two most common types of quarks (as in, found in protons and neutrons), have either a down spin or an up spin. A proton has two ups and one down, a neutron has one up and two downs. A quark with an up spin gives 2/3 of a charge, a down quark takes 1/3. </p>
<p>Why an electron has - 1 charge, i do not know. </p>
<p>The difference between the two charges is as far as i know the direction of the electromagnetic flow.</p>
<p>Edit: please supplement or correct me, if you can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhere I recently saw or heard or read a scientist marveling at how difficult it is to explain some of these fundamental properties of the universe. We give them names like &quot;charge&quot; and &quot;energy&quot; and &quot;mass,&quot; we do math involving them, we use them to make accurate predictions about how objects will behave, but then you ask someone who can do all this, &quot;What is mass, exactly?&quot; And suddenly it becomes very hard to explain.  Well, it's this property of matter that... Uh... Makes it hard to push things around...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
