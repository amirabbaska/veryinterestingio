		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The general argument is that regulations like this make it more difficult for someone to open or run a new business or plant, so they are less likely to build that.  Those new establishments would have employed people, so by discouraging people from starting these establishments, they are in essence preventing jobs from being created.  You'll see similar thinking applied when someone argues against any regulation.  </p>
<p>If I can inject my own opinion, this argument makes more sense if you're already not inclined to care about the environment.  We could encourage the creation of jobs in other, non-environmentally damaging, areas by investing in solar, but it's easier to say &quot;fuck nature.&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is the <a href="https://www.osmre.gov/programs/rcm/streamprotectionrule.shtm" target="_blank">actual rule</a>.</p>
<p>In layman's terms, what the rule does is give a federal regulatory body authority to deny a mining operations permit if they believe the mining operations will effect the natural habitat of a stream.</p>
<p>The primary criticism of the rule is that it's purposefully broad and vague, and thus, gives regulators the ability to deny permits for almost any coal mining operation and makes it more costly to apply for coal mining permits.  Also, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Water_Act" target="_blank">Clean Water Act</a> already prohibits companies from dumping waste into streams and rivers.  Regulators already have the authority to shut down mining operations if they suspect there are Clean Water Act violations.  The functional effect of this rule would be to mire coal mining operations in a long, bureacratic money pit to pursue any new mining operations.  </p>
<p>It's worth noting that this rule was rushed through at the very end of Obama's presidency, less than a month before Trump took office.  It's so new it really hasn't even gone into effect yet.</p>
<p>Basically, it's a poor implementation of a good idea.  We don't want industry to dump waste into streams and rivers.  That's why we already have laws prohibiting it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I lived in WV as many coal mines were being shut down. It was an everyday occurrence for the mines to announce that a few hundred people had lost their jobs. When I moved away, [less than half the people] (<a href="https://secure.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-only-state-where-less-than-half-its-citizens-work-2015-01-13" target="_blank">https://secure.marketwatch.com/story/this-is-the-only-state-where-less-than-half-its-citizens-work-2015-01-13</a>) even had jobs. </p>
<p>I keep reading these posts that speak as though water is the only problem that needs solving in America, but many of these people need food and shelter. Many of these people would love to have a sense of self-worth as they work and would love to have something to do with their lives. Water certainly needs to be clean, but it's more complicated than it seems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you have two mines/factories/whatever that are otherwise identical,  but one needs to build pollution control facilities and pay pollution control staff,<br />
and the other company doesn't.   Which one can sell its product for a lower price? </p>
<p>If you ignore the external effects of the pollution,  healthcare and cleanup,  assuming those things get paid for,  then it is cheaper to not have regulations.   Even if you do pay for those things,  it can be other industries essentially subsidising the polluting one by paying a larger share of tax for cleanup. </p>
<p>Of course it's madness.  But if you think China is 'winning' by building hundred of coal generating stations a year and making so much airborne pollutants it is toxic,  then you think mimicking that will level the competitive playing field. China is understandably a bit bipolar on the issue,  with efforts to cut pollution but the need to meet energy demands of a wealthier population.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't.   Coal is largely expensive as a source of energy in the US compared to any other fossil fuel.  Some politicians thought that they could win an election by tricking people in coal mining country (who, by and large are not only suffering from low employment but some laid off coal miners are dealing with black lung) into thinking that jobs would come back to their area if regulations on coal mining were eased.  </p>
<p>If you were to drop all the regulations on coal mining, yes it would make coal more competitive but those regulations are there for a reason.  Coal is a dirty, dirty fuel source.<br />
And the jobs aren't coming back, because <a href="http://www.mining.com/study-shows-96-of-some-mining-jobs-can-be-automated/" target="_blank">coal mining is more automated</a> than it used to be.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
