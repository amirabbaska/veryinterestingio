		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So according to the wiki page, the national center for missing and exploited children estimates that 657 children have been saved due to the Amber alert system from 1996 to August 2013. </p>
<p>An Amber alert report from 2013 shows that of 196 alerts, involving 243 children, minus the 47 that were false or hoaxes, 95 % were recovered in 72 hours.</p>
<p>So, since no one can say for sure whether one particular call in tip was the definitive moment in recovery, I'm not really sure. </p>
<p>On the report there was a story where man spoke to a kidnapper and his victim, went home and saw the news story and called in their location, saving the young lady. So for sure 1/657....</p>
<p>Doesn't look very good when you put it like that huh? </p>
<p>Here's my sources </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've heard from several sources that they're very nearly worthless, and are sometimes harmful (it's possible for the abductor to benefit from the information in the alert).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/blog/post/after-20-years-of-amber-alerts-are-they-worth-it" target="_blank">This researcher</a> looked at over 1500 cases and says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]n my reading of the data, the number of children whose lives have been saved by AMBER Alert ranges from zero to something very close to zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically, in the vast majority of cases, the kid isn't actually in danger. Often it's that the dad took off with the kid, mom got mad and filled a report, or vice versa. The AMBER alert can end up exacerbating what started as a stupid domestic dispute, turning it into a traumatizing manhunt when the &quot;kidnapping&quot; parent panics. When the intention is to kill, it's usually already done within three hours, which is often well before the police ate even notified. Either way, these cases are being solved by regular police work.</p>
<p>The problem is that nobody wants to be the politician to suggest we're wasting money and resources on a program meant to find missing children, even though we unquestionably are.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't know about amber alerts, but for another type of mass notification: for a period of 4-5 years in the 80s they used to put pictures of abducted children on milk cartons. I think the majority of milk cartons in the country had these, or close to it, during this period. There is only one known success from this campaign, out of some billions of milk cartons printed.</p>
<p>Eventually some doctors complained that the cartons were scaring children unnecessarily and the campaign was stopped. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it depends on what you mean by &quot;effective&quot; - do you mean rate of recovery? Do you mean how effective are these mass notification systems purely as a system of getting a message out? Or how effective is Amber Alert in recovering people <em>compared to</em> other methods?</p>
<p>I am a 911 dispatcher and we have had to coordinate mass notifications at various times. These notifications used to be much more useful during the landline era when everyone still had a home phone; we could set an emergency notification to target a specific area and it would auto-dial all the residences there with a recorded message. It was effective in terms of getting information out quickly and directly. However, as cell phones became more and more prevalent and people stopped keeping landlines at home, these systems became increasingly less effective.</p>
<p>Now, our local county government has an opt-in service called &quot;AlertMe!&quot; which is part of the CENS (Community Emergency Notification System), where people can sign up with their cell phones for specific types of alerts and notifications including disaster messages (severe weather, fire, flooding) as well as local emergencies (police out in force looking for a suspect) or missing/endangered subjects (which can be missing youth, missing elderly, or other endangered persons).</p>
<p>Community opt-in services like these are only as effective as the community itself. If no one signs up for them, they won't be effective. So it can come down to how well the agencies involved advertise or spread the word about the systems.</p>
<p>I can say anecdotally that we have used mass notifications when dealing with missing/endangered citizens (usually either elderly/medically fragile, or people with severe mental disabilities) and have been able to find them thanks to someone calling in a sighting after getting a notification.</p>
<p>I can also say, as a private citizen, that I have gotten a handful of Amber Alert messages on my own cell phone and while I look at it I can't say I've ever really retained that much information or made any significant difference to my habits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
