<p>Tldr: starches have a structure that don't allow the absorption of water. Heat breaks down the structure, allowing water to be absorbed faster </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've seen some answers about why starch specifically requires hot water, which are likely correct as well, but I'll provide an explanation via thermodynamics. In general for anything like this it is all based on diffusion. Diffusion generally refers to the movement of matter from a high concentration to a low concentration, so if you have a lot of water molecules in one place (i.e. water in a bowl) next to a space that contains very few water molecules (i.e. a dry grain of rice floating in that water) the water molecules will be more likely to enter that space over time, this is due to entropy of mixing (I can go deeper into entropy upon request but I'll spare you here, basically it is a numerical measurement for the reason that things mix together).  This is why if you let even cold water close to freezing sit in a bowl with rice or beans it would eventually infiltrate them, but like you said it would just take a long time. Even cold atoms have energy, but that energy just makes them vibrate, not move with any kind of purpose, so the odds that they'll end up inside of the grain of rice are random.  Now the energy of the atoms increased with temperature, which makes them vibrate more, which means that they are that much more likely to enter the grain of rice. The thermodynamics probably compound with any chemical reason for the starch absorbing water as well.</p>
<p>TLDR: Hot things vibrate faster, faster vibrations increases the odds that each water molecule enters the rice over time. So hot water will enter the rice faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mentioned food all contain one compound: starch. Since its 'outer layer' is quite hard, it will take a while for the cold water to get through this tough barrier. Heat breaks down some starch compounds which allows the 'outer layer' to become something like a porous membrane. This allows the grain to absorb water faster.</p>

Edit: Clarified that starch is a compound. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to note. Beans and chickpeas are very difrerent from rice or any other grain.</p>
<p>With beans and chickpeas and lentils, the water has to penetrate the tough outer skin. Often, even with hot water, chickpeas and beans do not cook through (water is unable to go through the skin barrier).</p>
<p>A common technique used when cooking chickpeas (especially in Indian cooking where beans and chickpeas and lentils are key protein sources so are eaten every day) is to add baking soda which makes the water more alkaline and helps the moisture go through. Often, tea leaves or tea bags are added which being mildly acidic counteracts the alkilinity of baking soda and the food still ends up tasting good (and not bitter).</p>
<p>See this video recipe explaining this technique: <a href="https://youtu.be/IGtGx2fWz4Y" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/IGtGx2fWz4Y</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

You should watch &quot;good eats&quot; its a bit older now, was hosted by Alton Brown, the current host for iron chef america.  Good eats, however, is incredibly informative about food.  There is a cooking portion of the show, which visually demonstrates the lesson for the day.  I watch the entire series on YouTube, some dude called &quot;Rabe Shimpa&quot;  has every single episode on his channel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
