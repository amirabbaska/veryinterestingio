Evidence for this is based on the isotopes of xenon found at the site, which are known to be produced by nuclear fission.</p>

Carbon 14 and other cosmogenic nuclei, e.g., are formed continually via nuclear reactions as cosmic rays interact with the atmosphere.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear reactions happen all the time on earth, they're just so minute that it's like nothing is happening at all. However, what you're probably thinking of is a nuclear CHAIN reaction, which is the kind you find in a power plant or nuclear bomb. And that is when fission and/or fusion happens with a specific fuel to increase the amount of times fission/fusion happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
