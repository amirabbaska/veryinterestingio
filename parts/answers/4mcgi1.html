		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a photon with an energy greater twice the rest mass of an electron hits something (like an atomic nucleus), it can induce the creation of a positron-electron pair. This is the main mechanism of energy loss for very high energy gamma rays passing through matter.</p>
<p>However, this can't happen without the photon interacting with something else first, otherwise you could construct a reference frame where the photon doesn't have enough energy to do this.</p>
<p>edit: As I mentioned in a comment below, at extremely high energy densities you can start to get light interacting with itself and inducing pair creation, which can slow down <a href="http://klotza.blogspot.com/2016/05/the-speed-of-sound-in-light.html" target="_blank">the speed of sound through a photon gas</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and this is one of the fundamental principles or properties of the universe. Photons can convert into mass, and mass gets converted into photons, and importantly, this happens all the time.</p>
<p>This can occur via the creation of whole particle / anti-particle pairs, but also from the emission and absorption of photons from or into atoms / electron orbitals, which can also affect mass. Absorbing a photon can cause an increase in mass, and emitting one can cause a decrease.</p>
<p>Photons and mass are continually making exchanges, all the time, which is pretty cool.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mass and energy are just different ways of talking about the same thing in different contexts, they're like two different sides of the same coin. Mass is just a term for rest-energy. Photons have zero energy at rest because they're sort of a special case, so it seems weird that they can have zero mass but positive energy. However, consider that most of the mass of your body is just energy, not even rest-mass of elementary particles. The electrons in your body have rest-mass, that adds a few hundredths of a percent to the mass of your body. The quarks that make up your protons and neutrons, where you get most of your mass, have masses of less than 1% the mass of the proton or neutron. All the rest of the mass of those nuclear particles comes from energy, the kinetic energy of quarks, the energy of gluon fields, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
