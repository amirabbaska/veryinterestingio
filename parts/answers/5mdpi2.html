		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acne is predominantly triggered by hormonal imbalances. When you are stressed, your body produces excess stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol. </p>
<p>Just imagine your computer's available memory being your skin. In order for it to run smoothly, you don't want to clog it up by running a ton of unnecessary programs. In regular use, the computer does its job by allocating memory needed to run programs and allow you to multi-task. But if you try to render a 3D-model, while playing a game at its highest settings, while bitcoin mining, while aggressively compiling that stupid powerpoint with ugly wordart, all at the same time, you stress out your computer's memory. It has a harder time allocating/managing your memory resources, just like your immune system has a harder time managing the resources necessary to clear the acne-bacteria at its normal rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IANA biologist or doctor, but it is my understanding that stress reduces the effectiveness of the bodies immune system. Acne is caused by bacteria, and if your body is having a harder time fighting that bacteria then it will spread and get worse.</p>
<p>Your body does a whole lot of different things at the same time, but it also has the capacity to 'redirect resources' from things that aren't that important towards things that seem to be really important right now. Stress is usually a symptom of your body focusing on something, for example, you have been staying up late and spending all your free time studying for a really important exam. Your body has recognized that you aren't sleeping well, that you probably aren't eating well and that you are using your brain a lot. In response, your body has redirected resources from your immune system to your energy production system so that there is enough energy to keep your brain and body working while you aren't sleeping and eating properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
