		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leap years make up for the fact that a year is not exactly 365 days.</p>
<p>Having one every four years works if the year is 365.25 days long, which is almost right, but not quite.  If we had a leap day every 4 years, then after 400 years, we'd be off by about 3 days.  So we want to eliminate 3 leap years -- so the years 2100, 2200, and 2300 won't be leap years, though 2000 was.</p>
<p>So the rule is this: Years divisible by 400 are leaps years.  Years divisible by 100 but not by 400 are NOT leap years.  Years not divisible by 100 but divisible by 4 are leap years.  Years not divisible by 4 are not leap years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The purpose of a leap year is to make sure the calendar aligns with the time it takes for the earth to go around the sun.  It is not a nice round number.</p>
<p>I think it is 365.2425 days, roughly.</p>
<p>The standard 1 extra day every 4 years makes it 365.25 on average.</p>
<p>Removing a day every 100 years brings it back to 365.24</p>
<p>They also add an extra day back in once every 400 years to make it 365.2425</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly what the change from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar" target="_blank">Julian Calendar to the Gregorian Calendar in 1582</a> was meant to correct. Since Roman times a leap year was added every 4 years because the length of the year is just about 365 1/4 days... just under. It is just enough under (365.2425) that every 400 years, 3 extra days had been added.</p>
<p>To correct this, it was proposed that in century years that are not divisible by 4 (1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200,...) that no leap year would be added. </p>
<p>This small correction is enough to keep the calendar in check for about 4000 years. In fact, by skipping the year 4000 (and 8000, 12000, ...) leap years the calendar would be good for a long long long time. That is only a suggested fix that is not &quot;officially&quot; accepted, we will let the people in the 3900's worry about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A leap day every 4 years is not accurate enough. An astronomical year = 365.242188792 days.</p>
<pre><code>365 days/year
+0.25 (add 1 day every 4 years)
-0.01 (every 100 years, don't add the extra day)
+0.0025 (every 400 years, add the extra day anyway)
-0.00025 (every 4,000 years, don't add the extra day again)

<p>Close enough... for now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;tropical year&quot; or the time it takes the Earth to return to the same point in the seasons is 365.2421897 days long. So, obviously that's problematic, let's fix it.</p>
<p>Start off with regular leap years, that'll help some. Having a leap year every 4 years brings the average from 365 up to 365.25, already we're vastly closer, this is good. But we're still off a bit, only about 0.78% of a day per year but that'll add up to a full day over just a little more than a century.</p>
<p>But now we're too high instead of too low, so let's skip leap years sometimes. Hey, since 4 is divisible into 100 and 100 is around how often the calendar would slip a day then let's just skip leap years on years that are divisible by 100. Now that brings the average back down a tiny bit to 365.24.</p>
<p>But we can do even better, by adding back the leap year every 400 years we'll get 365.2425 days per year, on average.</p>
<p>And that leaves us a mere 0.3 thousandths of a year off from the actual value, meaning that it takes about 3 thousand years for the calendar date to slip by a full day. But by then we can figure out some other rule. These are the leap year rules for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar" target="_blank">gregorian calendar</a>, which was widely adopted around 400 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
