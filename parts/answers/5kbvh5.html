		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Voice actors. I was so shocked every time I saw &quot;turtle talk with crush&quot; I went there multiple times just because of how amazing it was thinking there was some massive soundboard. </p>
<p>BUT then one time I went and there was a guy that was not as good as the previous actors and it became totally oblivious.</p>
<p>Storm troopers, Vader, and Ren all probably have voice modifiers too that makes it easier to sound just like the movie.</p>
<p>Any of the scripted shows mostly use pre-recorded lines that are played back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ones walking around have pre-recorded phrases they can trigger. At meet and greets they most likely have someone else watching and listening that chooses what they say so they can be more interactive.</p>
<p>This is how the talking Mickey, Raz and the Mr. Potato Head work. Someone can see who is there and hear what they are saying and respond appropriately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>slightly</em> related, I hope you'll forgive me. 501st Vader's Fist member here. We use member developed voice changers (there are currently 3 or 4 accepted makes in circulation around the globe). We run them off a battery pack and have a mic. They usually have settings for static burst and amount of distortion. You can also get variants for popular characters, like Vader, or Fett.</p>
<p>Generally, ours will hide a bit of an accent, but you'll tell if someone's female right away or, say, from America or the UK (UK here).</p>
<p>They cost on average 100.00 GBP and are usually custom made, to order.</p>
<p>They are VERY convincing. People are always intimidated by us anyway but when we speak, it completes the illusion.</p>
<p>But it seems Disney do something else :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Unrelated to my answer, but those storm troopers are awesome! I had several &quot;run-ins&quot; with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
