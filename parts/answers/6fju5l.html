		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for an insurance company!</p>
<p>Basically, in Russia the volume of fraudulent claims is so high that insurers mandate or heavily incentivise dashcams to prevent fraud.  In western countries fraud still happens, but on a much lower scale relative to Russia.  At least in the UK (where I work), the claims most likely to be fraudulent are thefts, where the car is &quot;stolen&quot; but in reality has been hidden or sold to a chop shop, and dash cams do not help with these.  The other kind of serious fraud is done by organised gangs, who do induced accidents and staged accidents.  Staged accidents work fine on camera if done correctly.</p>
<p>An induced accident is where a fraudster tricks an innocent driver into hitting them.  Consider a line of four vehicles moving along in traffic.  in the line are three fraudsters, two at the front, one at the rear.  The victim is second from the back.  The driver at the very back overtakes the victim extremely closely, at high speed, maybe sounds their horn or something.  That distracts the victim, makes them look to the side.  The fraudsters in front of the victim sees them look to the side in their mirrors, and slam on their brakes.  The victim, unable to stop in time, hits the driver in front of them.  Then the overtaking fraudster and the fraudster at the very front drive off, leaving the one who was hit to take the victim's details.  He'll blame the driver at the very front for braking suddenly and then driving off, be very sympathetic, etc.  On a dashcam, this just looks like a driver failing to brake in time and hitting a driver who did brake in time. In fact it almost looks like the fraudster who got hit was the intended victim!  Still looks like a fault claim for the real victim's insurer.</p>
<p>That's not to say dashcams don't help with settling liability over otherwise genuine incidents where the drivers don't agree on what happened.  But in those situations the law of averages mentioned by whitby_ufo comes into play. That won't change unless dashcams hit a critical mass of commonality and drivers without cams become more expensive to insure because they lose more liability fights. For now though, <em>you've</em> got an incentive to get a dashcam, but they don't help your insurance settle the serious expensive fraud cases, so they don't care much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say insurance company A insures 1 million drivers and so does insurance company B. With a large enough number of incidents the overall average of at fault accidents is going to be about equal for each insurance company. Therefore, there's no real incentive for them because it doesn't generally make a difference in the grand scheme of things. It could make a huge difference in some individual cases here and there, but those will probably be about equal over time too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insurance companies can set percentages of blame for an accident. I live in BC, Canada and if you're (if I remember correct) above 30% at fault for an accident your rates will go up. This number is quite arbitrarily set during an investigation and typically has the effect that both parties in an accident will have their insurance rates go up.</p>
<p>I read somewhere (I'm going to look for it after this) that where dash cam's are used, the percentages are less likely to have both parties at fault enough for both their rates go up. This is lost revenue for insurance companies and part of why some insurance companies don't encourage dash cameras.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
