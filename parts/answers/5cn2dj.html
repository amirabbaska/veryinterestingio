		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually saw a talk about this from a current, foremost researcher in the social psychology of relationships, Eli Finkel from Northwestern University. His argument, with some evidence, was essentially that since around 1850, the psychological motives behind marriage mimic a progression &quot;up&quot; Maslow's hierarchy of needs:</p>
<p>At first, people married because it helped secure food and shelter, because companionship was a commodity.</p>
<p>Then people married because it secured social and group acceptance/support.</p>
<p>Then, people married for love of individuals regardless of food, shelter, and social acceptance, because these resources were accessible regardless of marriage. If I recall, he said this was around 1920-1950 in the U.S.</p>
<p>Then people started marrying to satisfy their self-esteem instead of achieve love. &quot;Even though I love Jim, I need to be with Greg because he increases my status, confidence, and feelings of self-worth.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, he argues, people are just beginning to marry for the sake of self-actualization. More and more, we seek a partner that we believe can help us become our &quot;true&quot; selves, the person who can help us fulfill who we are &quot;meant&quot; to be. This is, of course, nearly impossible to find in a partner, by any practical standard.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of misunderstanding about life expectancy here. Having a low life expectancy value for a time period does not mean people didn't live a long time. In most cases it means a lot of people died young and in most cases very young. </p>
<p>Take for example Korea in which the first birthday is a really big deal because many children didn't make it to one and if you did your odds of getting to old age went up dramatically. </p>
<p>If you have 10 people live to 70 and 10 die before 1 the life expectancy is 35. </p>
<p>Having and raising kids before you die wasn't a concern, getting to the age you could have kids was the concern. </p>
<p>Edit: Since there's some interest in the comment I'll refer to some things cited on wikipedia for life expectancy.  This all goes the point I was making, gotta get past the hard years, weakness to illness, fighting wars, being stupid (a side effect of being a kid) and you can expect to live a good life after that.  But the actual life expectancy number is low.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paleolithic- Life Expectancy 33 - Based on the data from recent hunter-gatherer populations, it is estimated that at 15, life expectancy was an additional 39 years (total 54), with a 0.60 probability of reaching 15.</p>
<p>Classical Rome - Life Expectancy 20â€“30 - If a child survived to age 10, life expectancy was an additional 37.5 years, (total age 47.5 years).</p>
<p>Late medieval English peerage - Life Expectancy 30 - At age 21, life expectancy was an additional 43 years (total age 64).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its not vastly different. Men were marrying in their mid to late twenties, women mid teens to early twenties. In a general sense. Adolescent or prepubescent marriage, while not unheard of, was not the norm.</p>
<p>Norms varied by location, time, and economic situations. They differed in Northern Europe from Southern Europe(I'm excluding the rest of the world for simplicity's sake and I'm assuming OP is referring to the European Middle Ages as well), before and after the black death, before and after different economic and military upheavals.</p>
<p>Economics generally drove how early people got married. After the Black Death lowered the competition for jobs it spurred a lowering of the average marriage age going into the Renaissance as they could afford to earlier. People actually got married later in the middle ages than shortly after.</p>
<p>Adolescent marriage was frowned upon by folk and church wisdom and economic necessity. Marriage for love is arguably a newer phenomenon linked to the modern era.</p>

<p>This generally coincides with what was being taught for Middle Ages history in college about 10 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the life-expectancy, frequently it wasn't the person who was marrying that was the issue, it was their parents.</p>
<p>I have two direct ancestors where this was the case in the 1800's, and I'm sure it was in countless others...</p>
<p>Young woman is 14 or 15 and both her parents have died.  She cannot work, as women &quot;didn't belong in the workplace&quot;.  There was no safety net of social security or such.</p>
<p>The only safety for women was to either be living with their parents or be married to a man who would provide for a home and food.  Occasionally they would live with another relative, I've seen several &quot;old maids&quot; living with siblings, nieces, nephews, etc.  But generally speaking, marriage was the best route to financial security.</p>
<p>If you were a young woman, unmarried, and without parents or some wealthy uncle who could take in another mouth to feed, you were likely to become homeless very shortly, and probably dead not long after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
