		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are bacteria that survive salt, however. Lactobacillus is one, and one that is good for us! We can preserve vegetables  with salt or salt brine because the salt kills other bacteria, the lactobacillus grows and excretes acid, which makes pickles! Or kimchi, sauerkraut, etc. These vegetables can be kept in cool storage but not necessarily the fridge. However they will continue fermenting, so if you like the taste then putting them in the fridge stops the lactobacillus from multiplying and making it more sour. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>High salinity is general disruptive to cell membranes due to osmotic pressure. While <em>some</em> bacteria can survive in the cruelest of conditions (heat, salinity, pH extremes and so forth), these bacteria are generally harmless to humans. Remember that pathological bacteria evolve to thrive in the base physiological conditions of their hosts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
