		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of these answers are good,  but they miss the mark a little. First off,  when you see carbon fiber,  Kevlar,  and fiberglass (others include boron fiber and other polymers) ,  you are seeing basically a bundle of fibers similar to a rope or yarn. Now imagine taking that yarn and pulling on it (tension),  it's pretty strong (how hard you have to pull to break it) and stiff (how much it deforms under that force). Now,  try pulling on it from the side, you instantly will pull the fibers from the bundle in that direction. If you push on it,  the yarn or rope folds, providing no resistance. These are your fibers. These can be made from extruded graphite (carbon), extruded aramids (kevlar),  or extruded glass and they will all give you different properties such as stiffness,  strength,  etc. </p>
<p>Now,  to solve the problem of pulling or pushing on the fiber that we saw above,  what you can do is set these fibers in a matrix,  which is basically a glue that holds the fibers in place. Imagine taking your yarn,  flattening it,  and setting it in Elmer's glue. If you did this,  it would now have actual stiffness and strength in the two directions that previously provided none. This glue,  is basically the matrix of a composite. This matrix can be a lot of things,  such as thermosets (can not be separated from the fiber with heat)  such as epoxy (most commonly used), phenolic,  bmi, etc and thermoplastics (can be separated from the fiber with heat) Each of these matrices will have different properties themselves,  but I won't go into them here. </p>
<p>So,  when you mix a fiber and matrix,  you get a composite. The matrix and fiber both provide strength and stiffness based on their ratios,  but in general,  what fiber you use dictates most of the properties in the primary tensile direction and the matrix dictates the the other properties. This where it gets complicated. In general,  your fiber will run in one direction (or two in the case of a bidirectional weave,  but we will only consider unidirectional here).  this will be the primary direction. This direction generally has properties on the order of 5 times better than the other directions,  we call this being anisotropic or more specifically orthotropic. Here's the beauty of composites- you can stack layers of this material to get properties in the direction you want. Therefore,  you can customize the strength and stiffness based on the angle that you stack the layers (plies) and how many layers you have. This is why composites are so &quot;strong&quot;,  but what is actually being referred to is it's strength and stiffness to weight ratio (specific strength / stiffness). This means for less weight, you can have a stronger and stiffer object than if you made it out of a metal. This why They are special.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to get into with composites,  including applications and processing requirements,  etc but it gets complicated fast. In general,  fiberglass is relatively heavy but cheap and provides good impact resistance so you'll see it used in large quantities for boat hull,  as protective layers on other composite,  and for generally cheaper applications. Carbon fiber is very strong, stiff,  lightweight,  but is very expensive and bad with puncture loads. It will be generally used where properties and weight matter such as in airplanes,  bikes, high performance cars,  etc though for a hefty cost. Kevlar has midrange properties,  but it's claim to fame is its energy absorption properties,  specifically in ballistic puncture applications like bulletproof vests. There are other composites all around us -  specifically steel reinforced concrete (steel rebarb fiber with concrete matrix), Adobe bricks (straw fiber and clay matrix),  and even wood (organic fiber with an organic matrix). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these answers are jumping straight to composites - with this, there's a lot of skipping material property differences between these 3 materials. I'll try to keep this ELI5 level... </p>
<p>Fiberglass - Does not conduct electricity. glass (silica / silicate) based. There are many classifications, but the 3 primary ones that I'm familiar with are E-glass, C-glass and S-glass. E-glass is generic, good chemical resistance good strength. C-glass has great chemical resistance but relatively poor strength. S-glass has great strength, but poor chemical resistance. Fiberglass also is greatly affected by humidity (can easily lose 50%+ of tensile strength when exposed over time). Fiberglass will creep (lose strength over time when exposed to a constant load). Coefficient of thermal expansion (how much it grows / shrinks when heated or cooled) is close to or higher than steel. Typically used woven or chopped. Produced by melting glass with certain chemicals present to create a polymer chain of silica.</p>
<p>Carbon Fiber - Conducts electricity. Carbon based. Two primary classifications, standard modulus and ultra high modulus. Carbon fiber is not typically affected by humidity and is much more chemical resistant then Fiberglass. Does not typically creep (relative to Fiberglass). Coefficient of thermal expansion is near zero (this can have a large impact in a composite design). Typically used in tows or a woven fabric. Produced multiple ways, one common way is PAN. Methods largely determine modulus of material. All methods result in a polymer chain with a strong carbon-carbon back-bone, creating &quot;graphite planes&quot;.</p>
<p>Kevlar - brand name for a type of aramid fiber. I don't have much hands on experience here, sorry! I primarily know that Kevlar is GREAT at distributing load in tension (think bullet-proof vests) but very fragile in compression loading. It has good chemical resistance, I don't believe it conducts electricity. Once produced, Kevlar is a polymer chain of repeating Aramids (notice a pattern here?). </p>
<p>The reason all these materials are &quot;strong&quot; is due to how the architecture utilizes the polymer chains. A single strand of any of these products is incredibly small (diameter less than hair). To break one of these strands, you have to pull apart atoms in polymer strands (more realistically, the weak spots in these strands). These strands are often bundled into &quot;Tows&quot;, typically around 3,000 - 12,000 strands per Tow. These Tows are then used to weave fabric. Based on these fabrics you can achieve various physical properties, but the individual material properties I discussed above are carried through to a degree. Often times, these materials are used as a composite (read rest of thread), but sometimes these materials can be used as is (Kevlar bullet proof vest or fiberglass insulation)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they all have the same basic idea, which is bonding lots of fibres together with some form of plastic to create a material which is much stronger than the individual components. Fibreglass is one of many different types of GRP (glass reinforced plastic). Take a fibreglass canoe. If it was just the plastic 'matrix' material, it would be quite weak and would break easily, but is great for moulding and will take impacts much better than glass, which tends to shatter. By  incorporating glass fibres, the material is made much stronger, but because the plastic is holding all the fibres together, the mixture doesn't shatter as easily as glass. </p>
<p>It works with pretty much any fibre and plastic-like material. You even see the basic principle in steel reinforced concrete, where steel bars are incorporated into concrete to enhance its strength.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>fiberglass and carbon are similar in many respects.  Kevlar is a completely different animal here I'll explain.</p>
<p>The concept with any reinforced plastic is to take something that is extremely hard.  To the point of being brittle.  The thing about any material we think of as brittle like glass or diamond(a form of carbon)  is that they actually do have some give.  A glass sheet can bend a little before breaking.  So what we do is make strands of it so thin that they bend quite easily.  Then weave them into a fabric.</p>
<p>Contrary to what many people think the glass/carbon fabric does not reinforce the plastic in high tech structural applications.  Yes in a bathtub or shower, or some crappy production boat.  But in aircraft, or high end boats there is very little resin used and the resin is referred to as the &quot;bonding agent&quot;.  </p>
<p>The reason for this is that it is much different than using steel to reinforce concrete.  In that application the concrete is main structural component.  The steel is then used to strengthen it.  I high end composites the fiberglass or carbon strand is the main structural component and the plastic is used to bond the fibers together.  </p>
<p>The idea is to that if we take something dense like glass or carbon and then make strands out of it.. then bond them together we get something that has the stiffness of the glass or carbon and the flexibility of the plastic bonding agent.  </p>
<p>But here's the key to all that.  By changing the bonding agent and or the process used to laminate layers of material and add/subtract plastic resin from the material we can adjust the stiffness of the end product.  Ideally you want to have just the bare minimum of bonding agent necessary to hold the fibers together and no more.  </p>
<p>In some aerospace applications the product when cured is actually porous and needs to be sealed to keep it from absorbing moisture. </p>
<p>So picture this in your mind if you can.  If you take all the carbon or glass and made one big block out of it.. it would be very hard, but it would break because it's fairly brittle.  So we make into into strands, then bond the strands together.  Now the strands are only allowed to move as much as the bonding agent allows the strands to move.  So by changing the base material fiberglass/carbon or changing the bonding agent polyester or epoxy.  We can change the stiffness and fatigue strength of the end product.</p>
<p>Take for example polyester and fiberglass.  This is the most common type of composite.  The polyester used in those products is actually stiffer and more brittle than epoxy.   If you were to use epoxy with fiberglass the product will be much less brittle but will also be a lot more flexible which isn't really good for a lot of things.  So we use carbon with the epoxy so that we can increase the stiffness of the end product.  Carbon and epoxy composites are some of the most durable types of materials that we have available to work with in large capacity.  </p>
<p>Carbon fiber composites are nowhere near as strong as steel aluminum or titanium for it's weight.  However in any structural application with non linear dynamic loads we have to use enough metal to make sure that we can handle the loads without stress fracturing becoming an issue over a given lifetime.</p>
<p>Now, because we are using a very flexible bonding agent to hold the fibers together we can build with the very minimum weight needed for any given structural application because we don't have to worry about stress fractures in the epoxy due to it's amazing elongation properties.  </p>
<p>That means we can build products at or below the weight of almost any metal available.. </p>
<p>Take a look at how far the wings of the Boieng Dreamliner bend.. it's crazy how far they move but the can bend a lot farther and do it for many years after a comparable aluminum wing is sent to the scrap pile.</p>
<p>edit: I totally forgot Kevlar.</p>
<p>Kevlar is one of a serious of aramid based synthetic strand material.  Those materials have amazing tensile elongation properties (they don't break very easy when you try to pull them apart)</p>
<p>However they have almost no structural value and are used mainly for abrasion resistance.  In some cases like bullet resistance the kevlar is used with a brittle resin and acts like a catchers mitt.  The bullet contacts the material at speed. The resin shatters and the strands reduce the velocity of  the bullet down until it stops.  If the kevlar is put into a stronger resin so that the kevlar is not allowed to move the bullet will point load and go strait through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fiberglass is pieces of molten glass that are pulled into really long, thin strands. Then using resin, which for our purposes is a very strong glue, the strands are all bonded together in what is usually a haphazard crisscross way very similar to particle board. It's strength comes from the fact that force upon it is distributed along the fibers and that because there are no seams or &quot;grain&quot; it lacks a structural weak point and can more or less maintain the same strength throughout.</p>
<p>Kevlar is a plant based fiber that has been given special treatments that make it super strong on its own, but most people think of the bullet stopping power and that comes from weaving the fibers to distribute the energy of the incoming bullet.</p>
<p>Carbon Fibers are built by alignment of graphite molecules in a special way that allows them to take advantage of the strong carbon crystal structure in a flexible fiber.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
