		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that eggs <em>can</em> crack inside the hen. But it's not common because eggs are actually pretty strong when forces are applied evenly over the entire shell.</p>
<p>If you wrap your whole hand around an egg trying to make as much surface contact as possible, it's actually pretty difficult to break the egg by squeezing it.  If you pinch the egg between two fingertips, it's much easier because the force is concentrated on a smaller area of the shell.</p>
<p>Imagine pushing an egg on to the point of a sharpened pencil.  It would pierce through pretty easily right?  Now imagine pushing an egg onto a soft ball of clay.  It takes much more pressure to break it. So you can imagine if the insides of a hen are pushing on the egg evenly from all directions, it gets even more difficult. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eggs harden inside the chicken. They are not laid soft. They can crack inside of the hen, and can repair themselves. They can also crack and have to be retrieved or the hen can die. The egg itself starts with the yolk, is surrounded by the white, and then the membrane that surrounds the white attracts calcite that is inside the hen. That makes the shell, and hardens. They are laid warm and coated with a bloom that covers the shell and protects it from spoiling.</p>
<p>Edit: I have chickens. I have watched them lay and have held a seconds laid egg. Not sure why I am getting downvoted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take an egg. Put it in the palm of your hand. Wrap your fingers around it, and try to tighten into a fist, crushing the egg.</p>
<p>You probably can't. An egg will crack if you put pressure in one small place. But an eggshell is really good at distributing pressure all around it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
