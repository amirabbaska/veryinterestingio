		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microphysics, ie the laws that we observe here on Earth, would not change.</p>
<p>One interesting thing that would change is that cosmic structure would begin to grow again;  density perturbations have trouble growing in an expanding universe, and even moreso in an accelerating expansion.  Because of this, the rate of formation and growth of cosmic structure has gone way down - pretty much all cosmic structures formed a while ago, and no new ones to speak of are forming now.</p>
<p>If the expansion stopped, that picture would change, and cosmic structures (galaxies, clusters of galaxies, superclusters, etc) could form and grow again, like winter turning to spring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The night sky would get brighter to our naked eye. There are stars that are red shifted just enough to have their light be invisible to us. Without an expanding universe, there would be more visible stars in the night sky. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This kind of depends on what you mean when you say it stops expanding. There are essentially three outcomes for any given universe:</p>
<ol>
<li>It will continue to expand and due to the amount of dark energy, it will keep expanding forever, and this expansion will get faster and faster. Recent research suggests this is what our universe is like.</li>
<li>If the amount of dark matter and dark energy in the universe are at the PERFECT ratio, or the critical density, the expansion will slow until eventually there is no virtually no expansion. This is one way expansion can stop, but this is essentially a slowing of expansion down to a limit of 0, so probably not what you’re asking about.</li>
<li>The universe’s mass puts it above the critical density, and eventually the expansion will stop, then the universe starts to contract until we have a sort of reverse big bang. (If this freaks you out as much as it did when I learned about it, don’t worry. It wouldn’t happen for an insanely long time, and this isn’t even possible given the universe we’re living in.)
If the universe stopped expanding on a universal scale, nothing on our world would change, which makes sense, since the universal expansion doesn’t really affect anything on even a solar system level. However, if everything stopped moving, it would most likely signify a sudden drop in dark energy, for whatever reason. This would most likely mean that the universe is now above the critical mass, and we’re now on our way to a reverse big bang. I’m not sure if this answers your question. Let me know if I misinterpreted what you were asking.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To address those saying the night sky would change... That will not happen for MILLIONS of years, observable to humans on Eart.</p>
<p>Anything far enough away to be redshifted, at present, to the point of being dimmed out of naked-eye view, is VERY dim and far away to begin with.  </p>
<p>These lights so far away are not discernable as individual stars, they are galaxies.</p>
<p>The &quot;dimmer switch&quot; that would stop turning-down the lights would stop, and the light will go full-blast ... At a rate of the speed of light FROM where the light source is.  The light already on its way (from millions of LYs away) is already &quot;red&quot; and humans will be probably gone by tue time a naked-human-eye effect could be seen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
