		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Transparency International publishes what they call a &quot;Corruption Perception Index&quot; made up from polls. They ask people how often in the past year (or whatever timeframe) they paid a bribe, and how much, and in what situation.<br />
It is true that the data is not entirely reliable because of the very nature of the thing but they openly acknowledge this. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.transparency.org/cpi2014/in_detail" target="_blank">From their Website:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>WHY IS THE CPI BASED ON PERCEPTIONS?</p>
<p>Corruption generally comprises illegal activities, which are deliberately hidden and only come to light through scandals, investigations or prosecutions. There is no meaningful way to assess absolute levels of corruption in countries or territories on the basis of hard empirical data. Possible attempts to do so, such as by comparing bribes reported, the number of prosecutions brought or studying court cases directly linked to corruption, cannot be taken as definitive indicators of corruption levels. Instead, they show how effective prosecutors, the courts or the media are in investigating and exposing corruption. Capturing perceptions of corruption of those in a position to offer assessments of public sector corruption is the most reliable method of comparing relative corruption levels across countries.</p>
