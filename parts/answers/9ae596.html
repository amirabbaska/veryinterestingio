		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I switched to T-Mobile over 55 plan in March, and immediately both my phone and my daughter's got 100% locked out of youtube, Amazon Prime Video and Netflix.</p>
<p>Everything else works great (Pandora, Amazon Music, Spotify).</p>
<p>Even when you got www.youtube.com, it doesn't load.</p>
<p>(and I am getting creeped out that most of the times I have posted this, I get downvotes making me think T-Mobile has people monitoring Reddit, but obviously not sure about that)</p>
<p><strong> EDIT </strong>  </p>
<p>1) For those who have said that I should contact them --&gt; I have contacted them. I spent hours in April, gave up then this week I started again and have been on the phone for hours. They are going to call me again on Monday. </p>
<p>2) For those who said their T-Mobile works fine, so did mine, it was amazingly good until the instant I switched to the 55 plan. Then all of a sudden both my phone AND my daughter's phone lost Youtube, Netflix and Amazon Prime Video (amazon music streams great btw)</p>
<p>More detail: The original call was a farce. </p>
<p>1) Switch out the SIM card. Okay, really? Both my daughter and I lost Youtube the instant we switched. It works on Wifi. In the history of SIM cards has there ever been one single instance where the SIM card was corrupt causing just 3 APPs to not work, and on two separate phones on the same plan at the same time?</p>
<p>2) Reinstall youtube. Really? It works amazingly well on Wifi, AND I can't even reach www.youtube.com in any of the browsers on my phone. Doesn't sound like the APP is the problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few ways to answer this.</p>
<p>In the USA, the system and laws are set up a certain way. Basically, they only have so much bandwidth to go around, and they've found they make more money by telling people it's unlimited then throttling later, rather than giving an accurate assessment of how much you get. So that's what they do. By throttling, they can provide a higher average speed to everyone (who isn't getting throttled), and charge extra to people who are getting throttled. </p>
<p>It's basically just a way of getting the most money possible out of a finite resource, and continues to be true if we're on 1mb/s connections or 1gb/s connections. The system is set up in such a way that allows them to do it, and they make more money that way, so they do it.</p>
<p>To put it another way, the system is set up such that the more they screw people over, the better their company does.</p>
<p>In the UK, ISP's have hard, enforced limits on truth in advertising and aren't allowed to do such things, so they don't. They tried to get around it by selling &quot;Up to 50mb/s&quot;, but that was recently outlawed as well, so what you see is what you get. Also the UK has a higher population density and laws again monopolies in utilities, so they have to compete against other companies.</p>
<p>They still try to screw people over, but the law limits the number of ways they can do that, and limits the rewards. This makes a strategy of complete screwing over less profitable, and in some cases it even provides less added value than the goodwill of acting in good faith. But that's another story.</p>
<p>I'm simplifying here, and there are other differences besides between the countries. But the basic rule is, if a situation is set up which incentivises a certain action in a global economy, companies will take that action. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To reduce there cost and income and incrase profit.</p>
<p>Data usage in mobile networks cost money. It is not the cost to send the data as the only cost then is a small around of electricity usage. The   cost is to have enough capacity. A cell tower like any other communications system have a max  bandwidth So if many people use more data the max capacity is reached and you need to build add more cell towers  to give the users the ability to use the network.  So it cost a lot of money to increase the amount of data the network can transmit. So if you reduce data usage you can have more customers in the same network and the result in higher profit.</p>
<p>The other part is they like to sell more expensive contract. So even if the network is not congested if you can get people to pay more you get higher profit.</p>
<p>You have to compare both parts with the risk of consumers moving to another cell phone provides so increased price or reduce data can result in that you loose more customers and the result is a decreased profit so what operators do depend a lot of the competition on the market.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
