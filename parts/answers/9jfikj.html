		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earths the magnetic field is pretty weak, about .3 Gauss, it is only able to protect us from energetic charged particles because it is so vast - it needs to act over extremely long distances to deflect particles by small angle changes. I haven't done the math but if it scales linearly you'd need about 10^6 times more field to act over the small scale lengths of a vessel. This puts us around the 100 Tesla range and you'd need the field to extend somewhere on the order of a meter. This is about the same as the 2012 record set by the national high magnetic field laboratory. Given that I suppose its possible to generate such fields with current technology but a space application would have to be at least decades off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best solution is not to use a magnetic field, but an electric one. We can generate these fields at a much higher strength with less power and they have no effect on humans (unlike magnetic fields which long term exposure results in some weird and possibly hazardous effects). Furthermore, electric fields do not need poles and you can face them in any direction. If you were to face one out it would slow down any particles approaching the spacecraft.</p>
<p>We would only place these at key points such as the windows to living areas etc, and use clever design such as location of onboard water to provide some passive protection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earth just has tons of ozone, so if a spaceship had layers and layers of ozone it would be pretty close, besides the metal accidentally conducting it, hence the polymer revival committee. This committee makes the ion exchange membrane and thus health is restored. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
