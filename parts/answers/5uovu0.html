		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-sale_doctrine" target="_blank">First sale doctrine</a>, which was court ruling that stated that once you purchased something you could do with it as you pleased. If a video was available for sale, any video store was free to purchase it and rent it out. Studios could (and often did) release VHS tapes for like $100 at first (&quot;priced for rental&quot;) to maximize revenue from video stores, and then later on drop the price to consumer-friendly levels. Or they might provide discounted pricing to preferred rental chain, ie. Blockbuster's &quot;guaranteed in stock&quot; titles.</p>
<p>Streaming, however, works differently where the platform (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) have to buy the rights to stream for a specific period of time for a negotiated price...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exclusivity costs more. The online services <em>want</em> to be the only place you can get something, because that will drive people to subscribe to them. So they enter a bidding war to get content with exclusive rights.</p>
<p>If they were all fine with all having the same library, it wouldn't be an issue, but then Netflix, Hulu, Amazon, etc. wouldn't have any real reason for you to choose one over any of the others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Netflix broke the contract. They will not provide DVDs that the studios don't want you to have. In exchange Netflix gets kickbacks and minimal streaming rights. Did I mention the kickbacks? No DVDs for you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
