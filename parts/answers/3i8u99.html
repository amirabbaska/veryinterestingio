		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is exactly what hydro-electric power does. It takes the gravitational potential energy of water flowing and uses it to power turbines. In fact, using the gravitational potential energy of water is a practice much older than using electricity; water wheels being used to turned mills goes back over 2000 years! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you can use gravity to store energy, that is by lifting something up, and getting it back later. Some powerplants pump up water ro a mountain and later let it run through turbines.
The sun moves the water from the sea to higher places, wher it then flows downward and can be used to drive water wheels, but the energy comes from the sun and gravitation is just some intermediate step. </p>
<p>But you cannot generate energy from gravity in a closed loop, meaning you cannot build a machine that outputs energy by just moving something around in a loop inside of a gravitational field.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another way (besides hydroelectric) that gravitational energy is harnessed, which isn't really viable for terrestrial applications. This is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity_assist" target="_blank">gravitational slingshot</a>, where a spacecraft approaches a planet and essentially falls toward it as the planet moves away from the spacecraft in order to leave the planet's vicinity with more speed than it entered with.</p>
<p>Like hydroelectric, which is ultimately taking the energy provided by the sun to lift water (which will then fall as rain or snow onto higher land) into the air via evaporation, this needs to draw from an existing source of energy in order to work. In this case it's the kinetic energy of the planet, which decreases just as much as the kinetic energy of the spacecraft increases - but that doesn't really matter that much given how enormous, for example, Jupiter is relative to New Horizons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slightly repeating here, but yes hydroelectric power harnesses gravity. As far as other potential means of harnessing gravity, you can not simply harness the force itself, but rather need some object being propelled by the force of gravity and then harness the energy from that object to create usable electric energy. It is easy and efficient to do with water because their exists natural places in earth where water is continuously supplied to an area that uses gravity to propel the water. In most other cases it is highly inefficient in terms of energy used versus energy gained to harness gravitational force from other objects. This is because you must use the same amount of energy to get an object above ground level, to then turn around and harness the same amount of energy from it falling. And with energy collection never being at 100% due to factors such as friction, energy degradation between switching forms, etc. the process of using gravity becomes something that requires more energy than it gives back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
