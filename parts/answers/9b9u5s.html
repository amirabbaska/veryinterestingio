		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, ornithologist here! Though my particular research is focused on passeriformes (think starlings and sparrows) rather than anseriformes (ducks and geese), my old research/thesis advisor studied the Canada Goose at length so I have some knowledge of this content area. Bird species, even within families, differ wildly in behavioral terms, so this is specific to the Canada Goose.</p>
<p>Simply put, geese almost always flock in consistent groups. Each flock is a social structure that you can roughly equate to that of a wolf pack with less hierarchical organization. So while you do not have as defined of a pecking order (heh) in this social grouping, you still observe familiarity and friendliness of individuals to others within their flock. Therefore, these flocks tend to stay together and individuals do their best to avoid separation. In cases where an individual is separated from the flock, it is possible that they can join another flock but this, as I recall, is somewhat rare.</p>
<p>In the example you give, that one goose who seemed to have missed the boat will likely meet up with the flock again at one of the &quot;stops&quot; along the migration route.</p>
<p>Edit: Changed &quot;Canadian Goose&quot; to &quot;Canada Goose&quot;. The latter is more appropriate and what I would use in journals, but in conversation I use Canadian as that's how I was raised and most in the field don't mind either way. The people who demand exclusive use of &quot;Canada Goose&quot; are the same who would give you trouble for splitting an infinitive or dangling a participle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's two questions you didn't directly ask that you might like answered:</p>
<ol>
<li>When goslings lose a parent/parents, what do they do?</li>
</ol>
<p>They generally join another gaggle of goslings.  Care of goslings can be more like a collective &quot;day care&quot; with care shared between several adults.</p>

<p>2) Do all Canada geese migrate?</p>
<p>No, there are many flocks that have abandoned migration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
