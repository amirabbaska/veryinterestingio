		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Union flag is made up of three crosses:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://www.flags.net/images/largeflags/UNKG0100.GIF" target="_blank">cross of St George, representing England</a>, is a red cross on a white (representing silver) background;</li>
<li>the <a href="https://flagspot.net/images/i/ie-stpat.gif" target="_blank">cross of St Patrick, representing Ireland</a>, is a red saltire on a white background;</li>
<li>the <a href="https://www.greensofgloucestershire.com/media/catalog/product/cache/1/image/9df78eab33525d08d6e5fb8d27136e95/s/c/scotland-sky-st-andrews-cross-53-eyelets_1.png" target="_blank">cross of St Andrew, representing Scotland</a>, is a white saltire on a blue background.</li>
</ul>
<p>The white in all of these flags is known in heraldry as &quot;argent&quot;, meaning &quot;silver&quot;, and is one of the two &quot;metals&quot;, the other being &quot;or&quot; (&quot;gold&quot;) which is represented as yellow; the red and blue (or &quot;gules&quot; and &quot;azure&quot;) are &quot;colours&quot;. One of the rules in heraldry is that you can't put a metal on another metal, or a colour on another colour. This already causes a problem if you try to put the cross of St George on the blue background of the cross of St Andrew, because then you'd get gules (a colour) on azure (another colour), which isn't allowed. To avoid that, the red cross is &quot;fimbriated argent&quot;, meaning it's given a white outline.</p>
<p>The original Union Flag (or Union Jack -- it's a myth, apparently, that you can only call it the &quot;Union Jack&quot; if it's flying from the jack mast of a ship) was created when England and Scotland were united as Great Britain, and so only had the crosses of St George and St Andrew: it looked <a href="https://www.awesomestories.com/images/user/915520df7d.gif" target="_blank">like this</a>.</p>
<p>Later, Ireland entered into a union with Great Britain, and it was represented by the cross of St Patrick. But if you put the cross of St Patrick and the cross of St Andrew on top of each other, all you see is whichever cross is on top -- you don't see the one below.</p>
<p>So to depict both crosses, they were <em>quartered</em> and <em>counterchanged</em>: they were split so that each &quot;arm&quot; of the &quot;X&quot; showed half argent (St Andrew) and half gules (St Patrick). And then the quartered saltire was fimbriated argent to avoid the &quot;colour on colour&quot; problem.</p>

The &quot;red lines&quot; aren't continuous, but they meet at a point. The narrow white strips are the fimbriation; the wider white strips are what is visible of the cross of St Andrew.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking the saltire (corner-to-corner cross) in the UK flag evenly splits its width between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Patrick%27s_Saltire" target="_blank">the red of St. Patrick's Saltire</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Scotland" target="_blank">the white of St. Andrew's</a>. It looks uneven because the red and white is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fimbriation" target="_blank">fimbriated</a> with additional white - on the white edge of the saltire you can't visually tell where the saltire ends and the fimbriation begins but in flag terms those are considered distinct from one another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because then one set of 'lines' would be superior to another.
The UK flag is a combination of three different flags.<br />
The Flag of Scotland: Blue with a White 'X'<br />
The St. Patrick's Cross: White with a Red 'X'<br />
The St. George's Cross: White with a Red '+'<br />
If you combine these three you get the UK flag. However flags are  also symbols of heraldry, which means that there are rules for how these things can be combined. In the case of the UK flag the Scottish flag and st Patrick's cross are 'quartered per saltire' and 'countercharged' which is a fancy way of saying that in each of the four triangular areas formed (quartered per saltrie) that the forground and background colors are reversed (countercharged). This makes it so that the flag of Scotland isn't 'superior' to St. Patrick's cross (or vice versa).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually no documented reason other than &quot;that's what the specifications say&quot;.</p>
<p>The flag was invented when the United Kingdom was formed in 1801, by combining the crosses of St George (patron saint of England), St Andrew (patron saint of Scotland) and St Patrick (patron saint of Ireland). As <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/ea/Flags_of_the_Union_Jack.png" target="_blank">this diagram shows</a>.</p>
<p>The exact text of how to combine the crosses is full of obscure vexilogical terms, and reads: <em>&quot;the Union flag shall be azure, the crosses-saltires of St. Andrew and St. Patrick quartered per saltire counter charged argent and gules; the latter fimbriated of the second [viz., argent]; surmounted by the cross of St. George of the third [viz., gules], fimbriated as the saltire [viz., argent].&quot;</em></p>
<p>Translated into diagramatical form, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d8/United_Kingdom_Flag_Specifications.svg" target="_blank">it means this</a> -- so as you can see, it's designed that the cross of St Patrick is offcentred.</p>
<p>One advantage this provides (although probably not the original intention of the flag's designers) is that you can fly the UK flag upside-down. It's subtle, but there is a definite difference. In the British military an upside-down Union Flag is used as a secret distress signal (e.g. when a ship is being boarded by enemies), because it was believed that the enemy probably wouldn't notice the upside-down flag, but any British ships in the vicinity certainly would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
