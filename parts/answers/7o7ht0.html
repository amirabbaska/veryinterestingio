		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not completely sure about the chemistry, but for water the maximum temperature at which liquid water may exist is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Properties_of_water#/media/File:Phase_diagram_of_water_simplified.svg" target="_blank">647K</a> (374 °C; 705 °F), at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_point_(thermodynamics\)" target="_blank">minimum pressure 22.064 MPa</a> (3200 psia; 218 atm). <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4820106/" target="_blank">These researchers call 300 °C a low pyrolysis temperature</a> for wood, so it would seem that it would be possible for wood, at least, to char at temperatures attainable by liquid water.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that's not the whole story. As noted by the wood-burners, their samples were first dried in an oven. In the presence of large amounts of water, different chemical reactions take place, generically called hydrolysis. There is apparently a name for this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrous_pyrolysis" target="_blank">hydrous pyrolysis</a>. When applied to various organic materials (220-360 ºC and), the products are apparently various alcohols and oils. Their description of the pressure is 'higher than that of saturated steam', so this takes place in liquid water. Is this charring, though? <a href="https://www.google.com/patents/US2177557" target="_blank">This patent</a> describes the byproducts as various calcium salts in solution. (Lime was added to aid the reactions.) This doesn't quite sound like charring, but <a href="https://ergosphere.files.wordpress.com/2007/04/cwt_genconflasvegas3_3_04.pdf" target="_blank">a similar process applied to turkey offal</a> at lower pressures and temperatures (260 ºC and 600psi) does seem to leave behind carbon char. This process operates at approximately the borderline between liquid and gas, but if I read the chart correctly, does take place in liquid.</p>
<p>The last word seems to be apparently <strong>yes</strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When food (or organic matter) is heated in high pressures (5-40 MPa) in water, as in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrothermal_liquefaction" target="_blank">hydrothermal liquefaction</a>, the product is usually a liquid that is oil-like along with a watery product. This starts at around 200 °C up to about 400 °C. Higher temperatures usually produce more gaseous products. There is a bit of char produced but the conditions promote production of lighter liquid and gaseous products. The organic components (cellulose, lignin, fats and protein) are cracked and a variety of reactions such as <a href="http://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2008/EE/b810100k#!divAbstract" target="_blank">dehydration and decarboxylation occur</a>. Waste food/garbage has been shown to be subjected to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0961953495000172" target="_blank">hydrothermal liquefaction to produce a high calorific value liquid</a> that has potential for fuel or as a starting material for chemical production.</p>
<p>This happens because of the <a href="http://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/8/7/6765" target="_blank">properties of water at higher temperature and pressure</a>. Water can remain in liquid form and facilitates reactions of liquefied components. The high pressure also allows greater penetration into complex organic structures. Water also has a lower dielectric constant (less polar) and can dissolve non-polar compounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Under extreme conditions the carbons in hydrocarbons can steal oxygen directly from water. You get carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen gas. The date of your beef stew is probably roughly similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
