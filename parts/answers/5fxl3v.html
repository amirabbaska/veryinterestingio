I've got to ask: Does the backpack mounted Tesla coil have the potential to incapacitate a human if desired?  How much could that thing pump out before frying?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey guys!  Destin here.  I'm by no means a tesla coil guru... but I'm no stranger to high voltage either.  I have experience with DC high voltage detonator circuitry.  HV AC is a brave new world for me, so I'm eager to learn.  Cameron Prince (u/teslauniverse), the guy that runs www.teslauniverse.com is going to be in this thread as well.  He is the real guru that can answer technical questions about the circuitry and Nikola Tesla in general.  I've asked him to answer questions by providing references to Tesla documentation he's accumulated over the years when appropriate.  One question I'd like to start with myself is <strong><em>&quot;Why does the bolt just go out into air and not physically touch the ground?&quot;</em></strong>  What is happening there?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What a great video!  It was great to watch how much fun you were having during that video.</p>
<p>On the safety bit, part of the reason the answers vary so much are because each answer depends on a lot of things.  The biggest is whether your skin is intact.  The level of resistance offered to the current path with unbroken skin is much higher than if you have an open wound where it starts to drop to basically the same level of resistance that water would offer.  And when dealing with super high voltage, as it is ionizing things near its path, the resistance also changes.  So the easiest answer is always &quot;don't shoot yourself with lightning bolts!&quot;  Plus the special grounding strap boots he had was an interesting thing for you to show!</p>
<p>I had a great time watching you have fun.  Keep it up!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
