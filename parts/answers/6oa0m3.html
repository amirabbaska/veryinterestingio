		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surface tension.  Water wants to stick to hard surfaces.  This is what causes a meniscus in a test tube, for example.  That &quot;u&quot; shape at the top of the water.  The attraction between the surface and the water molecules is stronger than the attraction of the water molecules to each other.</p>
<p>So, when pouring, the force of the gravity on the water needs to overcome this surface tension to pull the water away from the container.  When the angle between glass wall and vertical direction is small, the component of gravity perpendicular to container wall is small and surface tension is stronger, causing the water to stick to the container and run down the outside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In chemistry we use pouring rings to decant fluids from a bottle without it spilling down the sides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: You're pouring too slow. </p>
<p>Everything about water can be explained with two of its properties: </p>
<p>It is <em>cohesive</em> (sticks to itself) and <em>adhesive</em> (sticks to other stuff). </p>
<p>In this case, the water sticking to itself tends to make it follow, uh, itself, out of the container in a smooth pour. </p>
<p>But the water sticking to other stuff, like the container, will tend to make it dribble over and down the sides. </p>
<p>Which properties dominate depends on a lot of things, like material properties and time spent forming bonds (ie speed of the pour). If you pour too slowly for how &quot;sticky&quot; the container material is, the water spends too much time bonding to the container and some of it bonds more strongly to the lip instead of its water molecule brethren. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is talking about how liquids interacts between hard surfaces and softer surfaces, but I'm assuming you mean when pouring from the same or similar container. For example, if you're using the same glass or bowl each time and sometimes it pours and sometimes it doesn't the answer is simple: Water sticks to water (cohesion) and if there is water on the lip/rim of the container then it will stick to that water and spill everywhere. If the lip/rim of the container is dry then it will pour correctly.</p>
<p>You can try this yourself. Next time the water is pouring all crazy just take a towel and dry the lip/rim of the container and then continue pouring. It will then pour correctly.</p>
<p>Now not all liquids are as cohesive as water and so this effect may differ between liquids, but is the same general idea. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's one influence missing from the answers. It's the interaction of the fluid with the solid surface. Although this closely related to surface tension, it is a different result. In engineering it's called &quot;wetting&quot;. It's the affinity a liquid has with a solid surface.
You can tell if a fluid has good wetting properties by looking at the shape of a single drop on the surface. If it's very spherical the surface tension is higher than the affinity towards the solid. If the drop smears itself out it has higher affinity.
So in the end you have several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>surface tension vs wetting properties: low affinity liquids will want to detach from the canister surface quicker.</li>
<li>pouring speed: higher speed means higher inertia, which means the flow will rather go straight on as opposed to follow the shape of the spout.</li>
<li>fluid viscosity (thickness of the fluid): thicker fluid will have a laminar flow, which means the fluid speed  is quite low near the surface of the canister. Low speed means low inertia, means it's difficult to flow straight on. Which is why syrup pours poorly.</li>
<li>spout shape: a sharp edge or smaller radius of more difficult to follow due to inertia.
Now you have all factors involved! So it's chemistry as well as physics and shape.
Cheers!</li>
