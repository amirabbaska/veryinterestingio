		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In everyday life, the energy scale you encounter the most is simply temperature. At low temperatures, there is less energy in a system and the fact that systems behave very differently depending on temperature is quite familiar. Eg. below 0 C water is a solid, whereas above, it is a liquid. </p>
<p>Actually, at much higher temperatures, metals also melt. However, it doesn't matter that at 660 C Aluminum melts because at the energy scale we live at, it is a solid.</p>
<p>I think this partly answers your question about the car crash. It's not just a question of total energy, it's a question of energy density. The energy needs to be concentrated in a very small region in order to see a quantum process.</p>
<p>To further understand how energy scales and distances are related, you need a bit of quantum mechanics. If you know anything about so-called 'wave-particle duality' this makes sense. The de Broglie equation relates the wavelength λ of a particle with its momentum p: λ=h/p, where h is the Planck constant. So, your wavelength decreases with both your mass and velocity. Associating energy E with momentum E~cp, where c is the speed of light, you find that E~ch/λ. </p>
<p>So, if you want to see a process that happens only over a very small distance, you need to &quot;see&quot; it with something which has a comparable wavelength, and therefore a very large energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, when physicists talk about a specific energy scale it is because something is expected (or known) to happen at those energies. </p>
<p>For example, the electroweak scale is the characteristic scale of the electroweak part of the standard model. Above this energy scale the weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force form an unbroken symmetry of the standard model. Below this scale, the symmetry is broken by the Higgs mechanism, resulting in the weak bosons (W+/- and Z) getting masses that are related to the scale. </p>
<p>Similarly, when we talk about the GUT scale, it is because this is the energy at which we might expect to see all the symmetries of the standard model unite to form one, single grand unified symmetry. The reason people think this might be a possibility is somewhat technical, but essentially all the standard model coupling are &quot;run&quot; with energy, and if you run the couplings up to very high energies, they almost become equal at energies of 10^15GeV. Hence, they might be unified into one force... maybe.</p>
<p>A popular symmetry for this is SU(5), which is the smallest allowed group that contains the standard model forces. In a similar way to the electroweak sector (actually a bit different, but for this example it doesn't matter too much), when we fall below the energy of unification, we would expect to see some massive particle that are consistent with that unification scale.</p>
<p>Similar for the planck scale, but with gravity. </p>
<p>tl;dr: scales in particle physics are usually where we expect something to happen, perhaps unification of forces. Perhaps being able to resolve new particles. Also I like to ramble off topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An energy scale is where something &quot;new&quot; happens or is expected to happen.  In a car crash, the total energy is large, but the energy in each individual interaction is low---on the scale of the chemical interaction, and not on the scale of, say, the nuclear interaction.  The reason the total energy is so high in a car crash is because there's ~ Avogadro's number of particles in a car.  In fact, if nothing catches on fire, the majority of a car crash happens at the scale of material deformation, which is a lower energy scale than the scale required for a chemical reaction---the energy needed for a rearrangement of covalent or ionic bonds.</p>
<p>When the energy in individual interactions becomes larger, then you have to start to wonder: is my theory of physics still valid when those large energies are involved?  This is the question behind the philosophy that leads to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_field_theory" target="_blank">effective field theories</a>.  Here's a great question:  we don't have a unified theory of physics, so how is it that we're able to make <em>any</em> progress <em>at all</em>?!  I mean, we can design bridges and rockets and all SORTS of stuff, and yet we don't have to teach anything about the Higgs boson to engineers.  Why not?  It's because Newton's laws are valid irrespective of what's going on &quot;down there&quot;.  We don't have to teach engineers relativity because the speed of light is ENORMOUS.  If the speed of light were 100 miles per hour, every car company would worry about relativity.</p>
<p>When do we know that we don't have to worry about relativistic effects?  When the velocities involved are much less than the speed of light.  Answers calculated with relativity will differ from answers derived from Newton's laws by a very small amount, as long as v, the velocity of the car (in this example) is much much less than the speed of light.  Newtonian answers are like (v/c)^0, which makes sense because it's independent of c.  The leading corrections to the Newtonian answer go like (v/c)^2.  But even if you incorporate those corrections you still don't have the full relativistic answer.  The next correction is (v/c)^4 and the next is (v/c)^6 and so on.  So you can see that if (v/c) = (speeds relevant to automobiles / speed of light) is small, we have to care less and less about the corrections.  However, you can see that when v/c is not small the successive terms can make a big difference!  If v/c = 0.99, the first correction is of a comparable size to the Newtonian answer.  So are the other corrections.  Even the 50th correction is of a scale (0.99)^100 ~= 0.36---a correction on the scale of 36% of the Newtonian answer!  So if we ignore relativity we're making a BIG mistake, but only if the velocities are large.</p>
<p>When physicists talk about &quot;energy scales&quot; they mean something similar---a scale at which you ought to be suspicious that you're making a mistake, and that you need a new theory to feel comfortable.  Notice that it typically doesn't matter if you change an energy scale by a factor of 2---if you were OK before you're probably still OK.  But if you change it by a factor of 10 or 100, look out!</p>
<p>Moreover, energy scales are often widely separated.  For example, chemistry happens at the eV scale, nuclear physics at the MeV scale (a million times as much energy).  The mass of the proton is 1 GeV, and the mass of the W, Z, and Higgs bosons are ~ 100 GeV (not exactly, but close!).  This is what allows us to formulate an effective theory and to ignore the complication of the whole underlying theory.  At each of those scales our &quot;previous&quot; (lower-energy-scale) description is no longer of any use.  In chemistry we don't talk about pions (which are important to nuclear physics), and to describe nuclear physics we don't worry about the Higgs, and we usually don't have to worry about electrons, either!  Moreover, all of the physics that depend on the same explanation happens roughly at the same scale (for example, the mass of the W is ~ 80 GeV, Z is ~ 91 GeV, Higgs is ~ 125 GeV; another example: most nuclear energy splittings are of the same rough scale).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>How microscopic does a system have to be before you can consider it &quot;at that scale?&quot; Macroscopically speaking 1016 GeV is pretty small, like the energy of a car crash or the electricity to run the average American house for less than an hour, but clearly we aren't seeing Grand Unification in happen in a car crash.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since other responses don't seem to be clearly touching this:</p>
<p>If a physicist quotes an energy or energy scale in this context they are talking about single particle energy, or perhaps the collision energy of two particles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mass of X, Y bosons that suppose to mediate GUTs are theorized to have the mass of approx 10^16 GeV.</p>
<p>To have them mediate the new GUT force, you need to create them, ie collide particles together with enough energy (10^16 GeV) to spawn them, and then let them do their stuff. </p>
<p>It is true that in a car crash, the energy release is orders and orders more than any GeV, but those are over the 10^29 particles per car. Averaged over each particle, its very much less. Even so, the particles never really collide head on with each other, Its mostly the degeneracy force of atoms pushing on each other. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
