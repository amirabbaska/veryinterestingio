		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of those companies are losing money today because they are investing in scaling their businesses, lobbying for changes in laws to allow them to operate legally. Once those expenses are tapered off, then the revenue they take in will become profitable.</p>
<p>Right now, much of Uber's loses are from offering free rides to new customers and paying signing bonuses to new drivers. Additionally, they are fighting battles with city governments legislatively and in court to be allowed to operate legally.</p>
<p>Similarly, DraftKings is spending a TON of money advertising all over the place, offering new users credits to their accounts, and spending lots of money on lawyers/lobbying to try and become legal.</p>
<p>In both cases, these are start-up costs and not long term operating costs... once each had a user base installed, and has won the approvals to operate, the revenues will go to the bottom line. And because of the nature of their businesses, they can scale with minimal marginal costs compared to other businesses/industries.</p>
<p>Other companies may be drawing in revenue, just not to the extreme levels VCs and others wanted to see (Twitter), or have freemium models (Box) that do generate revenue and a path toward prifitability. </p>
<p>Some are simply cool gimmicks/features and not sustainable businesses, but are still acquisition targets to be integrated into a platform (SnapChat) or will eventually find some sort of revenue model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that they're getting something with the potential to be the next Google ($550 bil) or Facebook ($344 bil) at $1 billion or $25 billion. The price is sort of like a low chance bet, that has a massive potential payoff, and even if it doesn't payoff, you've got a decent shot of making a small profit even in cases where your investment is acquired.  </p>
<p>Look at long term bond rates, that's the hurdle for many wealthy investors (either as the marginal investment or close to their borrowing cost).  If you knew you'd remain safely rich if you were wrong, how much 2% interest would you be willing to miss for a slim chance at owning 5% of the next $100 billion company?   </p>
<p>Uber is entirely a bet that self driving cars will allow them to reshape how people buy transportation (rather than owning a &quot;car&quot; you'll own 0.1% of a 100 car fleet that will swing by you when you need to use one).  </p>
<p>DraftKings is a bet that using the internet and the fantasy sports exception, allows someone to become the equivalent of the biggest bookie on the internet.  </p>
<p>ClassPass has a chance to reshape how people buy gym memberships (and they'll get a cut from each of them).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I read an interesting article that argues that every new company has two growth models to choose from: Ben &amp; Jerry's or Amazon. In other words, low and slow or high and fast. The model you choose is based on your competition. You either have to compete on a product and brand recognition level (Ben &amp; Jerry's) or through a massive land grab that will secure your place at the top (Amazon.) These multi billion dollar tech valuations are all companies who are building brand new markets and they are rushing as fast as possible to grab as much market share as they possibly can, hoping profit will come. They spare no expense in order to become the biggest, with the idea that being the biggest will inevitably become the most profitable. That's why they can't turn a profit now. Amazon didn't turn a profit for 26 quarters, but they were still taking in billions and billions in revenue, but were losing money because they were reinvesting in themselves or spending hand over fist to save time. Following a Ben &amp; Jerry's growth model of profitability and growth in a brand new market will leave them in the dust, because someone else will step in and grab market share at the expense of profit. They're playing the long game. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Company makes 100 million in revenue in a year. Their total operating costs are 80 million. In order to remain viable and retain traction, the company knows it needs to expand rapidly to fend off competitors, so it sources additional financing to spend another 50 million on expanding.</p>
<p>On the books, the company lost 30 million this year.</p>
<p>In reality they made 20million profit in existing markets and plugged that plus another 30 into expanding their business.</p>
<p>The next year they make 160 million of which 120 million is operating costs. So they've covered last year's defecit plus 10 mill. So this time they spend another 60 million expanding further.</p>
<p>Now they've lost 30 million in year 1, and a further 20. Million in year 2, but in reality they're 40 million in debt with additional growth financed for year 3.</p>
<p>In year 3 they consolidate their market share as they find its saturated and further expansion isn't viable. They make 220 million in profit, and spend 170 million on costs. They've made 50 million, paying off the debt they owe, being 10 million in profit. </p>
<p>Sounds like they've barely scraped through when, realistically, they've doubled down on repeated investments and ended up with a company making 60 million in profit a year, when they previously made 20 million.</p>
<p>Obviously these numbers are a made-up example, but this is the basic premise many of these rapidly expanding companies work on. Amazon did the same for almost 20 years by moving into newer markets to keep expansion investment high; e-readers, net infrastructure, groceries, TV, 3rd party warehousing. Huge list of shit that came from AN ONLINE BOOKSHOP. Netflix did the same by doubling down on expansion and service provision until they became ubiquitous with streamed TV. Now they slowly bring their price up, start making their own content and 'suddenly' they make money.</p>
<p><em>TL:Dr</em> Companies gain value by spending more than they earn because they're not spending more than they can afford to repay with projected growth from the additional expense. If they actually stopped investing in growth for a year they'd make a sizeable profit but also suffer from a years lack of expansion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>You described it pretty well. The other way I thought of it was like scholarships for universities. They're giving you money now on the assumption that you will one day make a lot of money and in turn make them money.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
