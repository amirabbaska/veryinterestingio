		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a guy who has worked professionally as a sound engineer, I'll tell you, your hearing acuity goes just as soon, if not sooner. The difference is that most people don't rely on the detail-oriented parts of their hearing as much, at least not consciously, so you notice your eyes first.</p>
<p>Have you ever noticed that when you're tired it's easier for someone to walk up next to you or behind you and you to not hear them? Or that you don't really hear what is being said to you?</p>
<p>In a studio environment, the first way I notice that I'm getting tired and it's time to call it a day is that I can't discern details as easily.</p>
<p>It's all about input, sensory stress, and what you are focused on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ophthalmologist here.I don't see anyone touch on the right answer so I'll chime in. </p>
<p>Our neutral eye position is actually not looking straight ahead, but actually directed outward towards your ears (this is known as exotropia). In fact, if you look at a picture of our bony orbits, they actually point away from each other. Our eyes overcome this by constantly converging, or turning both of your eyes toward each other.  We are very good at this, as demonstrated by how easy it is to cross our eyes, but nearly impossible to move our eyes in separate directions in any other fashion.  Whenever the fusion of our two eyes is broken, most people tend to have their eyes drift towards their ears (this is called exophoria).  When we get tired, this exophoria happens more as the drive to fuse our two eyes diminishes. This causes a slight double vision and describes what you are referring to.</p>
<p>Fun fact, as you can imagine, our eyes drift towards our ears when we fall asleep for the reason I described above.    Babies are generally born with their eyes drifted outwards. And our eyes drift outwards when we pass away. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you feel your eyes (or body) starting to shut off, you'll notice your arms will weigh a metric ton. Your head is more an Easter Island head. Everything becomes foggy.  It's sneaky and you might not even notice i happening.  </p>
<p>This is (from what I understand) your body releasing natural melatonin and trying to get you to crash.  It's actually easy to get rid of, short term at least.  </p>
<p>Just stand up. Shake your head like a dog. Do jumping jacks.  Walk around the room. Do push-ups.  Just moving your blood a little will do wonders.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary thing keeping your eyes focused are these small, thin, muscles attached to your lens. When you're tired, these muscle relax and the tension is released, causing the lens of change shape and therefore your vision gets blurry. Your other senses are a bit more passive in that you can't really turn then off. There's no muscles that govern taste or smell as they are chemical senses, so when odorant molecules enter your nose, it stimulates those receptors. Same with your tongue. Hearing is governed by a small membrane in your inner ear that converts sound waves in the air to ripples in a fluid filled organ. When the fluid vibrates, it also vibrates tiny hair cells that convert that into a an electric impulse that your brain perceives as hearing a&quot;sound&quot;.  In order for your eyes to receive light, your lens needs to focus it onto your retina through your pupil. But if the muscles holding the lens are slack from fatigue, it doesn't bend to focus the light and your vision becomes blurry. In that regard, vision is the first &quot;sense&quot; to deteriorate when tired/sleepy, as it's the only sense that requires musculature assistance (in this case, for focalization of light through the flexion of the ocular lens)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Throughout the day, I would argue it is the most strained of our 5 senses. Especially in our culture today, from a young age, you're required to focus on computer screens, smart phones, and do not give your focused sight enough rest. </p>
<p>When you think about it, our vision has to meet very high demands throughout the day: driving, reading, computer usage, phone usage, etc, but we don't give it proper breaks, we work in poor lighting conditions, we subject our eyes to high contrasts, the list goes on. I don't know if this helps, but it's my attempt.</p>
<p>Edit: grammar</p>
<p>Someone said that I didn't have any basis for what I was saying, so I pulled some references (first is the best, from 1875):</p>
