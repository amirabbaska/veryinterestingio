		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is nothing as fundamental as the speed of light to restrict the possible size/mass of large objects, but there are practical limits. Just like you guess, large enough objects in the absence of an external source of energy will implode in a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_collapse" target="_blank">gravitational collapse</a>.</p>
<p>To see why, think of a big star. Each bit of matter in that star is pulling on the rest, so that in effect gravity is trying to pull the whole thing together. But for a long time, that doesn't happen. The reason is that the nuclear reactions in the core of the star heat the crap out of the surrounding gases, which creates a pressure (called the thermal pressure) that opposes gravity. For a long while the star is stable under the equilibrium of these two forces (the fancy term for this situation is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrostatic_equilibrium" target="_blank">hydrostatic equilibrium</a>).</p>
<p>But at one point the star will no longer be able to produce enough heat to offset gravity and then what happens next depends on its size (and more specifically the size of the core):</p>
<ol>
<li>For stars with a core smaller than ~1.4 solar masses, the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chandrasekhar_limit#Super-Chandrasekhar_mass_supernovae" target="_blank">Chandrasekhar limit</a>, the star will start to collapse, but it will stop to form a small body called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf" target="_blank">white dwarf</a>. The reason further collapse doesn't happen is that electrons don't like to be crammed together in an ever smaller space. This effect (which is a result of a rule in quantum mechanics called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle" target="_blank">Pauli Exclusion Principle</a>) creates an effective pressure called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron_degeneracy_pressure" target="_blank">electron degeneracy pressure</a> that prevents further collapse.</li>
<li>If the mass is between 1.4 and ~3 solar masses, the gravity is so strong that it can overcome the electron degeneracy pressure. At that point the matter will collapse into the densest star known, called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star" target="_blank">neutron star</a> that is made up almost entirely of neutrons. At this point a new kind of degeneracy pressure, this time from neutrons can prevent further collapse. </li>
<li>If the mass is larger than ~3 solar masses, all hell breaks loose. At that point there is no known force that can prevent further collapse and the star ends up as a black hole.</li>
</ol>
<p>edit: The ranges I gave work best for the core of a star, or more generally for the part of any massive object that ends up collapsing inwards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Currently, there is evidence towards that the universe is expanding at an exponential rate. This means that as times goes on the universe stretches faster and faster into the distance, to the point when light itself is not fast enough to catch up. By then, Objects are &quot;flying&quot; away from you faster than light can get back to you, and you can never see them again.
This seems to go on forever and the universe's size limit might only be limited by quantum fluctuation that could change the laws of physics in pocket and thus affect that region of the universe itself. How big these pockets can get is speculative. Can they overtake the universe expanding faster than the speed of light? I don't think we have the information yet to answer this, but perhaps the pocket universe can expand into a mini universe inside the big one, with a big bang, matter and all but with potentially different rules of physics, and thus rendering your question obsolete.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the universe is compact (i.e. of finite size), then nothing can be bigger than the universe. If it's infinite, there are no size limits.</p>
<p>If you look at objects at a fixed density, then at a certain size they will collapse into a black hole. But if I'm allowed to make my &quot;object&quot; arbitrarily sparse, there is no limit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Size isn't mass. Galaxies are huge, but their matter is spread out over a large enough area to avoid the density that causes gravitational collapse.</p>
<p>The explanation given helps explain why objects beyond a certain mass density and overall gravitational field strength will eventually collapse down to a smaller size under their own gravity.</p>
<p>However, there's also the issue of actual size of a non-stellar, engineered object.</p>
<p>What would limit us from making a building the size of a galaxy, or the Universe itself? If we were careful we could avoid gravitational collapse... but there are other issues.</p>
<p>Molecular bonds have specific strengths. As soon as a shearing force exceeds this strength, the bonds break and so does the material they are a part of. </p>
<p>So, let's think about the massive leverage we have to deal with when we're talking about thousands of light years of distance in a single structure: it won't take much of an acceleration in one place to produce a massive shearing force in another part of the structure that will shred the material it's made out of.</p>
<p>Spacetime itself shifts and folds... it is malleable, which is why (at least as far as we know) you get shredded by stellar mass black holes long before you cross the event horizon.</p>
<p>At such a large size, the changing gravitational pulls on such a large object from neighboring galaxies as they move, impact from quasar jets, rotational motion, etc. will probably be more than enough to impose an actual maximum size limit based on the material properties of whatever we try to use in the construction of said object.</p>
<p>I just wanted to share that opinion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer to this requires a better definition of the word &quot;object&quot;.  </p>
<p>Are galaxy walls or filaments 'objects'?  They are bound together by the same gravitational force that stars are, after all. Some of them span a good portion of the observable universe (hundreds of millions, even <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.1104" target="_blank">billions of light years</a>).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
