		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nations are particular about their airspace, but how far that airspace extends is debatable. Now whether they have the power to do anything about it, and whether doing so would be considered a hostile act or a defensive act is debatable. </p>
<p>That being said though, it's not possible to put a satellite in permanent position over most countries because of the Earths spin. We would call such an orbit geostationary meaning from the ground the satellite doesn't appear to move, because it's orbiting the Earth at the same rate the Earth is spinning. The only stable orbit in that setup is around the Earths equator in a narrow range of latitude. </p>
<p>Spy satellites tend to orbit at an incline to the equator which allows an orbit that progresses over time, like using a pen to progressively paint a white ping pong ball black tracing one line next to another line over and over. By having several satellites in overlapping orbits it is possible to keep continuous view of a country though as one satellite moves too far away, another is coming into range. </p>
<p>It would be possible to move a satellite above any country and hold it there, but it would expend fuel doing so and could not do it indefinitely. Equatorial geostationary orbits though are stable without fuel (other than minor corrections) and the use of those geostationary spots (there is limited space up there in that narrow band) is governed by international treaty and businesses that hold licenses for those spots. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What can be put into space and what activities can be conducted there is regulated by international treaties at least partially through the <a href="http://www.unoosa.org/oosa/index.html" target="_blank">United Nations Office of Outer Space Affairs</a>. Among the agreements contained in those treaties is the agreement that: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>outer space and celestial bodies (e.g. the Moon or any of the planets) cannot be claimed as the territory of any nation, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that every nation has the right to the peaceful use and exploration of space, </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that no nation can place weapons of mass destruction into space nor build military bases in space or on any celestial bodies, and </p>
</li>
<li>that nations that launch objects into space must register them (generally describing their purpose and intended orbit) with the Secretary General who publishes a registry of the objects and who owns them.</li>
</ul>
<p>So in short, any nation can place non-weaponized objects in space as long as they tell the Secretary General of the United Nations about it. </p>
<p>The treaties also cover private actors like SpaceX or Blue Origin and there are national laws and bodies that govern the extraterrestrial activities of domestic private entities (e.g. FAA regulates launches in the United States under the Commercial Space Launch Act).</p>
<p>This area of law called (unsurprisingly) Space Law, and is an actively practiced specialization for at least a few lawyers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5 version:
Sattelites in space move in really strange ways from our perspective on the ground. Because of this, the idea of something in space staying direclty &quot;over&quot; a country is almost impossible unless the country is really near the equator. The reality is that satellites fly over many, many countries depending on their orbit (e.g. the international space station flies over almost every single country every day or two).</p>
<p>Any sovereign nation can place a satellite in space that flies over another. This is part of the reason why the Cold War did not escalate further, the Russians could see what Americans were doing and the Americans could see what Russians were doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember watching a documentary about Sputnik (1950s) and the contemporaneous American space program. According to the show, this was a real concern at the time. The American's were purportedly okay with Russia getting a satellite into space first and letting it cross international &quot;borders&quot; in orbit because it would set the precedent that space wasn't part of a nation's air space, and would allow the Americans to launch their own satellite without concern of escalating tensions. Edit: Can't spell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
