<p>Hair is fairly easy for your body to generate. It's made of protein, specifically keratin. By the time you reached a severe enough protein deficiency to affect hair growth, you'd have bigger health problems to worry about.</p>
<p>Realistically; yes. A lot of areas are naturally void of hair follicles (soles of your feet, inside creases for elbows etc.), meaning you'd need to transplant them there with surgery, and it's may not &quot;take&quot; in thicker skin very well.</p>
<p>Hair also rarely maintains it's strength as it grows. While a &quot;perfect&quot; system should be able to generate an infinite perfect hair strand, external factors (shampoos, environmental wear and tear, radiation, androgen imbalance, all kinds of things) usually degrade hair quality. It <em>is</em> possible to grow Rapunzel-length hair with some determination, but the majority of humans aren't going to achieve it. The longest hair on record was about 18 feet long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
