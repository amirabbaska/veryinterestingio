		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people think that it's CamKII/NMDAR. It sits in between neurons that are connected. As they fire together, the complex strengthens the association between the two neurons. The process involves successive incidents of calcium binding. This is called a &quot;molecular coincidence detector.&quot; As the neurons fire together more frequently, they become wired together. Neat!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Memory and learning are a result of a combination of within-system and between-system adaptations.  If a &quot;memory&quot; is represented in the brain as simultaneous firing of neurons A and B while neurons Q, R, and S are silent, it is stored by both enhancing the connection(s) between neurons A and B and by shutting down the ability of neurons A and B to listen to those unrelated signals.</p>
<p>Over time, firing of one neuron (A) tends to be paired with increased likelihood of another neuron firing (B). This can lead to both short-term increases in the sensitivity of neuron B to the firing of neuron A, and also neuron B starts completely ignoring neurons Q, R, and S because they seem to fire &quot;randomly&quot;, as far as neuron B is concerned. The mechanisms of that sensitization can include the placement of receptors at the synapse between neuron A and neuron B (either because the cell ships a bunch of pre-built receptors to the synapse or because the cell stars making more receptors so just keep a larger population of them handy at all times), as /u/Wakebrite references, but also the development of new synapses--now, neuron A and neuron B synapse on each other three different times, so if neuron A fires off an action potential, it's way more likely (although not quite 3 times as likely!) that neuron B will also depolarize and send ANOTHER action potential. If the two neurons fire together enough, you'll see that maybe neuron B completely loses the ability to listen to neurons Q, R, and S due to epigenetic silencing through a process called DNA methylation, which basically makes a cell unable to express certain genes anymore. Essentially, neuron B could eventually lose the ability to build new synapses to Q, R, or S because it's got enough with those that connect to neuron A, thanks--this firmly solidifies the relationship between neurons A and B.  You can also get other kinds of adaptations, too--neuron B may just become generally more likely to fire over time, which could accelerate this whole process (and also BE accelerated by this whole process).</p>
<p>The distinction between short-term memory and long-term memory is roughly the distinction between how long it takes for these different adaptations to take place. Putting an extra receptor that already existed in the cell into a synapse might take minutes or hours and also might only last a few minutes or hours; making new receptors will take longer but also last longer; but pruning a whole dendrite off a cell because the synapses it connects to seem irrelevant will take days or even weeks of repeated stimulation of A to B but not Q,R,S to B, and may last a really long time if you just activate the network every once in a while to maintain those connections.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your asking something that isn't really known right now. After MIT figured out that memories in rats could be brought forth by a laser on specific neurons/neuron clusters and that the Npas4 gene is what allows us to even form memories (without it you wouldn't remember anything) the question then became HOW they are encoded. That is something that's being worked on. We know that activating a cluster of neurons can cause you to remember your first kiss - but why? We just don't know yet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
