		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically nerves have electric switches on them that allow current to flow through and that creates all sensations. Including pain. When you hurt yourself, some of these switches (called TRPs) trip causing the 'pain sensation'.</p>
<p>Now there is a particular switch (NaV1.9) that gets turned on by the cold and it has the effect of making the other switches easier to activate. So if it's cold, NaV1.9 is in the on position and that makes the pain switches trip faster and more frequently...enhancing the pain sensation.</p>
<p>Basically it sort of sucks that the same switches that cause pain are also sensitive to temperature changes. The reason for the cold pain is that you probably want to know your finger is freezing   <em>before</em> it dies of frostbite. </p>
<p>PS: I hate it when specialized neurobiology has to be ELI5ed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
