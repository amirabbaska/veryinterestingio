		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had a poke around the literature to see whether it's really true that solar metallicity is unusually high. The answer is that, yes, it is significantly higher than the average, but it has plenty of company and isn't an outlier.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/THF6zm7" target="_blank">This plot</a> is a histogram of the metallicities of 14,000 F and G dwarf stars in our neighbourhood. The sun's [ME/H] is, by definition, 0; from this plot it appears the mean for the sample is about 72% of solar metallicity. However, as you can see there's a broad distribution. We appear to be in the top quartile of that distribution, so we have plenty of company. </p>
<p>According to the source you cited, scientists &quot;aren’t sure why. It could be that the Sun formed in a part of the Galaxy that had an abundance of metals, and then migrated to its present position.&quot; Well of course it did. It formed from a molecular cloud that was a little richer in metals than others found in the galaxy. That's also true of lots of other stars who have since mixed and scattered throughout the galaxy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you for the responses so far!  Maybe I'm just missing it, but it doesn't seem like any of the responses have exactly hit on the question I have, though.</p>
<p>I understand what metallicity refers to in regards to stars.  <strong>What I don't understand is what makes the Sun's metallicity &quot;unusual&quot; in comparison to what one would expect based on our Sun's age and type</strong>, as the initial article appears to be implying.  The metallicity of the Sun seems to be exactly what you would expect based on its age, type and location - so I don't understand why the article would state it as being unusual.</p>
<p>Here's the full quote from the article:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Our Sun is unusually metal-rich for a star of its age and type. Scientists aren’t sure why. It could be that the Sun formed in a part of the Galaxy that had an abundance of metals, and then migrated to its present position.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That quote seems to be implying that you wouldn't expect to find a star with the Sun's metallicity in this part of the galaxy.  Yet the Wikipedia article appears to be saying the exact opposite -- that this area of the galaxy is known for producing stars of exactly this metallicity.</p>
<p><strong>Are the two articles simply contradicting each other, or am I missing something?  Is there something about the Sun that makes its location in the galaxy surprising, metallicity or otherwise?</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>EDIT:  This just popped into my head.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but metal-rich stars would generally form in one of the &quot;busy&quot; parts of the galaxy - specifically, the arms or center.  These &quot;busy&quot; areas would generally have the materials needed to form a metal-rich star.  Yet our sun is not located in one of the arms or center -- it's located between two arms, in a bit of a galactic dead-zone (relatively speaking).  Thus, this relatively barren location in the galaxy does not appear to have the type of environment that would be conducive to producing a metal-rich star.  Thus, it makes the Sun's location a bit surprising?  Is that the gist?  And if so...is this actually unusual?  I just assumed it'd be quite common for a star to drift from it's &quot;birthplace&quot; to another part of the galaxy.  Is it unusual to find metal-rich/population I stars outside of the arms/center, like our Sun?</p>
<p>Then again, the article mentions it being unusual because of its age and type, not simply because of its location.  So I guess I'm still back at square one...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to clarify the point about population I stars in spiral arms and the Sun's position just outside of a spiral arm.</p>
<p>The Sun is <em>currently</em> located just outside of a spiral arm, but it hasn't been there for the entirety of its lifetime.  The Sun, like most stars in the Milky Way, orbits the galactic centre at a different angular velocity to the angular velocity of the spiral pattern.  This means that over the course of the Sun's lifetime it has moved into, through, and out of spiral arms on many occasions.</p>
<p>The relative frequency of population I stars in spiral arms is related to the above phenomenon.  Spiral arms are regions of high density interstellar medium and are therefore the regions that dominate stellar formation.  When low-mass stars are formed there, they live for long enough to travel out of the spiral arm, whereas when high-mass stars are formed, they end up as supernovae before they can leave.  This is why we observe more young stars inside the spiral arms than out.</p>
<p>So, when looked at in terms of movement through the galactic spiral pattern, the Sun isn't really a young star at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In astronomy, a metal is basically anything over Lithium (or maybe it was Carbon, it's been a while). Most of these &quot;metals,&quot; ie. heavier elements, are created in the center of stars, and are distributed throughout the universe during novae (and anything heavier than Iron is created in a novae itself.) So to say that a star is metal rich, is saying that it was born after other stars have died. The material from which the sun formed, contained the remains of dead stars. We can learn something about when the star was formed by looking at its metal content. For example, the very first generation of stars in our universe had a very low metal content. Only a very small percentage of matter was converted to anything heavier than Lithum during the big bang. So the building blocks of the first stars were metal-poor. Seeing a metal-rich star tells us that it was born after other stars have died.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if that answers your question, but that's what I remember from my astronomy degree many years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
