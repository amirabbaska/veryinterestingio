		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For light sources to be coherent, they must be monochromatic (one colour) and have a constant phase difference between them.</p>
<p>The monochromatic-ness is easy to achieve, just use a source which produces only one wavelength of light.</p>
<p>For the constant phase difference, a single slit was often used before the gratings, or double slit, or whatever equipment the experiment was using. This works because the single slit acts as a point source, and therefore, as long as it is not moving relative to the other  gratings/slits, will mean there is a constant phase difference between the sources.</p>
<p>Hope this is correct and answers your question :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I was in graduate school we discussed Young's two slit experiment in some detail. It turns out that what we discussed was not exactly on the mark with what wikipedia says on the topic:</p>
<p>&quot;Strictly speaking, there was no double slit in the original experiment as described by Young. Instead, the sunlight reflected off a steering mirror passed through a small hole in a paper, and the resulting thin light beam was then split in half alongside a paper card&quot;</p>
<p>Both the discussion we had in grad school and the wikipedia entry have one thing in common: the source was sunlight. Sunlight illuminates a small hole or a slit. At some distance from this hole/slit the &quot;light source&quot; originating from the hole/slit is now spatially coherent. That is to say, the light waves at different points in space have consistent phase relationships. When we talk about these experiments it is that &quot;spatial coherence&quot; that matters as it allows the observer to see the diffraction pattern. </p>
<p>Lasers create light that is both spatially coherent and temporally coherent. That is, the phase of light at a single point in space is highly consistent, in addition to the phases at different points in space being highly consistent.</p>
<p>Diffraction can be observed with spatially coherent light. To see speckle though one needs temporally coherent light. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They used gases and prisms/diffraction gratings to separate wavelength. Then you collimate the output of that. You can also focus it down to a spatial filter then collimate it from there too.</p>
<p>Edit: to sum it up. You get a specific emission line from an ionized gas and separate it using prisms/difraction gratings. Then you pass it through a spatial filter to clean up the wavefront. From there you collimate the result and you get a somewhat coherent single wavelength source.</p>
<p>I remember doing something like this back in the dark ages lol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
