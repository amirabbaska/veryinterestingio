		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>It would,  in fact,  be pretty trivial to do this for humans,  but note that there is no evidence to support the idea that kibble is an ideal food for dogs.   There are plenty of maladies that we consider &quot;normal&quot;  for dogs that may or may not be something that a better more varied diet might help.  I've heard plenty of (anecdotal)  evidence from pet owners who switch to rmb or a raw food diet for their pets that are noteworthy in that way.  <br><br>Edit.   Apparently I a word. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">
