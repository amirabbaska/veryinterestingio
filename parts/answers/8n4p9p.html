		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First question - is long exposure necessary for deep space photography?  In short, yes.  How long depends on the light gathering capability of your telescope, the sensitivity of your camera, and the brightness of the object of interest.  The reason is that most of these objects are very dim, meaning a relatively few number of “photons” strikes the camera sensor, as compared to a bright object.   That means you have to expose your camera sensor to the image for a longer period of time to get a reasonably clear (low noise) photo.  </p>
<p>Second question - can you see the center of the Milky Way with a decent telescope?   Actually, you’re better off using a wide angle camera lens because the Milky Way is so huge.   A telescope of any appreciable focal length would reduce your field of view and limit what you can see.  Search for some Milky Way photos online and you’ll see what I mean.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, let's do some math.</p>
<p>Imagine a star like the Sun, it has a luminosity of about 4e26 Watts. Now, let's take a SWAG and say that as much as about half of that power is radiated in the visible spectrum with an average photon energy of 1.8 electron-Volts (around 700 nm light). That means a star like our Sun is radiating about 1.4e45 photons per second.</p>
<p>OK, that's a huge number, but remember we're also talking about huge distances. So, let's say, oh, a distance of 25,000 light years (the distance from the Earth to the center of the Milky Way). That 1.4e45 photons per second is now being distributed over a sphere that is 25kly in radius, or 7.0e41 m^2 , which translates to a photon flux of just 2k photons per m^2 per second. Now, your backyard telescope might have a mirror diameter of 10&quot; (25.4 cm), which means it has a total light gathering area of a bit under 0.2 m^2 . Meaning that only 400 photons per second from a Sun-like star near the core of the Milky Way will be falling into your telescope. Factor in light scattering and imager detector efficiency (plus atmospheric absorption) and you get an even smaller number. A &quot;full&quot; pixel on a standard imager is going to be around 50k electrons, with somewhere around an average of 0.7-0.8 electrons per photon striking the pixel. So, again as a SWAG assume you transform half of the photons falling into the front of the telescope into detectable electrons in the imager, that means it would take 250 seconds to fully saturate a single pixel with this particular star. You don't want to do that, and you will have much brighter stars in the frame, but that gives you a perspective on the timescales at play, you want the brightest star in the scene to be nearly at maximum saturation in order to maximize the dynamic range your imager is capable of picking.</p>
<p>Also, there is noise in the sensor to contend with. Noise is random so when you add up many different images of the same object the image itself gets clearer while the noise mostly cancels/evens itself out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The signal scales with the number of incident photons. The noise scales with the square-root of the number of incident photons.</p>
<p>So longer exposures lead to better, lower noise images.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good metaphorical way to think about it, might be like this: </p>
<p>It's all about the number of photons, filling up your light-bucket! </p>
<hr />
<p>If your shutter (tap) is open for just a short burst, you'll only get a few photons in your light-bucket. </p>
<hr />
<p>If, however, your shutter is open for a long time... </p>
<p>then you're going to fill that bucket up with a richness of all kinds of photons (with each photon carrying significant data from the distant universe). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
