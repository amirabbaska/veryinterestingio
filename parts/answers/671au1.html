		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple things that change prior to 1 year. As mentioned, both the gut microbiome and theimmune system are relevant to the homey one, but this isn't AT 1 year, but BY one year. In the first weeks you have a very large increase in stomache size, allowingbabies to consume larger meals less frequently. This slows down, but continues even past 1 year. Of course, teeth become a factor allowing for more foods, as does the size of the throat in regards to choking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know the gut microbiome might play an important role in our immune system, a view that is getting increased support. However, the full development of the gut microbiome is only complete 2-3 years following birth, which is significantly more than the 1 year cutoff that you describe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue (in my understanding) is that raw honey contains bacterial mould spores which in essence will create &quot;food poisoning&quot; in the form of botulism.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't by any means a complete response, but among many things:</p>
<p>The avoidance for sugar/salt is because 1) At very young ages, they can't taste much of anything anyway because they haven't developed all the taste buds and 2) a lot of adults have tastes adjusted by what they eat daily, which may be more than generally recommended and is certainly the last thing you want a child to be accustomed to, when excessive sugar and salt intake isn't necessarily healthy.</p>
<p>In first worldâ€‹ countries, the trend is to wean kids off breast milk by 1 year of age, and in doing so you are removing their default source of antibodies (to protect their immune system), easily digested iron and good fats (to name a few). Now, kids still have a developing immune system, as well as a developing gut that's needs to learn to produce the right amount of enzymes to digest foods they are introduced to, and there's definitely studies out there that indicate the immune system's development has some sort of relation to the gut bacteria present that changes as the child grows, but nothing's been pinpointed yet. There are recommended diets and vaccinations to take/give them to help them along with this, but overall I have no idea why &quot;1 year&quot; is important in a biological sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
