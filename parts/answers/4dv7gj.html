		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Someone says you've done something bad, so you are arrested and you go before a judge that will decide whether or not to take them seriously -- not to decide if you did something bad, just to decide if it's possible.<br><br>The judge says &quot;OK, maybe you did something bad, but it's going to take a lot of time to get everyone together to figure this out.&quot; Then, &quot;You're innocent until someone proves otherwise, so it wouldn't be fair to punish you before you've gone to court; is there anyone here that has a problem with me letting this person go home until their trial comes?&quot;<br><br>At that point, the prosecutor says something like: &quot;well, this guy has already been in prison for murder before&quot; or &quot;let me show you the video of him eating the victim&quot; and the judge will respond &quot;wow, that's super serious - you can't go home because I think you might be dangerous; bail refused&quot;.<br><br>Or, the prosecutor will say something like: &quot;Well, this is a very serious thing and what if they run away?&quot; and the judge might say, &quot;I see that, but this person's never had problems before; I'll tell you what, how about we agree that they set aside some money in an account; if they don't come back to court when they're supposed to they lose the money and you can use it to pay someone to go get them - in exchange, we let them carry on with their lives until the trial&quot; at which point the judge will consult a table and lookup some customary figure for bail.<br><br>Lastly the judge can just say, &quot;well, this is just stupid, this person's a well known member of the community, the crime isn't particularly violent and the situation doesn't seem to indicate that they'd do something like that again, even if they did do it, so the person can go without bail as long as they promise to come back later&quot;.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Like other people have stated, bail is only for a defendants awaiting trial and is offered on a case by case basis. A judge can choose to offer no bail and hold a defendant until trial or even &quot;ROR&quot; a defendant (release own recognizance) where no bail is set but the defendant is released.  <br><br> Bail is determined by Posted Bail Schedules which are predetermined  amounts for specific crimes that vary from one jurisdiction to the next. After that, what's taken into account is the severity of the crime, ties to the community, criminal record, outstanding warrants, probability of making court dates, flight risk, and risk to public safety. <br>  <br>Bail can also be set with equity not just cash. Its actually an agreement with the court and/or prosecutor that you will return for your court date or trial. Allowing defendants to post bail helps keep jails from being completely overcrowded. Low risk, first time offenders, and white collar criminals are spared the risks of being in jail or prison. The biggest advantage is that saves taxpayers tons of money (65k/year per inmate is average cost to taxpayers). </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>(Former criminal defense attorney here.)<br><br>Bail (as used in the the United States) serves several purposes. When a court grants bail, it essentially makes the defendant promise to come back to court so the criminal justice process can proceed properly. To ensure that the defendant lives up to that promise, the court may require payment (in the form of money or property), require the defendant to report to a court officer or comply with other limitations or restrictions, or both. Defendants on bail who fail to return as promised risk losing the bail money they've paid, as well as risk being kept in jail until their case is over.<br><br>There are several reasons why courts allow bail. First, it allows those charged with crimes to continue to live their lives (work, raise a family, etc.) while they are awaiting the outcome of their case. Otherwise defendants would have to remain in jail until the cases against them are concluded, which could take months or even years. This would mean keeping people in jail even though they have yet to be convicted of a crime.<br><br>Second, by requiring payments or imposing restrictions, bail allows courts to give defendants an additional motivation to return. Namely, if defendants fail to return or flee, they lose the money they've paid.<br><br>Third, by allowing a court to refuse to grant bail where defendants pose a risk to others or are likely to flee, <br>it allows the court to protect the safety of the community and ensure the integrity of the criminal justice process.<br><br>So, bail is not a punishment imposed against those who have been accused of a crime, it's a way to ensure the that criminal defendants appear in court as needed while simultaneously protecting the community and giving accused criminals the ability to live their lives while the charges against them have yet to be proven.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>You'd had a response from a US perspective, so I'll give you the UK answer.<br><br>Here, as in the US, it still comes down to being innocent until proven guilty - therefore, if you're awaiting trial you should remain free.<br><br>However, we will put restrictions on someone on bail - we won't insist on money like in the US, but the court might insist that they report to the police daily/weekly/whatever, remain at a certain address or perhaps surrender their passport.<br><br>That said, if someone has been charged with a particularly serious crime, or the court believe there's a high likelihood of reoffending, then bail will be denied.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">
