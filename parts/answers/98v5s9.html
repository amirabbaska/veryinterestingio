		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually when you hyperventilate into the bag , the rise of concentration of c02 ( you inhale less than 1 percent and exhale about 4 percent ) in the bag , which is what you end up inhaling (more c02), works on chemical receptors in your brain which makes you slow down your rate of breathing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The air in the bag has less and less oxygen every time you breath into it, and more co2, breathing in air like that forces your body to lower your heart rate as your body tries to conserve oxygen
Edit: Turns out I don’t know nearly as much about biology as I thought. Thanks to all the people that provided actually correct answers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your blood has a very specific pH balance. If it goes even a touch too high or low, bad things happen. When your lungs process oxygen, your blood becomes more basic. When your lungs process CO2, blood gets more acidic. Believe it or not, breathing pure oxygen isn’t good for you. Your blood has a system in place -called buffers- that give you some leeway either way so things like airplane oxygen masks and such won’t immediately wreck your system. </p>
<p>When you suffer a panic attack, you hyperventilate. The air doesn’t get to sit in your lungs for any appreciable amount of time, meaning your lungs don’t process any of the CO2 you’re creating. Eventually, the buffers will fail, and you will faint and pass out, as your body desperately tries to restore balance in your blood. </p>
<p>Breathing into a bag ensures that the CO2 your lungs produce will be breathed, regardless of the rate you’re breathing at. You couldn’t do it indefinitely (or even for very long without taking a spare outside-bag breath) since that would be the same as holding your breath. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When someone has a panic attack, they often breath very quickly, getting rid of lots of carbon dioxide. The presence of carbon dioxide normally tells blood vessels in your brain to dilate, so if you get rid of too much carbon dioxide, you blood vessels will constrict and reduce blood flow to the brain, so you could theoretically pass out. Breathing into the bag is supposed to return carbon dioxide to your lungs and prevent that.</p>
<p>However, if you find someone hyperventilating, you shouldn't default to having them breathe into a bag. If the problem is actually that they are short of breath (like having asthma, COPD, a pulmonary embolism, or a heart attack) then breathing into the bag will just make their problem worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Panic attacks usually cause you too lose CO2 at a rate at which your body cannot compensate the loss with its regulatory mechanisms. This may cause respiratory alkalosis. Breathing into a paper bag lets you retain the air you exhale, which has a higher concentration of CO2 compared to the atmosphere, which helps with the retention of CO2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
