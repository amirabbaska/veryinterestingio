		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To actually answer your question, Usually iron levels in womens and some other minerals are higher in mens vitamins (ie zinc). Often there are added herbs such as saw palmetto in mens for prostate support, etc. Women dont have a prostate, and their products often contain additions such as cranberry for UT health</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I develop multi vitamin and mineral tablets. I tend to leave iron out of men's tablets but that is about it.</p>
<p>Women lose iron from menstruation. Haemachromatosis (abnormal iron levels) is more common in men.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I sell vitamins and you don't start to see major differences until you get Into the men and womens age specific vitamins (e.g. 45/50+) which is generally where companies start to include added prostate support for men and menopausal support for women. There are a few other differences but honestly they are quite negibile and there is no harm in taking a women's multivitamin if you are a man and vice versa as long as you check the label. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
