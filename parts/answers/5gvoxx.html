<p>~20 keV (tritium as notable example) to the low MeV range. Yes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Are there even vast differences between beta decay energies of different isotopes to begin with? (I'm having some problems finding tables of beta decay energies and are finding weird (what seems like probability) graphs of energies. Cobalt-60 beta decay energy seems to be comparable(-ish) (in orders of magnitude) to carbon-14 decay energies if I understand things right).</p>

<p>Beta decay energies tend to be around 1 MeV, but there is some variance spanning between a few keV to a few MeV. There's also the fact that beta particles are not monoenergetic, since the final state in a beta decay has three particles. All three share the decay energy, and how much each one gets is not uniquely determined, as it would be for a two body final state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
