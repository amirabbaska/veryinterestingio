		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a glow in the dark molecule absorbs light, an electron is exited from a low energy state to a high energy state, you could think of it like a ball being lifted into the air. If you let the ball go, it'll fall back to the ground where it started. The same is true for the electron, except it &quot;falls&quot; via one of two quantum mechanical processes: fluorescence or phosphorescence. When the electron falls back down to the ground state, it emits a photon, which is what you see as the glow.</p>
<p>Fluorescence is basically instantaneous, so as soon as you turn off the light, the thing stops glowing, however phosphorescence has a much longer lifetime, up to a few hours. Once all the electrons have fallen back to the ground state, it stops glowing until you excite more electrons up (by shining a light on it again). </p>
<p>Edit: forgot to mention where the glow comes from</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the thread, there are &quot;glow-in-the-dark&quot; things that don't need to &quot;recharge&quot;. They are made with tiny bits of radioactive stuff (tritium or radium usualy) that emit the 'light' that will recharge the phosphor coating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot more fantastic than you think!  Unlike say LEDs, electrons are not involved:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence#Quantum_mechanical" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phosphorescence#Quantum_mechanical</a></p>
<p>Its a quantum mechanics phenomenon where the entire molecule ends up stuck in a triplet state with only &quot;forbidden transistions&quot; available to resolve it.  These rarely occur, so it takes a long time to release the energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Basically something called a phosphor absorbs light during the day and excretes it during night time. Green phosphors are common because they are easiest and cheapest to make. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
