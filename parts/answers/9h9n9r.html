		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food Scientist here. The answer: ABSOLUTELY YES!</p>
<p>First it's important to know WHAT rigor mortis is! Rigor mortis causes the carcasses (and meat!) to become stiff. This is because after the animal is dead, they are no longer eating food (adding energy to their system). Over time, the energy stored in their body (glycogen) is used up. This can cause the rigidity, off flavors, pH drops (acid production) etc. </p>
<p>In fact, some meat is called &quot;pre rigor&quot; and is used extremely quickly in order (some sausages will do this) in order to give a higher overall quality.</p>
<p>This varies from animal to animal. Someone mentioned how chickens are usually killed and processed quickly because of this, where other game can be left to do this to develop flavor.</p>
<p>But: ELI5: YES! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rigor mortis only lasts for a short time after death. When you kill a deer it will get rigor mortis pretty quickly, but they are hung for 24 hours and the rigor mortis goes away. It is not advised to butcher the meat while it has rigor mortis, or shortening will occur where the muscles retract and the meat becomes very tough. Animals are not hung to bleed out because the heart is not pumping as they hang, they are hung to let the rigor mortis subside. </p>
<p>Edit: As some posters have mentioned, the hanging is to also age the beef so that it becomes more tender. This occurs once the rigor stage stops and enzymes begin to break down the muscle tissue. This takes some time, but the outcome is much better. Some people leave the skin on, but if you have fridge it can be removed once rigor mortis has resolved itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rigor mortis is a natural process for all animals  though some cycles are longer than others  eg. Birds 1 day vs cows 7 or more even. Chemical changes in the body that first stiffen eventually tenderize. This process is effected by stress during slaughter, too much stress = no rigor = yucky meat that has a shorter shelf life. A surprise kill is likely going to yield better result vs an uncomfortable or scary trip to an unknown place. Proper bleed out will also effect the shelf life as blood spoils much quicker than the meat does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the meat you eat went though the rigor mortis process. And the majority of the meat you buy, fresh or frozen has been bled out to aid with cutting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
