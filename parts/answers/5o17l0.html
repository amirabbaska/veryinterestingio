		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The air inside a hot cookie is also hot.   Actually, fresh out of the oven the &quot;air&quot; inside a hot cookie is possibly steam. When this hot pieces fall into a cold liquid (like milk) the hot air contracts (or the steam is quenched) and a large fraction of the void space is filled with milk.   The cookie sinks.</p>
<p>When the cookies are not longer hot out of the oven, all of those spaces are already filled with relatively cooler air, so there is a smaller fraction of void space to fill with milk.  The cookie floats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know nothing about physics, but I have read a lot about baking. When coating a cake with a flavoured syrup that you want to sink into the crumb, I've read that it works best if the cake and syrup are different temperatures - either a still-hot cake with room-temperature syrup, or a cooled cake with heated syrup. I haven't been able to find any proof or spelled-out scientific explanation, but perhaps the hot cookies are drawing in the cold milk faster than the cooled cookies would? </p>
<p>Have you ever noticed how when you pour water on soil that is completely parched, a lot of it runs right out the bottom of the pot without seeming to wet the soil at all (I kill a lot of plants...)? But soil that's only a little dry will suck up water like a sponge. I don't know the reason for that either, but maybe it has something to do with things shrinking as they dry out so the openings water could seep into are narrower. Maybe also a similar effect? I would have thought pockets of steam within the crumb of the cookie would make it more buoyant, not less, but maybe the steam is also keeping those little pores open? Cold cookies are definitely more dense than ones fresh out of the oven (you can see them shrink as they cool), so better moisture-resistance is the only thing I can come up with that would explain the floating.</p>
<p>I'd be very interested to hear corrections from anyone with some real physics knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Complete shot in the dark here.</p>
<p>Hot cookies are still moist, while cold cookies are dry? A dry cookie has cavities containing air that are hard to reach by milk, and thus float. My guess is that if you cool down your cookies in a humid environment, they would not float. And be all mushy...</p>
<p>But that is pure speculation. I have difficulty running experiments that require to patiently wait for cookies to cool down. :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wheat flour produces a substance called gluten.  When a cookie (or other baked good) is baking, the baking soda activates and produces carbon dioxide gas.  This gas is trapped in the gluten structures and forms air pockets inside the cookie.</p>
<p>When a cookie is hot, these air pockets have not set properly.  So putting them in milk causes these structures to collapse as the cookie dough becomes dense and waterlogged as the milk and dough displace the carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>In a cool cookie, these structures have solidified to a degree.  Making the dough have a lower specific gravity than the milk, so it floats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
