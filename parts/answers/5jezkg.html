		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like the other dude, I'm not a physicist, but I've struggled a lot with the idea of how time can be finite. </p>
<p>I think I like the idea of a snail (with a million dollars) at the bottom of a skate-park half pipe.</p>
<p>Now he starts of slithering north, towards the slope of the half pipe, and he's getting on just fine.</p>
<p>Then about half way up, it's difficult, but he still continues north.</p>
<p>Now eventually, he gets to the point where he's on a vertical surface. At this point, there's no more &quot;north&quot;. He's only got the choice of up, down, east or west; but of course he can still slide back down just a tiny bit, and again there's an idea of north and south again.</p>
<p>In my analogy, I reckon North is the direction we call back in time. </p>
<p>We can back as far as a point, but then as the time and space get curved &quot;back&quot; becomes more and more meaningless, to the point where it doesn't even mean anything at all.</p>
<p>This is as close as I've ever got. Equally frustrating is the question, &quot;what's just outside the sphere containing all of the matter in the universe?&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's the whole point.  There wasn't any &quot;there&quot; before the big bang.  There wasn't even a &quot;before&quot; the big bang, that was the thing out of which both space and time spew forth.</p>
<p>Think of the north pole.  Anywhere on earth you are, going north will take you there.  All points are south of it, and talking about what's north of the north pole is a question that doesn't really make sense.  Similarly, anywhere in the universe you are, if you go back far enough in the past, everything approaches a single point, it's like the past pole of the universe the same way the earth has a north pole.  Instead of being the northmost point, it's the pastmost point of the universe, and just like all &quot;where's&quot; on the globe are &quot;south&quot; of the north pole, all &quot;when's&quot; in the universe are &quot;after&quot; the big bang</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By definition, there aren't any theories of what was before the Big Bang, because the Big Bang is the oldest event we can measure. A theory is something that can be tested, i.e. observed. Also, it's generally accepted that speaking of time before the Big Bang doesn't make much sense.</p>
<p>Right now, it is only possible to speculate about what was before the big bang.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prior to the Big Bang, all matter in the universe was collected into a singularity, right? Fancy talk for saying the heaviest black hole ever, so heavy it collapsed into a point of immeasurably small size. One universal pixel. </p>
<p>But the funny thing about black holes (or any large concentration of mass) is that it bends time. If you fell into a black hole, you would age slower and slower the closer you got to the center of all that mass. One day for you would be decades for people not falling into black holes. Then you got closer and one second for you is one million years for outsiders. Then you get really close and one nanosecond to you is trillions of years on the outside. </p>
<p>So imagine all of the matter in the universe is in the same place. There IS no one outside that pre-universal singularity. The black hole of everything is also containing everything. So time is so warped that what we would like to think of as quadrillions of years would be not even one cosmic frame of animation. Time as we know it was stretched to meaninglessness.</p>
<p>Then the Big Bang. The single speck that contained everything and didn't make sense when we try to call it &quot;time&quot; exploded. Matter flew out. And now here we are NOT in black holes watching the clock and counting hours. Time as we know it exists where we are, but what it was like in there and back then isn't what we would recognize as time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned, the word &quot;theory&quot; shouldn't really be used in this context, although there certainly are some speculations and ideas about what may have happened prior to the Big Bang. One somewhat popular idea that no one here has yet mentioned came directly from the idea of the multiverse.</p>
<p>The basic idea is that our reality, our universe, is just one of many (possibly infinitely many or possibly not, depending on exactly who you ask) universes. These universes are 3-dimensional objects that exist and move about in a 4-dimensional &quot;space.&quot; As such, sometimes they collide with one another. And when they do, it's theorized that the energy from the collision can create a new universe, i.e. the Big Bang from our internal perspective.</p>
<p>A slightly different take on this idea suggests that our 3-dimensional universe actually exists <em>inside</em> the &quot;actual&quot; 4-dimensional universe. Specifically, operating under this idea, our universe was formed from the &quot;leftovers&quot; of a 4-dimensional star going supernova and turning into a black hole.</p>
<p>However you implement this idea though, it still sufferers from the same critical problem - if we exist inside another universe, what caused/created that universe? Is that universe perhaps itself part of yet another universe? If so, then what created <em>that</em> universe? And so on, indefinitely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
