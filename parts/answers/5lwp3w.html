		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The RF spectrum was divided up into various bands for various uses by the FCC.  The band for FM radio transmission is 88 to 108 MHz.</p>
<p>From there there's a limit to how much information you can carry in an FM channel of a given band.  It turns out that having channels that are 200 KHz wide gives a good tradeoff between having lots of channels and having good quality, so that's what is used.</p>
<p>To divide the spectrum up into even parts without wasting any you start with 88.0-88.2, then 88.2-88.4, and so on.  This means that they're all even-to-even decimals.</p>
<p>The carrier wave in an FM transmission should be the center of the band, so for 99.6-99.8 you'd choose 99.7.  Since all bands run even-to-even the center is always an odd decimal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another tidbit is that radios from different countries are not universal.  Car radios from the US won't pick up on all of the stations in the EU because of how they are programmed and even on &quot;scan&quot; they still lock on certain bands.  If the station is in-between bands it won't even see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
