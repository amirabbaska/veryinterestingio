		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually the reason is a lot simpler than you might think;
Usually languages started out having only upper case letters. That's why on really old professional documents, lower case letters aren't really anywhere to be seen.
It was only after scribes discovered that they could write much faster and take up a lot less space if they wrote smaller. So they rounded their letters to make them less spacious and soon the lower case letters were made.
Good question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Charlemagne gets at least some of the credit for lower-case letters in the so-called Latin alphabet. Cursive writing had become so sloppy by Charlemagne's time that it was practically unreadable and when monks would copy manuscripts the state of the writing made corruption of texts nearly inevitable. Aside from his military conquests, Charlemagne was all about promoting learning and preserving knowledge, so he actually passed laws mandating reform of the script. The result was a font called Carolingian minuscule that lives on in our lower-case letters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
