		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's another aspect to this. I came across what I thought was a stutter in Zulu speakers when I visited South Africa. Zulu people, speaking English, would sometimes say the beginning of a word over and over several times before continuing. I assumed it was a stutter, but nearly everyone did it. Then I noticed they did the same thing in their native tongue. Eventually I figured out that it wasn't a stutter, per se, but the Zulu version of &quot;ummm&quot; or &quot;uhhh&quot;, the common English sounds for &quot;I'm still formulating my next thought&quot;. Zulu speakers never used those &quot;ummm&quot; or &quot;uhhh&quot; sounds, but instead would just repeat the first syllable of the next word they were saying until they were ready to proceed. Served the same function, but sounded quite different.</p>
<p>I learned later that different languages have very different means of expressing that they're still formulating the next thought. It's not a word, but it conveys meaning nonetheless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know for sure. There are some theories that certain languages have lower rates (and there's some epidemiological data showing that it might be different in certain countries) but there's a lack of good data to back these theories up.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure about stuttering specifically, but there is evidence that other linguistic difficulties are language dependent.</p>
<p>For example, dyslexia in Chinese speakers is a result of a process in a different part of the brain than it is in English speakers, <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2008/080407/full/news.2008.739.html" target="_blank">Nature 2008</a>.  People who are dyslexic in one language may be perfectly fine in another language.</p>
<p>It seems reasonable that there would be differences in stuttering and other language difficulties in different languages, especially those that are very different from each other.</p>

<p>A case report on bilingual stuttering in English/Spanish indicated there there were some differences in stuttering rates in the two languages.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Canadian currently doing my masters in Speech-Language Pathology in South Korea, and I can tell you that while there is not a scientific consensus on this, the perception is that, yes, certain languages have more stuttering.  It comes up a fair bit in discussions on stuttering in class, because it seems that English speakers are more prone to stuttering than Korean speakers.  The thought is that because English has a lot of consonant clusters, it is just more difficult to pronounce than Korean, which for the most part doesn't allow consonant clusters (at least, not in one syllable, you can have them occur between syllables though).  </p>
<p>But... the clarification on this is that well, are you talking about people with a stuttering pathology, like an actual disorder?  or just people stuttering in general, because that is different.  Koreans are astounded when I, a native English speaker, occasionally stutter when speaking English.  It happens a fair bit when I'm tired, nervous or stressed.  But I do not have a fluency disorder (the technical term for stuttering).  I just stutter under stress.  And this is common in Engish.  But apparently, it is not common in Korean.  The prevalence of actual fluency disorders across languages is a different question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if it's related or not but I never stuttered until I was about 23. I started to stutter sometimes when I had a hard time explaining something. It makes it hard to convince people since it just sounds like I have no idea what I'm saying. Only started to happen after I went through a long Arabic course for the military. I had previously learned Portuguese and never stuttered in English or Portuguese, only after learning a good bit of Arabic did I start to stutter. Also only stuttered in English, always thought it was weird.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
