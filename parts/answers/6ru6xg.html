		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Postural distortion expert here.</p>
<p>In reflexive reaction to negative emotions of any kind, our nervous system reflexively tightens the front of the body. It's a withdrawal response, a self protective contraction with survival value. In its full expression, it's the same contraction pattern as the startle reflex.    </p>
<p>It hunches us forward, depresses the chest, rounds the shoulders, and leans the head forward.
It makes us small, trying to say &quot;don't notice me&quot;. In its extreme, it stops our breathing.</p>
<p>Stretching  out of it doesn't really work because it stretching doesn't get the brain to turn off the contraction very well.  </p>
<p>Try pandiculating, doing a little more of what the body is already doing and relax out of it voluntarily.</p>
<p>There is a modality that teaches this called Clinical Somatics that teaches ways to regain control of these tightenings. Here is a friend of mine teaching the exact pandiculations to escape from this tightness. <a href="https://youtu.be/umWj6axd04g" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/umWj6axd04g</a>   A movement called The Flower. Do it very carefully with low effort. It really works.</p>
<p>Edit: Adding: This habituated reflexive contraction is the posture of depression.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Medical doctor here. I will talk about the &quot;Heart Break Syndrome&quot;, which gives a kind of chest pain similar to that felt by depressed patients.</p>
<p>This kind of pain happens thanks to our inherent survival instinct. Many evolutionary psychologists believed that as human civilizations evolved, our bodies made our social and pain/reward systems in the brain connected, as a way to force us to socialize. Which means that if you fall in love or like someone, dopamine levels will rise in your brain and you'll feel happy and excited, if you feel sad or heartbroken, it will activate the pain pathway in your brain.</p>
<p>The whole physiology of this kind of pain - alas, how we become aware of this kind of pain is not exactly very known. But it is indeed known that bad emotions - just like any other emotion we feel - activate many areas of our brains. One of them is an area of the brain called anterior cingulate cortex, which stimulates the vagal nerve. The vagal nerve is a nerve that, among many other body parts, innervates your heart and your stomach region. By stimulating your vagal nerve, your brain will make you feel chest pain or nausea. That's why some people throw up after traumatic situations, for example. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR: Any bad emotion may stimulate an area of the brain called anterior cingulate cortex, which stimulates the vagal nerve, which causes chest pain and nausea, among other symptoms.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysphoria" target="_blank">Dysphoria</a> maybe would be the official psychiatric term? I don't know very much about the biological basis.<br />
Sarah Silverman described the feeling of depression as being like homesickness even though she was home. I think this is very apt for some of the feelings I get when depressed, a lot like when I was away at camp and miserable as a kid and would have given anything to leave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if we're talking about the same feeling.</p>
<p>But back when I was depressed, I had a horrible pain in my chest, that somehow was half mental has physical pain, I don't really know how to describe it.</p>
<p>But I did ask my biology teacher about pain related to feeling and she told me about psychosomatic pain, which is pain caused or heavily influenced by emotional factors.</p>
<p>Basically your feelings physically hurt you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're stressed and/or anxious your body has a physical response. This is called the fight or flight response. It is a way for the body to prepare itself for a treat, which we call stress. The muscles in our body tighten up, which also happens in the chest area. Normally your body recovers easily from this response. But when this response is frequent, the body has not enough time to recover, which results in a tightened chest. This can cause pain or can have effect on your breathing, which maybe explains the feeling you've described.</p>
