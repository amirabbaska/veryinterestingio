		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the most popular comments this work received was concern about the synthetic bacteria escaping into the natural environment. I think the first thing to keep in mind with this new biotechnology is that they are entirely dependent on X and Y nucleotides being made available to them by our synthetic chemists. There is no replication of X and Y outside of our laboratory setting, especially in the absence of artificial X and Y. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How many H bonds between X and Y? Also do you have an image of their structures? </p>
<p>Do X and Y allow for extremely specific primer bonding, or do they even bind as primers at all? </p>
<p>Have you successfully incorporated these bp's into ss or ds RNA?</p>
<p>Are you able to sequence these new base pairs easily? I assume you had to develop some dideoxynucleotides corresponding to X and Y, no?</p>
<p>Do you have to supply these bacteria with X and Y so they continue to propogate it throughout their genome? If so, what happens to the daughters of the control bacteria which have X and Y in their genomes, but don't receive the X and Y nucleotides and how do their sequences compare to the mother cell?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>in your observations of the bacteria after adding the new X and Y pair, have you noticed any changes physical or behavioral? has your change impacted the lifespan </p>
<p>are these changes visible in second generation bacteria?</p>
<p>also: congratulations!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you could use this for the treatment of chronic genetic mutations? make a virus with the expanded alphabet that get inside our cells repairs enhances etc then it disappears because it could not get its amino acids, naturally so its growth could be controlled by the supply of said amino acids, that would make the virus safe and would not mutate and replicate uncontrollably inside our body, like cancer</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
