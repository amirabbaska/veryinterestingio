		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many reasons why. </p>
<p>For one, suicide is a tragedy because it's a person making a decision but virtually never in a healthy state of mind. For example, there was a man who jumped off a bridge, and the second he jumped, he realized all his problems were solvable. That things weren't as bad as they seemed in his head. </p>
<p>Suicide is also a tragedy because it often means that person did not receive the support they deserved, that the systems in their life failed them. Maybe their family system is toxic, maybe they go unnoticed in their school system, etc. Some people have it rougher than others, or they don't have the same level of resilience as others, so they need a little extra help. A suicide can indicate they didn't get the help they needed when they needed it. </p>
<p>Also we are social creatures, and we like to be connected. Any death is a disconnect from someone we care about. But with young deaths there is a greater disconnect, because there is an expectation that we'll have this connection for another fifty years, etc. any young death is extra tragic because we want everyone to live a long prosperous life. Someone who dies at 75 is almost expected to die around that age. </p>
<p>This is all to say why it's &quot;tragic.&quot; So to get why it's &quot;frowned on&quot; is because it hurts enough to lose someone, and it hurts twice as much if they took their own life because of how complex the emotional response is. For example, if someone murders your daughter, you'd be devastated about your daughter and furious at her killer. But if your daughter murders herself, you are feeling both emotions directed at her. She is both the victim and the perpetrator. </p>
<p>Also you feel responsible, as you are her family system which failed her. But you also are the victim, because you're the one who lost a daughter. </p>
<p>Suicide is frowned upon because it brings up so many of these extreme, mixed emotions, and because it all could have been prevented somehow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the arguments people are making here are important, there's also the social and cultural aspect to consider. In the west we have a very Christian view of morality and in traditional Christian views, suicide is sinful because your life belongs to God, not to you. To take your own life is to defy God's plan for your life. Obviously religious dominance on public opinion has waned over the past hundred years, but the effects of it are pretty clear when you compare British and American views on euthanasia to those of European cultures that aren't as Christianity-centric. Other examples of things that culturally come from our socio-religious past are our views on what animals are suitable for eating, fear of the number 13, celebrations of Christmas and Easter (even by nonreligious families), new years resolutions, even football (soccer for Americans out there) fans sing songs to the tune of religious hymns. It takes a long time for those kinds of views to abate and shift. Just look at how long womens rights and gay rights took, and now we're in the fight for trans rights. Culturally we have a Christian heritage and those ideals pervade our society heavily. Almost all common names in the West are religious in origin, even now, and show no strong signs of changing any time soon.</p>
<p>I agree that from a secular point of view, the fact suicide is preventable is a major reason for many people, but I think it's a little restrictive not to consider the historical context these ideas and belief systems came from. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think we have pretty unhealthy attitudes to death. Cultural beliefs are changing though. Many people now agree with assisted suicide for people who are suffering greatly from physical illnesses with no chance of a cure. But it's a scale. Should a teenager experiencing his first heartbreak over a failed relationship be assisted in suicide when in all probability, he will feel better after a short period? I don't think so. It's true that he will eventually die anyway, but we might be able to logically assume that staying alive is in his best interests, seeing as he will probably be happy he didn't go through with it eventually. So it's kind of like looking out for the interests of his future self/selves. How about someone with a much more serious form of mental illness who hasn't responded to any treatment over a long period and is suffering greatly because of it? I would be more inclined to say they should be allowed to die peacefully if that's what they want but others would disagree. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter. Not really. It's frowned upon because most of us are hardwired for survival (evolution and all that). When we find someone for whom this isn't the driving force, we tend to think they're sick (must be, because we would never do that) and again, we're hardwired to fear and avoid illness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's preventable. I work in psych and it's always heartbreaking to hear of patients attempting or committing suicide. You can't always predict a heart attack or a serious accident, but suicide is usually premeditated and it leaves a shockwave of people asking what they could have done to keep it from happening. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
