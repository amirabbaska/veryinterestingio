		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 methods for the body to metabolize alcohol. Light, occasional drinkers mostly only use one, the &quot;alcohol dehydrogenase pathway.&quot; When this pathway is overwhelmed, the &quot;microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system&quot; starts. This pathway is also why stronger drinks are linked with a warm feeling, this pathway wastes some energy as heat. Someone who drinks heavily and regularly will have more enzymes for MEOS, speeding their breakdown of alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of effects in your post:</p>
<p>1) BAC: Blood alcohol content, a physical test of how much of your blood is alcohol.  </p>
<p>2) how your various systems are affected by a BAC, aka &quot;drunkenness&quot; or alcohol tolerance. Two people with BAC of 0.05 might behave much more differently.</p>
<p>3) Alcohol metabolism, aka how quickly does your body process alcohol and turn it into less dangerous stuff (acetaldehyde and then acetate).</p>
<p>Alcohol is absorbed in about ~30-90 minutes (generally 30 min though). At that point, it is in your blood and shows up in BAC tests.</p>
<p>While alcohol is in your stomach, it isn't causing any drunken effects. Imagine having a propane tank. It isn't doing anything in the tank. But as it leaks out into their air (bloodstream) it spreads and affects our brains. That is why vomiting shortly after drinking is an effective defence by your body. A lot of alcohol is removed from the body and won't make it to the bloodstream.</p>
<p>About ~20% of alcohol can be converted in the stomach through a process called MEOS. So if you have 10 ml of pure alcohol, only 8 ml might make it into your blood stream.</p>
<p>Interesting as you drink more often and in high quantities, your body produces more of the stuff needed for the MEOS process. This leads to more alcohol being broken down in the stomach before it ever reaches your blood. Less alcohol in blood means less BAC and less drunk.</p>
<p>As well, some people have almost no enzymes needed for MEOS, which means that almost all alcohol they consume makes it to the bloodstream unconverted.</p>
<p>Volume of blood increases with weight. For a 200-pound, six-foot male, the blood volume is estimated at 7 liters, For a 100-pound, five-foot female, the estimate is 3.5 litres. bigger bathtub = more water.</p>
<p>Assuming the same volume of ethanol is absorbed into the blood, a 200 pound person will have roughly half the BAC of a 100 pound person. Put 5 drops of dark food colouring into 1 litre, and 5 drops of dye into 2 litres. Obviously the amount of dye is the same, but the effect of the dye is greatly reduced and the two litres is less dark.</p>
<p>Once it gets into your bloodstream, it can get into your brain and start screwing stuff up. This leads to alcohol symptoms such as balance issues, mood changes, etc. Visible drunkenness </p>
<p>As you drink more and more often, your brain gets better at functioning normally despite the alcohol. Imagine getting on a boat and trying to walk around on rough seas with the captain. He is much more stable than you, and appears unaffected by the waves. By being at sea a long time, they have gotten better at compensating for the boats movements. The brain learns to function and adapts to work with alcohol present. This is why chronic drinkers are able to perform tasks normally with high BACs whereas occasional drinkers &quot;appear&quot; more drunk. This is also why chronic drinkers may suffer from mood changes and problems when they aren't drunk, like that sea captain coming back to land and struggling to regain his &quot;land-legs&quot;.</p>
<p>Lastly, alcoholics seem to break down alcohol in the bloodstream differently. While they convert alcohol to acetaldehyde at similar speeds to non-alcoholics, they don't convert that into the less harmful acetate (which gets converted into water and CO2 and removed).</p>
<p>That slower breakdown means that there is much more acetaldehyde in their system. That chemical is pretty bad, and does things like create special opioid like chemicals in the brain (addiction), wrecks organs, etc.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am wondering if one of the reasons alcoholics end up as alcoholics is because they don’t feel as sick and uncomfortable as nonalcoholics tend to be after a number of drinks.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That was long considered a strong possibility. Recently however things like the rising number of Japanese alcoholics (who can get drunk after 1-2 drinks because of missing enzymes), the discovery of alcohol allergies in alcoholics (wheat/rye allergies) and alcoholics perseverance through reverse tolerance suggest this isn't the case.</p>
<p>It seems the dominant reason alcoholics end up as such is that the way their body breaks down alcohol creates addictive compounds in their brain and makes them crave them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
