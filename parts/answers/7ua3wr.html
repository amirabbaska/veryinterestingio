		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flu is very common in waterfowl. It doesn’t make them sick, however.  Generally people don’t get sick from the flu virus types that infect birds, but pigs can get both. And if a pig gets both, their cells can be infected by both viruses, both adding stuff into the cell’s DNA. Then a new virus emerges. This is why most epidemic versions of influenza have strain names of Asian cities. Asia is one place where ducks and pigs are often raised in close proximity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Veterinarian here, the true flu H#N# viruses are pretty common in horses, birds and pigs (hence bird flu/swine flu) though they do not always cause significant disease in those species. There are currently multiple outbreaks of canine influenza (H3N8 and H3N2) around the US though this really isn’t very common in general. </p>
<p>The flu virus mutates frequently and participates in genetic recombination. This means genes from multiple flu viruses can recombine into a virus with a unique/uncommon genetic make up. This is why they make a different flu vaccine every year and why that flu vaccine doesn’t always work (they have to predict what strains will be most common in any given year). It’s also what makes the flu virus able to cross species in all sorts of different directions. </p>
<p>In general, however, our pets don’t have as much of a problem with viruses like the cold and flu. (With the exception of what I mentioned above regarding canine influenza). Both of those viruses rely strongly on many individuals of the same species having close contact with each other. That just doesn’t happen as much for dogs and cats as it does for humans. Diseases that are sort of in the same vein however include kennel cough in dogs and herpes and calicivirus in cats. They can all cause upper respiratory infections and are contagious. </p>
<p>Other viral, infectious diseases that we really worry about are parvovirus and the feline equivalent, panleukopenia, as well as things like distemper and rabies. Good news is there are vaccines out there for those bad boys. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most animals don't have the transportation abilities of people coupled with our tendency to live in dense and highly social arrangements. With that said, to the degree that they do, they get sick in proportion to how often people do and by very similar viruses.</p>
<p>For colonial insects and animals you see flu epidemics, cold seasons, etc exactly as in people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see some people citing psychological stuff, personally kinda skeptical that they &quot;hide the symptoms&quot; of disease. As a soon-to-be-graduated microbiologist, ive seen it being just a case of &quot;it happens a shitton in animals, we just don't care enough to study it&quot; leading to a large gap in information in animal diseases when compared to human diseases. Lifespan also plays a factor of course, leading to (many) animals having drastically lower rates of cancer than humans purely because they die to other things before cancer would normally appear. Fun fact, though I'm sure many already know this, but it's worth pointing out that basically every one of the biggest diseases we deal with are diseases spread and maintained in animal populations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though im not 100% sure this fully awnsers the question at hand it helps shed some light in the right direction . </p>
<p>Some animals are susceptible to the human cold and can experience most, if not all the symptoms associated with humans.</p>
<p>While dogs are not known to catch the human cold virus, cats occasionally do and will display cold symptoms much like a human would. Cats have even been proven to contract the H1N1 or swine flu strain from humans and their environment.</p>
<p>On a slightly different note, large primates such as gorillas and chimpanzees have also been known to contract pneumonia from humans, which is not too surprising considering the close genetic ties.</p>
<p>However, the viruses that affect plants are rarely known to be transmitted to humans or other animals given the genetic distance between plant and animal DNA. --Tony Hegar, MPH with emphasis in Epidemiology</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
