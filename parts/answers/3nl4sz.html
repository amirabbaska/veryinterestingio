		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright, let's kick this one off.</p>
<p>The Trans-Pacific Partnership is a multi-layered deal whose particulars have just been agreed upon by the twelve participating countries. Its stated purpose is to reduce <strong>tariffs</strong> - taxes on bringing your goods into a country or sending them out - and therefore encourage industry by making it cheaper for importers and exporters to conduct business between these countries. Its other stated goal is to create a set of easy <strong>rules</strong> that businesses can live by when dealing between these countries.</p>
<p>The TPP is far more complex than that, however. Its subtextual function is to serve as a foundation from which to spread that set of easy rules to other Asian nations, with an eye to preventing China from setting standards among these countries first. The Obama administration is concerned that it's either &quot;us or them&quot; and that a Chinese-led trade agreement would set rules that American businesses would find problematic.</p>
<p>So what does it mean for you? Let's assume you are a citizen of one of the participating nations.</p>
<p>• A deal like the TPP involves identifying which tariffs affect <strong>market access</strong> and <strong>competition</strong> by creating a market that favors some producers over others instead of letting price, quality and consumer preference decide. For instance, it is very expensive to bring milk in to Canada, so even if you could sell your milk at a lower price, you will have to account for the cost of the tariffs, which will make your milk uncompetitive on the Canadian market. New Zealand and the US both want to see Canadian dairy tariffs lowered so that their milk producers can sell on the Canadian market more easily.</p>
<p>• When the market can decide and the barriers are down, we expect to see <strong>open markets</strong> offering <strong>more products/services</strong> than could previously have been made available. Prices should go down for certain products due to increased competition.</p>
<p>• A deal with as many players as the TPP rarely functions on one-to-one trades; instead, each party has a list of things that they want and needs to go shopping around to find ways to get their positions filled - a <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ChainOfDeals" target="_blank">chain of deals</a> wherein, for instance, Japan pressures Canada on the milk issue so that they can in turn see motion on their own priority, such as car parts. This is why the negotiations have taken so long.</p>
<p>• The TPP wants to <strong>standardize</strong> rules for trade among its participants, which cover a lot more than just tariffs and quotas. Other issues that have to be considered and negotiated include intellectual property rights and protections; rules regarding patents; environmental and labor regulations. In short, it tries to set standards on <strong>how business is conducted</strong>, both internationally and at home. It does this because uneven practices can result in uncompetitive market access.</p>
<p>• This standardization is hoped to <strong>improve labor and environmental laws</strong> across the board, as the need to conform forces countries that have been lagging behind in their standards to catch up with the rest of the group. By setting rules that apply equally to the US as to Malaysia, it is hoped that <strong>people will be better off</strong> and enjoy more protections in their working environment.</p>
<p>• To that end, the TPP will also have a process in place for what happens when someone breaks the rules - a <strong>tribunal</strong> which will decide based on terms laid out by the TPP instead of following the laws of any one government. This helps ensure that foreign companies are treated fairly and can conduct business under the same standards and with the same opportunities.</p>
<p><strong>Tl;dr the TPP is out to make business between these 12 countries more fair, predictable and even. It should provide more choice in goods and services and more bang for your buck, while making labor standards improve for people outside of North America who may be operating under less protections than a Canadian or American enjoys.</strong></p>

<h2>What are some concerns?</h2>
<p>• The TPP has been negotiated in <strong>heavy secrecy</strong>. While it's easy to see why keeping such a huge deal secret from the public is problematic, it is also reasonable for governments to work on negotiations and come to terms before letting elected officials decide if the end result is in the public interest. It lets others at the bargaining table know that what is said there won't be changed by a public opinion poll two days later, and it has been argued that such secrecy is therefore necessary to make these meetings work at all.</p>
<p>• The TPP has a <strong>scope</strong> that concerns many parties as it addresses trade and industry regulations on a 21st century scope - everything from upcoming cancer drugs to internet regulations to, yes, a cup of milk in Canada is all being covered by the same negotiation. It is a reasonable concern to say that the number of issues being covered in the same deal will make it hard for the public to reasonably read, understand and decide on.</p>
<p>• The removal of tariffs provides new foreign opportunities for business, but it also means that industries which rely on a <strong>protected domestic market</strong> will become exposed. It is not unreasonable to suggest that any given country is trading away the success of industry A for success in industry B, which, if all things are equal, should come down to a zero-sum game. Economics does not, of course, work like that, but it's still a fair question to examine.</p>
<p>• While supporters of the TPP say that it will encourage countries to improve their standards and reform, those elements are at their strongest during the negotiation - and the heat on issues such as human trafficking and human rights abuses have been sidelined as pressure to secure a deal of any kind has mounted on major nations facing upcoming elections. What should have been an opportunity to engage and demand reform as a condition of involvement in such a major global trade deal has been left by the wayside, a casualty of ambition.</p>
<hr />
<h2>What are the serious issues?</h2>
<p>• While the TPP has been kept secret from the public, <strong>large corporate interests</strong> have had a seat at the table throughout the process. These businesses have an <strong>obligation</strong> to make as much money as possible for their shareholders. This means that a great many of the deals that form the basis of the TPP have been negotiated with an eye to advantaging those businesses, potentially at the expense of the average citizen.</p>
<p>• &quot;Free trade&quot; as the TPP proposes is <strong>nothing new</strong> - globalization has already happened, and we are all the beneficiaries. What this deal will offer is not for the average citizen, who might see a few price differences on common products - it is for the large corporate interests who will have more freedom to <strong>move jobs</strong> and production to areas where it is cheaper to conduct business.</p>
<p>• There should be no such areas within the TPP zone, but part of the negotiation involves <strong>exceptions</strong> in place specifically to help these companies. The consistent standards that the TPP desires to set? Corporations would like to see those <strong>standards lowered</strong> - it is in their best interest to have access to a labor, property and capital market where they pay the least amount of money to conduct their business. </p>
<p>• Tariffs exist in part to protect domestic industry - <strong>jobs</strong> - from the vagaries of a global market. If cheaper US milk is sold in Canada, Canadian milk producers will have to choose whether to sell their own products more cheaply or else close down and go out of business. If it is not possible for these farmers to sell at a lower price and still remain profitable, then that choice is not a choice at all.</p>
<p>• The TPP's intellectual property provisions, which have been the subject of several leaks, are <strong>harsher than existing law</strong>, a product (again) of corporate involvement in the deal. They aim to crack down on several ways people use intellectual property, fairly and otherwise, and their scope means there is significant possibility for abuse and harrassment.</p>
<p>• More damagingly, the TPP <strong>applies those laws to drugs</strong> with an eye to preventing cheaper medicine from being available on the market - products that by rights <strong>should</strong> be subject to competition as their prices are heavily inflated beyond the cost of production.</p>
<p>• The TPP will offer a method by which companies can <strong>attack laws that affect them</strong>, suing governments through a tribunal for such offenses as trying to protect youth from cigarette marketing images, trying to protect the environment from dangerous industrial contaminants, or even refusing to pass laws removing or suppressing regulations where beneficial to corporate activity. These are all issues that already happen under various trade deals.</p>
<p>• We, the public, and our elected representatives will not have a great deal of time or means to push back against this trade deal if we dislike it. The text will only be released when absolutely necessary (a period of 60 days in the US) and steps have already been taken to ensure that elected officials cannot muck about with the deal. While this is logical (it would not be fair to negotiate terms and then change them back at home without discussing it), it does mean that instead of being able to debate and dissect we're committed to an <strong>all-or-nothing deal</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tl;dr the TPP puts local industries at risk, threatens jobs, attacks your privacy, and you may be looking at paying more for important medications (either directly or through your government). It's being sold as lower prices and better standards across the board, but lower prices are meaningless by themselves - purchasing power is what you really want - and there is no guarantee that standards need to be raised instead of lowered.</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea around this is to lower trade barriers between nations.  For instance, I read that Canadian beef to Japan is currently taxed at close to 40% by the Japanese, where the new deal will reduce it to under 10%.  By reducing barriers to trade, companies will have a wider, international market to deal with.  This means that many industries will do better.  However, there are several industries that are heavily protected under the law with high taxation and government subsidies.  These industries can be damaged.  The success and failures of each industry is different between nations.  </p>
<p>There are typically three concerns with trade deals.</p>
<p>*1. Failure of certain industries.  Some industries are heavily protected by the government through subsidies, higher prices and taxation.  When the market becomes more competitive, these industries are at risk.  </p>
<p>The counter argument here is that consumers are paying much higher prices for these products to help support them.  Further, trade theorists will argue that we are investing significant amounts of our economic dollars into industries that are just not efficient on a world scale.  That if we instead invested our economies in the areas where we are most efficient, we can have better economic results and higher wages in other areas.  Plus, we will save money from lower prices and lower taxation.</p>
<p>Of course, the counter argument to that is that a dairy farmer cannot necessarily just become a web designer overnight, and that there are costs associated with lost of industry.</p>
<p>*2. Secrecy.  There has been significant criticism about the secrecy of this deal.  People would like a lot more transparency.  However, the counter argument to that is that you need secrecy when you are negotiating deals.  That by showing your full hand leaves you at risk for losing a lot during the negotiations.  That the details will be released eventually.</p>
<p>*3. Loss of sovereignty.  There are always mechanisms built into deals about opening up borders, dispute resolution, and generally having similar laws on things.  Most legislative bodies will be expected to pass certain laws under these areas.  In some cases, they will just be flat out ignored.  A good example of this is the old dispute around soft-wood lumber between Canada and the US.  The American government was putting tariffs on Canadian imports, because it felt it was considered &quot;dumping&quot; under NAFTA.  The case when through many judicial bodies with them all pretty much concluding that Canada was not dumping, and that the tariffs were illegal.  The US basically said it was still not paying back the taxes.  Eventually the Canadian government had to settle in a bad deal.  In the end, international courts really do not have much power.  That unless it is decided by your own court in your own nation, much is not going to be resolved.</p>
<p>I hope that helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Copied this from an article some time ago, I like its conciseness.. It was describing similarities between TPP and TTP using what was in the TPP agreement..</p>
<p>1/ a right to challenge capital controls and other macro-prudential financial regulations that promote financial stability (Article 12.11) - this challenges the right of governments to use laws and financial transaction taxes to maintain stable capital markets and economies;</p>
<p>2/ procedural rights that are not available to domestic investors to sue governments outside of national court systems, unconstrained by the rights and obligations of countries’ constitutions, laws and domestic court procedures (Section B) - this in effect gives foreign firms operating in a TPP signatory greater rights than the citizens and their businesses of that signatory by placing them above the laws of the signatory;</p>
<p>3/ foreign tribunals [of the UN and World Bank] staffed by private sector lawyers who rotate between acting as “judges” and representing corporations suing governments, posing major conflicts of interest [Article 12.21] - foreign firms can lodge suits governments in international courts using advocates from a group of lawyers and judges who have presumably been vetted for their support for the firms and from which governments must select lawyers to defend their interests; </p>
<p>4/ foreign tribunals [as above] empowered to order governments to pay unlimited cash compensation out of national treasuries - this in effect would allow foreign firms to plunder taxes paid by the TPP signatory's citizens;</p>
<p>5/ Investors can demand compensation if new policies that apply to domestic and foreign firms alike undermine foreign investors’ “expectations” of how they should be treated - in other words, if foreign firms expect that governments must offer hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of sweeteners to entice them to invest, and that expectation is not met, then they can go to a foreign tribunal and demand &quot;compensation&quot;;</p>
<p>6/ the right to claim compensation for indirect expropriation that allows foreign investors to demand government payments for regulatory costs all firms operating in a country must meet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
