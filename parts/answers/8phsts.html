<p>Like other live-birth animals, they are provided oxygenated blood while in the womb, but after birth, they need to start breathing, and baby whales (for example) cannot easily float or swim. The mother will lift the baby out of the water to take its first breath. If the baby is born too deep, or in rough waters, or if another whale is unable or unwilling to lift it, then they can/will drown before they get to the surface.</p>

<p>According to this daily mail article, other whales (midwives) help out by  lifting the newborn to the surface for their first breath</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm confused by a lot of the answers in this thread - A popular fad among humans is &quot;birthing tanks&quot;, where human mothers give birth while in a tank of water.</p>
<p>And the babies <strong>don't drown</strong>, because they're still receiving oxygenated blood through the umbilical cord, until it's either severed or the placenta detaches (which can take up to an hour after the baby pops out).</p>
<p>Why is it any different in marine mammals?  If the baby pops out while mom is still too deep, can't she just slowly surface, being careful to keep the baby attached?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mammals are gestated in a fluid filled environment. At birth, the first breath is required to inflate the lungs and begin normal circulation.
When a mammal is born they can be sustained by the oxygen from the umbilical cord while it is still attached to the placenta and a breath hasn't occurred.
Extrapolating this, a whale or dolphin can be born and then have, in theory, a few minutes at least to reach the surface. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
