		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides what other commenters said:</p>
<p>Historically, very poor countries had a very high infant mortality rate, much more women dying during childbirth, and also a general lower life expectancy.</p>
<p>So they started having children early in their lives and had many - it ends up part of the culture.</p>
<p>With the (even modest) advance of medicine, healthcare, and people migrating to cities, you have a quick drop in infant mortality, an increase in general fertility, and longer fertile life. These factors, with the same &quot;high yield&quot; boosts the population growth.</p>
<p>Whenever I see ads for humanitarian aid to miserable countries, most focusing in helping with healthcare and child care, I wonder if they also put enough parallel effort in birth control, because simply making sure a population grows way beyond the people's and country's capabilities to maintain it just perpetuates extreme poverty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Countries like Bangladesh are in the process of demographic transition - largely the result of industrialisation. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsBT5EQt348" target="_blank">Kurzgesagt has a great video about it here</a>.</p>
<p>Industrialisation brings with it, among other things, lower infant mortality, higher standards of living for more people, more people getting access to education etc. All these things also lead to other important stuff which I will not go into. </p>
<p>Before the industrial revolution and the advent of modern medicine, parents would have to get a lot of children to expect have 2-3 of them survive to adulthood. Something like 3/4 children under the age of 5 died in the 1700s in London. A mere century later, that number was 1/3. So over time, the would-be parents realises that if they want 2 children, they don't need to produce 5 or 6, or more. </p>
<p>On a personal note, my great grandmother had 7 sibilings growing up (she was born 1916, and it still wasn't unusal to have more than 8 children at that time). Herself had 4 children. My grandfather had 2, and my father had 2. So over the course of 4 generations, my familiy ended up on 2 children, which is pretty much the average for most industrialised nations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In poorer countries like Bangladesh, the people tend to live very traditional lifestyles - which means you get married when you're old enough and have a family because this is what people do.  If this is was what you were planning on doing all along, having a large family instead of a very small one doesn't seem like a very big deal - especially if that means there are extra hands to help out with the work.</p>
<p>In the wealthiest countries, people are encouraged from a very young age to basically be free and do whatever you want, and that often means that the young adults who might otherwise be having babies instead don't want to interrupt their careers and other goals to raise kids.  Eventually some of them do have kids, but often later in life and fewer - partly because they're still not wanting to interrupt their other goals TOO much, and also partly because it's harder to have kids when you're older.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Geography major. Here is the 411:</p>
<p>A lot of what was said is correct. The two major factors though are: 1. - how can I ever buy shit? 2. - How can I retire?</p>
<p>In DEVELOPED nations (i.e most of North America, Europe, some Asia), people are highly educated (this does not mean smart), and know that the more children they have, the more expensive life will get. Companies or places of work have set retirement plans, there is some sort of health care. Life goal pretty much is have kids (for most), send them through a school until they be 18, and then fend for themselves. Therefore, it's counterproductive to have kids+1 if you want to say travel, buy a seconds home, have many cars, live &quot;the normal life&quot;</p>
<p>In DEVELOPING nations, where industries tend to be agriculture favored, the more children you have, the more employees you have. Also, as the children grow they will earn more money. When you get old and are bed ridden or living on some mountain, your children will look after you. This is a general trend in developing nations. Your retirement fund is hopefully better educated children looking out for you. It sadly is what keeps poverty poor. Finally, the cherry on top, most developing nations are highly religious, which keeps them from practicing some sort of birth control.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a lot of people are missing that fact that having children in  a developed country is a more complicated and expensive process than in the developing world.</p>
<p>There are a lot of bells a whistles when it comes to raising kids in the developed world (I mean, look at something like car seats and strollers, items that are considered a basic necessity involved in raising a child, they cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars apiece and are something you rarely see kids in the developing world needing or using). </p>
<p>Daycare is something that is also considered essential and costs a boatload. </p>
<p>Then there's the fact that it's also considered a necessity for kids in the developed world to get increasingly higher education levels resulting in parents shelling out not just money for college but also tutors and mental enrichment games and activities. Everyone needs to have a baby Einstein. </p>
<p>Having kids is a pretty basic thing but the more advanced a country gets it seems the more intricate having a kid gets and the added cost, complication and stress means a lot of people can really only handle 1-3.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
