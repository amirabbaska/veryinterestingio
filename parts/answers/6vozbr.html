		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try my best to answer this because I studied this in school.</p>
<p>In theory, the most efficient turbine would be with one blade, because there are no other blades to create turbulance in front of the blade. However, in practice this creates an unbalanced rotor, so it doesn't work.</p>
<p>Then, the next most efficient blade system would be a two bladed system. However, these tend to vibrate on a third plane, losing lots of energy to friction. To overcome this, some turbines have a teetering hub, but that is more expensive to manufacture.</p>
<p>A three blades design allows for the most efficiency in practice. More blades would create more turbulance, so the costs of making more blades on a turbine would outweigh the benefits of the extra electricity being created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have a lab at work (science centre) about this.</p>
<p>More blades gives more electricity, but with diminishing returns, and blades are expensive. Therefore, you want to find a number of blades where the return on one more blade is less than the increase in service cost.</p>
<p>The difference between two and three blades is large. The difference between the and four blades is slight.</p>
<p>One of the largest service costs is due to different wind speeds on different parts of the mill: wind speeds tend to vary in relation to distance off the ground squared. Turns out, with 3 blades the force on the mill from wind is more evenly distributed than with 2 or 4 blades. This reduces wear on the axle to a noticeable degree.</p>
<p>At the end of the day you get a bigger return building a larger mill than adding another blade when you have 3 blades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More blades equals more torque and slower speed. That is the windmills you used in your example. They needed the torque to mill grain. Less blades equals less torque but has faster speeds. Like stated three is the magic number when producing electricity on a horizontal axis wind turbine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More blades generate more lift to spin the turbine. This means blades of lesser surface area can be used by increasing the number of blades. Having more than 3 blades can be less efficient in terms of manufacturing costs since the blades are often very large and expensive.  </p>
<p>You may also be interested in an efficiency limit on how much power a wind turbine can harvest from an airflow called the Betz Limit.  </p>
<p>Source:   <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/lifteq.html" target="_blank">NASA</a> has lots of very good pages on aerodynamics and such on their website. When looking at the lift equation here, keep in mind that the blade has much greater velocities as you go further out and that the blade has different surface areas throughout. We must therefore break down the blade into sections, calculating the lift for each section for it's different properties. Also note that the complexities of air compression and wind conditions are hidden in the lift coefficient.</p>
<p>Computational Fluid Dynamics, which often make use of Navier-Stoke equations are also used in calculating these things.</p>
<p>Why do wind turbines typically have 3 blades but helicopters typically have even numbers of blades (2 or 4)? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
