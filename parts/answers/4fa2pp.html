That darkness-to-light spectrum you perceive on the mirror somehow translates as a white-to-black spectrum to your brain.. a white to black spectrum is basically an array of grays.. grays with reflection.. that gives you a silver-ish perception.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mirrors are usually pieces of glass with a metallic layer painted on (a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror#Manufacturing" target="_blank">multi-step process</a> to produce a well bonded shiny metal layer. For most mirrors, this metal layer is silver or aluminium.</p>
<p>So now the question is: why does silver (or aluminium) appear grey/silver in colour? Or more broadly speaking, what determines the colour of reflective metals?</p>
<p>Metals have what is known as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_oscillation#mechanism" target="_blank">plasma frequency</a>. In simple terms, this frequency is the upper limit for electromagnetic radiation that the electrons in the metals can respond to. Frequencies higher will simply pass through and frequencies lower will be reflected. Basically, the electrons <del>can</del> can't 'keep up' to the high frequency vibrations and don't respond. When the electrons can 'keep up' (for EM waves with a frequency lower than the plasma frequency), they vibrate and re-emit that radiation. This is the reflected light we see.</p>
<p>For most metals, like silver and aluminium, this frequency is in the ultraviolet region. This means that all lower frequencies, such as the entire visible light range, are reflected. The result is a shiny white, silver. </p>
<p>For other metals, say copper, this plasma frequency is lower, closer to red in the visible light range of EM waves. This gives the reddish-brown colour of copper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all mirrors are perfectly reflective, and things can be done to a mirror to make it less reflective (like fogging, smudging, etc).</p>
<p>If you look at something like the side of a butter knife, you can see that it has a color, despite also reflecting the world around it.  If you polish the side of that knife enough, eventually you'd get a usable mirror.</p>
<p>Common household mirrors are a thin layout of silver on the back of a pane of glass, so their color when less than perfectly reflective is the same as the color of unpolished silver.</p>
<p><em>edit:</em> as had been pointed out, modern mirrors use aluminum, since it is almost as good but a lot cheaper.  Still, the language evolved in a time when aluminum was less common.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
