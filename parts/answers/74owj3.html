		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's high in sugar and low in water. Bacteria, like all living things, requires water to survive. Honey has so little water that it will pull water out of any bacteria and kill it. Also, too much sugar is also a good way to kill bacteria. If all the bacteria that get on the honey die, there's none left to produce any of the hazardous byproducts that make food go bad and expire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have already commented on the low moisture and low water activity being the primary method of preservation. To add to this, bees naturally produce small amounts of hydrogen peroxide when they break down the sugars. Hydrogen peroxide both inhibits growth and can kill certain types of bacteria and fungal spores. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, it's the lack of water and resulting osmotic effects that is the primary cause. However, when compared to concentrated sugar solutions, honey has even more antibacterial effects. So there are additional naturally occurring compounds to preserve honey as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
