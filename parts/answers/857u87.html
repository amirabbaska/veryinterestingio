<p>In a few words, the final <a href="http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/ligseq.html#c2" target="_blank">step leader</a> before <del>it</del> the lighting contacts the ground accelerates electrons to relativistic speeds. As they strike the ground, they release radiation in the microwave frequency. These microwaves ionizes the air around them, forming a ball of plasma. In rare scenarios, the microwaves can be trapped in the plasma ball as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_wave" target="_blank">standing wave</a> which can persist and provide energy to 'fuel' the plasma ball.</p>
<p>The article explains it a lot better than I could, and is fairly accessible. It's definitely worth a read!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure of the cause but saw one a few years back during a storm. It was about the size of a golf ball and was hovering outside in the middle of a road. I was watching from a nearby house through a window. It sort of bounced around for about 10 seconds then headed for a road sign that it hit, produced a flash and disappeared. So cool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
