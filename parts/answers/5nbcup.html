		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we are crying, our body is essentially in a state of stress. Stress activates our sympathetic nervous system which is responsible for the fight or fli8ght response. This increases blood flow and respiration. To allow for the extra respiration, a muscle called the glottis opens up for more air to pass through. Now when you need to swallow it creates tension in this muscle, resulting in that lump-like sensation.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I looked it up for you OP! According to <a href="http://indianapublicmedia.org/amomentofscience/a-lump-in-your-throat/" target="_blank">this website</a>, the autonomous nervous system helps deal with emotions and stress. Part of its job is to help us breath more easily (in case we need fight/flight reflex) by opening up your throat. When we swallow, it is an opposing motion that registers as a 'lump'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with the autonomic nervous system which deals with non conscious actions. It's just the way it responds to emotional stress, it stretches the grottos and when you try to swallow it causes the lump feeling.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
