		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The patella provides a lever arm to optimize the transmission of force from the quadriceps muscle to extend the tibia. If you look at the anatomy of the elbow, when you bend it, the olecranon process of the ulna protrudes similarly to the patella, creating an effective moment arm for transmission of force from the triceps to the ulna. </p>
<p>Two different joint designs to achieve similar goals. In my mind, one reason may be the following. The knee has two cruciate ligaments in the middle that contribute significantly to its stability.  The elbow is stabilized mainly by collateral ligaments on the sides and the bony congruency. The shape of the olecranon makes the joint highly constrained and, especially in extension, locks it into place making it very stable. Replacing the olecranon with a &quot;patella&quot; or sesamoid type lever would not confer the same stabilizing advantage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Google Olecranon. Similar function, but part of the ulna, one of the long bones in the arm. Why not a separate elbow cap? The knee is generally asked to provide more force in extending more often (in standing up, for example) but less freedom of movement than the arm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Legs need strength in extension -- to climb, to run, (for humans, to lift things.)
Knee cap gives mechanical advantage when extending leg.</p>
<p>Arms need strength in flexion -- to lift, to pull (for non-humans, to run.)
Human punching requires extension, but that does not require much torque. </p>
<p>So there are a lot of reasons, but these are two different joint systems with very different strength requirements.</p>
<p>Most joints have more strength, and more need for strength, in flexion, and this makes sense because of the inherent mechanical advantage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Kneecaps are not unique to humans, or even mammals for that matter, even reptiles and birds have kneecaps but no elbow caps.  The difference between rear and forelimbs is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_tetrapods#From_fins_to_feet" target="_blank">evolutionary</a>
