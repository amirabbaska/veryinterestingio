		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most powerful earthquake that has been recorded was the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/world/events/1960_05_22.php" target="_blank">1960 M9.5 Valdivia</a> earthquake in Chile that ruptured a length of about 1000 km. However the longest fault ruptured observed was during the <a href="https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/sumatra9.php" target="_blank">2004 M9.2 Sumatra-Andaman earthquake</a> that ruptured over a length of 1200 km. </p>
<p>Fault length plays a key role in the most powerful earthquake that is theoretically possible, since rupture length will be limited to be less than the circumference of the Earth (40,075 km). To determine seismic moment or the amount of energy released in an earthquake, you would multiply the area of the fault that slipped (length x width), the distance it all slipped (usually in the tens of meters for great earthquakes like this), and the shear modulus of the fault (rigidity or how much the fault surface can resist breaking) [<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/JB084iB05p02348/abstract" target="_blank">Hanks and Kanamori, JGR, 1979</a>]. The width of a fault is also a limit, because beyond a certain depth the lithosphere no longer breaks brittlely but instead deforms ductilely. This limit varies, but the deepest known earthquakes tap out at ~700 km depth. Since the faults that the largest and deepest earthquakes occur on are subduction zone faults which dip into the earth at an angle, their width would technically be more than that 700 km depth limit but that is a huge width already so I am going to stick with that for this exercise. And since this is conjecture, I will stick with a generally accepted 3.0*10^10 N/m^2 for rigidity and 100 meters of slip as any more than that freaks me out.</p>
<p>Putting that all together in our equations for moment M0 = (40075000 m <em> 700000 m) </em> (100 m) <em> 3.0</em>10^10 N/m^2, and subbing that into our equation for magnitude MW = (2/3) * log(M0) - 6.05, we would get a magnitude of 11.23 for an earthquake that basically breaks the full circumference of the earth like a plastic Easter egg to a depth of 700 km and twists it to shift everything by 100 m.</p>
<p>Needless to say, that is far from what is expected to actually occur on Earth through plate tectonics in our lifetime. With current knowledge of the longest active faults a more reasonable limit on the most powerful earthquake would be a magnitude of about M9.6. It would be on a megathrust subduction zone fault probably on one of the faults in the Pacific, and it would likely have to rupture much of the shallow part towards the trench which would generate a significant tsunami impacting all countries with coastlines along that ocean with Hawaiâ€™i right in the middle of the fun. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe someone can answer a follow on question for me.  </p>
<p>The magnitude of an earthquake is a measure of the total energy released.  The total energy released is going to be a function of the ground movement amplitude AND the length of time the shaking occurs.</p>
<p>So, it's possible that a large amplitude short duration quake could release the exact same amount of energy has a low amplitude long duration quake...right?  The effects of each on infrastructure would be drastically different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I live in Christchurch, New Zealand, I've recently experienced quite a few different EQs....</p>
<p>I would add that there is more to earthquakes than just what they measure on the Richter scale. Our first major EQ was a magnitude 7.1 ( September 2010) and this caused moderate damage however the city was still able to function. In February 2011 we had a 6.3 EQ which caused severe damage and had an extremely intense vertical and horizontal ground movement and was also quite shallow (10k deep).</p>
<p>The recent earthquake (7.5) was actually centered 100km or so north of Christchurch but extremely widespread. It lasted about 2 minutes and felt more 'wavey' and rocky'. Not much damage in the city but a huge amount up north where it hit...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the human experience, I think the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercalli_intensity_scale" target="_blank">Mercalli</a> helps give an idea of how intense an earthquake is, relatively speaking.</p>
<p>The scale goes from didn't feel it, to everything is destroyed and stuff is even flying off the ground.  It isn't terribly scientific, and relies on data gathered from first hand experiences and aftermath rather than seismic data.  Still an interesting way to measure an earthquake in my opinion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
