		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally something I might have insight on! First off, you can use electric pulses to build and repair damages tissue. I have had terrible knees for years, I started physical therapy at around 17. However, the cartilage damage was so bad in my knee, that I couldn't build the muscle in a healthy way to keep my knee in better traction. Long story short I had surgery. I am 22, and recovering. Because of the nerve and tissue damage I cannot build muscle in my leg through exercise alone. Instead, when I go to PT they hook me up to a machine that sends a small electric charge into my knee, making the muscles contract, nerves reactivate, and swelling in my knee go down. Because of this machine I am able to do my exercises after with little pain. So, regular exercise is needed to build muscle quickly and healthy, but you can use electric shock therapy to help your body out! It is really amazing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can actually build muscle with electro stimulation. By putting electrodes on your skin in the right place the muscles will contract with each pulse of electricity. It's not a pleasant feeling. My roommate had a stimulator for his back muscles when he was injured and to fuck with me he just threw the contacts on me. Fucker, it's unpleasant. Supposedly Bruce Lee use electrostimulation to work his muscles out when he was doing something he had to do that wasn't physical. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you're thinking of - several of the comments refer to electro stimulation, which could work. If you're thinking 'I'll just cut my muscles and get stronger', that won't work. Your body adapts to the environment it experiences, so if you try it by cutting muscles, you won't get stronger, just a little more resistant to being cut (and this isn't much good either, because while it might make your skin/muscles slightly tougher, a knife can do more damage than you could ever hope to prevent with mere human tissue).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have absolutely no credentials to back what I am saying outside my amateur understanding of fitness and weight lifting, so take what I say with a grain of salt. </p>
<p>As others have said, it is possible to build muscle with electrical stimulation, but I have to believe there is probably a limit to how accurate or efficient that stimulus can be.</p>
<p>Moreover there is actually a brain body connection that is also trained when weight lifting. When gaining strength as a result of weight lifting some of those gains don't come from additional muscle, but instead from your brain learning how to more efficiently use those muscles. </p>
<p>So assuming you could force the body to build 50lb of muscle absolutely perfectly, it probably wouldn't be able to use much if any of it.</p>
<p>A probably bad example would be riding a bike. Someone who can't ride a bike probably has all of the physical necessities to do so, but their brain hasn't learned how to use them to actually ride a bike. The same could be said of the artificial muscle growth above. The body might be physically capable of lifting 300lb, but the brain wouldn't know how to utilize the muscles to do so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not damaging muscle and repairing it. There's also a lot of cellular signaling involved for nutrient/energy sensing that feeds into a complicated mostly opaque box of anabolic/catabolic programming that takes additional inputs such as immune signaling, DNA synthesis/repair, reactive oxygen sensing, etc. Also hormones and other signaling factor triggered through the brain. Working out is very complex. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
