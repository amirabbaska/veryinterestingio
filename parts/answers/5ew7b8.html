		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so this can easily be explained, but it might be a little different than you might expect. <strong>Both</strong> 10 mins of extra sleep in the morning and a 10 min nap work in different ways to be beneficial. The <strong>bad guy</strong> here is your <strong>snooze</strong> button.</p>
<p>10 blissful minutes of extra sleep a night can make a difference, but it will be a long-term benefit and won't necessarily change how groggy you feel in the morning. <strong>But</strong> when you hit your snooze button for those extra ten minutes, you’re pretty much telling your body “hell ya false alarm, go back to bed.” Then your body gets pissy at you and confused when it realizes this ain’t no high school fire drill.</p>
<p>Afternoon naps work in a different way as they rely on your body <strong>not</strong> going into any big ol’ canyon slumber, and instead act like cleaning the RAM on your computer. As you progress through your day the chemical adenosine, which regulates how tired you feel, starts building up in the brain similar to how dirt and odours build up in your bedroom. Taking that little nap is like power misting the crap out of your room with a can of Febreze; It temporarily gets the job done, but can’t replace the almighty slumber vacuum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In the afternoon 10 min nap doesn't start pumping to many chemicals, but does gives your brain time to rest. </p>

If you eat a snack in between meals, it keeps you satisfied until the next meal. If you eat it after eating a meal, then it's not very helpful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly there are 6 stages of sleep that we go through. Once we enter the so called sleep cycle it apparently is most beneficial to successfully go through each stage. Day you wake up and put your alarm on snooze this may put you back into stage one which is meant to last 20 minutes. But youre likely to be resting all ready as youve just woken up so its more likely (maybe im not enitrely sure) that you might skip stsge one and go straight into stage 2 which then makes your body think it's entered the full sleep cycle again, which is why you feel more tired when you snooze.</p>
<p>However napping for 20 mins (not 10) is meant to be beneficial as you get the rest from the first stage of sleep but as you are unlikely to be as relaxed as when youre woken from sleep you're less likely to enter the next stage of sleep which is likely why you feel less tired post nap then you do post snooze.</p>
<p>Apologies this might not accurate or the most understandable, I'm thinking back 3 years ago when I had a brief lecture on the sleep cycle!!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>There is an absurd amount of up-voted misinformation in this thread.</strong></p>
<p>Other than causing a temporary decrease in the levels of adenosine in your brain, I don't think you will find a 10 minute nap to be that beneficial.</p>
<p>In general, sleep quality degrades the longer one sleeps.</p>
<p>More specifically, your sleep architecture changes the longer you sleep.  At the start of a sleep period your brain spends most of its time in sleep stages 2 &amp; 3, which are the stages associated with deep dreamless physically restorative sleep (especially stage 3).</p>
<p>However as you sleep longer, the amount of time your brain spends in stages 2 &amp; 3 diminishes significantly, and your brain instead starts spending most of its time in REM sleep, which is not physically restorative, and is instead associated with minor benefits to procedural memory and emotional equanimity.</p>
<p>Thus after 8 hours of sleep you're spending basically all your time in REM sleep, which provides you with little (if any) further benefit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
