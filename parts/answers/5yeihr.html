		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: they don't survive.</p>
<p>The life expectancy of the mentally ill is short. From the <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/about/directors/thomas-insel/blog/2011/no-health-without-mental-health.shtml" target="_blank">NIH</a>, and specifically addressing Americans, mental health, and life span.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;...on average, Americans with major mental illness die 14 to 32 years earlier than the general population. The average life expectancy for people with major mental illness ranged from 49 to 60 years of age in the states they examined — a life span on par with many sub-Saharan African countries, including Sudan (58.6 years) and Ethiopia (52.9 years). Average life expectancy in the United States is 77.9 years. It would appear that the increase in longevity enjoyed by the general U. S. population over the past half century has been lost on those with serious mental illness (SMI). In fact, this drop in life expectancy due to mental illness would surpass the health disparities reported for most racial or ethnic groups. Yet this population is rarely identified as an underserved or at-risk group in surveys of the social determinants of health. </p>
<p>Why is there such a profound disparity in life expectancy for those with SMI? Disorders such as schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder are risk factors for suicide, but most people with SMI do not die by suicide. Rather, the 5 percent of Americans who have SMI die of the same things that the rest of the population experiences — cancer, heart disease, stroke, pulmonary disease, and diabetes. They are more likely to suffer chronic diseases associated with addiction (especially nicotine), obesity (sometimes associated with antipsychotic medication), and poverty (with its attendant poor nutrition and health care) and they may suffer the adverse health consequences earlier.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't need good social skills to dig through a dumpster for discarded food or clothing.</p>
<p>There are also soup kitchens that might feed them as long as they behave while on the premises, even if they might still say unusual things.</p>
<p>They might have good and bad days too, like most people. Perhaps they're able to keep it together for long enough to buy some bread one day, even if they were behaving erraticly some days earlier.</p>
<p>In some areas, there are cash refunds for empty cans and bottles. Homeless people in these areas often go around collecting these, and turn them in for money. You only need to find like 15 bottles to be able to afford a loaf of bread, which might sustain you for a few days. Sure, it's not a varied diet, but it keeps you not-dead, and you can supplement it with random stuff you find (or steal) elsewhere, like the occasional fruit, or maybe even some meat if you're lucky.</p>
<p>As for water, you'd be amazed at what you'll drink if you're thirsty enough, and cities often have fountains or other running water somewhere. Maybe they'll find a half-empty water bottle on the ground now and then too. They might keep a bottle to fill up whenever they come across fresh water.</p>
<p>Eating and drinking random stuff you find lying around is of course risky. It could be contaminated with lots of stuff. That's why it's not exactly uncommon for homeless people to be of poor health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Winnipeg, one of the coldest major cities in the world; I am continually astounded that people survive the streets here. Most homeless people hit the relatively balmy West Coast for winter, but there are still those who stay, and deal with temperatures that can reach -50Celsius (-58Fahrenheit) on rare occasions, and frequently stay below -20C (-4F) for weeks. </p>
<p>They mainly sleep in shelters, but some get banned for disruptive behaviour, and some cannot pay the minimal entry fee; the cardboard recycling dumpsters here have lids, and in the very worst pinch, they provide a relatively sheltered and insulated sleeping spot, if you can hazard the chance of getting accidentally dumped in a trash compactor truck.</p>
<p>Sleep aside, no shelter provides day services, and so they must find ways to stay warm for at least half the day. In the downtown core, Winnipeg has built a series of insulated walkways between buildings, over streets and underground, to allow comfortable pedestrian movement. This helps business to stay alive in winter, but these walkways are also a way for the homeless to stay warm without being targeted for &quot;loitering&quot;; they can simply walk around in neutral spaces, where no store-owner can kick them out. All the same, there's only so many times you can do laps in the walkways before you need to find a place to sit, shit, eat, panhandle, or busk, and I can't say what they manage to do then.</p>
<p>For many years, Winnipeggers have talked about our Frequent Flyers; a few homeless and mentally ill people, less than 20 of them, who rack up massive bills for the city by calling 911 and getting a free ambulance ride and checkup; 911 operators are bound by regulation to send an ambulance if the caller lists certain symptoms (which I will not disclose); they may be on first-name basis with the caller, and be fully aware of their ill intent, but if they didn't send paramedics, they'd lose their jobs. </p>
<p>The Paramedics are similarly bound; if the &quot;patient&quot; lists certain symptoms, they must assume good faith and bring the patient to the appropriate hospital that specializes in the symptoms described; basically, this means that a free phone call can be used as a way to get social contact (fucked up as it is, they are often genuinely desperate for any kind of interaction), warmth, and a free ride to a few locations in Winnipeg. It's infuriating and ingenious at the same time; they cost us huge amounts of money, I've heard estimates in the hundreds of thousands all told, and it would be so much more affordable if we made some other sort of provision for them, like maybe bought them each a bus pass. Chances are, they'd lose or sell it though.... it is a pickle.</p>
<p>Sorry if this was a little off-topic, I got carried away. Hope it's interesting!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oftentimes, homeless people wind up in jail. Not for long periods, but they are highly prone to becoming &quot;regulars&quot; in the local jail wherever they live. The homeless are locked up for many reasons: stealing is most common, but sometimes it's for harassing others, assault, or drug crimes. Homelessness, mental illness, and drug use are all correlated. </p>
<p>I work in a jail and very frequently see inmates living on the streets after they are released. But contrary to popular belief, homeless people do not relish being locked up. No one likes being in jail. They can't wait to be released because even if they have nowhere to live, they are at least free to either find more drugs or because they just hate the highly structured life that comes with being incarcerated. When they go to jail, they are fed and given medical treatment for whatever problems they have and even get a few days worth of whatever medicine they need after being released. And this is part of how they survive: jails have a fundamental purpose in keeping inmates alive. </p>
<p>I've seen one homeless person in particular with a combine five years of time in jail - but his longest sentence was only 25 days! So the average length of his stay is something like a few days at a time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chicagoan here. There's an EXTREMELY schizophrenic woman that lives under the awning on Randolph that is always talking to herself. Never makes eye contact. But is always eating. I imagine she survives literally exclusively on the kindness of strangers. </p>
<p>Abama is like the metra station poltergeist. He's drunk as fuck 24/7. Sleeps with lit cigarettes in his mouth. And gets arrested when shit goes south for him. But he's quite funny, in like a &quot;fuck it and fuck you&quot; kinda way. Not a laugh at this drunk homeless man kinda way. So I think people give him cash when they see him. People smoke weed with him fairly frequently. I certainly notice when he gets locked up for a few weeks. </p>
<p>This one dude, whose entire understanding of the english language is &quot;Have a nice day guys&quot;. Who is always excited to be there, despite being dealt a completely shit hand in life. His like weird split second positive interjection really stands out.  He goes away in the winter though. I think he's got something figured out. </p>
<p>But there was one dude. Whose entire existence was just as like a silent mummy under a pile of blankets on wacker. Never interacted with anyone. He just died when it got too cold. Froze to death on the sidewalk. </p>
<p>So I guess like. Some do. Some don't. all depends on how you sell it  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
