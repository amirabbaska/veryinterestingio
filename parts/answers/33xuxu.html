		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar physicist here.</p>
<p>The Sun is immensely loud.  The surface generates thousands to tens of thousands of watts of sound power for every square meter.  That's something like 10x to 100x the power flux through the speakers at a rock concert, or out the front of a police siren.  Except the &quot;speaker surface&quot; in this case is the entire surface of the Sun, some 10,000 times larger than the surface area of Earth.</p>
<p>Despite what /u/Bigetto said, we do in fact know what the Sun &quot;sounds&quot; like -- instruments like SDO's HMI or SOHO's MDI or the ground-based GONG observatory measure the Doppler shift everywhere on the visible surface of the Sun, and we can actually <em>see</em> sound waves (well, infrasound waves) resonating in the Sun as a whole!  Pretty effing cool, eh?  Since the Sun is large, the sound waves resonate at very deep frequencies -- typical resonant modes have 5 minute periods, and there are about a million of them going all at once.</p>
<p>The resonant modes in the Sun are excited by something.  That something is the tremendous broadband rushing of convective turbulence.  Heat gets brought to the surface of the Sun by convection -- hot material rises through the outer layers, reaches the surface, cools off (by radiating sunlight), and sinks.  The &quot;typical&quot; convection cell is about the size of Texas, and is called a &quot;granule&quot; because they look like little grains when viewed through a telescope.  Each one (the size of Texas, remember) rises, disperses its light, and sinks <em>in five minutes</em>. That produces a Hell of a racket.  There are something like 10 million of those all over the surface of the Sun at any one time.  Most of that sound energy just gets reflected right back down into the Sun, but some of it gets out into the solar chromosphere and corona.  None of us (professional solar physicists) can be sure, yet, just how much of that sound energy gets out, but it's most likely between about 30 and about 300 watts per square meter of surface, on average.  The uncertainty comes because the surface dynamics of the Sun are tricky.  In the deep interior, we can pretend the solar magnetic field doesn't affect the physics much and use hydrodynamics, and in the exterior (corona) we can pretend the gas itself doesn't affect the physics much.  At the boundary layers above the visible surface, neither approximation applies and the physics gets too tricky to be tractable (yet).</p>
<p>In terms of dBA, if all that leaked sound could somehow propagate to Earth, well let's see... Sunlight at Earth is attenuated about 10,000 times by distance (i.e. it's 10,000 times brighter at the surface of the Sun), so if 200 W/m^2 of sound at the Sun could somehow propagate out to Earth it would yield a sound intensity of about 20 mW/m^2 .  0dB is about 1pW/m^2 , so that's about 100dB.  At Earth, some 150,000,000 kilometers from the sound source.  Good thing sound doesn't travel through space, eh?</p>
<p>The good folks at the SOHO/MDI project created some sound files of resonant solar oscillations by speeding up the data from their instrument by 43,000 times.  You can hear those <a href="http://solar-center.stanford.edu/singing/#sing" target="_blank">here, at the Solar Center website</a>.
Someone else did the same thing with the SDO/HMI instrument, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWCJkG31h0c" target="_blank">superposed the sounds on first-light videos from SDO</a>.  Both of those sounds, which sound sort of like rubber bands twanging, are heavily filtered from the data -- a particular resonant spatial mode (shape of a resonant sound) is being extracted from the data, and so you hear mainly that particular resonant mode.  The actual unfiltered sound is far more cacophonous, and to the ear would sound less like a resonant sound and more like noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've spent the last 5 years working with NASA scientists to translate data from the sun into sound through a process known as audification. It looks like the question of raw intensity has been pretty well covered here, I'd be more than happy to chime in on <em>what the sun sounds like.</em></p>
<p>The answer is... it depends on <em>how</em> we listen to the data and over what time-scale.  If we <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOszY79xSkQ" target="_blank">audify to 12 years of data from the Advanced Composition Explorer satellite</a>, we'll hear an underlying &quot;hum&quot; produced by features that persist across multiple solar rotations, and we'll also hear spherical harmonics generated by the solar magnetic field.  Particle observations are generally gathered at a sampling cadence of roughly two-hours, while the solar magnetic field is typically sampled at a rate above the ~10 Hz.  I produced a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTr23HV47D8" target="_blank">two minute video that walks through the solar-wind audification process while providing audio examples of various wave-particle interactions</a>.</p>
<p>If you'd like to dive a bit deeper... <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/more-than-meets-the-eye-nasa-scientists-listen-to-data/" target="_blank">nasa.gov ran a nice story that covers what we've been up to, provides a few audio/visual examples, and links to a recent research publication</a>.  We can also use a process known as parameter-mapping sonification to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=S-saaAyaW0c" target="_blank">listen to events like solar flares and coronal mass ejections</a>... though through this process we lose the direct 1-1 correlation between the frequency space of the raw data, and the frequency space of the audio spectrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;In 2006, NASA discovered &quot;space roar&quot; â€”a sound that's six times louder than what they expected to hear when they eavesdropped on space. Inexplicably weird, right? Stuff to Blow Your Mind explores.&quot;</p>
<p>A really good podcast in general if your into multitasking while also being entertained.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
