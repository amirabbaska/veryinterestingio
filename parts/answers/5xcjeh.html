		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body will not hold onto the food for five days. It will either absorb it as it passes through our it will pass some of it out in about a day if it cannot absorb it all. Most likely your body will be able to absorb 2000 calories eaten in one meal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To begin, a Calorie isn't exactly &quot;absorbed.&quot; All a kcal is is a measurement of energy required to raise the temperature of one kg of water 1 degree celsius at 1 atmospheric pressure. And, in physics, the amount energy in the universe is fixed. We use the energy, but release energy as well as heat, as matter, etc.</p>
<p>So, with that out of the way, your body definitely would metabolize 2,000 Calories in one sitting versus several days completely differently. Your stomach generally holds onto food for 3 - 6 hours, depending on how much fat content is in it; fats take longer to break down because they must be emulsified first, and then broken down into fatty acids and glycerol, absorbed through your intestines into lacteals, which are a part of your lymphatic system, and then disbursed throughout your body.</p>
<p>The biggest factor to consider concerning metabolization and Caloric intake is which type of macro nutrient we are talking about. Ignoring vitamins and minerals, fats, carbohydrates, and proteins are broken down in different ways. Simple sugars and carbohydrates are the easiest to break down, and are a preferred source of energy in some ways, because of their high bioavalibility; sugar is excellent for bursts of energy, ya know, to outrun lions, or catch the rabbit for food. Fats require a lot of oxidation to be utilized, so when you are walking, sitting, sleeping, studying, pooping, or anything that does not raise your heart rate very much, (IE: using oxygen rapidly as energy in conjunction with sugar for your muscle cells) your body will use the oxygen to oxidize fats for energy. This is why we say fats give 9kcal per gram. Proteins are a different beast, that I will not get into.</p>
<p>TLDR; the way Calories are metabolized depends on the activity you are, or are not doing. And, there is a timer in which foods consumed will be utilized for energy, or stored for later use, and this time period is just a handful of hours--much less than one day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sort of depends. Mostly depends on the type of food.</p>
<p>Your body is going to do its darndest to absorb all the calories that it can. most of the time it does a pretty good job, but sometimes things make it down far enough into the intestines that gut bacteria get to eat some of it - oftentimes this leads to what we call indigestion.</p>
<p>If you spread out 2000 calories of normal food over a 5 day period, your body will get pretty much every bit of nutrition (calories, this case) that it can. If you eat 2000 calories worth of fat and sugar in one sitting, your body can pretty much get all those calories into your bloodstream where they will be dealt with in one manner or another. If you eat 2000 calories of tough meat, high fiber foods, and other tough to digest foods, and if you eat it all in one sitting, a portion of the meal will move down the intestinal tract before being absorbed, and a bit of it will be utilized by bacteria or be left over in your fecal matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're thinking of calories as a day to day thing. How about weekly calories? If my goal is 2000 calories a day x7=14000 per week. If you add up your caloric expenditure for each day and realise that by Friday you have 8000 calories left, you offically earned a cheat day where instead of eating 1200 cals in a day you can fuckin eat 2500 cals for 3 days straight and STILL lose weight! For a while I was eating like a king at home, but then packing bullshit ass lunches to try to lose weight. Now I ride my bike to and from work, eat like a king at work, and on my days off veg out and lay off the carbs; Essentially carb cycling.  Also, as a former alcoholic, I was really use to drinking my calories. When I stopped drinking alcohol and soda my daily calorie intake dropped from nearly 3000 to barely able to eat half that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short, simple answer is yes. If you eat a 2000 calorie burger one day and nothing else for 5 days, your body will 'absorb' about the same amount of energy as if you eat 1/5 of that burger every day. Athletes who are training very hard can consume in excess of 10,000 calories a day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
