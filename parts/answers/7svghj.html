		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature and pressure can both be overcome with technology rather easily, particularly when you are discussing our civilization at the point of colonizing exoplanets.  To a point, of course - we don't know of any materials that could withstand pressures deep within Jupiter's atmosphere, for example.</p>
<p>Gravity is harder, and has the largest effect on our ISS astronauts today - and note that their environment has lethal temperature and pressure conditions for the unprotected human body.</p>
<p>Lesser planetary gravity might be tolerable to humans in the long term, within reason, by wearing intentionally heavy body suits from head to toe.  The practicality of that becomes impinged at very small  fractions of earth gravity though as to my knowledge the only materials that are heavy enough are either inflexible, toxic, radioactive, or all three.</p>
<p>For larger gravity values, we simply don't know.  Existing in a high gravity environment would require the heart to work harder, and there are limits as to how hard it can work for how long.  Additionally, at very high G values our physical structures simply won't be strong enough to cope with the stress of the environment and we will be unable to move without breaking.</p>
<p>However, since we're already in the realm of science fiction as we discuss exoplanets, it is not impossible to consider a person intentionally replacing his heart with a more powerful artificial version designed for higher gravity values and moving around the planet with the aid of a strong exosuit, such as the ones already at work in Japan.</p>
<p>Again, we're so far away from being able to experiment to know for sure.  The human body has proven incredibly adaptable for environments on Earth, so I suspect we will one day be surprised at how well we cope with exoplanetary conditions, particularly generationally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of orbital radius this has been an active area of research. There is a lot of doubt as to the conventional &quot;habitable zone&quot; being in fact the true extent of habitability. This is because it does not take into account effects such tidal heating (there is a nice paper I read a while back about habitable zones around distant gas giants due to tidal heating). </p>
<p>Further the orbital radius alone can not give a true measure of habitability as the rotation period and eccentricity play a role. There were some interesting papers looking at liquid water on high eccentricity planets that are only partially within the normal habitable zone. </p>
<p>Although the above is criticism over the habitable zone which just looks for where liquid water exists than where is habitable for humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I frequently read discussions about &quot;terra-forming&quot; other planets, making them more human friendly.  I wonder if, when we do begin to colonize other worlds, it would make more sense to change the people to fit the planet.  If the new world has a higher gravity, genetically engineer the people to fit that environment.  They would want short, stocky bodies with great strength.  If the new world has an atmosphere that holds a smaller percent of oxygen than Earth, the people would need greater lung capacity and a more efficient circulatory system.  Over time this would lead to the galaxy being populated with &quot;humans&quot; who were different species, but shared a common ancestry.</p>
<p>It's just a thought that I use to amuse myself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
