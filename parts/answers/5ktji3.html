		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemical engineer here with only undergrad classes, but my understanding is no in both cases. This is because a system where every molecule has the exact same speed/energy is actually very low entropy, so would not form spontaneously. The second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy in an isolated system (such as yours) always increases towards the maximum.</p>
<p>For a system like you are describing, the maximum entropy state is one where the molecules have a <del>normal</del> boltzmann distribution of energy.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone with more knowledge will be able to correct me and/or expand further.</p>
<p>Edit: just saw microli's response... forgot about the Boltzmann distribution. Edited to correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have mentioned the Boltzmann distribution, but that's only correct for the canonical ensemble. If you have a completely closed and isolated system, you have a microcanonical ensemble. The equilibrium distribution for the microcanoncial ensemble is not the Boltzmann distribution, but rather a uniform distribution.</p>
<p>So all the particles in the gas will not have the same energy nor speed. But they'll obey a probability distribution which assigns the same probability to every accessible state.</p>
<p>If your system is closed but not isolated, and held at thermal equilibrium with a reservoir at temperature T, then you've got a canonical ensemble. In that case, the probability of each particle being in a state with energy E<em><em>i</em></em> is not uniform, but rather proportional to exp[-E<em><em>i</em></em>/kT], where k is Boltzmann's constant.</p>
<p>If you write this in terms of velocities (assuming a nonrelativistic gas), it becomes exp[-m<em><em>i</em></em>v<em><em>i</em></em>^(2)/2kT]. I've written the mass as m<em><em>i</em></em> to account for the different species in your second situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The particles in a gas at equilibrium (ignoring quantum effects) will have a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boltzmann_distribution" target="_blank">Boltzmann distribution</a>. This means that you're more likely to find low energy, i.e. low velocity, particles, but there is also a nonzero probability for finding particles with pretty much any energy. The probability for high energy particles drops off very quickly above the Boltzmann energy kT. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No the velocity of particles will assume some distribution. Gasses in a closed system will reach thermodynamic equilibrium. Most gases can be approximately fairly well as an ideal gas. The velocity distribution for ideal gases in thermodynamic equilibrium is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution" target="_blank">Maxwell-Boltzman Distribution</a>. It's mean value defines the kinetic temperature and the distribution is slightly positively skewed.<br />
In real life gases won't behave exactly like ideal gases, so there might be some differences to this <em>model</em> but the main idea is still the same: The particles won't all have the same velocity but rather some distribution of velocities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
