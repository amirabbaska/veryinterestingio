		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>You're probably smelling molecules that are oxidized. Many compounds can react with oxygen in the presence of a metal. That metal acts as a catalyst to facilitate the reaction, and you can smell the oxidized byproduct. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Your sweat and skin is filled with various oils. These are long chains of carbon and hydrogen which serve to store energy and lubricate things and for your skin prevents drying out. When they touch metal they get close, have some of their bonds disrupted, and react (catalysis) into various smelly aldehydes and ketones.<br><br>Exactly which ones are causing the smell varies from person to person.<br><br><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oct-1-en-3-one" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oct-1-en-3-one</a><br><br><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16218683" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16218683</a><br><br>But this is one of the major ones.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Others here have done a great job explaining what you're actually smelling, but I would like to temper your assumption that solids, even metals, don't have some tiny probability of losing constituent particles from their matrix. They do indeed. The reason incandescent light bulb filaments are made of tungsten is that, out of all the elements, it has the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vapor_pressures_of_the_elements_\(data_page)" target="_blank">highest vapor pressure</a> of all elements. Of course, this regards its performance at the high temperature of the filament, so the other explanations here are what accounts for the perception of metallic smells under normal conditions.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>&quot;Overall “skin–iron odor” mechanism: The metallic odor from iron contacting skin is surprisingly a type of human body odor. Sweaty skin corrodes iron metal to form reactive Fe2+ ions that are oxidized within seconds to Fe3+ ions while simultaneously reducing and decomposing existing skin lipidperoxides to odorous carbonyl hydrocarbons that are perceived as a metallic odor. This fast reaction creates the sensory illusion that it is the “metal in itself” that we smell right after touching it. Similar mechanisms underlie the skin– metal odors of iron, copper, and brass used as every-day objects.&quot;</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
