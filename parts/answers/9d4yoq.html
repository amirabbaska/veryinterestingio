		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This only applies to traditional animation before everything started being done on computers. Each frame of an animation was a picture of a bunch of transparent sheets layered on top of a background. Each frame of an animated object was drawn on a transparent sheet, and then those would be layered, moved around, and swapped out to produce the final scene that was photographed, kind of like slides under a projector. It's basically just 2D stop-motion.</p>
<p>So objects that will move look different from the background because they're a completely separate drawing. That static pile of rocks is part of the single, high-quality, painted background. That one rock that's going to move is drawn separately on a transparent sheet on top of it. Most likely more than one sheet since it will probably have multiple frames of animation instead of just a single image sliding across the scene.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Three reasons:</p>
<p>One is because the process used to make older shows is called 'cel animation' and involved layers upon layers of artwork that was combined into a single scene. Disney pioneered this <a href="https://youtu.be/YdHTlUGN1zw" target="_blank">technique</a> and made use of it for his movies, which drastically increased the speed that animation could be produced. However, since nothing is 100% transparent, all those layers add up to darker the background. The moving objects are literally closer to the camera and appear to be 'brighter' even when they are the same colour in real life.</p>
<p>Two is that you may notice that some films don't have this and it's usually a sign of high quality. The fact is that Sunday morning cartoons we're often produced on a shoestring budget and with very little time to spare, often only having a week to work on it. In this case, it doesn't make sense to make a bunch of background or items in different shades to match with respect to the layering. It just wasn't cost effective to worry about.</p>
<p>Third is that teams of in-betweeners were the ones making the cel sheets that have the animations, whereas the backgrounds are painted months in advance. It was literally different people, who could potentially be on opposite sides of the country making the different pieces. However, the reasoning is the same. It just wasn't cost effective to have them redo the sheets to account for changes in light because of the layering. It's obviously possible because certain films, notable Disney, did account for this. But low-budget Sunday morning cartoons very obviously did not.</p>
<p>Some people mentioned that we didn't have the ability to match colours and stuff, but that's just nonsense. It wasn't that they couldn't, it's that it wasn't worth the time and cost because they had to make physical objects for each and every frame. This is also the same reason why you see poses and actions reused: cost effectiveness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The static art was drawn and painted sometimes months in advance of the animation phase</p>
<p>Even if the static, key, and animated frames all used the same colour palette (which was hard enough to do, buying and tracking colours) the effects of light bleaching and dessication would alter the background colours Vs the animation colours</p>
<p>Also studios started outsourcing more and more, so colour analysis sometimes went out the window</p>
<p>And lastly now as an affectation, perhaps it helps those who don't see in the strictly typical manner to have visual cues as to what will and won't be moving in the scene</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
