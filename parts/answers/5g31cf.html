		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a form of protection for the accused. There can actually be a long time between arrest and trial and there is only one way to guarantee that the accused shows up to trial: jail them in the interim.</p>
<p>Since a person not yet tried is technically innocent, and since this interim period can be long (and historically has been used to jail people indefinitely), we have the option of releasing them until the trial.</p>
<p>But we still need a way to ensure they show up for trial, so we have bail. They pay money that the court keeps until they show up for trial. If they show up, they get the money back, if not, they lose the money (and get other crimes added to their charges, to boot).</p>
<p>The more severe the crime, the more severe punishment the accused faces, and the greater incentive is needed for them to appear to face that possible punishment, so we have higher bails for those crimes.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Some answers to common replies:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Yes you can get the money back even if you are guilty, but the government will take from that fees, fines and other penalties. Since it's money you would owe anyway, them taking it out of money they are already in possession of is the same thing as giving you all the money back and then just taking the money anyway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is not a loan. It is collateral. You do not get interest and it is not adjusted for inflation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yes, this is just one of many aspects of the US criminal justice system that hurts poor people more than rich people. It is not the only aspect nor the aspect that hurts poor people the most.</p>
</li>
<li>People that cannot afford bail outright (almost everyone) can use a bail bondsman. This is a person or company that will pay your bail for you, but the price of that is they permanently keep 10% of that fee. So if your bail is $50,000, you pay the bail bondsman $5,000 and they will foot the rest of the bill to the government. So you are permanently out $5,000 as opposed to being temporarily out $50,000. If you skip trial (meaning the bondsman loses their money) they will hunt you down and find you and not be very friendly about it.</li>
</ol>
<p>EDIT2:</p>
<p>Update from /u/wickedogg regarding bond bailmen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As an attorney who works for a bail bondsman, hunting people down is not the main consequence of skipping trial. The main thing that we do is go after the people who agreed to guarantee the bail. The accused (to use your term) needs someone to go to the bondsman for him and usually that person is a parent, or uncle, or other family member. That person signs a guarantee and a confession of judgment along with providing a detailed accounting of all their assets, job, and personal information. When the bail gets forfeited I file the judgment and take the money out of bank accounts, garnish wages, and take property. All of this is motivation for the family to make sure that the accused shows up in court in the first place, or turns himself in soon after skipping a court date.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Attorney here, with the majority of my practice in criminal law. The terms &quot;bail&quot; and &quot;bond&quot; are used pretty interchangeably. In theory, bail is used to ensure your appearance in court. You have to &quot;post&quot; the bond with the court in full. The amount is set based on a number of factors, all with the focus being on what will it take to make sure you come back to court. So if you have a very serious crime, it will take a lot of money to make sure you come back, rather than just run. If you have a history of skipping out on court dates, you get a high bond. If you have the ability to travel to foreign countries, high bond. If you've never been in trouble before, have strong ties to the community, and are intent on contesting the charges, a lower bond. Most judges have  standard &quot;x charge = y bond&quot;, and will only deviate from that (up or down) based on extraordinary circumstances. If you show up for your court, that money is refunded to you, or oftentimes is applied to fines and court costs if you are found guilty.</p>
<p>Bail bondsmen come in to play when you cannot afford your bond. They are licensed and regulated by the courts. In my state, their fees are also regulated - 10% of the bond plus fees. If you have a $50,000 bond, you are going to pay the bondsman $5,000 plus his fees (usually $80-$250). That money is a payment to the bondsman and you will not get it back. The bondsmen then signs some paperwork with the jail saying they are guaranteeing you will be in court on the specified date and time, and if you are not, then they are on the hook for the $50,000. This is where &quot;bounty hunters&quot; come from. In most cases, the bounty hunter and bondsman are the same person. If you miss court, the judge will give the bondsman a set amount of time (usually 30-60 days) to get you back in to court before they make the bondsman pay up. So now it is in his financial interest to go find you. If he can't, he may hire a private party to find you, or put out a bounty, because it's better to pay $10,000 to the guy that finds you and brings you in than it is to pay $50,000 to the court. </p>
<p>It is important to note that just because your bond is forfeited, doesn't' mean you are off the hook for the charges you were facing. Your charges are still pending, you have a warrant, you will have a new charge for failure to appear, and you are out the bond money. </p>
<p>The court can impose almost any type of restriction it wants while you are out on bail. Common ones are GPS monitoring, surrendering your passport, and no out of state travel. </p>
<p>The system definitely favors the wealthy over the poor. If you have the money to post the $50,000, you aren't out anything. Most people facing criminal charges can't afford that, so they have to pay $5000 to a bondsman to avoid sitting in jail for the months/years it may take to get to trial. That $5000 is money they no longer have to spend on hiring an attorney or other things to help in their defense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>How does 'Bail' work in America?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The court determines an amount of money you can give to the court in order to not sit in jail between arraignment and trial.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do they attribute money to the severity of crimes?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The amount is set in relation to the risk of flight from justice (how likely you are to not show up to court if not held there between arraignment and the trial).</p>
<p>This amount, per the law, is to be set high enough that you will be compelled to not run, but low enough that you can afford it.</p>
<p>Typically, individuals use bail-bondsmen to obtain money for bail.</p>
<p>You pay a bail-bondsman a percentage of the total bail amount, and they front the rest to the court. If you fail to show, the bail-bond company send out bounty hunters to capture you in order to get the money they fronted to the court back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Bail is money you give to the court in exchange for a promise that, if you are let out of jail before trial, you will show up to your trial.</p>
<p>Bail basically is a means of ensuring that you show up - you aren't paying the government anything, you're giving them money to hold that they return to you when your trial takes place.</p>
<p>2) Bail amounts depend on two things - how much money you have, and the severity of the crime you committed. If you committed some heinous crime, they may not allow you out on bail at all; you simply cannot be trusted out in the community, and/or no amount of money could ensure that you wouldn't try to run, because you might be sentenced to life in prison or death. Likewise, if you have a history of running away when facing trial, they're unlikely to allow you out on bail for any amount of money.</p>
<p>If you have a lot of money, they're likely to ask for a greater amount of money from you for bail - to a poor person, $1,000 might be a lot, but to Donald Trump, that wouldn't be very much.</p>
<p>However, other factors are taken into account as well - having strong ties to the local community will tend to lower bail amounts, for instance, because if you fled, you'd have to be abandoning all that stuff. Owning a house or a business makes it much less likely you'll just run off because there's no way for you to take that house or business with you. Obviously, this varies depending on the crime.</p>
<p>The purpose of bail is ultimately to get you to show up - if they have other reasons to think you'll show up if they let you out of jail until your trial, they're less likely to ask for bail money.</p>
<p>3) If you fail to show up to your trial, you lose your bail money - the government keeps it.</p>
<p>4) In some states, such as Oregon, bail works slightly differently; instead of giving the government the full amount, you give the government 1/10th the amount of your bail. If you show up, you get that money back; if you fail to show up, not only do you lose the money the government is holding, but you owe the government the rest of that money as well, and they may seize it from you.</p>
<p>5) In some other states, it is possible to get a loan from someone known as a bail bondsman. Typically speaking, a bail bondsman will ask for approximately 10% of the bail as a fee; the bail bondsman then gives the government the full amount of your bail. If you show up to your trial, the bail bondsman will get their money back, but you won't get that 10% of the bail that you paid the bail bondsman back - that was their fee, so you're just out their money. This allows you to get out with 1/10th the amount of bail you would pay otherwise, but you do lose that bail for sure. This is how bail bondsmen make money.</p>
<p>In most states where this is legal, the bail bondsman can also hire a bounty hunter to track you down if you skip out on your trial - if the bounty hunter tracks you down and brings you back in, the bail bondsman gets their bail money back, though the bail bondsman will have to pay the bounty hunter for their services (though in some cases, bail bondsmen double as bounty hunters).</p>
<p>The practice of bail bondsmen and bounty hunters is controversial; the idea behind bail bondsmen is that, as private individuals, they'll hunt you down if you skip out on your trial. They also frequently force you to get cosigners for your bond, and if you skip out on your trial, those other people may become responsible for the loan that the bail bondsman made to you, further disincentivizing fleeing.</p>
<p>The problem is that this can lead to corruption (bail bondsmen make money from people going to jail, which can lead to them getting cozy with local law enforcement and judges in an attempt to get more money, as well as incentivizing them to want to push for more things to be criminalized), overly high bonds being demanded of people as a matter of course (because people only have to pay 1/10th of it), bail bondsmen  making money doing something that the government should be doing itself, it undercutting the idea of bonds in the first place, it primarily being directed at taking advantage of poor people, and the problems which can be caused by bounty hunters (who aren't law enforcement officers) doing illegal things, harassing people, or in some cases, kidnapping people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
