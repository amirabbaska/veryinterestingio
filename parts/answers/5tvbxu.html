		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot of great answers here and they all point out important aspects of it, but the main reason native apps are pushed is User Engagement. I don't know the whys of it, I suspect it's a psychological thing where you feel like you &quot;have&quot; something and so you're more prone to using it, but the data backs it up; if you can get your users to install your app they're more likely to keep coming back and using your product or service which equals more ad revenue or more purchases or more brand recognition or whatever they're going for.</p>
<p>Yeah, sometimes a certain product works better as a mobile app (games, super-rich UIs) but the main reason is engagement. There's something about the application showing up in that list that causes people to use it more and this is why companies push for it. It makes them money. They ultimately don't give a flying leap about the user's experience so long as they keep forking over (the two are usually related but not always). I'm not sure why this is since users were more than happy to jump ship years ago and get applications out of their Start Menu and into webapps like email, docs, spreadsheets, and even a lot of games, but that's how it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Over 60% (or more) of web traffic comes from mobile visitors. It's important for SEO to reduce bounce rates and increase time-on site. By not having a convenient mobile site will damage overall visibility (even on social pages) because people will leave. If a site &quot;pushes&quot; a mobile version then it's an old site and probably limited in great modern features. What people want is a &quot;responsive web&quot; structure that fluidly collapses across all browsers, and doesn't require a 2nd mobile design file which is expensive and outdated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't seen this listed yet, so I'll jump in late:</p>
<p>Because it's a mobile device, which likely means:</p>
<p>A) A smaller screen
B) A much less precise instrument for pressing links (a.k.a., your fat-ass finger)</p>
<p>These two things complicate each other.  It's obvious that having a smaller screen means less being on a screen at a time (such as menus, links, or the information people actually want to see).  Meanwhile, using a finger to press links means most people are less accurate, therefore links need to be bigger...taking up more of that precious screen space.  (For instance, all the tiny links at the top of the Reddit Desktop Site, of your favorite subs.  For some, such as WTF, my finger covers that, as well as parts of the links to the left or right.)</p>
<p>To compensate, mobile sites will reduce the number of links available, more out of necessity than anything.  Less options = inferior functionality, or in the best instance, harder to find functionality.</p>
<p>To further complicate the issue...with HTML, there are simply less things someone can do than with their own programing.  Such as having the now-familiar set of navigation buttons ever-present on the bottom of the screen that apps can do.  Also, with a mobile web-browser, even with disappearing controls, precious screen space is taken up by controls that have nothing to do with the site.</p>
<p>And, also, some of the aspects of HTML that designers often use are directed a cursor-control, as opposed to finger control  The most obvious of these is what's known as &quot;Rollover&quot;.  When your cursor goes over something, it may highlight, change, or pop something up to tell you your cursor is on it, or to give you more information.  There is no equivalent to doing this with a finger...a tap = a click, and even if something highlights when your finger touches it, you aren't going to know because your finger is over it!</p>
<p>A mobile app, while at times less functional and certainly less familiar, will allow developers to create an experience designed for everything mobile has to do, rather than try to force of cursor-based world onto your finger.</p>
<p>This is one big reason why, pre-2007, you did not see a lot of popular touch-screen computing platforms.  It's not like there weren't touch screens available...there were modification systems to turn Macs and Windows machines into touchscreens.  But the major reason they did not catch on was that shoehorning a User Interface based on a cursor into a finger is not easy.  The most common complaint I heard was that the buttons on Microsoft Word or Adobe Photoshop were too damn tiny.  It took one company to say &quot;F it, we'll build an entire new OS around touch interface&quot; to help the world open up to the popularity of it.</p>
<p>This is still a longstanding UI issue, and one that is still being debated today.  Microsoft Windows has spent years to create a unified OS that can do both, and particularly the first attempt was panned profusely.  Apple continues to maintain separate OS's (Now 4 versions, including TvOS and WatchOS), but has faced difficulty in getting users to learn using all of them.  Neither approach is failing, but both have faced significant challenges.</p>
<p>That last part will be my final point, I promise: The mobile UI experience is constantly changing.  First there were no styluses, now there are.  Pressure-sensitive screens have given new ways for users to interface with apps, but not all phones have them.  Not to mention the controls for voice-interface that are all over the place.  There are yearly changes to the mobile environment to try and improve user experience...but that means developers have to be on a fast learning curve to learn how to implement them...and then hope they aren't abandoned and changed.  And that's before talking about how to implement the voice control abilities on iOS are different than doing it on Android (not to mention Samsung's separate stuff), doubling or tripling to workload before you even talk about Microsoft's.</p>
<p>It's a complicated, extraordinarily fast-moving world in Mobile, even for the already quick-changing tech world.  Developers are playing catch up constantly, and that means the users are far behind...  And there's no easy solution, other than to hope that the UI world finds its groove in the next few years...</p>
<p>Oh, rumors say the home button's going away on phones???  Oh boy...guess you're going to have to tighten your grip on the reins of this Mobile OS life for a few more years.</p>
<p>EDIT: Yes, obviously cost was another reason why touchscreens were rare pre-2007, but popularity would drive that...the more you can mass produce, the lower production costs can become.  And the demand just wasn't there...and while I can't produce scholastic proof, my experience of being in tech since the 1990's will tell you the lack of satisfaction of touchscreen interfaces helped limit that demand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
