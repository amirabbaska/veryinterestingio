		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it will slow down and eventually stop if the rotation axis and the magnetic axis are not perfectly aligned (if they are aligned, there will be no radiation). This phenomenon is called magnetic spin-down, and is especially important for neutron stars, which rotate very quickly (1 ms- 1s period) and have large magnetic fields of 10^(12)-10^(15) gauss. In the most extreme case, a magnetar with a magnetic field of 10^(15) gauss and rotation period 1 ms, the spin-down luminosity is powerful enough to produce a gamma-ray burst, and magnetars are being studied as progenitors of gamma-ray bursts for this reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have touched on the main factors, but it's also worth pointing out that space isn't a perfect vacuum. It's close, but not quite. So there would be some incredibly tiny amount of normal &quot;air resistance.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A spinning anything in space will eventually stop spinning.  Because any manufactured material is going to have tiny variations in its density and manufacture there are going to be tiny variations in its rotation.  Those tiny variations will cause the material to contract and shrink heating itself, which in turn will be bled off into space through black body radiation.  Eventually this will take enough energy from the system that the rotation will stop completely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
