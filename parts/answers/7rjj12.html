		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few ways.  The flu can cause intense inflammation in your lungs and you can die from respiratory failure.   That's the most direct way (along with heart or organ failure, also brought on by inflammation).  </p>
<p>But the flu can kill you by making you susceptible to other bad stuff, too, because your body is weak and slow from trying to fight off the flu.  In fact the most common way to die from the flu is to get it and then get pneumonia as a result.  that's how the elderly usually go when it happens to them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Rarely flu can cause acute necrotizing encephalopathy (..which in other words is melting away of parts of your brain!) in kids who were completely normal and healthy before they got the flu. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a strain of the flu becomes a pandemic (like the Spanish flu in 1918, which killed an estimated 50-100 million people), it can apparently trigger an autoimmune response in healthy adults, potentially killing them. AFAIK, the details are not fully understood, but a suspect is what's called a cytokine storm (sp?).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a medical professional, but my understanding from working in nursing homes and hospitals as a social worker is the people with dementia (including from Alzheimer's) and strokes can't swallow well anymore and get pneumonia a lot easier, then can't fight it off well and the rest of the body and organs can't function as well leading to death.  Also respiratory failure of course, just adding a bit from what I have worked with.  It was so sad to see families want to put feeding tubes in when late stage dementia impaired swallowing and eating, not wanting to realize that you can get pneumonia from your own spit going the wrong way, and you just stuck a tube in them to prolong this last stage of their life.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
