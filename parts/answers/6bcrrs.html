		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from some good (and bad) answers others have given, there's a chicken and egg argument.  Lots of voters in these states think that federal funding has <em>harmed</em> the private sector and as long as the government continues to, in their mind, poorly spend money in their state, it'll keep it dependent on federal funding and be self-perpetuating.</p>
<p>They think that if the federal funding stopped, there would be a period of pain but then the private sector would be better positioned to help the state and make it stronger than before.  Whether you believe that or not- or maybe do in some cases but not in others- is up to you.</p>
<p>Side note: this is often a talking point about Brexit, too.  People that are against it will point to the UK's economy doing worse right afterward as an indication that leaving the EU was/is bad for the country.  People who are pro-Brexit will look at the exact same economic downturn and say &quot;Yeah, that the EU has that much influence over our economy in the first place is <em>exactly</em> the problem.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The household income in states like Alabama and Mississippi for example means that more people are eligible for and receive federal aid more than states with higher income levels.   The lower the income the less in taxes you pay. States like Florida and Arizona have a LOT of senior citizens so they also receive a lot in federal aid.  Also, and this is a huge one, Southern states (conservative) tend to have more military bases than Northern states (liberal) which draws more federal dollars, more federal contractors and more military retirees (retirees get benefits from living near a base).  All of this combined is the reason.  It is not political.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The correlation isn't perfect- look at Maine and Kansas as examples of that. </p>
<p>Beyond that, the big reason for this is the lurking variable of urbanization. Highly urban states are more likely to be wealthy and therefore send more money to the federal government, and urban states are more likely to have Democratic voters. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, people think they pay more in taxes and that they use less public services than they actually do.  </p>
<p>People with 7 kids on a 100k income and only paying 700/yr on school taxes complaining about welfare.  </p>
<p>Guys making 40k in Susanville, CA thinking that their taxes are paying for &quot;welfare queens&quot; in San Francisco.  (SF county median household income is double Lassen county.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cheap land.  It's available in many more conservative areas, while less conservative, more urban areas tend to have relatively expensive land.  </p>
<p>When the government needs 15,000 acres to build a new nuclear test area, laboratory, or other program it's likely to build it in a state where it already owns land or can acquire the land inexpensively.  Places with cheap land tend to have more families and married couples tend to be more conservative than singles.  </p>
<p>Further, an enormous amount of government spending goes to retirees a large number of whom work in high income/high cost of living areas and retire to low income/low cost of living areas (so their fixed pension buys a higher standard of living).  Retirees tend to be more conservative than younger people.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
