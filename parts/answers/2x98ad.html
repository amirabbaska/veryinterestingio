		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Net neutrality means that you, the consumer, get to access ALL, not just SOME, web sites, video and more at the speeds for which you've paid.</p>
<p>As a consumer you are paying your ISP/Internet Service Provider (Comcast, COx, Verizon, etc) for internet access at a specific speed.  You may be paying for nice, fast speeds so you can stream video at a good quality or have a general fast web experience.</p>
<p>Let's call the web sites, video, audio streaming and other web services you use - content providers.
Like you, content providers pay an ISP to be on the Internet.  They pay their ISP for nice, superfast speeds so that everyone who wants to access their content gets a nice fast experience.</p>
<p>You have an expectation to be able to reach any content provider at the speeds for which you've paid.</p>
<p>ISP's want to be able charge the content providers a fee to let you, their customer, through to their service - even though or perhaps especially because, the content provider has their content on the Internet elsewhere.
If the content provider does not pay that fee, you, the ISP's customer, ie, you, the consumer, will get only slow access to those sites and services.</p>
<p>Net neutrality says that the ISP cannot slow down access any content providers.</p>
<p>Beyond what you asked:</p>
<p>Absence of net neutrality favors big/established business and harms entrepreneurship and competition.  With Net neutrality, anyone can start be a new content provider - start a web site, a video service, be the next Facebook, etc. and know that everyone on the Internet can reach them.  You pay one fee to your own ISP have your content on the web.</p>
<p>Without net neutrality, you'd better have a big budget to not only pay your ISP, but also pay every ISP everywhere on the planet who will charge you a fee to let their customers get to your site.  </p>
<p>Without net neutrality, big established ISP's have the power to throttle any service they see as competitive.  You have a fledgling new video service? Heck please pay Comcast $2million and then and only then will their customers have access at speeds that lets your video work.  Then do the same again for Verzion. And so on for every established ISP in the country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since they did not include the last mile, we will still have telecom monopolies like Comcast, Verizon, At&amp;t, who will give lousy service, terrible customer service, and raise rates constantly just to make higher profits. It will be a huge barrier to overcome those monopolies since last mile was not included.</p>
<p>This does, however, open the door to local power companies(mostly, due to the last mile easement issue) to begin offering local telecom service. Hopefully these kinds of rollouts will be similar to the best internet service in America(and arguably the world) in Chattanooga TN. When the local power company rolled out that service Comcast had a mass exodus of customers in Chattanooga such that they are trying to sell off the city and leave. This will be years to happen in the cities that try to roll out a similar service, so for now most American consumers will continue to overpay for lousy internet service by monopolies. But the door is open to that changing over time.</p>
<p>It does classify internet as a utility and prevents more fuckery from the monopolies in many ways, it also shuts down the 'tiered internet', which is a huge victory to prevent other types of future fuckery from the monopolies too. Don't count these two short, while they basically benefit no one now, they prevent future nightmares.</p>
<p>But this is a first victory, and if all the lazy, apathetic majority of Americans think 'we won and I can stop paying attention now', which they most assuredly will, the incredible power of money will slowly and silently chip away at these gains in many ways over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Net neutrality has been a subject that's been debated for a while. Without net neutrality certain sites would be split into two types similar to an HOV lane vs. slow lane. Certain sites would be given preferential treatment by having faster speeds. Sites that are able to pay the premium would be in the HOV lane and sites that are not would be in the slow lane. This would make it unfair to many smaller businesses. For example pretend there are two local floral shop businesses . One is a large corporate floral shop and another is a small mom and pop floral shop.  Without net neutrality, the large corporate floral shop would be able to afford the premium for faster speeds whereas the small shop would not. This affects their business because no one like a slow website and many users may end up going with the faster site simply because we don't like to wait. Without net neutrality, internet service providers could also discriminate and sites that meet their agenda would be given preferential treatment. Net neutrality rules create an open and free internet.
As far as being the lowly consumer, nothing will change. Had net neutrality rules not been approved, then you would see some changes</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically nothing. And that's good.</p>
<p>Net neutrality is how the internet has worked all along. This was about preventing a bunch of seriously shitty practices from ruining the internet for consumers.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm getting a <em>lot</em> of comments from people who don't understand the basics (like, &quot;I can sell crappy pizzas and good pizzas for more money, why should it be illegal to sell good pizzas?&quot; Fortunately, I made [EDIT: wrote] a comic last year explaining what was at stake: <a href="http://economixcomix.com/home/net-neutrality" target="_blank">http://economixcomix.com/home/net-neutrality</a>.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Thanks for the gold, kind Redditor!</p>
<p>EDIT3: My site has been kind of hugged to death, or at least to injury; for the record, &quot;Error establishing a database connection&quot; is not the joke. Try refreshing, or /u/jnoel1234 pointed me to this: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140921160330/http://economixcomix.com/home/net-neutrality/" target="_blank">https://web.archive.org/web/20140921160330/http://economixcomix.com/home/net-neutrality/</a></p>
<p>EDIT4: Gotta go eat. I'll try to reply to everyone, but it'll be a while before I'm back online.</p>
<p>EDIT5: Yes, Stories of Roy Orbison in Cling-Film is a <a href="http://michaelkelly.artofeurope.com/karl.htm" target="_blank">real site</a>. Spock-Tyrion fanfic, however, is not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, what will <em>change</em> is nothing.  The Internet has always been neutral, and this FCC approval ensures that it stays that way.</p>
<p>If Net Neutrality hadn't passed, what would have happened is that ISPs would have started charging Netflix and Google a higher <em>rate</em>, because so much internet traffic is made up of their content being sent to customers.</p>
<p>The word &quot;rate&quot; is emphasized above because there's an important point that needs to be clarified:</p>
<p>People who use stuff more, should have to pay more.  For example, let's say you use a toll road one time per day and it cost you $1 per use, so $1 per day.  Someone else, let's call him George, uses the toll road five times per day and it cost George $1 per use, so $5 per day.  This is how the internet is now, and it's fair because the rate is the same no matter who uses the road, or what they're using it for.</p>
<p>What ISPs wanted to do is change the <em>rate</em> for people like George.  So in our example, the ISPs want to keep it $1 per use for people like you, but $3 per use for George, so now his five uses per day costs $15 per day.</p>
<p>What the FCC has done is ensured that ISPs can't charge different rates to different users.</p>
<hr />
<p>Today's FCC approval of Net Neutrality is good for innovation because arbitrarily adjustable rates would pave the way for ISPs to prevent startups from succeeding.  Let's say an awesome company figures out a way to provide internet access over hot air balloons or drones or something.  If Comcast is threatened by this new company, Comcast could charge the new company 1000 times the normal rate (to connect potential customers to the new company's website), ensuring the new company's failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
