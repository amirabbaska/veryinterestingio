		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad ran tower cranes for 30 years. They call it jacking the crane. There is a piece called the jacking collar that hooks into two sections of the tower and then literally jacks the top section up so that for a little bit of time there is actually a hole into which the crane lifts another section from the ground and the jacking crew inserts the new piece and bolts it in place. They raise the collar up and add more the same way. They normally do around 4-5 sections at a time. It is pretty time consuming and dangerous. He knew guys that got crushed when the collar slipped. There are specific crews that just travel around and do this. They usually work for the crane rental company as almost all cranes are rented for the jobs. They cost several million dollars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Simply put, the crane builds itself as it needs to, and tears itself apart as it needs to. </p>
<p>It is immensely fascinating to watch (hence why the link is in the beginning).</p>
<p>To give it more like an ELI5.</p>
<p>The crane is modular, so you can add pieces to the tower as you need, or remove pieces from the tower.  As the crane can move these modular pieces onto itself it uses a jack system to raise itself slightly so that the new piece can fit in.  Then someone bolts down the new piece and the jack system is raised and then attached to the new piece so it can do it over again.</p>
<p>The reverse is used to lower the crane.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They &quot;build&quot; them.</p>
<p>The one I saw was able to lift it's main body section (or whatever) high enough for the workers to add sections to increase its height one section at a time.</p>
<p>The legs extend out, lift the crane, workers install more scaffolding like sections, it's able to incorporate this into the entire structure...rinse and repeat.  Opposite chain of events to take it back down when done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tower cranes you see for such projects are made out of modular sections. You can add or remove sections as you want. The top part of the crane can move up one section so you can slide a new section under the top, you use the crane to lift the new section into place. Similarly you can anchor the crane to the building at a higher floor and remove the sections under the new anchors. When they are done most of the crane can be lifted down off the building by the crane itself. The last few sections are much easier to get down. For example by using winches or a helicopter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
