<p>So let's talk about Process S and the sleep wake cycle for a moment. The passage you quoted can be better described like this:</p>
<p>The longer you stay awake, the greater the need to sleep becomes. As you stay awake and burn calories and therefore make ATP for your body, you also build up adenosine as a byproduct of glycolysis itself. So the depletion of glycogen itself is not a cause for sleepiness but it does causes a build up of adenosine. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Adenosine is your friendly nucleotide that also has a huge role in the way signals propogate in certain cellular systems. There are many receptors for adenosine (A1,A2a, A2b,A3) but we will talk about A1 mostly.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It appears that binding to A1 receptors in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_forebrain" target="_blank">basal forebrain</a> <strong>inhibits</strong> neurons that primarily use acetylcholine to communicate (cholinergic neurons).  These neurons appear to produce wakefulness, so inhibiting them should make you less &quot;wakeful&quot;, even if not outright sleepy just yet. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So adenosine accumulates around wakefulness promoting cholinergic neurons which ends up inhibiting those neurons ability to &quot;send&quot; acetylcholine to the Ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO). This area of the brain is inhibited by acetylcholine while you are awake. But as adenosine builds up, less and less acetylcholine gets to the VLPO, which <em>dis-inhibits</em> or reverses the inhibition on the VLPO. So now that there is no acetylcholine stimulation on the VLPO it is free to do as it pleases. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The VLPO itself, even though it receives acetylcholine (and serotonin), uses GABA and galanin to communicate with other parts of the brain. Those neurotransmitters are generally inhibitory and will start to &quot;reduce&quot; activity in parts of the brain by inhibiting the firing of other neurons. This begins the suppressing of other parts of neural circuits that promote arousal. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So as you stay awake and burn calories, adenosine builds up, which turns anti-turns off (turns on) the VLPO, which begins turning off systems of arousal. And we should note that even before the VLPO is turned on, the decrease in cholinergic signals from the basal forebrain (caused by our adenosine build up) also &quot;reduces&quot; the activity of motor centers in the brain, making us less likely to use our muscles at full capacity. </p>
</li>
<li>While you are asleep, adenosine is metabolized by adenosine deaminase which catalyzes the irreversible deamination of 2'-deoxyadenosine and adenosine to deoxyinosine and inosine. With the reduction in the Adenosine content the body is excited from sleep slowly. So we <strong>need</strong> a certain amount of sleep to flush enough adenosine out of our brains. We have to give those enzymes enough time do its work (whether or not we can speed up this process is still fairly unknown). </li>
</ul>
<p>So adenosine is really only half the story. It's our introduction to sleep, where everything starts getting slower and more <strong>relaxed</strong>. </p>
<p>Now if we really want to fall asleep we need a bigger push. Here's where we start really considering our circadian rhythm and it's influence on what we call the <strong>homeostatic sleep drive</strong>, which is just a fancy term to describe our need to sleep to maintain homeostasis. </p>
<p>There are a lot of important components to regulating our circadian rhythm but we'll focus on a big one, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suprachiasmatic_nucleus" target="_blank">Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (SCN)</a>. Named because it lies <strong>above</strong> the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_chiasm" target="_blank">optic <strong>chiasm</strong></a> (a chiasm is where large bundles of neurons cross each other, like with the optic nerve)</p>
<p>The SCN is uniquely sensitive to signals from special ganglion cells in the retina. These retinal ganglion cells contain <em>melanopsin</em> which makes them particularly sensitive to <strong>blue light</strong>. </p>
<p>According to Holzman: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>other researchers explored the neural pathways that arise from the melanopsin cells. Roughly 40% of these cellsâ€™ axons project to the SCN.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So these projections from the retina are very strong and they influence the SCN greatly. While you can see blue light, those retinal neurons are inhibiting the SCN from doing much of anything. But once you stop seeing blue light (which traditionally only comes from the sun), the SCN is free and <strong>uninhibited</strong>. </p>
<p>Once the SCN is free, it can now send signals to other important parts of our circadian rhythm controllers like the hypothalamus and pineal gland, which will produce cortisol and melatonin, which leads to a lowering of our body temperature. </p>
<p>Melatonin is interesting because it acts like an anti-oxidant, helping take up radical (dangerous) molecules in our brain (that might end up poking holes in neuron membranes). It also helps regulate immune functions in the brain too, which seems to be very important in making sleep a rejuvenating experience for people. </p>
<p>Binding melatonin to melatonin receptors appears to help synchronize our circadian rhythms properly, setting the stage for when we need to wake up, also helping to ensure that our sleep is peaceful and relaxed. </p>
<p>So in this very generalized two-phase model of sleep, we primarily focus on the roles of adenosine and melatonin (as well as their targets). </p>
<p>Adenosine helps our body know when we are physiologically &quot;tired&quot; and melatonin helps guide our circadian rhythm in-sync with our environment, as well as protecting DNA and neurons themselves in our brain while we sleep. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Being awake builds up adenosine, which turns off the anti-arousal brain circuits, which makes you fatigued. Then when you stop seeing blue light, the SCN gets turned on and tells other parts of the brain to make melatonin and other sleepy signalers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We actually just learned about this yesterday! Basically, when you're awake your lateral hypothalamus is releasing orexin, a neurotransmitter which stimulates different centers in the brain to release serotonin, histamine, and norepinephrine, which, through a variety of mechanisms I'm not familiar with, keep you awake. At the same time your basal forebrain is inhibiting the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), we'll get back to that in a sec. As you said, throughout the day adenosine builds up due to your brain using ATP (energy), which creates adenosine as a byproduct. In a way, adenosine is to your brain as lactic acid is to your muscles; when enough builds up you can't use the organ as well. Eventually, enough adenosine builds up which inhibits the basal forebrain, disinhibiting the VLPO. The VLPO can then inhibit all the centers keeping you awake, causing you to get sleepy and eventually fall asleep. There's a little bit more detail than that, but I'm not super familiar with it yet as we just learned it yesterday. It's a relatively recent discovery, so there's always the chance we'll find something new to change our understanding of it. Hope this helps! </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your Wikipedia info was pretty on target, but let me add: Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that helps create &quot;feelings of tiredness&quot; in the brain, and slows one's heart rate. Caffeine is an adenosine antagonist, meaning it lessens the effect (by blocking receptors in this case), so that tired feeling is reduced, and heart rate increases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When it stars to get dark your brain sends out a signal to produce a hormone called melatonin. This drug helps us sleep and regulates the sleep cycles. Melatonin makes you drowsy and puts your body into a &quot;tired&quot; state. Then when you fall asleep the drug controls how deep you sleep, how long you sleep, etc. </p>
<p>Fun fact: All the way back to caveman days, when the sun went down people went &quot;home&quot; and went to sleep. Their body's adapted to this and released the hormone about the time the sun went down. That trait is still with us, which is also why it is hard for people to pull all nighters on a random day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
