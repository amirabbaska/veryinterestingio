You have more slices but it's the same amount of pizza. Getting money from another country is like another country giving you a second pizza. Not right now, but down the road you need to give them back a pizza, or possibly more than just one due to interest, but hopefully by that point you have enough pizza to pay them back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you print money, you get more currency units, therefore each unit has less value.</p>
<p>When a country gives money to another, one is losing money. There's no extra currency units being made.</p>
<p>However, the second scenario <strong>can</strong> lead to inflation depending on some conditions. Iirc Musa I of Mali gave gold to several villages in his pilgrimage to Mecca. The gold in those villages lost its original value because there was too much gold. I'm not sure if this is legit or just a legend but the point still stands regardless</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>what if I print money secretly?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>/u/danzibara gave a good explanation </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value of a currency unit is based on countless interactions between countless individual market actors. A quantifiable total of money doesn’t really affect some dude’s decision to convert 10 hours of labor into a trampoline. The currency is just a portable and storable method of trampolines (or substitute any other good or service). </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, /u/ZippyDan rightfully pointed out that the Musa I example wouldn't be doable these days</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about money supply (how much of that currency exists).</p>
<p>Money is just an abstraction of bartering one good/service for another. If those goods/services don't increase but the money supply does, then they become worth more money, since there's more money around now to pay for them with.</p>
<p>There's naturally a delay between the two, so sometimes governments play games - dangerous games - with the money supply.</p>
<p>As an illustrative example, lets say there are only two goods in the entire world - an apple and a banana. There are only 2 dollars in the world. The apple is worth 50 cents, and the banana is worth $1.50. Now I increase the amount of dollars in the world to 4. Since the apple and banana's inherent value hasn't changed, the apple will become worth $1 and the banana $3 (the banana is still worth 3x an apple).</p>
<p>So if a country prints more money, they increase the money supply and cause inflation. If another country gives them some of their own money, no increase in the money supply occurred (globally at least).</p>
<p>Inflation could still occur in the receiving country, depending on how much international trade occurs/is possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Country B cannot print Country A's currency. That's just how currency works. Therefore Country B cannot   give Country A's currency to Country A. </p>
<p>So let's say Country B is still feeling charitable and wants to give <em>something</em> to country A. What are its options? </p>
<p>-It can give goods. Food aid, weapons, etc. It's pretty clear to see why this wouldn't cause inflation. Those goods are valuable in their own right and wouldn't even necessarily need to be priced. If anything, it would cause deflation!</p>
<p>-It can give Country B's currency. This is just a more flexible version of giving goods. Country B's currency is just a coupon good for some of the goods that Country B produces. Only now Country A can choose what it wants to buy. </p>
<p>-It can <em>buy</em> some of Country A's currency with Country B currency or goods, then give that to Country A. This is just giving Country B's currency in disguise. If I used 10 USD to buy 8.5 Euro from Greece at the current exchange rate, then gave those 8.5 Euro to Greece, Greece ends up with the same amount of Euro it started with, plus 10 USD. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does.
Let's say country B is buying goods from country A.<br />
The value of money is defined by number of goods divided by amount of money.<br />
If you export way more then you import, you get ↑money and ↓goods, so you have inflation since the fraction goods/money gets smaller.
If you import more then you get the opposite effect:<br />
↓money ↑goods -&gt; goods/money ↑ = deflation
This is called induced/imported inflation and is an actual problem for countries.<br />
There are many reasons for inflation because in general inflation just describes the currency loosing value. (or more accurately: a sustained increase in the general price level)<br />
There can also be other reasons for inflation: for example
Latent inflation: When the i.e. government releases massive amounts of saved currency e.g. during war-times<br />
It can also look entirely different from the outside:<br />
Supressed/Repressed inflation: The government puts a price stop on certain goods, way below their free-market value (e.g. food during war) and thusly the public cannot spend money.<br />
The actual inflation here doesn't happen to the prices, but rather money in bank accounts. (you have inflation, just don't know it yet)  </p>
<p>tldr; Country B giving A money is inflation for A and deflation for B; inflation describes the increase of the general price level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
