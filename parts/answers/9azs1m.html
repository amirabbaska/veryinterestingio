		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although we have never explicitly observed violations of Baryon Number conservation, we have some strong reasons to believe that there are processes that do violate it. Even within the Standard Model there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chiral_anomaly#An_example:_baryon_number_non-conservation" target="_blank">some high energy processes</a> that should violate it (but we are not yet capable of looking for it in experiments), Another prominent reason why it's suspected that Baryon Number is not always conserved is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry" target="_blank">Baryon asymmetry</a> of the universe. </p>
<p>There is a lot of uncertainty about what happens in black holes, because to fully understand them we need a quantum mechanical understanding of gravity, which still eludes us. There is still some debate about whether or not black holes preserve quantum information. If information is lost, then black holes would violate many conservation laws. However, even if black hole evaporation does preserve information (as is most commonly believed), only perfect conservation laws would be respected. And since the symmetry that gives us Baryon Number conservation is probably imperfect, black hole evaporation would not conserve Baryon number anyway. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even without other hints at the violation of baryon number conservation, the process of Hawking radiation is believed to spell the death for all other &quot;global&quot; conservation laws in the universe. The idea essentially comes from the &quot;no hair&quot; theorem: from outside of a black hole, the only conserved quantities you can measure are conserved spacetime quantities (mass, momentum, angular momentum), and electric charge (or more generally, any &quot;deconfined gauge charge,&quot; of which there is only one in our universe). Things like mass and electric charge can be measured because there is a Gauss law: measure the flux of some field through a surface <em>outside</em> the black hole, and you know how much mass/charge is inside without actually looking inside the surface. There's no Gauss law of baryon/lepton number - you drop a baryon or lepton into a black hole and you never see them again.</p>
<p>Ed Witten recently wrote a really nice article about how we expect that only gauge symmetries survive in quantum gravity: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01791" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.01791</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a note: While it can violate baryon number (and lepton number): That only happens for very small black holes. The Hawking radiation of stellar mass black holes is exclusively photons and gravitons (assuming they exist) and maybe one neutrino mass eigenstate. To radiate protons as lightest baryon you need a black hole below one billion tonnes. To emit a neutrino with (say) 1 meV it needs a mass smaller than 0.1 Earth masses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
