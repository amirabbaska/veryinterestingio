		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Prior to the Nazi rise to power Germany was undergoing a push towards equal rights for homosexuals. Many men lived out lives and there were clubs and newspapers and other community oriented activities that were open about being for homosexuals. When the Nazis took power, these were the first people targeted. After that, identifying gay men proceeded much the same as it does in any country that oppresses homosexuality. People were outed to the authorities and punished. Some police forces set up undercover units. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People just freely grassed them up. The Nazis would literally get thousands of unsolicited letters everyday from Germans wanting their neighbours taken off to concentration camps. Often they weren't even really gay, just single and loners in a small town where people were arseholes. But it wouldn't just be one person in town writing letters, the Nazis would often received dozens from different people about the same completely harmless person so of course then the guilt of that person was then assumed as why else would all these normal people take time out of their day to write letters. </p>
<p>It's a very interesting aspect of the Nazi regime which gets over looked because it shows how german culture enabled and even encouraged Nazi atrocities and you could argue that cultural issue has never been fully addressed. The programme Nazis, A Warning from History had a piece on it and found one of the letter writers who got one of her neighbours killed, needless to say she denied any memory of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers are true and explain part of how homosexuals were identified. One thing I haven't read yet are the pink lists (German Wikipedia: <a href="https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Liste" target="_blank">https://de.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Liste</a>) The police had, even before the Nazis rose to power, been keeping taps on who was gay (mostly on male gays, though) or frequents gay clubs and bars. If you were under surveillance, there was little you could do about it since the police claimed that they're just collecting data and not using it (which was not entirely true). Of course, these lists came in handy when someone decided to round all homosexuals up. (it's a story you a lot when talking about data protection and someone drops &quot;I have nothing to hide&quot; or &quot;they're just collecting data, they only need a warrant when they want to do something with it&quot;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Germany was fairly liberal and supportive of gay people before Hitler. More people were out of the closet than you might think. They were unfortunately easy targets for the Nazis. As the Nazi party gained more and more power they spread more and more propaganda. People who were once tolerant began to fear homosexuals. In 1933 the &quot;purge of homophiles&quot; banned LGBT groups, clubs, and publications. In 1934 The Gestapo complies a list of all the known LGBTQ people. Thousands were arrested, some went to regular prions while others went to concentration camps. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hitler's regime operated very much on the basis of &quot;you make MY life easier and I won't kill you&quot; and this was especially true of the SS. When the SS patrolled a neighborhood, oftentimes people would inform on their neighbors of any wrongdoing, fabricated or otherwise. The SS fact checks these claims like a duck fact checks bread and many people who were upstanding Aryan citizens would be thrown under the bus by their neighbors for favor with the Gestapo. If any of the neighbors were known or even suspected homosexuals, they'd be offered up quickly. </p>
