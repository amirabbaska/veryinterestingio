On cosmic scales those differences are so insignificant that we can ignore them in models but they're still different. For the purposes of astronomy we can say that the OU is the same for every part of the Earth-Sun system, but yes... if you want to be perfectionist about it, your OU moves with you... wherever you go in spacetime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not in any meaningful way.</p>
<p>Scale is a factor here, the edge of the observable Universe is such a huge distance that the distance between where the Earth is in Summer and Winter won't make any difference to how far we can see, and the same can be said even of being on the surface of Pluto.</p>
<p>Technically we might be able to see further by the distance between Earth and Pluto, or see further in a particular direction based on where the Earth is relative to the sun, but given that we're talking about distances on the scale of the distance between stars, that isn't going to let us see anything we wouldn't have otherwise been able to see and makes no difference.</p>
<p>What might make a difference is the amount of observable bodies that are otherwise obscured by the light from the Sun.</p>
<p>On Pluto, this would make a pretty big difference, as the Sun would not be nearly as bright even when shining directly overhead and thus would obscure our view of the cosmos less than it does from the surface of the Earth.</p>
<p>On Earth it would have more to do with out distance from the sun in our orbit than what season it was. The shape of a planetary orbit is an ellipse and not a circle.</p>
<p>Though, again, due to the scale of the distances involved the difference between the furthest and closest points of our orbit around the sun would be so negligible that it wouldn't matter to a point that is likely noticeable.</p>
<p>That wouldn't really let us see any farther though, it would just make what we can see within that range clearer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
