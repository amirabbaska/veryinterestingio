		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert on the industry, but I do work in materials for one of the name brand companies you listed, so here goes:</p>
<p>In short: yes, generally speaking the material (and therefore quality) is different. Of course different doesn't have to mean better.</p>
<p>Brands have material palettes developed specifically for their product lines, either in-house or in partnership with material suppliers. This could be as simple as a new color for their basic tee shirt material, or as complicated as a new-to-the-world fabric made from unicorn hair (fictitious example, obviously). In apparel, this is accomplished through vertically integrated textile mills (company X owns the mill, which only makes textiles for X) or through exclusive supplier relationships (the mill is independent, but agrees to only make textiles for X, or at least not for X's direct competitors, etc). The further &quot;down&quot; the chain you go towards cheaper textiles, the more likely it is that a mill is making materials for many different companies - perhaps Forever 21, Target, and Walmart are all buying their basic tee shirt material from the same mill, and may even be using the same garment manufacturer and pattern too. </p>
<p>So yes, the materials are different. And yet you are also &quot;paying for the branding&quot; as well. The margins on finished garments from name brands are reasonably healthy for sure, but the price difference also needs to cover the additional cost of designing, developing, marketing, etc, which is generally borne by a name brand but not off-brands. A name brand may have a dedicated group of people coming up with new (unicorn hair) materials and generating the next trendy design, whereas an off-brand just buys off-the-shelf fabric and mimics the same style that came out of the name brand (some garment manufacturers will show all of their off-brand buyers the new hot shirt for the season, and multiple buyers will add it to their collection, resulting in literally identical garments at multiple retailers under different brands). </p>
<p>All that said, these are general truths, but there are always exceptions - a name brand may be using the same &quot;cheap&quot; material as a Walmart shirt, and a Target house brand could have a robust design team coming up with their own unique designs. </p>
<p>Edit to add: another big factor in the price difference is volume. The overhead costs of designing / developing a shirt are the same whether you make one shirt or one million shirts. Name brands produce fewer units (all the way down to just one unit in high end couture), so fewer opportunities to recoup that cost leads to higher price. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked with designer brands for a few years and can tell you that when you see clothing in Burlington Coat Factory &amp; TJ Maxx (or other Factory stores), what you're actually buying is clothing that was made for those stores. Cheaper materials and manufacturing is being used so they can sell at &quot;60% off retail&quot;, but they were built to be sold at that price and they're still making roughly the same margin. They are used to sell off mainline brand past season clothes also, but it will be mixed in and hard to tell a lot of the time (until 1 year of wear).</p>
<p>There is a big difference in the quality of materials and design of designer brands (Michael Kors and Tory Burch) compared to mass market &quot;fast fashion&quot; (stores like Wet Seal, Forever 21, H&amp;M).</p>
<p>If you go to the very high end of the market (Fashion Houses / Haute Couture, such are Chanel and Hermes), the product will all be made from the most sturdy materials, using the best equipment, and certain elements hand-sewn, this is where you get a coat at $3,000. This coat will have a massive difference in end product and durability to a coat bought at H&amp;M for $50. The difference though is not scalable at all, but this is where the marketing budget steps in.</p>
<p>The famous Burberry trench coats costs around £40 to make, and they sell at around £1K (for simplicity,
It actually varies by style) in their own stores. Fashion retail generally aims for a 60% retail margin, after tax, its £833 and with margin it's £333, so you have a difference of let's say £300 (after import and shipping). Burberry puts most of this into marketing. They are one of the big brands that takes out TV time during Christmas around the world... these are multi-million campaigns (anything on TV during Christmas is).
A brand of exact same quality, but none of the marketing presence would sell this product for about £300 (or $400). So with this in mind, a $400 trench coat is much better quality than a $100 trench coat (who are also making the same margin), but a $400 trench coat is the same quality as a $1000 trench coat.</p>
<p>TL;DR - clothing in cheap stores (Target and Walmart) is probably the same quality as clothing in the &quot;fast-fashion&quot; stores (H&amp;M, Wet Seal)... meaning it is bad quality built with cheap materials and meant to last only a season.
In fashion you don't really get into good quality until a dress/pants/shoes are $100+. Anything less is made using cheap labor and bad materials. If you buy at this range, you will need to buy less over the years (if you manage to stay the same size). But STILL BEWARE. Some brands label themselves &quot;designer&quot; and manufacture in the same factory as H&amp;M! If you're making an investment, look up the quality of the brand online first. </p>
<p>EDIT - I didn't think this would get so many questions/comments so I cleaned up my wording a bit (I wrote it originally absent minded) and made the english less British and more American (to please the masses). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is a great article from NPR laying out the world of men's suits <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/09/05/160607575/the-difference-between-a-99-suit-and-a-5-000-suit-in-one-graphic" target="_blank">http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2012/09/05/160607575/the-difference-between-a-99-suit-and-a-5-000-suit-in-one-graphic</a></p>
<p>There's a great documentary on Netflix called &quot;Dior and I&quot; (translated from &quot;Dior et Moi&quot;). It examines the design of one line of Dior haute couture. It's a French language film. Haute Couture is the most expensive fashion on the market and the right to be called haute couture is regulated with strict rules.</p>
<p>The world of ready-to-wear uses patterns based on average bodies to create garments. Ultra high end ready to wear (most of the stuff you see at fashion week) is meticulously constructed with premium materials and highly skilled techniques.</p>
<p>Haute couture is designed specifically for the body of the client, with design elements scaled up and down to flatter the client's figure and maintain the integrity of the design.  A mock up garment is painstakingly created by draping it on a dress form to create the sewing pattern. This garment is tried on by the client and taken apart to trace for the final garment.  The garment is hand stitched for a fitting, then hand stitched (often from the front side of the garment..  which is very very skilled and time consuming labor) only the finest materials are used, and the dress is often made with &quot;features&quot; that only the most skilled sewers can accomplish.  Dresses have intense structure to best hold and display the drapes and folds. Necklines are painstakingly shaped to ensure that there is no gaping. The most skilled levels of ironing and pressing are used (I'm not kidding here) to shrink and stretch fabric. Similar techniques of pressing and shaping fabric are really only used on the sleeves of fine suit jackets outside of this world. Expensive fabric is used with great care to match design elements across the seam lines, which means that the fabric is not used in a conservative manner.  The most labor intensive and technically challenging techniques are used to create a masterpiece. </p>
<p>[Edit] if you're interested in learning about the techniques used in couture sewing, I highly recommend the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00L2223DM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank">&quot;couture sewing techniques.&quot;</a>  It gives very practical information on the subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like to break clothing &quot;quality&quot; into three main components: materials, construction, and design (some people might consider durability as another important point, but when you're getting into some higher-end stuff, garments can be delicate yet well constructed. I'd lump that in with construction). Depending on the target market, the mix or emphasis on one or more of these components differs.</p>
<p>For example, a typical brand aimed at young adults like Forever 21 will focus most on design because that age group tends to be more fast-fashion. They generally like to follow trends and move on from styles that are no longer trendy. Spending extra money on a durable garment is thus unnecessary.</p>
<p>Contrast that with a company like L.L. Bean which focuses on materials and construction rather than design. They are aimed at a more middle-aged group that wants to buy something only once and doesn't care too much for the style. These kinds of brands have very basic no-nonsense designs that don't change much over the years.</p>
<p>Luxury brands try to hit all three, but can still be split into Big and Small. Big brands are ones like Chanel, Dior, Burberry, LV, etc. They're the ones that have the most markup for brand prestige, much of which goes to marketing. Small brands like Lemaire, MMZ, The Row, etc. have smaller supply chains and also try to build an artistic vision rather than a moneymaking business (not that Big brands aren't artful; they're often owned by a huge conglomerate that cares strongly about bottom lines though).</p>
<p>In short, as many people have mentioned already, brand sometimes plays a role. In terms of materials, construction, and design, however, these will differ from brand to brand depending on their target. An L.L. Bean sweater might last longer than a Ralph Lauren one, but there are a lot of factors at play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, Italian here.<br />
A friend of mine has a small textile factory in a town near Bari, southern Italy.<br />
He manufactures shirts and sweaters, and those without flaws (bad seam, rougher texture, unaligned buttons) are sent to Valentino, where they get the brand patch attached and are sold for way more than they cost in manufacturing.<br />
The flawed ones end up on the local markets, with unknown brand labels, and cost less than one tenth.  </p>
<p>In the past he worked also with Armani, though he dropped it because they paid less.  </p>
<p>I cannot talk in regards to &quot;store chain&quot; clothing, though, as he didn't deal with those.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
