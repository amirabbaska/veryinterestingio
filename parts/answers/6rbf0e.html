		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The Earth-Moon system is very close to a twin planet.</p>
<p>Luna in comparison to Earth is the second largest mass ratio in the solar system, I believe second only to Pluto/Charon. It is so large, in fact, that not only does the moon orbit the Earth, Earth orbits the moon.  Their common barycenter is not the center of the Earth, but a point only 1,000 miles beneath the Earth's surface.</p>
<p>Unless our theories of planet migration are flawed, twin planets should be possible if uncommon.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is theoretically possible for Trojan planets to exist, where a large planet orbits a star and a smaller one orbits 60 degrees ahead or behind the planet. Our solar system has lots of Trojan asteroid, and one of Saturn's moons has a smaller Trojan moon in the same orbit. I am unsure if there are planet formation reasons why this is unlikely (paging /u/dannei) but thus far none have been observed in the Kepler data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We almost are a  binary planet.</p>
<p>There is no other planet know where the moon is as large relative to the size of the planet as the Earth and it's moon!</p>
<p>If the moon were much larger than it is we WOULD be a binary planet </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Piggyback question that I've always wondered- Is it possible for 2 or more planets to share an orbital path around a star, assuming they move at the same speeds?  And how many would be able to be on the same path without messing with the other planets?</p>
<p>Example: We have Earth, and then, on the other side of the sun, at 12 o'clock to us, another planet, roughly where Earth will be in 6 months, and vice versa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
