		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bad stuff you ingested doesn't get entirely out the first time you vomit; there's some left behind. But once your stomach is mostly empty, you can't vomit the rest up (when your body tries, that's a &quot;dry heave&quot;).</p>
<p>The stomach refills with liquid and <del>bile</del> acid and stuff, and when its full enough to &quot;rinse out&quot; your stomach, you vomit again and that extra stuff carries away more of the bad stuff you ingested. This may need to happen a few times before your body is &quot;satisfied&quot; it's expelled enough.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I said &quot;bile&quot; when I meant &quot;acid&quot;, whoops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assume you mean food poisoning right?
It’s because it’s not the food itself causing you to be nauseous, but the bacteria inside of it, which can last much longer than your meal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I got food poisoning from Chipotle at the beginning of the year and man I don't wish it on my worst enemy. I called corporate and they did an investigation because several others got really sick too. Without being graphic let's just say I had to bleach my bathroom after a few episodes over 15 hours because my body forgot how to work. Your best bet is to sit on the porcelain bus with a bucket on your lap. I got sick so many times that my body had completely emptied itself. I drank water and couldn't even hold that in, so I was throwing up clear water. I almost went to hospital because I couldn't eat or drink anything for over 3 days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once had some bad chicken for dinner in India. We boarded an overnight train and in the middle of the night I woke up knowing something was wrong. Got down from my bunk and ran for the bathroom. But I wasn't going to make it, so I put my hand over my mouth. My stomach didn't care, and vomit rocketed out of my mouth between my fingers. I spewed on the carriage door, got into the bathroom and heaved some more.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it was a tiny bathroom, so when it happened I could put my head in the sink and my ass on the toilet and let my body take care of the rest.</p>
<p>Ended up having to change my pants (yup), then had to walk the whole length of the train before I found a conductor, where I had to awkwardly explain that I had vomited up an absurd amount of chicken chow mein in a public area. Came back to find out some dude on the train drinking my bottled water. When I questioned him, he said &quot;Oh, I thought it was the conductor's.&quot; Dude, what? It's still not your water!</p>
<p>I spent the next two days sick as a dog. We got to Agra and our hotel room. My girlfriend (now wife, even after all this) is telling me I've got to pull it together because we're going to see the Taj Mahal, and this is our only chance because we're continuing on the next day. I patiently listened to her argument before kindly asking her to move so I could vomit into the toilet. She got to see the Taj Mahal, I stayed in bed. Win/win.</p>
<p>2/10 would not do again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a literal phobia of vomiting --> nothing in the world makes me feel the way I do when I vomit. Shaking, too weak to stand but I'm still hurling and lurching. The anxiety as the saliva collects in your mouth. The relief after you throw up until that twisting uncomfortable pain starts in your stomach and grows stronger with each passing second.</p>
<p>I used to get gastroenteritis like clockwork every single June since I was 3 (almost died once due to dehydration) in which I would vomit 25+ times</p>
<p>This obviously affected me as I entered my adult years. I am now unable to throw up unless I am very very sick and even then will never do so voluntarily. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
