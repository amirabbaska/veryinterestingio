		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright, think of it this way.</p>
<p>Your cells are little sacs containing a bunch of solutes, like sodium and electrolytes. When the water-solute balance in your body is off (because you've drunk more water than your body can handle), the cells attempt to compensate by absorbing water from outside the cell (osmosis). The cells figure, <em>&quot;It's OK! We have enough salts and electrolytes that we can take on a little extra water!&quot;</em> </p>
<p>...but if the imbalance is great enough, the cells can't absorb enough water to correct it. All that extra water causes the cells to swell. When the brain cells swell this can interfere with their ability to function or cut off blood flow, resulting in death.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the responses below are correct, it has to do with the water and electrolyte shifts in the body. </p>
<p>The main electrolyte at play here is Sodium, and in severe dehydration, the sodium in our blood/plasma becomes very concentrated. This elevation in blood sodium levels is also a primary driver of our brain's thirst drive. More typically with a long drawn out, chronic form of dehydration this elevated sodium draws out fluid from within our cells to try to regulate the sodium level in our blood (osmosis) because our cells and nerves function best at a relatively narrow range of concentration. In severe dehydration and high sodium levels, rapidly correcting the blood sodium levels by drinking too quickly causes a sudden shift of water back into cells and the place where this is most dangerous is the brain (cerebral edema), which can quickly become fatal. It's usually pretty hard to cause such a dramatic change in water/sodium balance just by chugging water, but in such an extreme example like in the book, it's feasible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it's something called Water Intoxication (also known as Hyperhydration and Hyponatremia).  Water intoxication has killed Marathon runners (I've heard more have died from that than dehydration, but I don't have a link), and it can be very dangerous.  Essentially osmosis forces the electrolytes out of your body and you lose precious electrolytes, and you no longer function properly.  You need a balance of electrolytes (sodium, chlorides, calcium, magnesium, potassium, etc) and too many or too few can kill you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've had some great answers about but there's not much evidence on safe rehydration with water alone as electrolyte mixes are relatively easy to come by and safer. If all you have is water I'd GUESS you should stick to what your kidneys can eliminate as they are in charge of regulating your salt and fluid balance. They can filter a litre an hour so sipping a glass worth of water every 15 minutes would let your body deal with the rehydration steadily without sudden drops in sodium levels or cell swelling. </p>
<p>This is assuming something sudden has happened and kidneys would be working fine if they had enough water. If long term problems like being stuck in the desert for days I'd half this amount. If you lose water the salt levels in your body are more concentrated so bigger sodium levels. In hospital we aim to bring very high sodium levels down to normal over days and to rapid a drop causes all sorts of problems. Steadier is safer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All these people just overlooked the nuclear bomb part for some reason... everything's irradiated. The person's irradiated. The water,  the air.  If they were close enough to a bomb to have the water stucked out of them that bad, they were close enough to get hit with a lethal amount of radiation at the least.  They were full of radiation, burnt inside and out and on the brink of death; the water was probably their last wish at the time. The person who wrote that they died from rehydration is pulling at strings imo.</p>
<p>E: Found what I think your taking about. A woman gave water to a badly burned boy and he passed away after drinking. He didn't die from drinking water, he died from a nuclear bomb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
