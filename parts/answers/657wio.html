		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its a quick one-number metric used by lenders to judge how able you are or will be able to pay back your debts. 300 is bad. Noone will lend you anything. 900 is perfect. You could walk into a bank and ask for a $500k mortgage and you should have no problem.</p>
<p>How they're calculated is a closely guarded secret. But generally:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the more you pay off your debts (credit cards, line of credit) = good</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pay off big % of your debts every month (good) vs. just paying the minimum (bad)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do you have just a few big debts like a mortgage and a line of credit that you make regular payments on? good. Or do you have lots of small debts like 3 credit cards, and 4 store credit cards that all carry balances?</p>
</li>
<li>more outstanding debt = bad.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course this is one side of things. If you have a bad score but just got a massive raise, then your chances improve. Or a lender could also say &quot;pay off some of this debt first, then we'll talk about a loan.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a score that let's a bank know how responsible you are with your money, and how risky it is for them to lend to you. In other words, it's used to gauge how likely you are to pay off loans every month for long as it takes to pay the loan off completely. Essentially, a credit score is a <strong>responsibility score</strong> -- it won't <em>just</em> apply to loans. We'll talk about that later.</p>
<p>Several factors are used to come up with your credit score.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>35% of your credit score comes from you payment history.</strong> Basically they'll look at it all the loans and credit cards you've ever had, as well as stuff like insurance payments and rent, and see how often you make a late payment. So if the monthly payment on your auto loan is due on the 15th of every month, and you frequently pay it on the 25th, that will lower your credit score. <em>This means that paying stuff on time is really, really, important.</em></p>
</li>
<li><strong>30% of your credit score comes from your credit utilization rate.</strong> Your credit utilization rate is how much of your available credit you actually use. This is simpler than it sounds; take the amount you spend on a credit card, and divide it by your credit limit. Example 1: You have a credit card with a $1000 credit limit. You put about $200 on your credit card every month. Now divide $200 by $1000. The answer is 0.20. So your credit utilization rate is 20%. Example 2: You have a credit limit of $11000. You put about $9500 on your credit card each month. Divide $9500 by $11000. The answer is 0.86, so your credit utilization rate is 86%.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, it's important to note here that a credit utilization rate of 20% or less is <em>good</em>. It means you're using credit to buy things, but not a crazy amount. This, along with a good payment history, makes you look great. BUT if your credit utilization rate is way higher, like, 86%, that makes you look very, very, bad. That tells bank that <em>most</em> of the money you spend is borrowed (credit is essentially borrowed money. Pay with your credit card now, then pay back the bank later).</p>
<p>So let's say I'm the bank and you're asking me for an auto loan. If your credit utilization rate is 90%, I definitely don't want to give you that loan. If so much of the money you spend is borrowed, how can you possibly have enough money to make payments on the auto loan? Onward, financially savvy  steed.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>15% of your credit score comes from how long you've been using credit.</strong> Basically, this is just how long you've had credit cards, auto loans, etc. If you're 18, it won't be much. If you're 30, it'll be a lot higher. But remember, just like credit utilization rate, a long credit history doesn't help you if you have late payments; it actually hurts you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>10% of your credit score comes from your mix of credit.</strong> Really simple -- do you have one credit card and that's it? Or do you have a credit card, a mortgage, two auto loans, and a personal loan? Much, much better. Having different kinds of credit to your name looks good. That doesn't mean run to the bank and start opening different types of accounts to get a good mix, though. You'll eventually probably end up with a good mix of credit without even trying to. Essentially, this is just a grownup thing. A really young person doesn't really need a mortgage and an auto loan. But a 50 year old probably does.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>The last 10% of your credit score comes from new accounts.</strong> What you don't want to do here is open a whole lot of new accounts (like credit cards) in a short amount of time. If I open five credit cards in three months, that tells the bank that I'm opening a credit card, finding out I can't pay for it, then opening another one just to pay for the first one. And a third credit card to pay for the second... You get the idea. </li>
</ul>
<p>And that's what a credit score is. But where does it come from? Who gives it to you?</p>
<p>Credit bureaus. There are three credit bureaus. Equifax, Transunion, and Experian. So here's how it works. You get a $3000 personal loan from the bank. You and the bank agree that you will pay them back $83.33 per month for three years. You pay the $83.33 every single month for three years, just like you said you would. Every single month, your bank will report to one of these three credit bureaus to let them know whether you're paying them on time or not. That information will go on your credit report and be used to come up with your score.</p>
<p>OR let's say you're renting an apartment for $600 a month. You pay your rent late about eight months out of the year. Every single month, your landlord tells the credit bureau whether you were on time or late. Those eight late payments  will make your score lower. (Not every landlord reports to the credit bureaus, btw.)</p>
<p>So one of those credit bureaus will use all that stuff that got sent to them by banks, landlords, etc, and use the above breakdown to spit out your score.</p>
<p>Two really important takeaways here.</p>
<p>One is to <strong>live within your means</strong>. Cannot be stressed enough. Just because you <em>can</em> buy a 2016 Camarro does not mean you <em>should.</em> Yes, you might be able to get the loan from the bank, but can you pay that loan back? </p>
<p>You might not have $1000 laying around, but if you really, really want to go ahead and buy that stupid really big TV, a credit card will do the trick. That doesn't make it a good idea. Remember, credit is <em>borrowed</em> money. Not <em>fake</em> money. Whatever you borrow, you have to pay back, with <em>interest</em>.</p>
<p>And the other takeaway is that <strong>the worse your credit score is, the more expensive life is.</strong> See, you can have a bad credit score and still get that auto loan. The difference is, if your score is bad, you might have an interest rate something like 18%. That's really, really, high. Like, stupid high. If you have an interest rate that high, you will end up paying many thousands of dollars more than the actual price of the car. Or, you'll have to pay the bank back <em>more</em> then you put on your credit card. See how a low credit score costs you money?</p>
<p>Let's say you're applying for a job, and the employer looks at your credit (this is really common with government jobs). Remember waaaay up top where we called your credit score a <strong>responsibility score</strong>? If your score is low, that employer will think you're irresponsible, and they won't give you a job. So again, your low score cost you money. A lot of landlords will even look at your credit. Having a low credit score can actually make it harder for you to find a place to live.</p>
<p>Your credit score is really, really, important. Having a higher one makes life much easier, financially. Don't just spend money and hope for the best. Use that breakdown above and maximize your credit score. Live within your means, be smart, and think about what you're buying. Thirty year old you will thank you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the past, when getting a loan (mortgage, car loan, credit card, etc.) the lending institution would have to review your credit report, and make judgement about whether to extend the loan or credit to you. But there were inconsistancies, and it took a long time. The 3 credit bureaus (who collect the data and provide it to lending institutions) developed algorithms that crunch all your data and spit out a score ranging from 300-850. This makes it easy most of the time, as the lending institution can set broad guidelines that make a decision almost instantly for 95% of people.</p>
<p>The score is compiled from pieces of data such as your credit utilization rate (amount of credit relative to amount of credit you have, ie. $1000 balance on a $5000 limit credit card is 20% utilization); number of accounts; history of on-time payments; whether there are negative marks on any accounts; length of credit history; how many other recent credit pulls.</p>
<p>So the way it's used is you go to buy a car and they request your credit score... let's say it's 770. They may not approve a loan to credit scores below 600, charge 6% on loans with scores between 600-720, 4% on scores 721-800, and 2% on scores over 800. So you'd qualify for a loan at 4%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5 is that a credit score is an estimate of how likely you are to default on credit based on how often other people who have a credit history like you have done so. Note that there are different credit scores for credit cards, home loans, auto loans and just about anything else. </p>
<p>FICO works with the credit reporting companies to save everyone's credit report each month and they can basically look at people who had a credit report similar to yours in the past and see how many of them will miss a payment or default on their loan in the future. </p>
<p>Banks decide that they only want to loan money to people who have a low probability of defaulting or that if you have a higher chance of defaulting they will charge more interest on the loan. </p>
<p>The credit score is like predicting the weather. If the weather report says 80% chance of rain tomorrow It doesn't mean it will rain, just that in the past when the weather was like it is today that 80% of the time it rained the next day. </p>
<p>The credit score is not a judgement about you; however people use it to judge you; so if you're going to be judged by it then it's important to look as good as you can. How to do that is another topic. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: it's an estimate of how often people with credit histories like yours are likely to default in the future. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work for one of the major credit bureaus and I can say most everyone here has laid it out pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>But explaining like you are 5:</strong></p>
<p>It is a number that lets companies, not just banks (car dealerships, department stores, banks.. etc.) know how likely or able you are to pay off a loan should you get one to purchase items. This is called Debt to Income Ratio.  They take into consideration how much money you make versus how much money you are paying out. If you earn a certain amount yearly, can you pay all your rent/house mortgage and bills and still afford that new car too? Also how well are you at paying off your loans or credit cards. The better you are at it, the higher your score and the more people are willing to lend to you.</p>
<p>It was originally invented as a way for banks/lenders to let other banks/lenders know that you already had a loan or account with them and if you were paying them like you were supposed to.  This also was supposed to prevent you from taking a loan out one bank and not paying it back and going to another bank and taking out a loan with them and not paying that one either.  This allows the second bank/lender know you were not paying your bills so they would not lend to you.  Much the way it is today.  </p>
<p>Later the Credit Score was added.  Basically, this was a way for a lender to quickly look at your credit history and see if you were someone they wanted to lend to.   By having a quick visual of a number, they didn't have to sift through the information and actually read or decide on their own if you were a good risk.</p>
<p>While everyone is right about how the score is figured, it is a bit more complicated than that.  The reason being is there is more than one credit bureau company.  Each one weighs or factors your score a bit differently.  That is why if you pull your score from each company, it is not the same. Some factor how well you pay your bills with more &quot;weight&quot; than how much much total credit you used in comparison to how much total you have to use. Some will drop your score more if you miss a payment to a lender, more than another one will.</p>
<p>Honestly, there really are too many variables to explain each one unless you seriously have a bad score and history and are trying to figure all this out and how to get your credit score up. So I will just leave it at there are several factors that the credit bureaus look at (Did you pay your bills on time, how much your total line of credit is versus how much you actually used, how long have you had credit... etc) to determine your score and if you are a good risk to take if you apply for a loan or line of credit.</p>
<p>I will also quickly mention that the lenders, when they pull your credit score and credit history, can also exclude factors on your credit score/history to alter the credit score number.  For example, when my daughter purchased her house a few years back, the lender that gave her the loan to purchase her house, removed any information about medical bills that were not paid, which increased her credit score and ultimately gave her a lower interest rate and the amount of money that they were willing to lend her.  This is not uncommon when it comes to medical bills on your credit record, unfortunately, I do not know the reason why.</p>
<p>TLDR, It is a number that tells lenders what kind of a risk they will take if they were to extend you credit for a credit card, mortgage loan, car loan... etc.  The higher the number, the better &quot;risk&quot; you are or the better chance you have to get that line of credit or loan.</p>
<p>I have personally helped many people look at their credit history and score, learn to understand it and also showed them how to increase the score or what steps they should take to &quot;clean up&quot; their credit history and how to actually get this done.  I do not get paid to do this, I do it because after working with a credit bureau for a while, they really can do a number on people who do not understand this information.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to PM me and I will be happy to answer any questions you have. Just please keep in mind I only check Reddit every few days or so, so I might not respond the same day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
