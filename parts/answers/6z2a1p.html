		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert but the most obvious way for it to display these are just information it gets from background applications and or location. Say you're somewhere called 'university' or 'library', if you're within a radius of those buildings your avatar will say studying. As for the listening to music part: it's very easy for Snapchat to tell if you're running a music-streaming app. If you start the app <em>or</em> play music, Snapchat can change your avatar in the background simultaniously. Travel with a speed higher than 10-15km/h and it can assume you're driving a car or using public transportation etc. etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
