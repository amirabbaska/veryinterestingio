		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>migraines are often lateralized (on one side or the other), and this lateralization is correlated with physiological and prodrome/aura lateralization. for example, visual migraine aura are typically on one side or the other of the visual field; since each side of the field is processed on the opposite side of the brain, the aura side will predict the headache side, so if the aura is on the right side, the pain will be focused on the left.</p>
<p>The basic hypothesis here is that the aura (which is a temporary disastrous malfunction in cortex) creates byproducts that drift down from the cortex (where there are no pain receptors) into subcortical structures where they directly irritate the trigeminal nerve (which innervates the face, superficially and deep) etc, producing localized pain in the face and head. Since most of the brain is lateralized into left and right structures, the offending stuff is more-or-less confined to the side where it originated - the aura was on the right side, so the bad stuff is happening in the left side of the brain, and the left trigeminal nerve (which doesn't cross over like the cortical maps do) is annoyed.</p>
<p>here are two publicly available papers that touch on some of these issues (others I know are paywalled):</p>

<p><em>edited for wordage</em></p>
<p><em>edit</em></p>
<p>I would like to recommend the following papers for those interested in migraine aura (I am a vision guy, not a migraine guy, btw):</p>
<p>[Karl Lashley, more famous for his theory of memory, recorded and modeled his own aura for a great paper published in 1941] (<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/archneurpsyc/article-abstract/648953" target="_blank">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/archneurpsyc/article-abstract/648953</a>)
(sorry i cannot find a non-paywalled version)</p>
<p>[Peter Milner, husband of the even more famous psychologist Brenda Milner, figured out that Lashley's description of aura was a great fit with the then-rather-obscure phenomenon of &quot;cortical spreading depression&quot;] (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0013469458900737" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0013469458900737</a>) - he realized that CSD across the visual cortex would produce a symptom exactly like that described by Lashley ... paywall again :(</p>
<p>[And here is one of my all-time favorite papers] (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9593/af950f3e72ccd692ec40bb11a172356b2fee.pdf" target="_blank">https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9593/af950f3e72ccd692ec40bb11a172356b2fee.pdf</a>) by the neuroscientist Otto Grusser. This one is free!</p>
<p><em>edit 2</em></p>
<p>to reiterate my above parenthetical and my mod tag: i am a vision scientist not a migraine scientist, my knowledge of headache is entirely a side effect of my study of migraine aura, so i cannot really answer your headache questions with any particular expertise!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll jump in from a physical therapist perspective.</p>
<p>There are two types of &quot;mechanical&quot; headaches we see and treat: tension-type and cervicogenic. By mechanical I just mean to differentiate from something neurological like a stroke or a migraine (which may have more mechanical factors involved than we used to think, but I digress..).</p>
<p>Tension-type refer to any muscle in the neck or jaw &quot;referring&quot; pain into the head. One theory is the &quot;trigger point&quot; theory, which says an &quot;active&quot; trigger point (one that is actively causing you pain) can send said pain elsewhere. The most common headache muscles are:
Upper fibers of trapezius - generally refer to temporal aspect
Sternocleidomastoid (SCM) - similar pattern to trapezius
Suboccipitals (4 muscles on both right and left) - occipital headache and/or &quot;behind the eye&quot;
See: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16863699" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16863699</a> as one study discussing trigger points and headaches.</p>
<p>Cervicogenic headaches (see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201065/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3201065/</a>) are caused by a few different mechanisms. One is the proximity of the trigeminal nerve to the nerves of the upper neck - perhaps as neck pain occurs in this area it &quot;overflows&quot; to the trigeminal nerve and into the head. The other is similar to trigger points in that our spine facet joints can refer into the head.</p>
<p>In answering the original question, the area of the headache can give some insight to the origin of the headache, but oftentimes patients have a combination of the two types and blending occurs.</p>
<p>Headaches can also occur from post concussion syndromes and vestibular issues, neither of which garner much information at all from location of headache - unless again you're dealing with a multifactorial issue like a concussion that had all types involved in some way or another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor of physical therapy student here, short answer is yes it can but it depends on the type of headache. Muscles and trigger points very frequently refer pain to other nearby areas. Other types of headaches can stem from a host of other issues that can not be determined without further medical evaluation. In regards to muscular headaches, muscles of the upper cervical region and neck very commonly can present as a headache. During my clinical rotations the most frequent area of referral headaches were from the suboccipital muscles. These little muscles sit at the base of your skull and help to extend your occiput (tilting your head to look up). A great self release of these is to take a tennis ball or lacrosse ball and use it like a foam roller. When you find an area that is tight gently stay over that point until some relief is felt. Attached are some links that I think are great resources if you feel like you are having headaches from muscle referrals.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both the short and long answers to the question are &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>The location of the headache (e.g. one vs. both sides of the head, front/side/back/temples/neck/and so on) represents an important question in establishing the semiology of the headache, but location alone does not entirely determine the headache type. That said, knowing only the location of the headache will not likely guide any meaningful diagnostic or therapeutic interventions. It is very difficult to generalize about a headache simply based on its location.</p>
<p>A headache’s semiology (i.e. the constellation of features that characterize the patient’s headache) involves much more than simply the location of the pain. Most primary headache syndromes have a variety of criteria associated with them to establish the diagnosis (for example, a migraine needs to last for a certain amount of time, involve a certain number and type of symptoms, occur in certain locations, and so on). That said, I suspect the most productive way to address this question to people who aren’t neurologists is to highlight all the questions that your doctor would want to know when you seek out his/her input for evaluation of a headache. While probably not exhaustive, all of this information helps a physician determine the most likely headache type (as in most parts of medicine, things are not as clear-cut as we would like or are led to believe and we need to use a variety of avenues to reach a final impression), which in turn guides choices for any medical testing and choices for treatment. </p>
<p>The tl;dr of the novel to follow below is that a lot goes into defining a headache and subspecialists exist to parse out the details below to make sure people get the right treatment for the right headache and that people don’t waste money needlessly on testing that is unlikely to change any management for the patient. Some headaches are concerning, and some are not, and it is hard to know without eliciting particular pieces of information.</p>
<p>Providing this information to a physician helps them know what a patient has and guides subsequent decisions. Important things to consider when evaluating a headache include:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Location and areas the pain radiates: You should differentiate whether the pain occurs on one side of the head or both sides. Some headaches, when they occur, tend to be unilateral (one side of the head) or bilateral (both sides). This does not necessarily mean, though, a unilateral headache occurs always on the left or the right, but rather, that the headache respect one side when it occurs. Also, knowing where the pain seems to originate or go (e.g. by the temples, at the back of the head, behind the eyes, around the jaw) helps provide information about what may be causing the headache. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quality: The pain associated with a headache has many different features. Some describe the pain as stabbing, throbbing, band-like, pulsating, burning, electrical, and so on. Certain headache syndromes (e.g. migraine vs. trigeminal neuralgia vs. tension headache and so on) have a particular type of pain associated with them. Also, while it is a relatively subjective thing, understanding the degree of the pain is important to establish. A headache that is new and severe (10/10 with 10 being the worst pain) is sometimes more concerning than a headache that is generally less severe (3/10 pain).  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Onset: A headache that has been going on for 15 years and has not changed in quality may mean something different than a new headache (different from any other headaches) that just started a month or so ago. Understanding the circumstances of when the headache started (e.g. it has been ongoing since I hit my head and lost consciousness or it began sometime during my pregnancy or it began around the same time I started having blurry vision) is helpful to guide testing decisions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Onset &gt; 40 years of age? Never having a headache and then suddenly having a headache later in life sometimes represents a red flag that merits further testing. This is not always the case, and the decision to pursue additional tests varies relative to the other questions you ask. However, if someone develops a new headache after the age of 40, it is important to pay attention to other questions about the headache.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Number per week: The frequency of a patient’s headache helps guide decisions for medications and tests. Someone with daily headaches might require a medication they take daily to prevent the headaches in addition to a medication meant to stop a bad headache when it occurs. For instance, if someone has migraine headaches four or more times a month, that may warrant consideration of a prophylactic/preventative medication for the headache. Knowing this information also helps gauge whether any interventions help in the future. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duration: How long the headache lasts is an important feature in determining what headache it might be. For instance, migraine headaches tend to last on the order of hours to days. Other headaches may last on the order of seconds. Some headaches may not seem to last for particular periods of time. The duration of the headache is often a significant factor in the formal criteria for headache disorders. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effect of activity: Certain headaches significantly worsen when attempting to do anything other than hide under the covers. Other headaches may improve when doing activities. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New headache? The emergence of a new headache may represent a red flag. Establishing whether a headache is significantly different from any other headaches is important to guide decisions to further testing.</p>
</li>
<li>Wakes at night? Similarly, a headache that is significantly enough to wake someone up at night may also represent a red flag to merit further testing. Again, not always the case, and again, varies relative to the overall context. </li>
</ol>
<p>Associated features</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Photophobia/phonophobia/nausea/vomiting? Photophobia (light sensitivity), phonophobia (sound sensitivity), nausea, and vomiting are features seen in migraines and other headache syndromes. It is important diagnostically to establish which are present. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jaw pain when eating? This is a feature associated with a couple specific headache syndromes, which (if there are other specific associated features) merits particular additional testing. </p>
</li>
<li>Allodynia: Pain with non-painful stimulation (like pulling back your hair) is associated with certain headache syndrome. Knowing this helps point someone in the right direction when trying to support a particular diagnosis.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.Neck stiffness/pain: Asking specifically about neck stiffness and neck pain in association with the headache (or in association with the time the headaches seem to have become problematic) may be helpful in determining the cause of the headache. Some headaches arise from problems in spine and muscles around the neck. </p>
<p>Neurologic symptoms: Pain itself, technically I guess, is a neurologic symptom. However, establishing the presence of specific neurologic symptoms that occur with the headache (either before, during, or after) can be helpful to a provider evaluating the headache. Typically, if these types of things occur with the headache, a neurologist or dedicated headache specialist should evaluate the patient further. Again, the significance of having any of these things is generally unclear.</p>
<ol>
<li>Dysarthria? Difficulty articulating words properly. “Is your speech slurred” more or less.</li>
<li>Aphasia? Difficulty with language – not being able to get words out, not understanding other people, speaking gibberish when words do come out. </li>
<li>Diplopia? Double vision. </li>
<li>Hemiparesis/hemiplegia? Not being able to move a part of the body at some point during the headache.</li>
<li>Perioral numbness? Numbness around the mouth. </li>
<li>Hemisensory changes? Changes in sensation to parts of the body.</li>
<li>Vertigo? “Dizziness” with the sense of things moving when they are not actually moving.</li>
</ol>
<p>Autonomic related symptoms: These symptoms again point to very specific headache types. Some fail to ask these question and mis-characterize a headache as a result. A headache specialist may want to know about these symptoms if they occur on the side in which one experiences the pain.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ptosis or miosis: Ptosis is a droopy eye. Miosis is a small pupil (can be hard to notice as a patient).</li>
<li>Lacrimation: Crying from the eye on the side in which the headache occurs. </li>
<li>Conjunctival injection: Redness of the eye on the side in which the headache occurs.</li>
<li>Rhinorrhea: Runny nose.</li>
<li>Congestion: Nothing else to say.</li>
<li>Foreign body sensation: Sense of something in the eye that does not belong.</li>
<li>Facial sweating: Or absence thereof.</li>
<li>Pallor: Does the side in which the headache occurs seem to turn white?</li>
</ol>
<p>Exacerbating factors</p>
<ol>
<li>Movement: Changes in the headache with movements can sometimes be a red flag that merits further testing. </li>
<li>Positional changes: Does the headache get worse when going from lying to sitting/standing? Does it worsen when going from sitting/standing to lying? Does it improve in any of those contexts? This might imply that subtle changes in the bloodflow to the brain may have an effect on the headache and may merit specific testing.</li>
<li>Bending over: Another way to ask specifically about positional changes.</li>
<li>Coughing: Increasing pressure in the body can sometimes worsen a headache. This gets at that point.</li>
<li>Straining: Similar question. </li>
</ol>
<p>Alleviating factors: A variety of things may help a headache. These represent things a doctor may recommend to a patient. If a patient relates any of these as potentially helping, that can guide what headache may be present.</p>
<ol>
<li>Rest/sleep: </li>
<li>Darkness: </li>
<li>Quiet: </li>
<li>Activity: </li>
<li>Heat: </li>
<li>Cold: </li>
