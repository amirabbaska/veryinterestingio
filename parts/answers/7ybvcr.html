		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, we have to understand how vaccines work, in general. The basic premise is, we take a virus/bacteria and break it down into large chunks. These chunks are the outer shell/wall of the virus/bacteria, and as with most other cells, there are proteins that are embedded into them for communication, transport, etc.</p>
<p>Second, we have to understand how the immune system works. There are two phases, the innate phase and the adaptive phase. The innate phase is the first line of defense. Your body recognizes something is foreign and tries to get rid of it. It knows this due to the proteins in the wall chunks, as they don't have &quot;self&quot; displays within them. Once they're cleared, your immune system will begin developing other proteins (antibodies) for the adaptive response in case of a repeat infection. If you get infected with the same proteins, your immune response is much quicker as the antibodies alert better killing immune cells to Ninja in and eradicate the problem.</p>
<p>The issue with the flu is that it mutates a lot. Changes to the DNA and RNA subsequently change the comms proteins on the viral/bacterial walls. It might change some greatly, some not at all, but the reality is, there are some antibodies hanging out that can still tag some portions of the cell for removal. They can't tag them efficiently, or in great numbers, but it reduces the viral load down to something more manageable by the innate system than if nothing at all. Your fever spikes, you feel like crap for a day or two, but by them time you've truly noticed it, your innate system has already turned the tide and is just killing off stragglers, all the while making more antibodies for the new proteins. The new antibodies begin circulating while you have the adaptive system out in great numbers already, so they begin to work quickly as well, further reducing your infective time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You should understand what a &quot;flu variant&quot; means. The hemagglutinin (HA) protein is 567 amino acids long. A typical &quot;variant&quot; has changed 2, 3, maybe 4 of those amino acids. That's enough to disrupt binding of some important antibodies, but there are still lots of antibodies that do bind, or that still bind but more weakly than to the original. So even though there's no longer a strong enough antibody response to give good protection, there may be enough to provide <em>some</em> protection, or delayed protection.</p>
<p>Second, even though killed vaccines aren't great at stimulating T cells, they do induce some, and T cells have a much broader reactivity than antibodies; the changes in flu strains have little or not effect on T cell recognition. T cells don't have much preventive effect on flu, but they do have a protective effect: That is, T cells won't do much to stop you from getting flu, but they will make the flu milder. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your immune system recognises something as foreign (and potentially harmful) mostly by the proteins on the surface of the pathogen - we call these markers 'antigen'. </p>
<p>The white blood cells that are especially good at recognising these antigen are T cells, and B cells. Each cell can recognise a single antigen - in theory. In reality, the T and B cell receptors have a bit of flexibility, and can recognise several different protein shapes that look <em>almost</em> the same, but not quite. This is called <em>cross-reactivity</em>, and is the reason why you can be vaccinated against one flu strain and still respond to another. This reaction probably won't be as strong, but it does give you somewhat of a response - enough to kick your flu a little faster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if the flu strains in the vaccine don't match well with the most prevalent strains of the season being vaccinated can still help you recover from flu more easily. In fact, part of why &quot;swine flu&quot; was hitting younger people harder than middle aged people was because a very similar stain had been around years before. People who had been exposed to that strain in the past had better immunity. A flu shot introduces several versions of influenza to your body so it had better immunity if you end up getting exposed again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if this was mentioned already but, when exposed to an antigen, antibodies will proliferate at a high rate. Thus, small mutations often occur. As a result, you may produced antibodies that are also capable of recognizing slightly different antigens than the one present upon initial exposure. For instance, if you are exposed to an antigen 'A', your immune system will produce 'anti-A' antibodies as intended, but may also produce 'anti-A1' antibodies due to a point mutation. Because of this, your immune system will be able to recognize both antigens A and A1 in future exposures. This process is called somatic hypermutation, and is one of a few ways that your immune system is able to diversify your antibodies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
