		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first off, and this is extremely important to understand, you haven't already paid for your own social security. You've paid for your grandparents' social security. The whole system kinda works on the honor system where you pay in and in exchange the next generation will pay for you. </p>
<p>Now the problem comes in that there's less children in the next generation and the current generations are living longer and longer than ever. So, we can either seriously jack up the tax on younger generations to try to break even or we can cut benefits/eligibility/etc. on the older generations.</p>
<p>Edit: With regards to the rest of your question it is important to realize that the government isn't some person that you can take money from. It's not like you get your SS check from Paul Ryan or Nancy Pelosi's bank account. Rather you are getting your check from then next generation of American workers, who didn't vote for social security in the first place. If you want to argue from a position of justice, why should these individuals be required to pay for your social security?</p>
<p>Edit 2: Also, it helps to recognize that the social security trust fund is not some massive reservoir of reserve funds. It's around <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_Trust_Fund" target="_blank"> 2.7 trillion</a> which sounds like a lot but is only about <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/news/press/factsheets/basicfact-alt.pdf" target="_blank">3 years of the nation's social security expenditures.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wish to make one additional point from the many already given. </p>
<p>To best understand how SS works, think about how the first generation of recipients received the benefit. Those who met eligibility requirements were able to receive the benefit the first day of the program, even though they never had a single penny deducted for the program their entire career. </p>
<p>The money for that first group of benefit checks came from deductions taken the same month from those who were employed that month. That new deduction was tough on the employed, as it was like an immediate pay cut but it was generally understood that they would eventually see the benefit when they retire. </p>
<p>And it works the same today. Each generation accepts a lower take-home pay by funding the program for today's retirees with the expectation that the following generation will do the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I will speak only to Social Security:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Social Security contributions by you go to pay the benefits of retirees today.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There used to be a lot more people paying into social security than were receiving benefits.  (It has dropped from a 13:1 ratio down to a 3:1 ratio.)  The reason is that people are living longer than they ever have now, and more individuals qualify for benefits from a program that used to strictly be for individuals 65 and older only.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Social Security's structure (in its current form) will fail eventually.  I want you to visualize the structure of Social Security.  Lots of people on the bottom paying a certain amount of money into the system that pay for the benefits of a few people above them.  Now add another layer at the bottom with more people paying for the individuals that were on the bottom, but are now in the middle.  What does that shape look like to you?  You're right, it looks like a pyramid and Social Security is the biggest pyramid scheme ever devised in the history of the world.  Every time they increase taxes, or reduce benefits, all they are doing to extending the perceived viability of a system that WILL collapse someday and leave a whole generation of Americans holding the bag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To those individuals that believe having the trust fund invested into treasury bonds is a good idea:  You are crazy, or deluded, or both.  The US government takes the funds &quot;invested&quot; into treasury bonds and uses them for day-to-day general expenditures for the government to continue to function.  Even with those funds the US government runs a huge deficit.  It is just now getting to the point where Social Security will need to call in those markers on the treasury bonds, and then the US government will not only have those funds to borrow anymore, but they will also have to pay back the funds that it's borrowed to this point.  A full economic collapse would not be out of the realm of impossibility at that point IMO.  Let's use an example.  You have $1 million in a retirement account.  However, you live beyond your means on a day-to-day basis.  You decide it might be a good idea to loan yourself the money from your retirement account to make ends meet, because frankly living within a sensible budget sucks.  When it becomes time to retire, you now need that money that was in your retirement account, but you've already loaned all of the money out of the account to yourself.  Does that sound like sound financial planning to you?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Yeah, but didn't we run a surplus back when Clinton was in office?  Um, no we didn't.  The US government actually ran a deficit.  However, it got enough money from the Social Security Trust fund so that $60 million of deficit looked like a $30 million surplus.  I can't find it now, but I researched the shit out of this in college.  The President of the United States issues a letter each year on the national debt.  In Bill Clinton's letter during one of the years where he claimed that the government ran a surplus was this little gem of a quote, &quot;The national debt does not include money the government owes itself.&quot;  And make no mistake that the federal government owes money to Social Security than it does to any other creditor.</p>
</li>
<li>It's beyond a political issue now, but the only way to fix Social Security permanently is to have a percentage of your paycheck (let's say 10%) go into an account that is earmarked for you only and invested into actual stocks/bonds/mutual funds/etc...  If you don't pay into the system, then you don't get anything out.  If everyone had 10% of their paychecks set aside for their 40 or 50 years of employment and invested in good investments then everyone would have plenty of money to retire with. As it is, someone is going to get screwed, and the younger you are the more likely it is that it's going to be you.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did not see anyone touch this part, but some have made some very good points.</p>
<p>As others have said, you are not paying for you, you are paying for those on retirement and your kids will pay for you. </p>
<p>Ida May Fuller, I think, was the first to collect social security. She paid in something like 30 cents and collected a check for 30+ years. This should show the hazard of the program. It only works as long as the population ratio of payees to retiree's stays positive. </p>
<p>There are two major factors you need to consider:</p>
<p>Payee to collectee ratio, and life span </p>
<p>When social security was started the payee to retiree ratio in 1940 was 159:1. So 159 people were paying payroll taxes for every person collecting a check. </p>
<p>That ratio started dropping immediately, and never got better. 1960 it was 5:1 and in 2013 it was below 3:1 (2.8 I think). </p>
<p>So in 1940 you had 150 people paying for the care of one person, by 2013 you had three people paying to care for one person. </p>
<p>Why? Well life expectancy for one. In 1940 the average age before death was UNDER 65. Today it is closer to 80. Simply put, most people never collected from social security in 1941 since they died. Now you are expected to live 15 years collecting payments!</p>
<p>That kind of system is unsustainable. We either need to have more payers, or extend the benefit date to 80 for the system to work the way it was written. </p>
