		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can, it's just highly, highly impractical. Creating diamond is relatively straightforward, we just have to convert carbon from one form to another. For that all you have to do is to <a href="http://i.imgur.com/jHQlF1c.jpg" target="_blank">take cheap graphite, heat it up under high pressures</a>, and voil√†, you get <a href="http://i.imgur.com/XV8GIUz.jpg" target="_blank">diamond.</a></p>
<p>Creating gold on the other hand is a different beast altogether since now we have to convert one element into another. Now techniques do exist that allow us to achieve such a transformation using nuclear reactors or particle accelerators, but they are neither easy nor cheap. Probably the most &quot;practical&quot; method reported to date was the work of Seaborg and coworkers (<a href="http://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.23.1044" target="_blank">paper</a>). Their approach was to take sheets of bismuth, bombard them with high energy ions, and see what came out. Among the mess that resulted, they were able to detect trace amounts of various unstable gold isotopes from the radioactivity they gave off. The researchers also suspected that some of the stable gold isotope (Au-197) was also there, but they couldn't measure it directly. </p>
<p>Even though Seaborg was successful in creating gold, he didn't exactly stumble on a practical industrial process. When asked about the practicality of his work, Seaborg said that given the cost of the experiment, creating a gram of gold would have cost on the order of a quadrillion dollars (in 1980 dollars too!). Needless to say, it still makes far more sense for us just to use the gold that supernovas produced for us than to try to repeat the process ourselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IN the 90's I spent a few years routinely making tiny amounts of gold from mercury using neutron activation.  One isotope of mercury (Hg-196, 0.15% abundance) can absorb a neutron to become the radioisotope Hg-197 which decays through electron capture into the stable gold isotope Au-197.  The Hg-197 decays with a half-life of 2.67 days and gives off a 77.3 keV gamma ray.  By counting the number of gamma rays I could determine the amount of mercury in the original sample.  Over the full course of the work I made less than 0.1 femtogram (1E-16 gram) of gold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically we can. It's just incredibly difficult, and not even remotely cost-effective. </p>
<p>It would also technically not be considered 'chemistry,' so much as 'nuclear physics,' as it would require the very careful use of nuclear fission reactors. 'Chemistry' pertains to the interactions of elements, so it's sphere of influence is everything from atoms on up. What you're talking about is changing the composition of atoms themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The big difference between diamonds and gold is that gold is a (somewhat rare) basic element. Diamonds are a specific form of a (very, very common) element: carbon.</p>
<p>When you make diamonds, you start with carbon, and arrange it. </p>
<p>If you were to make gold, you'd have to start with some other basic element and somehow change it gold.</p>
<p>Let's use a Lego analogy:</p>
<p>Making diamonds is like taking some Lego bricks we already have and building something. </p>
<p>Making gold is like taking some Lego bricks and turning them into a completely new type of brick that we didn't have before. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone so far has answered the question as you intended it, so I'll be the one to be annoyingly literal. Yes, you can use chemistry (no particle accelerators required) to make metallic gold! Of course, you have to start with a chemical compound that already has gold atoms in it. For example:</p>
