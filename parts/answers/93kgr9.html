		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So these guys are a mixture of New York Air and Army National Guardsmen who make up <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Task_Force_Empire_Shield" target="_blank">Joint Task Force Empire Shield.</a> They help guard major landmarks and transit areas around the city. </p>
<p>They can’t arrest you, but they can respond to certain things - say a shooting or other mass casualty incident - and they can hold you until an NYPD officer arrives. The idea is that they can help provide a visible deterrent while freeing up NYPD officers for patrols. </p>
<p>Edit: One thing I wanted to add - if you're new to the city, don't be afraid to chat with them. They're mostly super friendly and are used to helping out the occasional lost tourist or posing with folks for photos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is probably units from the National Guard that are on orders from the state governor. They have funding to augment local and state police in certain areas. They more often than not operate under the authority of a civilian police officer assigned to them. </p>
<p>I'm a former Army Guardsmen and some people in my unit were tasked with drug interdiction in Texas. They had ID cards that were issued by the governors office and additional civilian law enforcement training. They routinely patrolled with state police (DPS) and the Texas Rangers. </p>
<p>Note: this was about 8 years ago, so if some of my knowledge is off, my apologies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing to add about the U.S. Armed Forces: you may have heard of the five branches (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, Coast Guard) but there’s also a large group called the National Guard who are not on full time service. They hold civilian jobs and serve part time. The general idea is that we have a sizable reserve force of trained soldiers, sailors and airmen who can be called into active service in an emergency and deployed oversees quickly. </p>
<p>As far as how it’s decided, the civilian volunteers for either type of duty, but the rules of deployment are more complex and there’s a unique relationship between the states and the department of defense in that case. Other responses are way better at explaining that. </p>
<p>EDIT: For transparency, I have no experience or close connections in the military, but I'm coming from a civilian's understanding about the U.S. Military. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I don't personally have experience in the military, I have a few family members who have served and a younger cousin active in the Marines. My understanding is that you don't get to pick where you get deployed, so these kind of assigents are very difficult to get. </p>
<p>While someone would be pretty lucky to get this kind of assignment, it's not decided by chance. Like any job, candidates are selected if they are highly qualified for the specific duties of the position. </p>
<p>Something else I want to add - in many high-traffic areas like NYC there are plainclothes officers mixed into the crowd. So while they may not be visible, security is definitely around!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
