		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>65 million years later, it's hard to say.</p>
<p>Everything we know about the T-Rex comes from just a handful of quality fossil finds.  With nothing but a pile of fossilized bones, there's only so much you can infer about the animal's actual behavior and appearance.</p>
<p>Maybe they were totally vestigial.  Maybe they had fabulous feathered maying displays on them.  Maybe they all played tiny ukuleles.</p>
<p>The purpose and utility of the T-Rex arms is still a bit of a mystery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paleontologist Robert Bakker theorized that the tiny arms were perfect for mating rituals. They could help hold the female in place. Keep in mind that these arms may seem tiny but each one as packed with enough muscle to curl a 200 pound barbell. They make have looked tiny but they must have had some sort of function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To flip that question -- how much muscle and size would a T-rex have to devote to the arms (and therefore away from other body parts in terms of energy expenditure) in order for them to be useful? They might have to be really big, at which point their energy expenditure is not worth it. </p>
<p>Another way to think about it -- we don't see reptiles like alligators using their front limbs to feed themselves or do much of anything besides locomote. If a reptile goes bipedal, you would naturally expect those limbs to get smaller/vestigial, not bigger. (Unless some strong evolutionary pressure favored growing the front limbs larger into something useful). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're small for it's size sure but they were well attached to <em>massive</em> chest muscles giving it a surprising amount of strength in them, they were <em>not</em> vestigial, though the exact use (mating, display, grappling) is an ongoing debate.</p>
<p>If you want to see totally useless arms look at something like a Carnotaurus, that's what useless theropod arms look like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>T-Rex evolved from a line of dinosaurs that, instead of using their forelimbs to walk or to hunt, they just developed larger and more powerful jaws. They also didn't need their limbs for balance because they had rigid tails. Large arms would actually have been a disadvantage because they would swing around when T-Rex ran. Most people thought that T-Rex held their arms in tight to their body to prevent this swinging around. </p>
