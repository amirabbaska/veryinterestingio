		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: yes. The longer a given wire gets, the greater electrical resistance it has. Resistance causes a voltage drop. If the wire is long enough, that voltage drop would be sufficient that the device would fail to work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since I havenâ€™t seen anyone mention yet: even if you could run it, a hair dryer would be a very ineffectual form of heating in a vacuum. Hair dryers rely on convection heating, and blowing warm air over their target, which of course is not possible on the Moon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I just add that at large distances resistance stops working in the usual believed fashion as it is only an approximation. It stops being a single element in series to the supply. It is now (approximated as) a series of repetitive elements connected end to end, each having a small resistance and also the capacitance and inductance you get due to lines being in parallel are no longer negligible.</p>
<p>The power supply now travels like a wave, surging through each element.</p>
<p>Due to these elements' properties there is sometimes also a reflection in this wave which sort of cancels the power supply by a factor.</p>
<p>At large distances we have a completely different rules. Studied under transmission lines and wave guides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of very interesting comments about resistance in the cable. But practically speaking, a cable to the moon would also induce an incredible amount of current just by swaying against earths strong magnetic field. Even if earths rotation is taken into effect. </p>
<p>That either leads to less or more current than intended and has to be taken into account. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignoring gravity, you would first need to establish what voltage you need at the moon.  In Australia, we have 230v, so I'll use that as our target voltage.
We also need to know the current needed to run the hair dryer.  Most are around 10amps at 230v, so lets work off that.</p>
<p>Voltage drop is the biggest issue here, so in order for you to get 230V to the moon, you would need an enormous cable.<br />
Using a Voltage drop calculator, it is telling me you would need a 30,000mm squared copper cable.  Even then, you would still loose 4.36v over a distance of 384,400km, which is the distance to the moon.  The 4.36v loss shouldn't be an issue, as a hairdryer will still work at that voltage.</p>
<p>In order to avoid Voltage drop, you would need a 10,000,000mm squared cable.</p>
<p>My science is probably very flawed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
