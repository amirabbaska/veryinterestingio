		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Platelets in blood causes it to be sticky when dried on your skin. They pile together to close off open wounds and give the bleeding area a temporary gelatinous shield from foreign contaminants. Your platelets also work underwater, thickening and sticking to your skin. A bar of soap does a similar thing, sticking to your skin and slowly rinses off with more water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since my last fluid mechanics course, but I looked it up and it appears blood is actually shear-thinning. This means that the more shearing (ie parallel to its surface) force applied to it, the &quot;liquider&quot; it becomes. This occurs because of the complex composition &amp; proteins in blood. When you wash, the rubbing motion makes it thinner and thus it is easier to have it slide off. When you don't touch it, it's thicker - imagine blood dripping down the side of something, it moves very slowly because it is more viscous. </p>
<p>To explain shear thinning probably better than I can see:  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_thinning" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_thinning</a></p>
