		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, this question is very philosophical in nature, but I'll add to that a bit, making it as simple as I can.</p>
<p>When it comes to the nature of mathematics, there are two <em>primary</em> views:</p>
<p>1.)  <strong>platonism</strong> - this is essentially the idea that mathematical objects are &quot;real&quot; - that they exist abstractly and independent of human existence.  Basically, a mathematical platonist would say that calculus was discovered.  The concept  of calculus exists inherent to our universe, and humans discovered them.</p>
<p>2.) <strong>nominalism</strong> - this would represent the other option in your question.  This view makes the claim that mathematical objects have no inherent reality to them, but that they were created (<em>invented</em>) by humankind to better understand our world.</p>
<p>To actually attempt to answer your question, philosophers are almost totally divided on this.  A recent survey of almost two-thousand philosophers shows this.  39.3% identify with platonism; 37.7% with nominalism; (23.0% other) (<a href="http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP" target="_blank">http://philpapers.org/archive/BOUWDP</a>)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a question of a pretty philosophical nature, so it's hard to say how well it can be answered. That said, mathematicians typically talk in terms of &quot;discovering&quot; a proof or method, thinking of the process as finding a principle hidden in the laws of math that they can now use to their advantage. As far as calculus goes, whether Newton deserves the credit he gets is frequently disputed, and it's generally thought that the calculus Newton was doing was more than a little sketchy in terms of mathematical rigor. The more formal definitions that set it on firm theoretical footing came much later.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a fundamental question in the philosophy of mathematics, to which there is no clear answer. You'll find many good arguments on either side, and encompassing all areas of mathematics.</p>
<p>EDIT: While it's not directly related to this idea, you might find the essay <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/MathDrama/reading/Wigner.html" target="_blank">&quot;The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences&quot;</a> by Eugene Wigner to be an interesting read.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In logic classes, you'll find people from linguistics, mathematics, as well as us philosophers.  These logic classes make for fun discussions because these 3 crowds have incredible overlap in the foundations of their schools, but incredible differences in jargon and teaching styles.  </p>
<p>In a few of my logic classes, this question regularly comes up and as I've tried to explain to students, &quot;it depends on context&quot; (as all things do).  </p>
<p>In order to start to answer your question, you will see that you'll start finding that some concepts were discovered (would exist even if humans did not) and some were invented.  As my friends from linguistics like to say, &quot;We made up the word 'apple' but apples exist independently of humans.&quot;  </p>
<p>So your ultimate question is: &quot;If there were no humans (or other humanoids), would calculus exist?&quot;  That question breaks down into two: </p>
<p>1) &quot;Would the principles of calculus still govern the universe?&quot; </p>
<p>And </p>
<p>2) &quot;Would anything <strong><em>do</em></strong> calculus.&quot;  </p>
<p>The answer to 1 appears to be an uncontroversial &quot;yes&quot; and the answer to 2 appears to be an uncontroversial &quot;no.&quot;  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been said - the question is philosophical in nature.</p>
<p>One interpretation of the philosophy of &quot;discovery&quot; vs. &quot;invention&quot; can be found in short in Socrates dialogue with Meno (titled &quot;Meno&quot;), in which Socrates questions Meno's slave about a simple geometry problem.</p>
<p>The slave solves the problem after being given instructions, despite having no formal study on the subject.  Socrates concludes (and philosophically &quot;proves&quot;) that the soul is immortal (this was the original point of the dialogue with Meno) and that every man already possesses all the knowledge that exists, he simply has to recollect it from his soul/past lives.</p>
<p>According to Socrates then, you might say that this sort of knowledge is (re)discovered, rather than invented.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
