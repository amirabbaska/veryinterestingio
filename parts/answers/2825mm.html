		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. He would not use his fat stores <em>first,</em> but he would use them <em>preferentially.</em></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK22414/#_A4359_" target="_blank">Here</a> is a source that discusses this. 30.3.1. is the section you want. Basically, the body attempts to minimize protein breakdown by producing high levels of ketone bodies from fat.</p>
<p>It's important to note that there's no way for a body to give signals that target fat specifically. It can increase the expression of enzymes that are involved in breaking down fat and producing ketone bodies, and decrease the expression of enzymes that are involved in carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, but that only causes one pathway to be preferred over the other. It doesn't shut down other pathways entirely. There is some amino acid and glucose breakdown that will occur even without enzymes to speed up the reaction.</p>
<p>Can you die of starvation while still having lots of body fat? Absolutely. Although the source I linked mentions that the triacylgylcerol (fat) stores of a subject are the primary determinant of survival time in starvation conditions, there are a number of immediate concerns in the starved patient.</p>
<p>Blood pressure can drop rapidly, dangerous electrolyte abnormalities can occur (esp. Hypomagnesemia and hypokalemia, which can cause a potentially fatal heart arrhythmia known as Torsades de pointes), and the acid-base balance of the blood can be disrupted (starvation ketoacidosis).</p>
<p>On a more long-term scale, vitamin deficiencies become a concern. Folate and B12 deficiencies can cause anemia and (B12) nerve damage. Thiamine deficiency can cause Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome (balance and eye movement problems + dementia due to brain damage). When beginning to consume food again, metabolic disturbances known as &quot;refeeding syndrome&quot; may also result in cardiac arrhythmias.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM196604282741705" target="_blank">Here</a> is an interesting case report from back when prolonged starvation was being investigated as a weight loss treatment. This patient developed WKS due to thiamine deficiency. Something interesting to note is that, during the starvation portion of this protocol, 25% of his weight loss (4.4kg/17.2kg) was estimated to be due to muscle tissue metabolism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have noted, fat energy is used preferentially, but other pathways are simultaneously active.</p>
<p>What hasn't been mentioned is that there's likely a &quot;cap&quot; on fat energy availability, to the tune of 31 kCal/day/lb-bodyfat, as per <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615615" target="_blank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15615615</a>.</p>
<p>What this means is that an individual with, say, 100 pounds of body fat can support up to 3100 kCal/d from fat energy metabolism--this is likely enough to support all or virtually all of that individual's TDEE, which is how very obese people with appropriate micronutrient and protein supplementation can be successful with near-starvation diets.</p>
<p>However, when you reduce that figure to something like 50 pounds of body fat, the &quot;maximum fat metabolism&quot; (which is often accounted for on good diet calculators) drops below TDEE--there's no longer enough fat to support <em>all</em> energy needs. If the balance isn't provided via food, the body will catabolize other energy sources, including lean mass, to serve that need. Losing lean mass is generally considered a very bad thing, which is why controlling the size of a caloric deficit while losing weight is increasingly important the leaner you get.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First a primer on metabolism.  For the most part, whether you're burning petroleum in your car or sugar or fat in your body, getting energy out of fuel always involves a process called &quot;oxidation,&quot; which basically means that reactive molecules (often oxygen, hence the name) bind to fuels so those fuels can release electrons that can be used for energy (that's a simplified version, feel free to get specific in the comments).  </p>
<p>Fat provides energy to the body by a process called &beta;-oxidation.  This means that the long chains of fatty acids are systematically &quot;oxidized&quot; (this occurs at a location on the molecule called the &beta; carbon, hence the name of the reaction).  In each permutation of the cycle, 2 carbon molecules are released from the fatty acid and form a molecule that the body uses to make energy, called acetyl-CoA.  </p>
<p>A good question is, &quot;why don't we ALWAYS use fat for energy?&quot;  We do not because for the most part, carbohydrates are preferred over fats when excess carbs are available.  This is for a few reasons.  One is because in fat cells, the globules of fat, called triglycerides, are always being made and broken down.  When glucose from carbohydrates like bread or soda is available, a chemical is released that helps build the triglycerides, so the rate of making new fat is greater than the rate of breaking down fat.  There are a few other causes, but the bottom line is that carbs help the body make new fat faster than it can metabolize it.  (footnote 1)</p>
<p>Some parts of your body have a nearly absolute need for glucose.  These include your red blood cells and your brain.  (for you bichem people out there, RBCs need glucose because they don't have mitochondria, while the brain needs glucose because neurons have very low levels of the the thiolase enzyme that cleaves the acetyl-CoA off of the rest of the fatty acid at the end of &beta;-oxidation, so they can't generate enough acetyl-CoA to drive the TCA cycle).  </p>
<p>In your example of the 500 lb man, his brain and blood would get glucose from &quot;gluconeogenesis,&quot; which is how the body makes glucose when supplies are low.  However, there are still some dangerous problems.  Using fat for energy makes the body chronically more acidic, which can have devastating consequences.  It can mess up your kidneys, and it can fatally throw your electrolyte balance off by disrupting the kidney's ability to maintain your potassium levels in your body, which are necessary for vital things like keeping your heart beating (footnote 2). </p>
<p>Starvation is really interesting, which is why some doctors wrote an article about David Blayne when he didn't eat for over a month.  As long as the 500 lb guy took potassium supplements (and probably B-12, and maybe some other essential vitamins and minerals), he would probably be OK.  He might be pretty weak though, as I think his body would break down muscles to get proteins.  A very minimal amount of protein is needed though, so a bit of soy protein would also be necessary.  I imagine he'd loose the weight, and quickly!</p>
<p>footnote 1: a followup question is, &quot;how do we EVER burn fat then?&quot;  the answer is that we use a lot of fat during exercise.  And everything is in balance, or &quot;equilibrium.&quot;  But A takeaway message is that reducing sugar intake is VERY important to loosing weight!  </p>
<p>footnote 2: This is physiologically interesting: acute acidosis causes a rise in potassium concentration because secreting all that extra acid causes the kidneys to reabsorb more potassium.  But chronically high acid levels have an osmotic effect that brings more water into the distal parts of the kidney, which dilutes the concentration of potassium in the fluid.  Because the concentration is low, the diffusion rate from an area of high concentration of potassium to an area of low concentration is greater, and more potassium is secreted.   </p>
