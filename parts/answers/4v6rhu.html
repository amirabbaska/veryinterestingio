		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the 80's there was a big debate about this called, appropriately, The Imagery Debate. There was even a (philosophy) book published with that name. I recommend checking out the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (SEP; a great resource in general) article on mental imagery, particularly the section on <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-imagery/#AnaProDeb" target="_blank">the analog propositional debate</a>.</p>
<p>Roughly, the two camps/ideas were this: </p>
<p><strong>Analog View (Kosslyn):</strong> mental images are imagistic or pictorial in nature and share many properties with an actual image / perception of the real world. This might include reactivation of cortical areas during mental imagery that are active during perception. It is like you are really seeing the thing (hence the term analog). </p>
<p><strong>Propositional View (Pylyshyn):</strong> although it may seem to us that we call up an image and examine it with our mind's eye (whatever that may mean!) this is actually misleading and does not reflect the true nature of the representation and is also in danger of committing the Cartesian fallacy (who/what is looking at / analyzing this internal picture?). Instead, mental images are actually (symbolic and amodal) descriptions in a Language of Thought -like way. So, for example, when you imagine your room, you are not creating a picture in your head, but a series of relations between concepts like &quot;to the left of (door, couch)&quot; which means that the operator &quot;to the left of&quot; takes in two objects or arguments (door and couch) and describes the relation between them.</p>
<p>It would take too long to list all of the arguments for the two views, so here are a select few:</p>
<p><strong>Evidence in favor of picture-like representations:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>mental rotation: if you are comparing two 3D objects and trying to decide whether they are the same (just rotated versions) or not, the amount of time to answer is linearly related to the angle of rotation (<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1974-08328-006" target="_blank">Cooper and Shepard 1973</a>. It is as if we are rotating a mental model just like we would a physical object to try to get them to match</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we represent empty space and preserve metric information: imagine a map of the US. Focus your attention on NY. Now move your attention to Maine. Go back to NY. Now shift your attention to California. Did it take you longer? Many people say yes. (The actual studies used fake maps that subjects had to memorize and different measures). This suggests that our mental images preserve metric properties: things that are far in the world are far in mental images, that just like for a picture, it takes time to scan our mental images, and that we represent the empty space between parts of our mental image/ focus of attention just like in a picture (<a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xhp/4/1/47/" target="_blank">Kosslyn, Ball, and Reiser 1978</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we experience our mental images in different detail based on our imagined viewpoint /distance just like a real picture/ the world:  imagine a rabbit next to an elephant. Does the rabbit have ears? Whiskers? Now imagine a rabbit next to a bee. Does it have those features now? Depending on the imagined &quot;level of zoom&quot; we imagine or can respond about features with varying degrees of resolution (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010028575900158" target="_blank">Kosslyn 1975</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>mental imagery activates early visual areas: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926641004000709" target="_blank">Ganis, Thompson, and Kosslyn 2004</a>, <a href="http://m.cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/10/1570.short" target="_blank">Slotnick, Thompson, and Kosslyn 2005</a>, and many more. Although I would point out that there is still a question of exactly what is represented / what those activations mean and some of the evidence isn't very convincing and vivid mental imagery can occur in the absence of primary visual cortex (<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00415-011-6299-z" target="_blank">Bridge et al. 2012</a>, although see <a href="http://m.jneurosci.org/content/29/5/1565.full" target="_blank">Stokes et al. 2009</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Evidence in favor of the propositional view:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>our mental images and representations are typically fixed in a particular viewpoint/ representation and we can't look at them a different way like we could with a picture. For example, in these <a href="http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/images/personal-zenon-pylyshyn/class-info/Lecture2_files/slide0019_image059.jpg" target="_blank">Slezak figures</a>, you can imagine rotating them 90 degrees counterclockwise and seeing a different animal. However, if subjects are shown these figures briefly and asked to memorize them, they do not notice the other interpretation, even though they can mentally rotate the figures (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Slezak2/publication/243768941_Can_images_be_rotated_and_inspected_A_test_of_the_pictorial_medium_theory/links/55fe323c08aeafc8ac740704.pdf" target="_blank">Slezak 1991</a>; see also <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xhp/11/3/317/" target="_blank">Chambers and Reisberg 1985</a> who showed that mental images cannot be ambiguous like pictures can). Nor can we detect the parts or patterns of a mental image like we could with a real image (<a href="http://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03197532" target="_blank">Reed and Johnsen 1975</a>). Rather, it is as if we have some sort of abstract, summary representation and not a picture. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>what we store and then try to imagine is greatly affected by the context and is not a veridical representation of what we have save / are trying to imagine. <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xge/15/1/73/" target="_blank">Carmichael, Hogan, and Waters 1932</a> (&lt;-- not a typo on the date!) had participants memorize and then later draw from memory a series of simple shapes. For example, they might be shown a circle with little lines sticking out of it on all sides. For one group of subjects, they told them it was a sun; for another group, they told them that it was a ship's wheel. When subjects later drew the images from memory, their pictures were distorted based on the label that the image was given, even though the original image was the same for both groups. They argued that this showed that the images were not stored as pictures but as concepts which were susceptible to linguistic influence.</p>
</li>
<li>as mentioned, the fMRI evidence is actually a bit mixed. In many of those studies, they find activation outside of early visual cortex in areas like LOC and in parietal cortex suggesting that representations are more diffuse and distributed and perhaps more abstract.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Resolution:</strong> the nature of mental image representations may be a combination of both types and may vary based on task. Some aspects are pictorial and some are propositional. See the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-coding_theory" target="_blank">dual-coding theory</a> (the critical evidence in favor of this is probably <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/cep/22/5/349/" target="_blank">Brooks 1968</a>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this is a tricky one as it has to do with memory storage, which isn't fully understood. However, the ability to &quot;see&quot; an image in your head is a bit easier to explain, so we'll skip over how the brain actually stores data.</p>
<p>When you see something in front of you the information gathered by your eyes is projected back into your visual cortex for processing, encoding, and storage. This is a fairly complex process that breaks the image down into patterns that can be stored internally (you aren't storing an &quot;image&quot; per se but rather the information about that image). </p>
<p>When you recall an image your brain recreates that pattern of signals and projects it onto the visual cortex like an echo of the original. This means that the only real difference between seeing something in the real world vs. in your head is the signal source and your ability to distinguish between the two.</p>
<p>It should be said that while the brain is remarkable it is not flawless, the image you remember is easily altered by other factors both intrinsic and extrinsic.</p>

<p>Edit: For those of you who say you lack this ability entirely, know that aphantasia is a relatively new suspected disorder. I was able to find a single small study on research gate concerning it.</p>
<p>Zeman, A., Dewar, M., &amp; Della Sala, S. (2015). Lives without imagery–Congenital aphantasia. Cortex, 3.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I've seen a lot of questions about imagined images and some talk of idea inception (original thought). At the visual cortex, the former functions the same as normal visual recall but you are combining known patterns in a different configuration from before. The combinations may be unique but the underlying patterns and ideas are &quot;recycled&quot;.</p>
<p>As for inception, this has more to do with memory structure, storage, recall, and conscious thought, but one of the prevailing theories is that our thoughts and recollections have a degree of randomness that can cause original ideas. I would not be the one to ask however.</p>
<p>Edit 3:</p>
<p>For music recall I imagine the mechanism is similar but I have not done much research into the topic yet. A good springboard for those curious would of course be Wikipedia but take it with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Apologies for the less than in depth responses but doing this from a phone makes pulling proper sources a tad difficult. I will try to revisit this thread when I have access to my mendeley account.</p>
<p>For a more in depth analysis of visual recall please refer to the post by /u/albasri as his sources are much better than Wikipedia links.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mildly off-topic, but I suppose this mildly changes the answer of the question:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphantasia</a></p>
<p>Some people have aphantasia (the inability to visualise images in their head.) I don't believe there is a clear answer as to what happens in the head of those people, but I would think that there would be some differences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You might be interested to learn more about something called Charles Bonnet Syndrome.  It's a common illness that effects about 10% of otherwise mentally healthy (i.e. not psychotic) people who have experienced partial or severe blindness.  What seems to be happening  is that various parts of the visual cortex self-stimulate in the absence of external stimulation to produce lifelike/realistic hallucinations.  There is an excellent TED talk on it from Oliver Sacks if you are interested that can be found here:</p>
