		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can train your body.  More importantly your brain.  Your body creates chemicals to battle the pain.  It is why heat heads get a high from trying really hot foods.  </p>
<p>Endorphins and other brain goos in the brain are discharged more effectively if you eat spicy food more often.  </p>
<p>If you have problems with spicy foods start off with small changes.  Overtime you'll find it much easier to kick up the spicy.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of cultures that eat spicy foods will also have some sort of dairy or other cooling component on the side. As an Indian I always had yogurt on the side and this would not only cool the palette but also the stomach. Over time the spice amount in the food increased (as I got older) and was able to tolerate it more and more, such that going to a restaurant with friends who never had eaten spicy food before were surprised at the tolerance level. </p>
<p>Doing this would certainly help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who feared spicy food and hot sauce until about 15 years ago, one thing I realized later in life was that spice causes pain but does not cause damage.  All that is happening is that these foods contain chemicals that bond with heat receptors in the body.  People who claim injury are mistaken.  The injury comes from stomach acid and from wiping the ass too much.</p>
<p>I enjoy spice a lot now.  I'm not sure I feel an endorphin rush but I do sweat a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm in the process of trying to enjoy hotter things. But I noticed there's two different types ( to me anyway). I tried to build up my tolerance with Thai food first and it seemed like it was more of a fresh heat but with Indian it was more dull ( don't know if I'm explaining it well). </p>
<p>I've built up being able to enjoy the hottest item on my local Thai menu and even ask for extra chillies. But with Indian I'm up to Madrass level. I went all out for Vindaloo last time and it was just too much pain. Like how can anyone even enjoy that level of heat. I'm sure real lovers of heat consider vindaloo tame. </p>
<p>I've just spoken to my local restaurants and told them I'd like to build up my tolerance and they've all been great at recommending what to try next. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm one of those people that partake in the super spicy. Part of it is genetic. Some people simply have less of a response trigger to capsaicin than others. The other part is something you can get used to with practice (to a point). If you have a want for handling spicy, eat a bit of hot as you can stand stuff every day. You become accustomed to it, and may learn to really enjoy it, but like a muscle, if you stop training it, you will start to lose it. Going a week without eating anything really spicy will leave you unable to handle super spicy food again. </p>
<p>Also, as an added note: when you try one of those record breaking hot peppers, like the 1.4 million shu ghost peppers, you aren't eating a pepper with 1.4 million shu's.  Record breaking peppers are grown in very special conditions and selectively bred to get that hot. Your ghost pepper you got a hold of is likely closer to just 600k shu.  Jalapenos can range anywhere from 6k to 300k shu's. </p>
<p>A good sauce to start with is Da Bomb: Ground Zero. 321,000 shu's .</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
