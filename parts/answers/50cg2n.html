		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Hi Jack, a baseball can curve for a number of reasons.<br><br>For a knuckleball, the ball moves around as it approaches the catcher because it isn't spinning. Spinning helps stabilize the ball, and prevents small turbulent effects from affecting its flightpath. A non-spinning ball isn't perfectly spherical, so as the air comes off the face of the ball, it creates turbulence in the air, and causes the ball to move erratically. You can see an example of vortex shedding here:<br><a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/mix.gif" target="_blank">https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/k-12/airplane/Images/mix.gif</a><br><br>For something like a curve ball, the spin of the ball is what causes it to move in a certain direction. As the ball spins, one side goes in the same direction as the air passing the ball, and the other side goes in the opposite direction of the air passing the ball. The side that moves in the same direction accelerates the air slightly (imagine the surface being rough, and acting to push the air as it goes by). The side going in the opposite direction slows the air slightly. As air accelerates, the pressure drops, and as it slows, the pressure rises (this is how planes fly). The net result is that the ball gets pushed by this pressure difference. With a top spin, you'll see the ball dropping, and with a backspin, you'll see the ball rising (or at least not dropping as quickly). If you apply this to a side spin, it'll cause the ball to curve from left-to-right or right-to-left.<br><br>It's worth noting that fluid dynamics is super complicated, but that's a pretty simplified explanation.<br><br>EDIT: THANKS FOR THE GOLD!</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The knuckle ball you see in the gif has almost no spin, which makes it susceptible to slight turbulences and variations in the air, which can push it one way or another (or more than one way) as it approaches the plate. The pitcher has no idea which way it will curve and, as you can see, neither do the batter or catcher.<br><br>The knuckle ball is unique as the only pitch that doesn’t have deliberate spin. Fastballs, curves, sliders, etc all are given spin as the ball is released from the pitcher’s fingertips. Any ball moving rapidly through the air creates a wake of turbulence behind it. It also carries a thin layer of air along with it. <br><br>When a spinning ball is moving through the air the spin influences the wake of turbulence behind it, pushing it in the direction that the back of the ball, the part facing the pitcher. Some of the thin layer of air traveling with the ball is also stripped off and thrown in that same direction. Because of conservation of momentum and Newton’s third law, if a mass of air is pushed one way, the ball will be pushed the other way. For instance, a fastball, because of how it leaves the pitcher’s hand, has backspin. The top of the ball is spinning in the opposite direction of travel and the side facing the pitcher is spinning down. That makes the turbulent wake move down and thus causes the fast ball to rise. (It doesn’t actually rise, but it doesn’t drop as much as it seems it should.)<br><br>A curve ball is thrown with a top spin, pushing the wake upward, making the ball curve down. The pitcher might throw the curve with the top spin at a slight angle, making it curve down and away.<br><br>They say the ball breaks, meaning it seems to curve just before it reaches the plate. In fact it is curving all the way there, but when it is near the plate is has slowed down enough that the curve is more pronounced.<br><br>The effect caused by the spin pushing the air in one direction and the ball in the other is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnus_effect" target="_blank">Magnus Effect.</a></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A bit of a sidenote here.  There is a good documentary on Netflix called &quot;Knuckleball!&quot; about the history of the pitch and the guys that throw it in the league.  Its a couple years old now but still worth checking out!<br><br>Here is a link for the trailer... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPsuORewPLY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPsuORewPLY</a></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Hi Jack, knuckleballs are fascinating. There's a really cool phenomenon that happens when the baseball has no spin, and it's called vortex shedding. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hbbkd2d3H8" target="_blank">Here's a pretty cool video demonstrating that with water.</a> When the turbulence gets built up too much on one side, the vortex is shed, and the ball moves the other way. <br><br>For regular curveballs, the pitcher puts spin on the ball, which overrides this effect. Vortex shedding only happens when there is no to little spin on the ball. <br><br>If you watched the video, you might have seen the part where the man talks about how at the high flow rate, there isn't much going on with vortex shedding. That's because it only happens at slower speeds. That's why when a pitcher throws a knuckleball, it has to be slow. The pitcher in the gif you showed us threw it at only 75 mph, which as you probably know is very slow for a major league pitch. <br><br>If you want to know about curveballs, there's a different principle at work here, and it's called the Magnus Effect. Imagine that you have a ball spinning through the air, with a downward spin. As the ball cuts through the air particles, the bottom of the ball will actually be moving with the air, and the top part will be moving against the flow of the air. This builds up air up and behind the ball, which forces the ball downward. It's hard to describe with just text, so here's a good video demonstrating this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23f1jvGUWJs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23f1jvGUWJs</a></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm not good at explaining it myself, <a href="http://imgur.com/a/nWkha" target="_blank">but there exists a nice infographic</a> that does it quite weill I think. Also, the University of Illinois <a href="http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/knuckleball.html" target="_blank">has an entire website about baseball physics and knuckleballs</a>!</p>		<div class="replies-controls">
