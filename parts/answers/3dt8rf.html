		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to quote the California stalking statute. Other states and countries will be different but this is an example.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(a) Any person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows or willfully and maliciously harasses another person and who makes a credible threat <strong>with the intent to place that person in reasonable fear for his or her safety, or the safety of his or her immediate family</strong> is guilty of the crime of stalking, punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for not more than one year, or by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both that fine and imprisonment, or by imprisonment in the state prison.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The emphasis is mine. In order to be guilty of stalking you have to make the person afraid for their safety. Paparazzi might be annoying but most people aren't worried for their safety around them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Police officer here! Albeit, I live far from California, so the way I interpret stalking may be entirely different from the way it is enforced there.</p>
<p>In the area I police, misdemeanor stalking can occur as long as one persons actions would reasonably cause another to fear for their safety, feel frightened or alarmed, or suffer emotional distress. </p>
<p>&quot;Stalking&quot; means to, on multiple occasions, follow or threaten an individual, interfere with damage or unlawfully enter a persons real or personal property, OR to use their identifying information.</p>
<p>The crime of voyeurism could be charged when one is surreptitiously recording a person changing or undressing or engaging in sexual activity. </p>
<p>So the question of whether a paparazzi can be charged with stalking is complicated. If the issue is where the recording is happening(namely private property), the charge would likely be unlawful entry. If the question is about the sexual nature of the recording, it may be a voyeurism charge which would likely be a felony when it is disseminated. </p>
<p>Stalking would really only be a charge if there was a threatening nature to the interactions between the celebrity and the photographer. Otherwise, there are other charges that better fit those crimes.</p>
<p>One way that paparazzi likely get around voyeurism charges is by selling their pictures to magazines under the table. Additionally, the individual's right to privacy on public property is not as strong as one would think</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This hasn't been addressed, but there are also times that celebrities really want the paparazzi to be filming them. Their careers sometimes thrive on the media attention and it helps their &quot;brand&quot;. For some people this is a really big deal, like Paris Hilton who isn't really famous for much other than paparazzi attention. At the same time a celebrity may want to develop the image of being a sort of playboy big shot so being filmed at a club helps that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of American law in layers that supersede each other. You have local law on the bottom, but that can be overruled by state law, but that can be overruled by federal law, but that can be overruled by constitutional law.</p>
<p>In the stalking/paparazzi question, we have state and federal law: see <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2261A" target="_blank">https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2261A</a></p>
<p>Note how the above language could easily fit the paparazzi's under the statute -- &quot;emotional distress&quot; is one of the standards, which certainly seems to describe some paparazzi activity, and we also see the term &quot;place under surveillance.&quot;</p>
<p>So far so good -- paparazzi journalism seems to fit the statute squarely.</p>
<p>But over and above federal law is constitutional law, to wit, the first amendment's protection of a free press. So think of that as a barrier or limit on any other law, including a federal law. The government cannot infringe on the press doing what it does. Does that mean the press is never punished or regulated? No. It means that the press in America is given a wide berth, a much wider berth than nearly everywhere else in the world, especially Europe, where paparazzi cannot simply harass anyone they please to sell a photo.</p>
<p>It's simply a value system we've adopted in the U.S.: when value a (no stalking) conflicts with value b (free press), value b wins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You don't have to be a celebrity for it to be okay. There's a guy here in Seattle who follows random people around with a camera to make some point. He's an asshole, but as far as I know he hasn't been arrested for stalking. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.geekwire.com/2012/seattles-creepy-cameraman-pushes-limits-public-surveillance/" target="_blank">‘Creepy Cameraman’ pushes limits of public surveillance — a glimpse of the future</a></p>
<p>People have come to accept surveillance cameras as a part of everyday life. But what happens when someone is carrying the surveillance camera instead?</p>
<p>That’s the question raised by a series of online videos in which an unidentified man takes a camera around Seattle and other parts of Washington state, walking up to people and recording them for no apparent reason other than to make a point: How is what he’s doing different than those stationary surveillance cameras tucked away in buildings and public places?</p>
<p>He has been called the “Creepy Cameraman,” and for good reason. It’s clearly more than a little unsettling for the subjects of his surveillance. Just check out the angry reactions in these videos.</p>
<p>It’s not clear who the person is, or what type of camera he’s using, but technology author and blogger Brian S. Hall makes the point that this could be a preview of our future, with technology such as Google’s Project Glass making cameras and recording devices even more pervasive in our daily lives.</p>
