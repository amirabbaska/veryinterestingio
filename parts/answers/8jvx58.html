		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of them are emulating Thomas Nast who is history's most influential political cartoonist. Nast was the first person to depict Republicans as Elephants and Democrats as Donkeys. His influence is akin to Jack Kirby's kinetic comic book drawing style that revolutionized super hero comics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of variation when you compare them side-by-side. That said, they're all caricatures. To sell a desired message, you exaggerate certain features to emphasize whatever it is you're trying to emphasize. It let's you say a lot with just one or two images.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found a big difference when moving to the UK from France (which had a closer style to USA).
The UK draws characters in a much more gruesome way, pointy features, baggy eyes, sickly skin colour, and much more attacks on personal clothing, physique, and symbols. (Communist Corbyn, Theresa may with leopard shoes and a belly...). Where France and the USA made them look much more friendly and would make a caricature of the ideas instead: By exaggerating their position, or words they say rather than attacking the person themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of them are not very good to be honest. I would say the majority are satirists first and cartoonists second. </p>
<p>I think the style of the cartoon suits the media though, all inky and scratchy and serious looking. Almost as if they are so angry they can't hold the pen properly. Graffiti but serious and grown up.</p>
<p>Most likely it has a history of court sketches, and how images were printed onto metal sheets and pressed onto the newspaper. </p>
<p>You will find there is a style common in most shared media, for example architectural illustrations have the same shakey ink scribbles too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
