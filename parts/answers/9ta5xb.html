		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things on the planet would appear to be moving extremely slowly. However, the rate at which light escapes the planet is also hugely dilated, and each photon is stretched out (redshifted) as it moves through the extreme gravitational field.</p>
<p>The redshift factor is the same as the time dilation faction, for a simple non-rotating black hole. In the movie, one hour on the planet is seven years for a distant observer, which comes out to a factor of 60,000. So you would be receiving photons from the planet 60,000 times more slowly, making it very very dim.</p>
<p>The light would also be so redshifted that it would not be visible. The visible light would be stretched down to low-energy microwaves - almost radio waves. X-ray radiation would be redshifted down to visible light, so you could see that, but if there's that many x-rays coming out of the planet, it's not going to be somewhere with an atmosphere and an ocean.</p>
<p>So yeah, you could see people moving slowly, but you'd need special equipment to see anything at all really.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, Stargate SG1 did <a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/A_Matter_of_Time" target="_blank">an episode</a> where the gate connected to a planet that was being consumed by a black hole. </p>
<p>It took a long while to figure out that the reason the video feed wasn't &quot;working&quot; was that, in actuality, it WAS working, but due to the time differential, only a handful of frames had been sent over several hours of live feed (several hours 'Earth time', of course). </p>
<p><a href="https://stargate.fandom.com/wiki/A_Matter_of_Time?file=Boyd_black_hole.jpg" target="_blank">The image (which appears still to the &quot;home&quot; characters)</a> shows the terrified side characters attempting to make a run back to the gate. Since nothing could be done for them, a main character insists on closing the visual feed since, to quote him, &quot;We are witnessing good men dying in slow motion.&quot;</p>
<p>I thought it was an interesting way to portray to laypeople the scenario your question outlines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a follow up to this question, given the redshift factor of 60,000 quoted above, does this mean that there's actually a very, very large region around large black holes that can't be seen with the naked eye given that all the light leaving the area has been red shifted down to radio waves?</p>
<p>Edit: To clarify, I mean an area beyond the event horizon. Light which is able to escape, but due to time dialation has been shifted so far down the spectrum that even though it has left the black hole's orbit we still can't see it with the naked eye. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an amazing Star Trek: Voyager episode called 'Blink of an Eye' that deals with this. The time moves faster on the planet in it however. There are scenes where they look at the planet with magnification and the time moves so fast the only person they can send down is the Emergency Medical Hologram because he won't age. When they bring him back 5 minutes later he was there for like 50 years. So cool </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tangentially related, there's a great science fiction book called Dragon's Egg <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon's_Egg" target="_blank">Dragon's Egg </a>by Robert Forward about scientists on a spaceship observing an alien race evolve on a planet in a similar situation. If you enjoyed that part of interstellar, you might enjoy this story. The story was adapted as an episode in Star Trek Voyager as well, iirc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
