The mind is conditioned to ignore the the second one because it is irrelevant to the the content. Like someone below demonstrated, it also works with scrambled words, because the the mind is very powerful.</p>
<p>Your mind likes to be efficient. It's also the the same reason why optical illusions work. It constantly adjusts how it processes its surroundings based on the the input of the the environment. </p>
<p>This youtube video from one of my favorite channels shows a good demonstration of your brain doing similar processes:</p>

<p>As you see in the the video, you brain can do weird stuff.</p>
<p>Also, I doubled the the word ------&quot;the&quot;----- 9 times during this post. Did you notice all of it? ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human mind ignores many many things actually. If it didn't, your consciousness would be constantly awash in so much information you'd basically be catatonic or hallucinating constantly. Our brains have evolved to tune in on a certain spectrum of reality and ignore a lot of it in order to function in an extremely complicated and ever changing world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Conditioning. I had to read that sentence three times before I noticed. You've been taught your whole life the correct structures of simple sentences, and your mind knows what that sentence is supposed to say. So when you read that, your mind ignores the second &quot;the&quot; because it knows it shouldn't be there and that it's unimportant to the sentence.</p>

<p>Edit: For those of you requiring an extra &quot;the&quot; in my comment, you'll find it up here: &quot;the the&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to what others have said, the human brain, when reading, doesn't actually see every word, unless you're not fluent in a particular language. Your eyes actually take in multiple words at a time and parse the sentence based on the words you've taken in. This also means that unless a particular particle is deadly important to the sentence, your brain ignores it. It also partially explains why you sometimes go back over a sentence if it doesn't parse correctly. An extra &quot;the&quot; doesn't change the meaning of a sentence, so you continue as if you understood.</p>
<p>(Edit: some source for those interested in how reading works: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_%28process%29" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_%28process%29</a> and of course this page has a nice, long reading list of sources at the bottom)</p>
<p>My question would be to those people who read languages such as Chinese or Korean or Japanese: does the same thing happen if you put two of the same particle in a row in a sentence? For example, would a Japanese person reading &quot;英語 がが わかりません&quot; spot the mistake or gloss over it in the same way native English speakers gloss over superfluous incidents of &quot;the&quot;?</p>
<p>Edit: it's curious and interesting as hell: about an equal number of native Japanese speakers gloss over the mistake as much as stands out for the others. If anyone has any research on reading and word cognition in non-roman alphabetic languages, I'd love to read it.</p>
<p>Edit2: As others have mentioned, the eye's saccadic movement system also has a lot to do with this. This wiki page has more information about it for those who are interested: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_in_language_reading" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_in_language_reading</a></p>

<p>There's a phenomenon called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_blink" target="_blank">attentional blink</a> where, when you're rapidly presented with stimuli, your brain will perceive two identical stimuli in a row as a single stimulus.  Basically, your brain sees &quot;the the&quot; and assumes there was only one.  </p>
<p>In nature, identical stimuli in rapid succession are vanishingly rare - if you see two crouching tigers from the same angle and in the same position in a quarter of a second, it's much more likely there was only one tiger and you just blinked; so your brain edits your perceptions with that in mind.</p>
