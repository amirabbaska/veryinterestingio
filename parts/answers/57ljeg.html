		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was my former specialization. I was a Nutrition Technician (later Senior Technician) in a contract analysis lab. I've worked on nearly every nutritional test we offered. </p>
<p>First, a sample is logged into the system. Contract labs are certified by various bodies, and accurate records are a vital part of that.</p>
<p>Then the sample will be blended [Homogenised is the fancy word]. This is literal, a big food processor is used, and usually around a kilo of whatever sample is sent in. Sometimes a lot more, I've blended everything from bin bags full of popcorn to whole turkeys. </p>
<p>Some of the sample is saved in a deep freezer, some is saved in a fridge. From the fridge sample, smaller samples are taken for each test.</p>
<p>Protein is calculated by burning it in a furnace to measure the nitrogen content. From the nitrogen content you can calculate the protein present in the sample.</p>
<p>Moisture is measured by drying the sample overnight. Weighing it before and after lets you calculate the amount of the sample that was water.</p>
<p>With the dried sample, you can perform a crude fat measurement using NMR. This is much faster and easier than other fat analyses, but it only gives you an idea of fat content, not what kinds of fat are present. NMR is the same sort of technology that is used in MRI machines, but in this case is tuned just to measure hydrogen atoms in a liquid state. </p>
<p>A drop of fat or oil is extracted from a sample and then used in a machine called a Gas Chromatograph. The droplet is vapourised at around 400 degrees centigrade and sent through a glass fiber tube. Big fat molecules in the droplet go slower than small ones, and so by detecting them as they come out of the tube, you know what order and amount of each one there was in the fat. From this you can calculate how much saturated and unsaturated fat is present, as well as more details like Omega 3 &amp; 6 content.</p>
<p>Sugar content is analysed in a similar manner, but with a Liquid Chromatograph.</p>
<p>Fiber is measured by dissolving a sample in different solvents, different enzyme baths, until only the fiber is left, it is then dried and weighed. If Carbohydrate calculation is needed, the sample is paused halfway for a drying and weighing stage</p>
<p>With this set of information; Fats, Proteins, Carbohydrates, Sugars, Fiber and Moisture, the calorie content of food can be calculated. </p>
<p>Other things are also analyzed, but that's the usual bare minimum for nutritional information. Most contract labs offer them as a &quot;suite&quot; of tests. </p>
<p>I hope that's about the right level for a 5 year old. Usually when I talk science to kids they can interrupt me to ask questions and I can explain what a molecule, or what have you, is.</p>
<p>Edit: I will not be answering comments until tomorrow, can't believe I've spent 5 hours sitting her talking to you all. Thanks for the Karma and Gold. Now I have to go cook dinner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at a place that tested this! Each thing had a different test for it and we'd mush up the food item and split it up and do each test on a bit so iirc for salt you put a known quantity (2 grams) in a little crucible and left it in the furnace overnight so it turned to ash then dissolved it in a known quantity of water (100ml) and then there was a machine that sucked up the water and gave a reading that went in a formula to calculate the amount of salt. </p>
<p>For protein it got dissolved in an acid overnight and then that got put in a flask and heated so stuff evaporated and condensed into a different flask that had an indicator in. When that changed colour it was done and you titrated it til the colour changed back so you know how much stuff was in there and then the numbers got put in another formula to tell you the amount of protein. </p>
<p>I never did fat but I saw other people doing it. More dissolving, evaporating and jiggery pokery to get numbers to put in formulae. You get the idea!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Originally, they'd just put the food/drink in a perfect combustion chamber, completely incinerate it, then measure how much energy was released.<br />
This wasn't a good measurement because the human body, while incredibly efficient, is not a perfect combustion machine.</p>
<p>Now, independent bodies (FDA, WHO) have calculated the effective absorbtion rate of the various food components (like protein, fats, carbohydrates, simple sugars etc) as well as the common breakdown of food types (e.g. the average amount of protein in cashew nuts).<br />
Food producers use these measurements to calculate the nutritional breakdown of their products. If they are found to misrepresent the information to a statistically significant degree, they can be charged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work at a very small food company doing research. All the scientists in labs have answered how it's technically done, but it's not how it's always done. </p>
<p>USDA accepts labels produced software such as ESHA. This is a program with a big database of all the ingredients. You input your ingredients, it kicks out a nutritional label. It's not nearly as accurate as actually lab testing a sample, but for a small company without the budget to send samples to a lab for a couple thousand dollars, it can be done this way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
