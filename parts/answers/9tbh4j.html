		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're starting from a slight misconception.</p>
<p>Try &quot;naturally&quot; sleeping too long out in nature.  Unless you have some underlying medical condition or using chemical assistance, you probably can't.  Even inside a tent, it's pretty difficult.</p>
<p>We can only sleep too long so easily because we have artificially shut ourselves off from the signals such as light, temperature change, and critter noise that trigger our body to wake up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You want to sleep as long as possible to maximize your energy. In nature, you're grateful for every rest you get, so we never really developed a limiter. The limiter is that tiger right behind you, get up!</p>
<p>Same with food. If you always have to fight for every scrap, you're always going to eat it, so nature didn't really put an extra limit on that. Nature didn't plan for people to get obese and sit around all day, because you just can't do that in the harsh savannas of africa.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a common mistake to think that your body always does things to benefit it. It's a complex organism where some parts often work against the well-being of the whole, especially in situations where the context is at odds with the one in which humans evolved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light was the &quot;sleep limiter&quot; back in the past. We evolved in central Africa were there aren't particularly long nights, you went to sleep with the dark and light naturally woke you up at sunrise.</p>
<p>When it's dark, your body produces melatonin, which makes you sleepy, light inhibits its production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
