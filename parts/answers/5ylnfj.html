		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cells in the meat you eat are not alive, so it doesn't matter if they are damaged when they freeze. They're already damaged beyond repair from lack of oxygen. That does however not mean that they've lost their nutritional value. Even if you crush an egg, all the nutritients are still there, right? Assuming you don't spill something onto the floor.</p>
<p>Your frozen meat is however not as fine when thawed as it was when it was fresh. You'll notice this if you freeze and thaw something several times. The meat's texture changes, and generally becomes less appetizing. Freezing it just once, and gently thawing it doesn't damage it all that much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how you've frozen the meat as well. Slow freezing will ruin meat worse because it takes time for large ice crystals to form. Its really the large ice crystals that cause damage on a cellular level. </p>
<p>If something is quick frozen, it maintains its structure much better, for example a flower submerged in liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>The poster Above me is correct though. Since no process is perfect, even through quick freezing, some large crystals form, damage will accumulate, and you will ruin the meat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Commercial meat freezing is usually done with blast freezers that reduce the temperature to -18 degrees Celsius within 4 hours (home freezers would take at least 12 hours to do the same thing) and reduce the chances of large ice crystals forming. Speed of freezing controls the formation of ice crystals and faster is better for limiting damage.</p>
<p>For frozen ready meals a nitrogen freezing tunnel is often used because it drops the temperature even more quickly and can be built into a preparation line with reasonable ease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not fine. Notice that puddle of red or clear liquid that leeches out and pools around what you're defrosting? That's liquid that was in the meat but has now escaped through ruptured cells. Defrosted meat is never as good as fresh.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
