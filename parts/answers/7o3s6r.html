		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1.5g is NOT the same physiologically as gaining 50% body weight in 1g. People are confusing physics for physiology. For example, in 1.5g your blood itself would weigh 50% more. Your heart will have to work much harder to pump blood through your body and prevent it from pooling in your legs. That added stress to your heart could mean heart failure becoming more common. Also with 1.5g, the organelles and components of every cell in your body would weigh more. Who knows how that could effect cellular functioning.</p>
<p>It just hasn't been studied, but there are many more potential adverse effects than stressing your joints more. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are we ever planning to return to Earth? If not, I would imagine that the 0.5g planet would be preferable, as setting up infrastructure would be easiest, requiring less energy to move and erect. The problems with reduced muscle and bone density will soon bring the person down a few notches, but by then most of the infrastructure would be in place.</p>
<p>However, if we were trying to terraform our new planet, I doubt that 0.5g would be enough to ever retain a breathable atmosphere. The thinner atmosphere would mean that solar cells are more efficient, but, by the point we are terraforming, I'd assume we'd have portable fusion reactors for near limitless energy. Radiation would also be less of a concern in a greater density atmosphere if the planet does not have as strong of a magnetic field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you land on a planet with 1.5G, you will have a much more difficult time getting back off of it.  If the earth was 50% larger in diameter then we could not use chemical rockets to get into space at all. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html" target="_blank">https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/expeditions/expedition30/tryanny.html</a>  So if you care about leaving, 0.5G would be better.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how you can spin up a space station to give you effectively artificial gravity?  You can do that on a planet surface too.  You just end up shaping your colony in sort of a bowl shape, so everyone's kinda running around on it diagonally, since that's the total vector of the spinning bowl plus the planet's gravity.</p>
<p>So .5G can be engineered around.  1.5G.... not really. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The 1.5g environment would be similar to someone on Earth gaining a large amount of weight in a short period.  It would take time for the body to adjust, but it would eventually.</p>
<p>Realistically, I don't think either would be &quot;ideal&quot;.  Higher g means more wear on joints, but the body can compensate with more muscle and tendon.  It couldn't compensate with more ligaments, so that's a limiting factor.  More strain on the heart, but again, it would compensate.  Artificial supports (wrist, elbow, back and knee braces) would reduce the chance of an injury while the person adapts to the new environment.  I include wrist and elbow braces due to how people try to stop themselves when the fall.</p>
<p>In lower g, you'll lose bone density and overall strength.  Distribution of fluids in the body may cause some problems.  Astronaut Scott Kelly spent nearly a year on the ISS, and reported bloating of the face as blood distributed itself more evenly in his body; I would expect a little bit of that at 0.5g.</p>
<p>It would be possible to simulate a 1g environment so that person could minimize the low-g effects.  For example, you would spend the day working in the 0.5g environment, but might sleep in a bed being spun in a large centrifuge to simulate 1g.  This may or may not help because the person isn't <em>actively</em> resisting the 1g forces as they would normally (such as standing, walking, etc.), but it would likely be tested all the same.</p>
<p>If the habitation is permanent, neither would likely pose any difficulties after several generations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
