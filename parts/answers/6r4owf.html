		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the early days of hacking, viruses were created on test computers. A machine that has all the basic components of a computer, but doesn't have anything but an OS installed. It's just a dummy. </p>
<p>Later, we created virtual machines for that. Basically, a whole computer that is separated from the rest of your computer by an invisible wall. This is how most viruses are created nowadays.</p>
<p>However, certain particularly nasty viruses can get through even virtual machines. We're back to using dummy computers that aren't connected to anything else. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally they test the code on a virtual machine, which is basically a copy of the operating system running in a &quot;box&quot; on the computer.</p>
<p>Successfully infecting the OS inside the virtual machine doesn't actually infect the computer.</p>
<p>If the malware is intended to target specific hardware setups you can always just infect a test machine too, then wipe it clean since it wasn't storing anything important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A virus on a computer isn't the same as a virus in your body.</p>
<p>Just having code for a virus doesn't make your computer radioactive and unusable. As long as you don't execute the virus on your own PC, you won't have any problems.</p>
<p>Additionally, to test it, you can just test it on a separate machine, or a virtual environment within a system that prevents it from getting outside of that. All depends on the type of &quot;virus.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really an answer to the original question, as others have more than covered that talking about virtual machines and sandboxed. Just an interesting sidenote - often malware isn't developed in a vacuum. A recurring theme when investigating new malware is that you can often find multiple versions of it uploaded to sites like VirusTotal.com (which is used to run multiple anti-virus products against a sample). Ive seen talks where the researchers have identified when a virus was first created by finding it in this site's archives - often multiple iterations, which can be very useful in analysis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
