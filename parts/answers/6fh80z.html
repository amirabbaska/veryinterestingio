		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The statement that &quot;ignorance of the law is not an excuse&quot; is not actually an ironclad rule, and it is in fact in tension with some basic legal principles.  Many people have little parts of this in the explanations already given, but let me see if I can put together the pieces.</p>
<p>First, the law distinguishes between acts that are &quot;malum in se&quot; (bad in itself) and &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; (bad because it's prohibited).  The classic example of &quot;malum in se&quot; is murder -- it's presumed that everyone knows it's wrong to kill.  (Note, though, that this may shift over time -- it didn't used to be the case that everyone was supposed to know that a husband was not allowed to slap his wife, or rape her; now we think they should know that.)  The classic example of &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; is the law stating that you have to drive on the right-hand side of the road (in the U.S.).  Of course, there's no moral element to this -- it could just as easily be the left-hand side -- and so you're not expected to have a moral intuition that you can't drive on the left.  But it's still illegal.</p>
<p>As some people have pointed out in this thread, part of the justification for treating many &quot;malum prohibitum&quot; acts as crimes regardless of knowledge is that when you undertake to do certain potentially hazardous things (like driving) you are presumed to take on responsibility for understanding how to do it lawfully.  In the case of driving, we make this explicit -- you have to have a license to drive, and you have to take a test on traffic laws before you can be licensed.  And while you don't (to my knowledge) have to take a test before you open a restaurant, you are expected to familiarize yourself with the local health codes -- usually by hiring an expert to help you.</p>
<p>Of course, there are hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of local, state, and federal laws and regulations that carry some sort of criminal or civil penalty, and not all of them address human safety.  Many laws primarily address other interests, such as tax collection, environmental protection, or simply aesthetic preferences (e.g., <a href="http://www.santafenm.gov/historic_preservation" target="_blank">&quot;historic preservation&quot; zones</a>).  It is perfectly possible to violate some of these laws without having assumed any particular duty to familiarize yourself with all of them.  For example, being a tourist in a national park does not reasonably carry with it the responsibility to become an expert on wildlife protection laws, forest fire safety laws, etc., etc -- nor to consult such an expert.  Requiring people to acquire expertise in multiple areas of law to undertake common, non-dangerous activities would be silly.  Yet people in those parks can be held liable for those laws all the same.  </p>
<p>You don't even have to go to a park to commit a crime, though.  Technically speaking, <a href="http://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2015/05/if-i-find-an-eagle-feather-can-i-keep-it.html" target="_blank">if you pick up a bald eagle feather off the ground in your own back yard, you have committed a crime</a> -- even though you did nothing to the eagle, bald eagles are no longer endangered, and you may not even know what kind of feather it is, let alone the law protecting it.</p>
<p>That is, really, somewhat unfair, and legal scholars <a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=619020093024127103117107020103114123102005063047062066086000020112083094091090088088027001040125108012013088008094082111120029021052054085039026069067093015113002004026085039007001081023117006004028112024001100019026029007013007025005097116115097005001&amp;EXT=pdf" target="_blank">debate the application and reach of this &quot;ignorance of the law&quot; principle</a>.  On the pro side, as /u/ViskerRatio notes, there are practical reasons for not making an absolute defense out of ignorance, since knowledge is very hard to prove.  On the con side, requiring detailed knowledge of the law just to interact with a feather on your lawn seems unreasonable.</p>
<p>Yet, as people have noted, in many situations the worst consequences do not actually follow from such technical violations.  Partly, of course, this is because many technical violations go unnoticed.  There is a certain amount of safety-in-obscurity at work.</p>
<p>Partly it is because of police and prosecutorial discretion; law enforcement officers may not arrest you, and prosecutors may decline to prosecute, if your act was truly without knowledge and the law is obscure.  This discretion is hardly a perfect safeguard, of course, because police and prosecutors (a) are human, and so may be biased in their application of discretion (b) are human, and so may just be rigid, hardass jerks who like punishing people; (c) <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2010/08/02/ignorance-of-the-law-is-no-exc" target="_blank">sometimes do not actually understand the law themselves</a>; and (d) are sometimes under perverse incentives to meet certain quotas, and a clear crime/violation, even if committed by accident, fits the bill.  But if none of those things is present, police or prosecutorial discretion can be a first-line safeguard against the prosecution of ignorant violations.</p>
<p>There are other layers of protection, too.  Some laws have a knowledge-of-the-law component built into them.  For example, in order to convict someone of &quot;structuring a bank transaction&quot; -- i.e., breaking up deposits into smaller amounts to avoid triggering the bank's duty to report large deposits to the government -- the prosecution has to prove that the defendant intended to avoid the reporting laws.  It's not enough to show small transactions -- you have to show, essentially, knowledge of the law. </p>
<p>Finally, sometimes courts will invalidate certain laws on the ground that a lack of notice violates the right to &quot;due process of law&quot; (guaranteed in the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments).   So, for example, in <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8476324156679315934&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr" target="_blank">Lambert v. California</a>, the Supreme Court overturned a conviction under a law requiring felons to register with the local government within five days of arrival in the city.  The Court noted that many licensing schemes (say, business licenses, or car registration) required a person to register with the government, but this law was different:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Violation of its provisions is unaccompanied by any activity whatever, mere presence in the city being the test. Moreover, <em>circumstances which might move one to inquire as to the necessity of registration are completely lacking</em> . . . . We believe that actual knowledge of the duty to register or proof of the probability of such knowledge and subsequent failure to comply are necessary before a conviction under the ordinance can stand. As Holmes wrote in The Common Law, &quot;A law which punished conduct which would not be blameworthy in the average member of the community would be too severe for that community to bear.&quot;  Its severity lies in the absence of an opportunity either to avoid the consequences of the law or to defend any prosecution brought under it. Where a person did not know of the duty to register and where there was no proof of the probability of such knowledge, he may not be convicted consistently with due process. Were it otherwise, the evil would be as great as it is when the law is written in print too fine to read or in a language foreign to the community.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &quot;ignorance of the law&quot; rule, then, is not a hard-and-fast thing, but one among a set of competing principles (including the principle of due process of law).  And it should be applied, when things work right, with a reasonable appreciation of the practicalities, and with due regard for basic fairness.  It doesn't always work out, and people really <em>do</em> sometimes get railroaded for things they didn't understand to be crimes.  But that's the idea.</p>
<p>I'll just add that there's a strong libertarian argument that we should prohibit fewer things and/or attach serious penalties to fewer things, so that &quot;the law&quot; accords better with people's intuitions about what might be contained in it.  On the other hand, most laws and regulations exist to solve some perceived problem, and if you want fewer laws you may have to wrestle with more social problems.  It's all a bit of a trade-off.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Even though it would be impossible, even for someone with substantial legal training, to be aware of every law in operation in every aspect of a state's activities, this is the price paid to ensure that willful blindness cannot become the basis of exculpation. Thus, it is well settled that persons engaged in any undertakings outside what is common for a normal person, such as running a nuclear power plant, will make themselves aware of the laws necessary to engage in that undertaking. If they do not, they cannot complain if they incur liability.</p>

<p>Also what exactly do you mean by &quot;I know about jury nullification.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ignorance of the law is not a defense against violation, but <em>knowing</em> the law is an immense help in mounting a defense or proving someone's guilt.</p>
<p>If they didn't study the law and ignorantly applied it in the courtroom or on the streets, you might have mothers arrested for child abuse when dressing their daughters in tight, form-revealing outfits and dance around showing off their butts (gymnastics floor routines).</p>
<p>What it means is simply that you can not claim that you thought it was perfectly fine to randomly kill that hobo, because no one ever told you not to kill hobos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to go to school for years to understand a huge number of intricacies about the law - years of prior cases, changes in the laws, the reasons for them, the meanings of a million specific terms and applications that they apply to.</p>
<p>But to know &quot;this is illegal&quot; doesn't take much - that's not the thing that law students are slaving away to cram into their brains.  We're raised by a society that tells us that killing, stealing, raping, and double parking are wrong and illegal.</p>
<p>But nobody's expected to know every law - only the ones that should apply to you.  I work in insurance, so I know a bunch of weird insurance laws, but the average person doesn't need to know jack (besides &quot;don't lie to get cheaper insurance&quot;).  And I don't need to know any of the laws that affect construction, or coal mining, or restaurant safety, or whatever - you're expected to be taught those when you take on a job, and if you don't it's on you and your employer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
