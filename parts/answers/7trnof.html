		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spoken languages change in predictable ways. Vowels shift, consonants are replaced, etc. Linguists have made evolutionary trees that map which languages arose from which. By comparing related languages that diverged a long time ago (eg Sanskrit and German), linguists can work out some features of the shared common ancestor language (proto-Indo European). P.I.E. hasn't been spoken for 7000+ years, but we have some idea of vocabulary and pronunciation.</p>
<p>It's a really fascinating subject. Google &quot;archaeolinguistics&quot; for more. There's also a book called The Horse, the Wheel and Language that takes a deep dive into indoeuropean archaeology and linguistics. Finally, the game Far Cry: Primal is not an accurate depiction of &quot;cave man life&quot;, but they did hire actual archaeolinguistic experts to create several spoken variations of indoeuropean that are used in the game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The spoken language evolved into Demotic by the time of Classical Antiquity, and finally into Coptic by the time of Christianisation. Spoken Coptic was almost extinct by the 17th century, but it remains in use as the liturgical language of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the other comments address reconstruction to some degree, it's important to note that the pronunciation adopted by Egyptologists has absolutely zero to do with reconstructions:  the vowel values are assigned arbitrarily.</p>
<p>As an example, &quot;Tutankhamen&quot; (twt-ꜥnḫ-ı͗mn) was likely pronounced as something like &quot;Tawat 'ankhu qaman&quot; ([taˈwaːt ˈʕaːnxu ʔaˈmaːn]).  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally something I can give very informative answer about.
I studies enough Egyptian language and as an Egyptian was particular concerned with proper (read original) pronunciation.</p>
<p>Originally Egyptians wrote their language in Hieroglyphics. A single glyph can represent a single constant, multiple constants or represent an actual complete word.</p>
<p>For example the glyph that looks like a mouth can represent the actual word &quot;mouth&quot; or can represent the letter &quot;R&quot; (probably because mouth was called &quot;ro&quot; in Egyptian)</p>
<p>A vowel might be written if it's very strong but usually dropped when it's weak. For example word &quot;Hello&quot; would've probably been written &quot;Hllo&quot; and &quot;road&quot; would be &quot;rod&quot;.</p>
<p>With that kind of system it's extremely difficult to reconstruct the original pronunciation of the words.</p>
<p>That wasn't a problem for Ancient Egyptians in general because they already knew how the words are pronounced however magicians had hard time using this system to write magic spells in their books.</p>
<p>You see, sometimes magic spells can be just some strange sounds that don't have a meaning, writing vowels was very important or the reader would recite the spell incorrectly which may end up killing him (because the evil spirit misinterpret what he is saying or whatever).</p>
<p>Fortunately Greek invaded Egypt and brought their alphabet - which  ironically derived from ancient Egyptian alphabet - but anyway that one had vowels.</p>
<p>Magicians were the first to adopt that new writing system. They wrote Egyptian language with Greek letters and this time all vowels were also represented.</p>
<p>Later when Christianity spread the Church also wanted to keep itself away from the evil pagan language (hieroglyphics) so she also adopted the Greek writing system and the new system spread and came to be known as &quot;Coptic&quot; writing system.</p>
<p>Eventually the knowledge of hieroglyphics was erased originally because one christian Roman emperor ordered the shut down of all Egyptian temples - where the language and writing system was usually taught - but the later invasion of the Arabs gave the final strike.</p>
<p>For long time after that, the only knowladge we had about Egyptian Gods and History was from writing of a greek historian called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herodotus#Egypt" target="_blank">Herodotus</a></p>
<p>Pretty much all Egyptian names that ends with &quot;is&quot; or &quot;os&quot; were known from his writings. For example (Isis, Osiris, Ramsis, Anubis, Horus, ....) and all these names without exception are not original and had their pronunciation altered to match Greek grammar (same way Jesus's name for example has been altered from Yashua to Yisos)</p>
<p>Finally Champollion came, he managed to decipher the Hieroglyphics system and that's how we knew the pronunication of kings like tut ankh amun.
That is also how we know for sure that the names Herodotus mentioned isn't the original names.</p>
<p>So does Tut Ankh Amun was really called that? well obviously the vowels is still missing so it's probably not so accurate.
The word Ankh means life which later written in Coptic Text as &quot;Ankh&quot; or &quot;Onkh&quot; (depending on the Dialect).
So for example assuming that this word hasn't changed between the time Tut Ankh Amun died and the time Coptic writing system appeared then yes we are pretty sure it's correct pronunciation.</p>
<p>Most of the time however scientist don't really care about original pronunciation and so they just place &quot;e&quot; between any two constants. Most of Egyptian names you hear are based on that lazy pronunciation system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary sources from pre-Greek contact (hieroglyphs, hieratic, demotic) are the best way to interpret the language directly, with Greek as a handy reference point.  Like modern-day Hebrew (and yes, it's Hebrew's predecessor by a few thousand years), the language is essentially a shorthand that omitted vowels.  This is the breakdown of Tut Ankh Amun:</p>
<p><a href="https://i0.wp.com/www.polatkaya.net/Tut_hieroglyphic_meanings.GIF" target="_blank">https://i0.wp.com/www.polatkaya.net/Tut_hieroglyphic_meanings.GIF</a></p>
<p>What we actually know of the phonology of this is something more like &quot;<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=1ehBExYpasIC&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=twt-rnh-imn&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=36a4WI_PSP&amp;sig=hlnBeS2-eZCS0lCXeCVkngnyIrw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsyveCwv3YAhUJ2FMKHeaEDVoQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target="_blank">twt-rnh-imn</a>&quot; (see goltrpoat's comment).  The vowels are filled in to fit our language.  We only have good estimates as to what they actually are, so correspondingly you'll sometimes see it rendered &quot;Tutenkhamen&quot; or whatever.  Tut-ankh-amun, by the way, means something like &quot;the living form of Amun&quot;, Amun basically being an aspect-deity along the same lines as Zeus, whose consort was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amunet" target="_blank">Amunet</a> or later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mut" target="_blank">Mut</a>.  <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/hieratic-inscriptions-from-the-tomb-of-tutankhamun-vol-2-jaroslav-cerny/1000820856" target="_blank">This</a> is a great  book if you want to read 1-to-1 translations from Tut's tomb.</p>
<p>In the same vein, &quot;Osiris&quot; is not accurate.  The &quot;is&quot; is a telltale sign that it's a modified Greek/Latin loan word.  &quot;Ausar&quot; is how it's usually rendered in its original form, but again, it breaks down to something like &quot;s'r&quot;.  I read &quot;wsjr&quot; in the Wiki article, honestly I forget why.  That's D4 in the Gardiner sign list, coupled often with Q1 (st) and A40 (?):</p>
