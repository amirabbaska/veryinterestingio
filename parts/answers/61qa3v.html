The fire just weakens it enough for it to collapse, if it does at all. It's the furniture, carpets, etc. that burn so fast. Especially curtains. Curtains are a HUGE fire hazard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other comments, the structure of a standard campfire (3-4 logs making a triangle into each other) contributes to it. </p>
<p>In this campfire, the logs burn, some of the heat radiates into the other logs, but most of it rises, away from the campfire, and into the air. This heat is lost, and it flies away. The flames on the log crawl up the log at about a 45 degree angle, where they contact a small amount of neighboring wood, and a lot of air. You may notice that as the logs ember, they drop coals in a pile under the logs. These embers sustain the fire by radiating the heat upward (into the logs) and empowering the flames on the underside of the logs.</p>
<p>In a housefire, the fire doesn't radiate the heat away. (until you breach a wall, or ceiling) The heat radiates into nearby furniture, walls, whatever, retaining that heat. This spreads the fire much faster by having everything heat up. For flames on a vertical wall, the actual flame is in contact with the wood directly above it, far more than a log at 45 degrees, which accelerates the burning of that piece of wood. In a housefire, there is also a much greater quantity of fuel. As the wood starts embering, there is simply so much more fuel to burn. The embers land, spread their heat to their surroundings and then those surroundings burn and ember and so forth. The fact that a house is a box-like structure means that it contains the heat and accumulates it, like an oven, whereas an open campfire is always losing heat to the air and wind.</p>
<p>TL:DR - fire burning things is a reaction that is controlled by the amount of heat being retained, the amount of fuel in contact with flame. Houses on fire hold the heat, spread it more effectively, and are simply larger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a person responsible for fire testing of architectural products and here is my take on it.</p>
<p>A commercial or residential window shade will burn if in the path of a flame, otherwise it self extinguishes. Similarly the walls and furniture will burn if in contact with a flame from a source like a carpet or other flooring surface. Ceiling tiles will burn if in path of a flame off of desks and sofas. The intensity of the fire will determine the flame height and the materials in the room affected by the flame. </p>
<p>The reason the campfire takes so long is because the logs were not stacked in order to enable the lower burning logs to ignite those above them. Next time try slicing the log with slits in it and see how much faster it burns. It has to do with accessibility to air. A solid log burns slowly while the slit logs burns faster because the air reaches inside the slits. Any burnable surface in contact with both air and a flame will burn quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Modern houses are filled with plastic and synthetic material so burn damn fast!</p>
<p>Old wooden houses are much slower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surface area versus volume. The larger the volume of material receiving the full fire triangle (fuel, oxygen, and heat) the faster more energetic the flame.</p>
<p>The total ability of &quot;the fire&quot; to radiate heat is limited by its surface area.</p>
<p>The total ability of &quot;the fire&quot; to receive new oxygen is also limited by its surface area -- unless you add an oxidizer or a blower or something.</p>
<p>Volume goes with the cube, area goes with the square, so larger things get bigger in volume faster than they get larger in size. You know this from blowing up balloons. </p>
<p>So a larger fire will &quot;burn hotter&quot; because it cannot get rid of the heat it's generating &quot;as easily&quot; as a smaller fire.</p>
<p>So you make a tiny campfire and you can get right up next to it, and it will burn and smolder all night. Make a larger campfire and you can't get close enough to it to be comfortable -- you just have this point where one side of you is searing and one side of you is freezing.</p>
<p>Build a bonfire and you can get injured long before you are close enough to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Set a house ablaze and you need protective gear to get on the front lawn.</p>
<p>Now a house fire will often leave a skeleton of wood behind because the fire triangle says you need oxygen and the oxygen cannot penetrate the wood fast enough to burn it. So the wood chunks <em>bake</em> and become charcoal instead of burning. The rest of the house burns real fast, then stops burning for running out of fuel. The whole thing then cools and there's not enough heat to keep the structural members burning. Plus there's often a guy with a hose cooling the thing and blocking the oxygen (both are part of what water does to fire).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
