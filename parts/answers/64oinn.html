<p>A lot of that content being uploaded isn't great quality and so it doesn't take up much space. The very high quality videos are compressed to take up as little as possible.</p>
<p>As long as they can add hard drives faster than we can consume it, they stay ahead.</p>
<p>Remember that the server farms are distributed throughout the world. There is probably one near you.</p>
