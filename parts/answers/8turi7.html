		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a review of an article in <em>Scientific American</em>:</p>
<p>Scientific American explains that when donor blood is mixed into the body with a transfusion, that person’s DNA will be present in your body for some days, “but its presence is unlikely to alter genetic tests significantly.” It is likely minimized because the majority of blood is red cells, which do not carry DNA — the white blood cells do. That publication notes studies have shown that highly sensitive equipment can pick up donor DNA from blood transfusions up to a week after the procedure, but with particularly large transfusions, donor white blood cells were present for up to a year and a half afterward. Still, even in those latter cases, the recipient’s DNA was clearly dominant over the donor DNA, which is easily identifiable as “a relatively inconsequential interloper.”</p>
<p>====</p>
<p>This review raises a question for me.   Suppose the white blood cells from the donor, that can persist for up to a year in the blood of the recipient, have a high risk of becoming cancerous.  Is there any evidence of this occurring, that is, a recipient developing cancer of a type of white blood cell that came from a donor ?    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many DNA tests do not require blood. Red blood cells do not contain DNA, but precursor cells to red blood cells and white blood cells do contain DNA.</p>
<p>I would expect there to be an issue. A recent blood transfusion is a question that would be asked if the DNA test requires blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, as a matter of fact! However, as others have stated, generally a cheek swab will be used instead of blood. Additionally the amount of foreign DNA will be minute, since white cells make up only a small part of whole blood. </p>
<p>There are tests that are done to monitor just such a mismatch of genetic material in the blood (or more properly, white cells). After a person receives a bone marrow transplant, their blood will appear as a certain percentage of their own DNA and a certain percentage of the donor's. Monitoring this percentage over time gives doctors an idea of how well the patient is tolerating the transplant. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just had a situation in which a patient was massively transfused upon presentation to our ER. For the next 30 days the patient was unable to have their blood type verified because we couldn't be certain whether the typing would be correct as they had received so much O- product. For the duration of their stay this particular patient had to have emergency typed and released/generic blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually do NGS based cancer testing for a hospital which does tumor/match normal heme assays. We quite often do run into what we call &quot;Donor SNPs&quot; or SNP sites coming from donor blood. Normally these would not be filtered out of our pipeline because the normal we use (nail/saliva) wouldn't possess the same SNPs as the blood tumor. For those cases we usually request Host pre-transplant, host post, and donor blood to make sure we only report somatic variants and not germline.  Or if none of that is available we will add a disclaimer to our documents saying that the variants detected may be from a donor but without adequate normal material we can not be certain.</p>
<p>Usually we have corresponding Cytogenetics reports to aid us and tell us how much of the sample we're testing is donor vs host and we can make an assumption based on variant frequency as well.</p>
<p>So if you were testing a patient who had a blood transfusion, yes the blood would carry DNA from both the host and donor depending on what type of transfusion it was. And 100% it will carry donor DNA if it was a marrow transplant. However, if you're testing say, skin or liver or lung, the donor material will be at a very low VF, but possibly can still be present if there is alot of blood in the sample. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
