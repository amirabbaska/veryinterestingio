		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's something called the &quot;LD50 value&quot;, which is how much of something you can drink before you have a 50/50 chance of dying from it. For alcohol, it's about 5-8 g per kilogram of human weight. For 185 lb (= 84 kg), that's about 420-670 g of pure ethanol. Basically, an entire pint of pure ethanol.</p>
<p>So if you had something that was 10% alcohol (lower end for wine), you'd need to drink 10 pints of it in a short period of time to have a 50/50 chance of death. For something that's 5% alcohol (lower end for beer), you'd need to rapidly drink 20 pints.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on tolerance, stomach contents, alcohol consumed over time etc. Recently there was a man that died after necking two pints of gin.  Generally accounts of people drinking themselves to death (discounting long-term alcoholism and the complications that arise with that) are from high ABV spirits drunk over a short period of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>0.40% blood alcohol concentration (BAC) is the low range for meaningful risk for coma or death by respiratory failure are estimated.
0.50% BAC is where death is more likely.</p>
<p>For a 180 pound person without odd metabolic or medical issues, it would take 24 shots within 1 hour to get over 0.50% BAC and have a significant risk of death or coma.</p>
<p>However, high tolerance has allowed several cases where people reached higher BAC levels, including <a href="https://guardianinterlock.com/blog/highest-blood-alcohol-concentration-ever-recorded/" target="_blank">the highest ever recorded at 1.48% BAC</a> but that's at the extreme margins. Also, different measurement mechanisms give different results: police breath or blood tests will actually measure lower than hospital blood tests because of different assumptions in calculating BAC (for example, partition ratios of 1:1400 to 1:2100 give widely different results). </p>
<p>One of the advantages of alcohol is that most people will pass out long before they reach these levels. Short of remarkable tolerance from years of hard drinking or drinking loads of shots in a very short period of time it's hard to drink that much. </p>
<p>But ask something harder, like a retrograde extrapolation hypothetical!</p>
<p>For clarity: </p>
<ul>
<li>1 shot = 1.5 oz of 80 proof liquor </li>
<li>1 glass of wine = 5 oz of 12% alcohol (24 proof)</li>
<li>1 beer = 12 oz of ~5% alcohol </li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just going of LD50 and a rough guess, I'd say someone chugging 40 Oz of 40% (80 proof) liquor within 5 minutes is likely to to have potential lethal dose for the person you describable. </p>
<p>That being said it's much more likely that over a period of say 6 hours said person drank 2 40Oz bottles of liquor. Usually requiring said person to be very use to the effects of alcohol in that they're physically capable of doing so. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on his physical condition, how fast he drinks it, what else he drinks, what he ate before drinking, and on whether he'll puke or not.  Genetics also play a role - some have a defective gene for the enzyme that breaks down alcohol.   </p>
<p>That said, a litre off vodka over the course of 2 hours will likely do the trick.     </p>
<p>Why do you ask - are you buying? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
