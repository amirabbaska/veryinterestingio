		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I sprayed a cockroach once and instead of running off or writhing around, it just turned around and stared at me. I sprayed it again and it didn’t move. Just kept staring at me. I had to smash the creepy fucker.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so you know how drugs are bad? Well, bug spray is like really bad drugs for bugs.
