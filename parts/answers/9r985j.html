For example if you find a fossil or particular mineral can a spectral analysis or something else directly yield information about the age or are we missing some variables in the equations because we don't know enough about mars right now?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What is the greatest challenge your company faces in finding life on Mars and elsewhere in our solar system? How can we use what we learn on Mars to investigate some of our more promising moons, such as Europa? There will surely be different challenges </p>
<p>Thank you again for doing this AMA. This is a very exciting topic!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you square having the SETI Institute (SETI = Search for Extra Terrestrial <strong>Intelligence</strong>) involved in searching Mars for life? Given what we can see of Mars today,  evidence for life on Mars is going to be microbial , best case. Aren't  you exceeding your mission brief? How does searching for primative life on Mars help direct the goal of searching for Intelligence in the universe?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
