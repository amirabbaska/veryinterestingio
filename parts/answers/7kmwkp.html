		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's difficult to be positive since it's difficult to separate shivering from other things the body does. For example, to raise the body core temperature blood flow to the extremities decreases, which decreases heat loss, but doesn't affect heat generation like shivering does. In <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/7862795_Cold-induced_heat_production_preceding_shivering" target="_blank">one study I found</a> it appears that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Normal heat production, while stationary = ~60W</li>
<li>Increased heat production, when cold, without shivering = + 15-20W</li>
<li>Increased heat production due to shivering = + 10-15W</li>
</ul>
<p>Another <a href="https://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/02/05/shivering-as-a-form-of-exercise/?_r=0" target="_blank">study</a> (that's a link to pretty good article about it, not the actual study) suggests that shivering will also stimulate the production of brown fat, which is very good at producing heat, which should increase the amount of non-shivering heating that is possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
