		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are suggesting tons of alternatives to your problem, but not actually answering the question. Here's why:</p>
<p>Youtube has a bunch of different product and engineering teams. Some work on the mobile app, and some work on the desktop/mobile web product. YouTube, most likely, gets different usage on both of these platforms, so the amount of engineers assigned to each of these platforms (in order to make updates on each of these) vary based on said usage.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are also &quot;endless&quot; amounts of fixes and feature improvements YouTube can make at any given time. As a result, these bug fixes and feature improvements need to be &quot;prioritized&quot; (i.e., ordered by priority) since YouTube doesn't have &quot;endless&quot; engineers to work on them. The feature of a &quot;minimized&quot; player on the web/mobile web platform of YouTube probably hasn't been prioritized for various reasons:</p>
<p>1) It's probably not that big of a use case, especially given all the alternatives people have mentioned in this thread</p>
<p>2) there are other important features/bugs the team needs to work on before implementing something like this.</p>
