I believe it is worth quoting at length the conclusion of the following recent study (<a href="http://pm22100.net/docs/pdf/enercoop/energie/gaz/130316_Methane_Hydrates_and_Contemporary_Climate_Change.pdf" target="_blank">Ruppel, C. D. (2011) Methane Hydrates and Contemporary Climate Change. Nature
Education Knowledge 3(10):29</a>):</p>
<p><em>Catastrophic, widespread dissociation of methane gas hydrates</em> <strong>will not be triggered by continued climate warming at contemporary rates</strong> <em>(0.2ÂºC per decade; IPCC 2007) over timescales of a few hundred years. Most of Earth's gas hydrates occur at low saturations and in sediments at such great depths below the seafloor or onshore permafrost that they will barely be affected by warming over even 103 yr. Even when CH4 is liberated from gas hydrates, oxidative and physical processes may greatly reduce the amount that reaches the atmosphere as CH4. The CO2 produced by oxidation of CH4 released from dissociating gas hydrates will likely have a greater impact on the Earth system (e.g., on ocean chemistry and atmospheric CO2 concentrations; Archer et al. 2009) than will the CH4 that remains after passing through various sinks.</em></p>
<p>That being said, it appears that there might indeed be a <em>localized</em> increase in clathrate destabilisation in some specific settings such as the relatively shallow Arctic continental shelves (<em>Op. cit.</em>), but the rate and actual scale of this phenomenon, as well as what actually happens to the released gasses (does it remain in solution? does it get degraded by microbes?), remains to be determined.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's worth pointing out that very rapid climate warming have occurred before (at the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Dryas" target="_blank">Younger Dryas</a>, most recently), and while those events did see big <a href="http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n5/fig_tab/ngeo1140_F1.html" target="_blank">changes in atmospheric methane</a>, they probably did <em>not</em> trigger major extinction events.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm a Ph.D. student working in the field of gas hydrates. I work with methane hydrates in looking at how they form and how we can inhibit their formation.</p>
<p>Gas hydrates formation is a crystallization process and as such, has a <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b4/Methane_Hydrate_phase_diagram.jpg" target="_blank">thermodynamic equilibrium line</a>. If your system has high pressure or low temperature, driving your operating condition on the region promoting gas hydrate formation, they will form at nucleation sites. This graph however is on a pure water-methane system and the ocean contains a plethora of other gases which, when combined into your system, will have a different equilibrium curve. </p>
<p>However, whatever that curve may be, an increase in temperature will lower the driving force of hydrate formation and if the temperature rises sufficiently to be above the thermodynamic equilibrium, the hydrate will melt and release the gases within. These gases rise above the sea level and reach the atmosphere where they act as greenhouse gases and further accelerate global warming. This is a feed positive system where temperature increase drives the increase in temperature to accelerate.</p>
<p>Things are already getting quite bad. The rate of release of these gases is accelerating and we don't have the technology to properly contain these gases and use them for our benefit. </p>
<p>The permafrost region and ocean beds are riddled (sorry for the non scientific language) with gas <a href="https://alfinnextlevel.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/energy_from_ice.jpg" target="_blank">hydrate banks</a>. Estimates put the amount of gas from hydrates at 3 times as much as commercially exploited reserves in the form of natural gas, oil, and coal, combined. Unless the hydrate system is further studied and better understood, the release in methane will only further increase. </p>
<p>Fun fact: Scientists lit a cave of natural gas on fire in 1971 expecting it to only burn for a few days; it still burns till this day. it has been nicknamed &quot;<a href="http://i.huffpost.com/gen/1473692/images/o-DOORTOHELL1-facebook.jpg" target="_blank">The Door to Hell</a>&quot;</p>
<p>I can do an science AMA on this topic with more detailed answers if the interest is present!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
