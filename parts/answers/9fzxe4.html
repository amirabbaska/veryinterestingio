		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there's a landing page that automatically redirects you to the page you see.  so when you click back your browser is momentarily at the landing page again and gets forwarded back to the same page.</p>
<p>sometimes you can counteract that by clicking back a few times rapidly (then you go &quot;backwards&quot; from the landing page to Google before it's able to redirect you again)</p>
<p>to counter this some websites redirect you several times before you see a page, which makes it much harder to get back to where you were just using the back button.  finding where you were in your browser history and clicking that will still work fine though</p>
<p><em>edit: or, as many have pointed out, right click the back button and select where you want to go back to</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Web developer here.  There are a few ways this can be done. </p>
<hr />
<p>You may notice sometimes that there is a <code>#</code> symbol somewhere in the URL (web page address at the top of your web browser).  In this context, it's known as an anchor.  It's native functionality is to jump to a certain spot on a page.  You may see this used on tables of contents, where the index at the top has links that cause the scroll position where the corresponding contents begin.</p>
<p>Super meta example of this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_contents" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_contents</a> (desktop viewing required) </p>
<p>Notice when you click on a link in the index, it jumps a spot lower down and URL contains <code>#something</code> at the end.  Also take note that the scrollbar has moved and it has not loaded a new page.  When you click the [back] button in your browser, it will return you to the table of contents. </p>
<p>Browsers consider anchor links to be their own entry in the history record.  So, when you go [back], it returns you to the previous state  It will continue recording any number of anchor links clicked or entered consecutively as another state. </p>
<p>Nasty websites can use this behavior to seemingly trap you into staying on their website by programmatically manipulating anchors; basically, simulating clicks on numerous anchors consecutively so that the browser &quot;thinks&quot; its going back through the history of anchors you clicked. </p>
<hr />
<p>There are other ways this can be done.  Javascript is the programming language that implements dynamic functionality on a web page.  There are built-in methods for manipulating and capturing the history state that are very useful for dynamic pages, but can be used to trap users a black hole of back-clicks. </p>
<p>There are a number of other ways this could be done with Javascript, like capturing keyboard inputs and rerouting their behavior, opening modal elements (things that block everything else until they are dismissed) that recursively reopen themselves when dismissed, or overflowing execution (making a browser do too much at once and causing it to freeze).</p>
<hr />
<p>tl;dr programming good.  mean programmers be mean.</p>
