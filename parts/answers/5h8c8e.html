		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an analogy that would explain the process and tipping point for a 5-year-old: </p>
<p>Imagine the climate of the earth is a huge, complicated, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=rube+goldberg+machines&amp;safe=active&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjpgu-J2OXQAhVW9mMKHdK9CTQQ_AUICSgC&amp;biw=1152&amp;bih=621" target="_blank">Mouse Trap Game/Rube Goldberg Machine</a> designed to water your plants, feed your pet fish and hamsters and turn your thermostat up and down so the room stays a comfortable temperature. </p>
<p>Now imagine the whole machine is powered by the heat from burning candles, like one of those <a href="https://www.google.com/search?safe=active&amp;biw=1152&amp;bih=621&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=1&amp;q=german+christmas+pyramid&amp;oq=german+christmas+pyramid&amp;gs_l=img.3..0l3j0i24k1l7.808744.814281.0.814458.24.11.0.13.13.0.164.1305.0j11.11.0....0...1c.1.64.img..0.24.1364...0i67k1.HBfHF_78BFI#imgrc=_" target="_blank">German Christmas toys</a>.</p>
<p>The whole intricate system is running beautifully, your plants and pets are thriving and the room is nice and comfy. It's like this most of your life.</p>
<p>But one day, one of the candles gets blown out, so the machine starts to malfunction. Maybe the plants don't get watered as often and the pets don't get fed so often. You don't really notice because the machine has always worked, and even though the room doesn't always feel <em>quite</em> as comfortable as it used to, you chalk it up to other reasons like what you cooked or hormones or something. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, since the hamsters aren't getting fed as often, their energy level is off, and since the hamster wheel was powering the part of the machine that replaces candles, another candle goes out and now the machine really isn't working well. </p>
<p>The fish aren't getting fed, the plants are wilting noticeably and the hamsters are entirely inactive. On top of this, the room is getting uncomfortably warm because the machine can no longer adjust the thermostat properly and now the few candles that remain lit are melting just because the room is so damn hot. Soon the machine isn't working at all and you're busy putting out the small fires that have started from the melted candles.</p>
<p>Some little cactus plants survive and there are no doubt microorganisms eating your dead fish and hamsters, and live mold is growing too and some flies have gathered. So life hasn't been wiped out entirely. It's just a different form life that's thriving because of the new, unintended environment.</p>
<p>You try to fix the machine, but can't because you're <em>not the one who built it</em> and it's really complicated. Intricacies upon intricacies down to the microscopic level. Fixing it is completely beyond your pay scale. So now this place you lived your entire life in is uncomfortably hot, has bugs and mold and a funky smell. You can't live there anymore, so you pack up your things to move to a new place. </p>
<p>When you open the door to leave, there is nothing there but an inconceivably vast and dark expanse that has no oxygen or heat. There is nowhere else you can go. </p>
<p>EDIT: Some people have PM'd me that they like this analogy enough to share it with younger folks. But this analogy doesn't leave room for a solution, which is really depressing, so here's more:</p>
<p>At this moment, we're at the point where the second candle has <em>just</em> gone out. The hamsters are still fairly active, the fish are still swimming and only the most sensitive plants are showing signs of wilt. You still aren't paying much attention, but you <em>are</em> noticing a strange noise you haven't heard before. You search for the source of the noise and it's a phone.</p>
<p>On the other end of the phone is a person telling you something is <em>very</em> wrong with your machine. They tell you your pets and plants are dying and if you don't do something <em>now</em> you won't be able to save them. (You look over at your pets and plants and they seem fine.)</p>
<p>This person says there's a <a href="https://youtu.be/KhoXFVQsIxw?t=1m17s" target="_blank">huge team of top scientists working hard</a> around the clock to find a work-around to the malfunction, but he needs you to buy them some time by <a href="https://youtu.be/KhoXFVQsIxw?t=28s" target="_blank"><em>changing the way you live</em></a>. Everything he says you have to change is incredibly inconvenient, not as comfortable and he's even telling you to stop doing some of your favorite things-- forever. </p>
<p>If you follow his instructions, your life will never be the same, but you will adapt and live out your days in the company of your beloved hamster, colorful fish and flowering plant. There's even a chance that the scientists will call back in your lifetime and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zm5nUEG5Bjo" target="_blank">talk you through a way to patch the machine</a> so it's functional again. </p>
<p>If you don't follow his instructions, one day soon the other candles will melt and it will be too much damage for the scientists to fix.</p>
<p>This is the moment we're at today. The scientists have made the call and are working furiously to sequester carbon, find new viable and sustainable energy sources and perhaps even repair the damage to the environment. Even though they're incredibly talented, they still aren't the one who built the machine, so they won't have a solution for a while. They're asking us to change the way we live to buy them some time.</p>
<p>I hope this edit mitigates some of the gloom of the original ending. Candidly, I'm not sure how many candles have gone out. I'm really hoping the scientists can help us and that enough of us change the way we live to buy those scientists the time they desperately need.</p>
<p>PS. Thanks for the gold.
PPS. Realized in this edit that the movie Apollo 13 is an incredibly good analogy for the balance between society/scientists in solving the climate crisis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the last 650k years, Earth has gone through 7 periods of glacial advance and retreat. The last was 7k years ago, marking the end of the Ice Age.</p>
<p>CO2 was demonstrated to trap heat in the mid 19th century. In the course of the last 650k years, Earth atmospheric CO2 levels has never been above 300ppm, and we know that through mineral deposits, fossils, and arctic ice leaving telltale predictable signs of how much CO2 must have been in the air at the time. Today, CO2 is over 400ppm. Not only have we kept fantastic records pre-industrial revolution, especially the Swedes for centuries, but arctic ice has acted as a more recent history of the last several dozen centuries. CO2 levels has been growing at unprecedented rates and achieving levels higher than we've ever known to occur that wasn't in the wake of planetary disaster and mass extinction. It follows that if CO2 traps heat, and there's more CO2 in the atmosphere than ever before, it's going to trap more heat than ever before.</p>
<p>Sea levels are rising. 17cm over the last century. The last decade alone has seen twice the rise of the previous century. So not only are the oceans rising, but the rate of rise is increasing <em>exponentially</em>.</p>
<p>The Earth's average temperature has increased since 1880, most of that has been in the last 35 years. 15 of the 16 hottest years have been since 2001. We're in a period of solar decline, where the output of the sun cycles every 11 or so years. Despite the sun putting out less energy, the average continues to rise and in 2015 the Earth's average was 1C hotter on average than in 1890. That doesn't sound like much, but if we go some 0.7C hotter, we'll match the age of the dinosaurs when the whole planet was a tropical jungle. That's not a good thing.</p>
<p>The ice caps are losing mass. While we've seen cycles of recession and growth, you have to consider ice is more than area, it's also thickness and density. Yes, we've seen big sheets of ice form, but A) they didn't stay, and B) how thick were they? Greenland has lost 60 cubic miles of ice and Antarctica has lost at least 30 cubic miles, both in the last decade. Greenland is not denying global warming, they're feverishly building ports to poise themselves as one of the most valuable ocean trading hubs in the world as the northern pass is opening, and it's projected you'll be able to sail across the north pole, a place you can currently stand, year-round.</p>
<p>Glacier ice is retreating all over the world, in the Alps, Himalayas, Andes, Rockies, Alaska and Africa.</p>
<p>The number of unprecedented intense weather events has been increasing since 1950 in the US. The number of record highs has been increasing, and record lows decreasing.</p>
<p>The ocean absorbs CO2 from the atmosphere. CO2 and water makes carbonic acid, - seltzer water! The oceans are 30% more acidic since the industrial revolution. 93% of The Great Barrier Reef has been bleeched and 22% and rising is dead as a consequence. The ocean currently absorbs 9.3 billion tons of CO2 a year and is currently absorbing an additional 2 billion tons annually. Not because the ocean is suddenly getting better at it, but because there's more saturation in the atmosphere.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to assume you're at the center of mass for most &quot;skeptics:&quot; i.e. the planet is definitely getting warmer, but humans aren't the cause.</p>
<p><strong>ELI5 version:</strong></p>
<p>Why is it so warm and cozy under your blankets in the morning? If you take your temperature before and after you get out of bed, is it any different? So if <em>you</em> aren't any hotter, why is the air under your blankets so warm?</p>
<p>In order to warm up the air, you need energy to come from somewhere. If you don't have electric blankets, the energy doesn't come from there. Your temperature isn't any different, so you aren't making any more energy than normal. If energy isn't coming <em>from</em> anywhere, than the only explanation is that less energy is <em>leaving</em>. The earth's atmosphere works in the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Slightly more advanced version.</strong> </p>
<p>I'm assuming that we've established that Earth has been getting hotter, as that is where most of the populace seems to be sitting. So...</p>
<p>Premise 1: surface temperatures of Earth are increasing.</p>
<p>Premise 2: There are only three possibilities to explain this:</p>
<ol>
<li>More energy is entering Earth</li>
<li>Energy is moving from somewhere else on Earth to the surface</li>
<li>Less energy is leaving Earth</li>
</ol>
<p>Possibility 1 used to be very popular, with its proponents claiming that solar activity was increasing, thus increasing the amount of energy entering Earth. This was bolstered by a slight increase in sunspot activity going into the 90's. <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/solar-activity-sunspots-global-warming.htm" target="_blank">The trend has since reversed</a>. Since the sun is, for all intents and purposes, the only energy source of our planet, this establishes pretty well that 1 is not possible.</p>
<ol>
<li><del>More energy is entering Earth</del></li>
<li>Energy is moving from somewhere else on Earth to the surface</li>
<li>Less energy is leaving Earth</li>
</ol>
<p>This is where most skeptics sit now, with the common claim being that current climate changes are a &quot;natural cycle.&quot; Considering that the biome has changed numerous times over the course of Earth's history, this &quot;cycle&quot; can only be astronomical, geological, or oceanological in nature. We've ruled out the sun, and <a href="http://www.livescience.com/28248-deep-ocean-warming.html" target="_blank">ocean temperatures are increasing as well overall</a>, so that leaves geological. <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/topics/earth/features/earth20110309.html" target="_blank">That's been studied as well</a>, and it <a href="http://www.skepticalscience.com/heatflow.html" target="_blank">doesn't come close to explaining the energy change</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li><del>More energy is entering Earth</del></li>
<li><del>Energy is moving from somewhere else on Earth to the surface</del></li>
<li>Less energy is leaving Earth</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the definition of greenhouse gases. They build up in the atmosphere, preventing solar energy from leaving the earth, and forcing it to stay as excess heat. I have yet to see a skeptic argue that increasing greenhouse gases are <em>not</em> anthropogenic in nature.</p>
<p>There are many other levels of climate change &quot;skepticism,&quot; ranging from a ridiculous denial that things are getting hotter to a more reasonable, but still dangerous, disbelief that it will be problematic in the future. I can cover those as well, if you'd like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever opened a car door during a hot day, probably in the summer?  Notice how when you do, the inside is <em>really</em> hot?  That's because light is going through windows, but when it bounces back, it isn't all getting out.  The heat inside the car has nowhere to go either since it's not (properly) ventilated.  So it gets hotter and hotter.  The longer you leave your car in the sun, the hotter it gets.</p>
<p>Greenhouse gases are essentially the windows.  They're molecules in the air and when sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, hits something, and goes to bounce back, some of it is caught in the gases.  This means the heat stays there.  When the heat stays there, it means things are getting hot.</p>
<p>In and of itself, that's not bad.  However, small temperature increases for the <em>entire</em> world cause massive changes everywhere.  If warm winds shift to another area, this means entire weather patterns are affected.  Rainfall changes (more, or less).  If it's hot, the ice melts at the north and south poles.  When this happens, it turns to water, and that water is added to the sea.  Hence the sea rise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's how CO2 traps heat:</p>
<p>There are different types of light and humans can only see 'visible light'. Light with a shorter wavelength (like ultraviolet/UV) or a longer wavelength (like infrared) is invisible (for human eyes).</p>
<p>If light hits matter, a few things can happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>It can pass without interaction (so the thing is transparent).</li>
<li>It can get reflected (light stays exactly the same, but starts moving in another direction).</li>
<li>It can get absorbed and then emitted as fluorescent light</li>
<li>It can get absorbed, making the matter hotter.</li>
</ul>
<p>If matter has a higher temperature than absolute zero, it will always emit some light as thermal radiation. The hotter it is, the more light it emits and the shorter the average wavelength will be. Example, humans emit light because they are hot, however this light has a too high wavelength to see with your eyes. But if you use an infra-red camera, you can see this light. Another example: molten iron and other metals are really hot. So hot that they even emit thermal radiation with a short enough wavelength that it's visible to humans.</p>
<p>The same happens with earth, if sunlight hits it, some gets reflected back (not changing the temperature), and some gets absorbed (making the earth hotter). The earth also emits a lot of invisible infrared light from being hot (thermal radiation).</p>
<p>Sunlight is a mix of all kinds of light. If it goes towards earth, first it has to pass the atmosphere a first time, then some gets reflected or re-emitted as thermal radiation, and then this light has to pass the atmosphere again to leave earth.</p>
<p>The more light that gets absorbed by the earth or the atmosphere, the hotter the planet gets. The more light that leaves earth again, the colder the planet gets.</p>
<p>What CO2 does is absorbing infrared light really well. If there's a lot of CO2 in the atmosphere, this thermal radiation that the earth emits, gets absorbed by the atmosphere and will not leave the earth. Because more energy stays on earth and in the atmosphere, the earth gets hotter when there's more CO2.</p>
<p>Humans have put more and more CO2 in the atmosphere, so more energy stays on earth and does not leave the planet, so more energy stays in and the earth gets hotter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
