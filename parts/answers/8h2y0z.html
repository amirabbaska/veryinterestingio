		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flowering plants and pollinating insects, such as bees, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096098221300256X" target="_blank">co-evolved somewhen between 140-110 million years ago</a>.</p>
<p>There are several different main categories of large plant, gymnosperms and angiosperms.  Gymnosperms came before angiosperms and are &quot;non-flowering&quot;  they include conifers, cycads, and ancient lineages such as ginkos and podocapus.  These plants generally pollinate by wind, dumping immense loads of pollen into the air and letting the wind carry it to the female receptacles on other plants, or self-pollinating in some cases.  Gymnosperms evolved around 320 million years ago, with indications that the lineage was emerging around 380 million years ago.</p>
<p>It's interesting to note that <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5954/808.full?rss=1" target="_blank">there <em>may</em> be evidence of animal pollination already taking place in gymnosperms</a> as early as 320 to 300 million years ago.  One line of evidence for this is pollen grains that appear to be too large to be wind transported.</p>
<p>Angiosperms are the flowering plants and the first true ones evolved around 160 million years ao, but split from gymnosperms long before that, around 245-200 million years go.  Flowering plants didn't become widespread until around 120 million years ago, which is right when we see the evidence of co-evolution in the first research paper linked above.  This suggests that the pairing of insect pollinators with flowering plants was vital to their success in spreading across the planet.</p>
<p>That still leaves a gap of some 40 million years, but there is evidence to suggest that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260766/" target="_blank"><em>Lichnomesopsyche gloriae</em> fly had already adapted to drink nutritious 'ovulate fluids'</a> from gymnosperm reproductive organs (can't really call it nectar since they're not technically flowers) and made an easy switch over to angiosperms when they evolved 160 million years ago.  So, from the very beginning it appears that there was a potential insect pollinator waiting in the wings to take advantage of a new niche, possibly many different ones.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that despite insects being the most well known pollinators (not just bees, but flies, mosquitoes, beetles, moths, butterflies, etc, etc) many <em>other</em> animals also pollinate flowers, including birds, bats, monkeys, marsupials, lemurs, bears, rabbits, deer, rodents, and, importantly for this discussion, reptiles.</p>
<p>Lizards, especially <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0028825X.1987.10410078" target="_blank">geckos and skinks can play an important role in pollinating plants</a>.  This is seen in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3241579/" target="_blank">various places around the world</a>.  This suggests there were certainly other animal pollination vectors potentially available for early flowering plants, especially if some of these non-arthropod animals were already taking advantage of the nutrients available in gymnosperm reproductive bodies.</p>
<p>And there is, of course, still wind pollination and self pollination, but it seems that <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169534702025405" target="_blank">wind pollination for flowering plants may have evolved after animal pollination</a>.  Wind pollination requires both wind and a relatively dry climate, part of the reason why it's not seen very often in wet tropical forests.</p>
<p>TL/DR:  there were already species pre-adapted to pollinate flowering plants when they evolved and there was a rapid co-evolution of flowing plants and insect pollinators, as well as potential non-insect pollinators present.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way that plants get pollinated is based largely on the type of plant and the ecosystem. </p>
<p>There are types of plants that can pollinate themselves or use the wind to carry their pollen to other plants. In the same vein, there  are other insects that can pollinate plants other than bees, but again this depends on the ecosystem. </p>
<p>Honey bees themselves are a little percentage of pollinator insects. As a matter of fact, they are actually an invasive species that intrude on the other pollinators. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Initially most plants either basically copyed itself like grass. or put massive amounts of pollen in the air. But over millennia plants slowly evolved to use animals to help them reproduce, either through hitchhiking (seeds with spikes to stick to fur) or pollination. </p>
<p>Eventually those that cloned themselves lost prevalence as disease is easily transmitted by genetically indistinct plants and often a single infection can wipe out a species. And without rapid entropic transportation they dominate only a single area they are adapted for and exclusively for. </p>
<p>Those that spread pollen on the wind have to use massive amounts of energy to create large amounts of pollen otherwise there is almost no chance of reproduction as wind is chaotic and can sometimes be slow for weeks. And to do this they must go through cycles of storing energy, growing going dormant, spreading pollen
Using remanding energy to grow and regain their leaves. The use of sexual reproduction allows for greater distance traveled and because the plants are farther away they are less related and create greater genetically diverse offspring but require routine weather they have evolved to work with and a sudden change can ruin their lifecycle.</p>
<p>A few spicies of plants had a animal take a liking to them (often for food) but in the process carry the pollen to hopefully another of the plant. These plants slowly evolved to create less pollen and instead put more sugar into their nectar to attack insects as these animals as small enough to notice and access the nectar but fast enough to travel great distances  and because the bugs were small they didnâ€™t kill the plants.</p>
<p>Centuries later Europeans brought bees around the world as they use the nectar to create honey that lasts and is more nutrient dense than raw nectar useful for rearing young that happens to be edible for humans. Eventually we helped bee colonies to grow and overtake the numerous pollenating insects leading to the initial lack of genetic diversity that caused asexual reproducers to lose prevalence!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of early plants, such as ferns, don't need flowers to reproduce, and use spores. Many plants also clone themselves and drop &quot;baby&quot; plants beneath them. Sometimes roots and stems can break off and grow new plants. Sometimes they send out vines that take root somewhere else. And as others said, even for flowering plants, anything that contacts both flowers can pollinate it. Heck, some flowers self-pollinate!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An excellent question.  Thank you for asking.  Wind pollination, for starters, which is how non-angiosperms (ferns and gymnosperms, ie cycads, pines, cypress trees) tend to be pollinated.  At least among vascular plants.  Many mosses, as I understand it, tend to rely on water droplets to get their spores from one sex to the other.  But a number of plants are self fertile.</p>
<p>It's actually probable that the flowers evolved first.  It's important to note that many don't attract bees at all: one of the the most basal angiosperms, so basal it's neither a monocot or a dicot, Magnolia, attract carrion beetles as pollinators by smelling [to them] like rotting meat, a tactic used by a number of other plant families, too.  However, showier flowers tend to attract a wider diversity of pollinators, like bees, flies, butterflies, moths, or even bats.  Some flowers have developed nectaries to further encourage pollinators to come down.  A little weed that pops up in North America, <em>Linaria canadensis</em>, Canadian Toad Flax, dusts the head of pollinators that land on its petals.  A personal favorite flower, the Bee Orchid is self fertile (and prefers to reproduce that way), but its flowers often attracts male bees in overlapping territories by emitting scents that smell like a female bee's pheromones -- the bee gets tricked with a pseudo-sexual reward, but it's another way of attract pollinators.</p>
<p>Bees, though, seem to have evolved from wasps that got a taste for nectar.  They and other things were already attracted to the flower, but the nectaries drove the evolution of an entire lineage of specialized pollinators.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
