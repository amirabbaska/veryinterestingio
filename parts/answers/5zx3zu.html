Adjusted for inflation, their education cost very little, they bought homes for 1/3rd of the cost, and set up social services that benefit them, but are paid for by the generations that followed.  Everyone from Gen X forward has been starting life in progressively more debt.  </p>
<p>The hate comes from that generation telling the next generations that they too can have the dream if only they work harder despite these generations working more than they did.  </p>
<p>It is misplaced anger.  In many ways the boomers created a better life for everyone.  The villains are the top few of every generation who are dismantling the middle class.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to explain this is that they sacrificed the future at the alter of their comfort.  I cannot think of another generation in history that had as much power so young and the opportunity to actually change the entire world in a meaningful way.  Think about it - they actually had enough clout to get Congress to amend the Constitution to lower the voting age!  Can you imagine millennials trying to get an amendment to say, stem climate change passed?  Instead, the hippies of the 60s became the coke dealers of the 70s, junk bond dealers of the 80s, internet bubble chiefs of the 90s and finally, reaching the height of their power, destroyed the economy in the 00's. They traded idealistic action and power for home shopping and drone strikes.  Plugging their ears against the onslaught of messages telling them they are dooming their children and grandchildren to a life of fewer opportunities and perhaps catastrophic consequences, they persisted in short term gains.  Now at the end of their time in power they are politically taking their ball and going home. </p>
<p>Their parents (the WWII generation) ensured they would live in a prosperous, strong place.  They saw war for what it was and did everything they could to ensure those horrors would not come back to the world.  They used their power for science, for the arts, for education,for the good of all mankind. You know, the things the boomers said &quot;well, we got ours, fuck the rest&quot; to.  </p>
<p>They speak of how younger generations are &quot;entitled&quot;, fully aware that the economy they grew up in was stronger, the cost of living was less, the wages were higher, the education cheaper, the housing more affordable.  It's a lie.  It's them trying to shift blame for their actions by blaming someone else.  It's the tactic used to those who come to the end of the line and still don't want to own up to what they have created.</p>
<p>I know many are not like this.  But the fact is that they voted in all the power that allowed it to happen this way.  So yes, I lay most of the problems future generations to come will have at their feet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think part of it is also this lack of self-awareness around the Boomer generation. They see the problems, but cannot see that they are part of it. The following is a sweeping generalization. Individual results may vary.</p>
<p>They put in place the education system that allows for standardized testing to rule education. They are the teachers, the administrators, the voters, that put the systems in place that educated those of us born between 1980-1995. But they call the following generations lazy, entitled, self-congratulatory. &quot;Special snowflakes.&quot; Etc. We all had to succeed or they would cut funding to schools.</p>
<p>They voted in administrations that started bank de-regulation. While they were busy patting themselves on the back for Civil Rights, they allowed Wall Street to sneak into government. And then they blamed the Clinton/Bush era for the Wall Street debacles. Not saying the blame rests solely in the 70-80s, but they seem to forget who they allowed into office, and what they allowed them to do. Corruption cannot seep in unless someone has poked the holes for it.</p>
<p>They won't retire. Not can't, won't. The natural cycle of employment has stuttered with Boomers holding onto jobs way past the age of retirement. But the poor job economy is Clinton's fault, Bush's fault, Obama's fault.</p>
<p>They won't invest in future generations. They resist change. While they spearheaded great efforts to help their own situations - voting age, drafting, Vietnam, Medicare (for them) - they forgot to plant seeds for the rest of us. Now that we are trying to improve our situation - immigrant students, LGBTQ rights, climate change research and action, food insecurity, failing infrastructure, a struggling economy, an antiquated economy, a housing market gone amuck - now they resist. They vote, in droves, to prevent having to spend their tax money on current or future programs.</p>
<p>&quot;What is a legacy? It's planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.&quot; - They went to our garden, planted nothing, pissed on it and told us it was raining, and then asked why we didn't grow.</p>
<p>BUT - the Boomer generation VOTES. That's why they continue to have the power they have and fuck us over. We need to VOTE. Small elections, special elections, location elections.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their parents were called &quot;The Greatest Generation&quot; but I like to call Baby Boomers &quot;The Luckiest Generation&quot;.</p>
<p>Baby Boomers are essentially the start of the modern day America as a concept and practice.  The idea of a good job, good house, good healthcare, good retirement, 2.5 kids, 2 cars in the garage, and a nice TV.</p>
<p>You can have it all!</p>
<p>And your voice can be heard.  You can be a modern day consumer.  You can have stuff and the life and the best healthcare... etc.  And its not all that hard to get as long as you just &quot;work hard&quot;.</p>
<p>Best part is the kids can have it too!  ... except we most definitely aren't.</p>
<p>A lot of what is considered and what made &quot;Modern America&quot; starts in the industrial revolution and mostly stopped evolving in the 80's.  Realistically not much has changed since then:</p>
<p>-Medicine may be better but the idea of a healthy lifestyle really is nothing new now.  And the idea that medicine will make life better is decades old.</p>
<p>-Social Media is new but all it REALLY is is the instantaneous communication of ideas and the democratization of that.  Decades ago ideas, news, etc. could be instantly shared around the globe via TV, radio, telephone, etc. and be mass consumed.  Interesting note here is that the phones we use now are built soley on the refinement of decades old technology.  GPS, touchscreen, cameras, LCD, internet, wifi... all decades old.</p>
<p>-Cars may be cleaner but they have been around for quite a while now.  Getting better and fancier, and pushes for emissions and efficiency have been around since the 70's.  Just look at the 70's gas crisis, Leaded gas, catalytic converters, etc.  For safety... Ralph Nader, and the wheel speed sensory.  The list goes on.</p>
<p>-Social Rights may be gaining a lot more traction than ever (a good thing) but social movements and protests are nothing new.  Been going on for a long long time.</p>
<p>I'm rambling a bit but suffice to say that the only big thing that has come about since the Baby Boomers had kids was the internet.  And the baby boomers gave us that.  So this means that the Baby Boomers either were born with certain concepts of America in place or they shaped and changed them directly.  And they did a LOT of that so that  much of our world is directly influenced and made by them.  And that is modern day America!</p>
<p>We are paying now for all of that prosperity they got to have.  So much borrowing against future generations.  Whether it be the environment or economy.  They really got it easy in a lot of ways.  The cost to entry to a middle class life now is much higher than it used to be.  And that class is disappearing.  But then again the middle class of America didn't come about til the boomers were born so there is that factor as well.  So they grew up with the idea, in the midst of, became, and the essentially drove the middle class as we know it today.</p>
<p>I could literally type for hours as the &quot;Baby Boomers vs later generations&quot; argument is one of my favorites... But let me bring up the 2 things I hate the most:  Corporations and Investment Banking (Wall Street).  The boomers took corporations and turned them into machines of capital generation through innovation and deregulation.  But ultimately corporations are only &quot;responsible&quot; to only the boardroom and the investors.  And they are the only ones who make any money.  And since they are so woven into society now, no one knows how to stop this... or they are very afraid to.  That boardroom is the head and will gut itself to keep the head alive.   So goodbye quality products and employees if you put any pressure on a corporation via taxes.  All the while they just keep exclaiming how they are &quot;the backbone of the economy&quot; or some such BS for what all they actually do for us.</p>
<p>And then Investment Banking.  I remember from school learning when I was 9 the idea that you put your money in savings and it generates interest!  Now that's just silly.  Simple banking is only for the poor and uneducated now.  Now its hedge funds, mutual funds, stock market... whatever!!  Literally through deregulation and some good creativity we have entire BS money markets that the boomers came up with to get rich or to invest for retirement!  We literally have this idea now that money gets created in mass quantities out of nothing and its mainly just BS and a LOT of risk.  Just look at the housing crisis and recession.  Its all just made up money and bullshit.  At least when you make something there is a tangible product to it.  But now?  That's the new norm and VAST quantities of everyone's money is tied into that working.  Mainly boomers like it for their retirement accounts.  But at this point anyone who can afford to buy into some investment wants it to pay off.  Its easy free money.  And it just doesn't really work that well in the long run.</p>
<p>You can debate a lot of this back and forth but ultimately the boomers loved the idea of retiring at 65 and living comfortably and healthily.  Sadly its just NOT TRUE.  Society can't afford to have people living that long while doing nothing.  And to generate the capital needed to afford &quot;that sweet retirement life&quot; while working only so long requires a lot of gambits, risks, and making future generations buy into a system that just wont work.  Between BS investment banking, and social entitlements like medicare, medicaide, social security, government pensions, etc...</p>
<p>Well we are just stuck with a system that doesn't work now thanks to the Boomers.  Go to a good school, work hard, get a job, work hard, get a house, work hard, get a family, work hard, retire on what you've earned at 65-70... its all just a system that doesn't work.</p>
<p>They grew up with a lotta prosperity.  And we are left with a system that mainly benefits those that are born into money.  It doesn't even need to be a lot of money!  But what matters more now is what your economic factors growing up are than how &quot;hard&quot; you work.  If you want to find the American dream go to Canada.  Its actually easier to get ahead there than it is in the US.</p>
<p>That said most of our parents are boomers and we still love them.  and many boomers are NOT doing so good.  So no need to run around hating them personally or anything dumb.  Ultimately we are all born, we all meet the same fate and die, and we are all in this together. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baby boomers were born into an era of unprecedented prosperity: cheap college educations, tons of well paid blue and white collar jobs, cheap homes, etc. They also spent the last 40 years squeezing every penny they could from the government: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>tax breaks during their prime working years</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>massive government deficit spending to keep the economy afloat</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>crazy low interest rates so they could buy huge houses and watch the values of their homes skyrocket</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cheap gas prices so they could drive huge trucks and SUVs</p>
</li>
<li>short term fixes for Social Security and Medicare designed to cover themselves and not much else</li>
</ul>
<p>Then after all of this, they have the gall to blame GenX and mostly Millenials for the bad economy we've inherited FROM THEM. They also take every chance to pat themselves on the back for creating &quot;the best music&quot; or for driving the cultural changes of the 60s and 70s, etc. They are a generation who couldn't keep their hands out of their kids and grandkids piggy bank, greedily borrowing more and more benefits today, knowing their kids and grandkids would have to foot the bill someday, yet still blaming younger generations for their lack of opportunities and wealth.</p>
<p>Fuck the baby boomers</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
