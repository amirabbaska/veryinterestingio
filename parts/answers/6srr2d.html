		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could I add a sub-question? How do countries know when a missile has been launched by another country? Are they always watching via satellite? Surely their radar doesn't cover everywhere? Also, do they have missiles that can change direction mid flight to confuse the intended target?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normally they tell the other country they are launching a missile.<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norwegian_rocket_incident" target="_blank">Though sometimes they forget and there's a bit of a nuclear scare</a>.<br />
So far this hasn't torched off a nuclear war because most tests are just 1 rocket.<br />
And a full first strike would involve hundreds of rockets.<br />
Also the missile might not be headed in the direction of anything of value.<br />
If the choice was potentially starting a nuclear war on accident or losing an uninhabited island in the middle of the pacific that you technically own, most people pick the latter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, you can calculate the trajectory of the missile to determine where it will land - A test launch won't be aimed at another country.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that any attack is likely to involve lots of missiles being launched simultaneously, seeing just one on radar is definitely cause for doubt that it's an intentional attack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically a test is anouncwd via an international NOTAM: Notice To Airman.</p>
<p>When a launch is detected without a NOTAM, all hell breaks loose to track where it's going. Once that's determined then decissions are made made based on the preliminary trajectory.</p>
<p>Needless to say, getting it right, with typically no more than 20 minutes of time to decide, is the money shot!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
