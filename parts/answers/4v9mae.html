		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lot of answers on here that are close to right but often not answering the question. I'm an obstetrician in the UK and hopefully can help a bit.</p>
<p>First, childbirth in developed countries is pretty safe. Major complications are rare and things that kill women in developing countries tend to make you sick in developed countries rather than dead. Overall worldwide childbirth is getting safer though. More information on worldwide mortality here: <a href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs348/en/</a></p>
<p>Haemorrhage (bleeding) is the main cause of death in developing countries and the main cause of morbidity (illness) in developed countries. The main causes of bleeding are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Atonic uterus: the big vessels which supply the uterus carry about 500ml a minute by the end of pregnancy. After the baby and placenta are delivered the uterus needs to contract (it is essentially a big muscle) to stop these vessels pumping all that blood out of the body. If that doesn't happen it's bad. Most women don't bleed at 500ml/min but less than that is still pretty quick. Treatment is drugs to make uterus contract or surgical options which I'm not going to detail here. </li>
<li>Retained placenta: if all or part of the placenta is left inside then the uterus can't contract properly. See above. Removal of the retained tissue will sort this.</li>
<li>Trauma: squeezing a baby out of a vagina can be very traumatic depending on relative sizes of the parties involved and how the baby comes out. Chopping open an abdomen and then cutting open a very vascular uterus (see above) can also lead to bleeding. Repairing the trauma is the solution.</li>
<li>Clotting disorders: this is unlikely to be a primary cause of bleeding but after heavy blood loss clotting can become abnormal which worsens the situation. Replacing clotting factors and blood will help this.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other causes include infection and eclampsia although the mechanism for eclampsia is swelling of the brain rather than the uncontrolled blood pressure that some people are suggesting. It's a complex disease that isn't completely understood but we do know it's potentially very dangerous if not treated.</p>
<p>TL;DR bleeding a major cause of death and illness, uterus needs to be empty and contracted, injury from birth and abnormal clotting can also cause problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a doctor, an anaesthetist. I regularly do obstetric anaesthesia - epidurals and caesars both awake and asleep.
<strong> In a developed country, pregnancy and childbirth is very safe.</strong>
However, things can go wrong, much like everything in life. There is simply not enough time or space to provide an accurate explanation for all these here.</p>
<p>Here is a short list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bleeding</li>
<li>Infection</li>
<li>Amniotic fluid embolism</li>
<li>Peripartum cardiomyopathy</li>
<li>Pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH) and associated diagnoses of PIH with proteinuria (often referred to as preeclampsia), eclampsia</li>
<li>Abnormal placental lie (vasa praevia, placenta praevia)</li>
<li>Abnormal placental inplantation (placenta accreta, placenta increta, placenta percreta)</li>
<li>Umbilical cord prolapse</li>
<li>Uterine rupture</li>
<li>Placental abruption</li>
<li>Cephalopelvic disproportion</li>
<li>Dystocia</li>
<li>Haemorrhage</li>
</ul>
<p>Blood loss during delivery is <strong>normal</strong>. The female body has an increased red cell mass and copes quite well with up to a litre of blood loss. Usual blood loss from a vaginal delivery is 500mL. This amount is higher with caesarians as there is blood loss from the incision.</p>
<p>Obstetricians are highly trained individuals who work with a team which includes anaesthetists, midwives and oftentimes neonatologists or paediatricians.</p>
<p>I'll add here that maternal mortality in the USA is quite high and <a href="http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/93/3/14-148627/en/" target="_blank">increased from 12 to 28 per 100000 between 1990 and 2013</a>. Pretty shocking when you consider, for example, that in Australia (a similarly-developed country) this figure is around 7.1 per 100000 on average and in 2012 it was 4.4 per 100000.</p>
<p>Edit: formatting.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I am not educated enough to be able to answer every question posed. I am sorry for that but if you want an answer you deserve an accurate answer. Perhaps I will do an AMA regarding anaesthesia, although there are others out there with more subspecialty knowledge than I.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a quite a few complications that can arise before/during/after birth. A few off the top of my head: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Abruptio Placentae - this is when the placenta (sac inside the abdomen where your baby lives) detaches from the uterus (area where the placenta resides) and a large amount of blood loss can come about. Happens about 1 in 120 births. Happens prior to delivery. Small blood vessels in between the placenta and uterus can rupture and this blood begins to pool and collect and it essentially forces the placenta and uterus to tear apart from each other. Very painful. Baby doesn't make it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Placenta previa - this is when the placenta implants itself in an abnormal position over the cervix instead of around the uterine wall. The cervix is the area that is past the vagina and if you keep going you'll hit the uterus. When the baby moves about or the cervix dilates, the placenta again tears away from its plant site. Happens about 1 in 250 births. Lots of blood loss can happen. Usually not painful. I don't think the baby makes it. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ruptured uterus - the uterus will expand as baby grows up in the placenta and this thins it. Like a rubber band when you stretch it. Sometimes it gets so thin it ruptures and the placenta falls into the abdominal cavity. Mother mortality is anywhere from 5-20% and baby fatality is around 50%. Requires surgery. </p>
</li>
<li>Ectopic pregnancies. This is when the egg gets implanted outside the uterus. It should be planted inside the uterus. Usually it gets put into a Fallopian tube. The placenta will invade the surrounding tissue but won't be able to accommodate for the incorrectly positioned embryo and so it will rupture. This is the 3rd leading cause of death in maternity cases. </li>
</ol>
<p>Other - seizures or coma (eclampsia) not sure why this happens on a biological level. Supine Hypotensive Syndrome - when the fetus puts pressure on the inferior vena cava (vein returning blood to heart) this decreasing the amount of blood coming back to the heart for pumping and decreasing perfusion. Although I don't think this one is too fatal because it will get noticed. Left unchecked it could be. </p>
<p>Source: I'm an EMT so with my knowledge and a little rummaging through my textbook I got these answers. I'm sorry if I don't know the specifics on a biological level, but I thought I could give some explanation. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor, and current trainee in Obstetrics and Gynecology here. </p>
<p>I actually answered this for a friend yesterday oddly enough. </p>
<p>As the anesthetist has said there are multiple causes for death during pregnancy, and I'm assuming the higher rate in the USA is due to weight more than anything. </p>
<p>You can put these deaths in to several categories.</p>
<p>Early pregnancy deaths - Mainly ectopic pregnancies, where the gestational sac, including the foetus is outside of the uterine cavity (such as in the fallopian tube which leads to the ovary). These cause pain, and then haemorrhage at about 5 - 8 weeks as grow larger. This leads to bleeding, pain (usually left or right sided), and sometimes shoulder pain or bowel/bladder irritation. These can be quickly resolved with surgery and there is no way a foetus in an ectopic can be saved. </p>
<p>Then there are the later pregnancy deaths - some of these can be related to the overall condition of the patient prior to pregnancy, such as severe cardiac or respiratory problems. These however are rare as we follow these patients up very closely. </p>
<p>Other risks in the early to late period include placenta praevia - this is where the placenta covers the opening to the uterus (the cervix), and can bleed into it. Usually this is mild and gets better over time (like a balloon expanding, the uterus expands bring the placenta up stopping this). But massive bleeds can occur.</p>
<p>Then there is the risk of deep vein thrombosis which dislodges and goes up to the lungs blocking the blood supply to them. These can be on multiple levels, from mild to utterly severe. Due to the foetus's mass, it can impinge the blood supply back from the legs leading to the blood slowing down which can cause a clot to form (usually a single swollen and painful leg - both legs swelling and not tender is relatively normal in pregnancy)</p>
<p>Moving towards to third trimester we have the big one. Pre-eclampsia - raised blood pressure with protein in the urine (symptoms are a frontal headache with flashing lights/blurred vision - with a raised blood pressure from baseline). This is due to an insufficiency in the placental vessels that invade the uterus (but is still relatively unknown). It may be mild/moderate/severe or fulminant. We treat with blood pressure medication for most.If blood pressure starts creeping up then we will usually induce the pregnancy earlier (the only real cure). However, if the patient has a blood pressure over 160/90 then they have a risk of a pre-eclamptic seizure. If this is the case, or they are seizing there and then we will c-section them.</p>
<p>Others during this time can include placental abruption, where a burst vessel due to either trauma, the patient being a smoker or cocaine user, or previous abruptions can occur. In the worst case this separates the placenta from the womb, killing the foetus and making the mother bleed to death if medical attention isn't found quickly. Once again, moderate to major ones of these are rare-ish.</p>
<p>Then during pregnancy there is the risk of blood clots in the legs again (7 in 100,000 or so deaths in the UK). Blood loss is also a big thing, c-sections can cause quite severe blood loss (the uterus gets 800ml of blood a minute to lose if it wants). The worst blood loss I've seen is from tears, occurring when the baby exists the vagina. Mild tears can be common, big tears at about 2-4% of vaginal births. I've seen some tears that move into the vaginal walls that have caused approximately 7 litres of blood loss, but I've heard of more being lost - patient survived. </p>
<p>There is also amniotic embolisms - ball of amniotic fluid going from the uterus to the lungs - incredibly rare. </p>
<p>Then there are the anaesthetic risks, and anaphylactic shock from drugs that can kill - once again in a hospital things are pretty safe, an anaethetist is always on site.</p>
<p>Post delivery the risk of clots is still high. The risk of post operative complications is there (but mortality is low in developed countries due to good monitoring and decent aftercare). It is infection which is the big killer here. Group A Streptococcus kills 11 per 100,000. Women are generally anaemic (low in iron), recovering from a traumatic experience for the body, and have a raw uterus post placenta coming away. Any bacteria in the vagina can take advantage of this and cause a very quick and severe septic shock (bacterial toxins causing shut down of organs). However, Group A strep is the one renowned for this, and we are utterly vigilant against it. It is also the bacteria responsible for toxic shock syndrome.</p>
<p>Anyway, that a relatively simple list of the big hitters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
