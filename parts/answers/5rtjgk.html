		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dr. Krauss, I took your class at ASU for honors students last year and towards the end of the course we discussed space exploration. You mentioned your involvement in the development of solar sails for micro payloads to be sent to nearby stars at nearly the speed of light. I was wondering about how the development of this technology is progressing and your thoughts on the timescale this could be achieved by and the impact it could have. </p>
<p>As a follow up question, with the growing problems on Earth, how important is space exploration for the future of mankind?</p>
<p>Thanks for doing this AMA; I really enjoyed the class you taught and thanks for all the free pizza!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello Professor Krauss, I understand that you, along with others from the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, recently moved the Doomsday Clock to two and a half minutes to midnight. </p>
<p>Could you tell us a bit more on the criteria of the clock's movement, how the move was calculated (probabilistically or otherwise) or details on how scientists decide and vote, like a checklist ? Anything on the who, why and what, really.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a couple of questions related to inflation: What are the currently favored models of inflation? How do people deal with the criticism of inflation just 'post-dicting' and what future experiments/data will be available (in the near future, i.e. our lifetime) to test these theories?</p>
<p>Thanks a lot! Not only for this AMA, also for all the good work you are doing going out in the public and explaining cosmology!</p>
<p>Edit: changed some wording.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a high school teacher, it is alarming to see the number of students that reject major theories in science and treat science as its own form of &quot;Religion.&quot;  What SHOULD or CAN we do in schools, science classes, etc. to change this way of thinking?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Everyone.  Thanks for all the great questions.  I am sorry I couldn't get to all of them in the 90 minutes I just spent online.  We will be doing another AMA in March when the new book comes out.  Hope to answer more questions then!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
