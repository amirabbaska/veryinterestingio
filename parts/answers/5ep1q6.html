<p>You ban just one person, they say &quot;hey I got banned for using leetsuperhax, its no good anymore&quot; </p>
<p>People stop using leetsuperhax, and start using something else thats undetectable.</p>
<p>It's better to wait and remove as many hackers as possible, cherry picking them as they pop up results in many more adapting their strategy and staying undetected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Additionally to the answer you already have:</p>
<p>A game might have more than one way that you can hack in it. The way a developer can detect whether a player has hacked or not depends on the developer's ability to monitor the player. Let's say the developer have just found out a new way their game can be hacked - they develop a new method to catch the hackers, and then implement the method in the next patch. Once people start playing, they are found out, and are banned. A new 'wave' of bannings happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not letting the hackers know you're on to them is one reason but another is just resources</p>
<p>A developer may not have a patch for their auto banning system yet (if they even have an auto ban system) and want to ban the cheaters. So the process goes like this:  </p>
<p>Devs detect a cheat, comb logs to see who cheated, give list to people with access to the banning tool. Sometimes, due to server strain, the banning tool only runs at certain times, like off-peak hours</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good answers here, but also it's not someone's full time job to &quot;ban&quot; normally. So they end up with a back log and then buckle down over a few hours to just ban them all.  (Smaller companies would be the ones doing it like this, big ones may have someone who focuses on it, small ones wouldn't).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I went through the first few comments and didn't find a good enough answer. Let's explain this using Minecraft if a person is making a hacked client and are testing it on a server if there was no ban waves you could just say oh let's try fly then if you get banned instantly then the maker of the client can assume oh it's the fly hacks and not the kill aura or bhop that gets people banned. I need to try to work harder to tweak my fly hack. But if there is ban waves it is harder for the client makers to figure out what is getting detected and also harder to by pass because of this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
