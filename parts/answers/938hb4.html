		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain to skull ratio could influence a coup contracoup concussion where your brain literally rattles back and forth in your skull and bruises. It also puts you at increased risk of subdural hematoma (shearing of the veins in the layer surrounding your brain) if you are elderly or have a smaller brain for other reasons. Can have small impacts, not remember and end up with a chronic bleed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, your brain grows with your skull and remains proportionate. So, a person with a larger skull would have a larger brain, putting them a equal risk for concussion as a smaller-skulled person. If someone had a brain that had gotten smaller for whatever reason, that might increase the severity of concussion with a head injury. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Based on my technical training and experience, a thicker skull would not necessarily affect your chances of specifically a concussion, although I would expect it to have other complications with it.</p>
<p>I’m assuming you’re asking about the space your brain has inside the skull, implying that a smaller space would mean less coup-contracoup movement and fewer concussions.
If you had a large space, I would expect injuries involving the brain stem to be more common, since that would still be an area where the skull and brain would be in close proximity. Those are usually quite bad. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the injuries I would expect to see if you had a smaller space between the meninges and the skull is an increased chance of cranial herniation, where the brain stem is pushed out of the foramen magnum. Bleeding in the brain of any kind would basically be a death sentence since it would have nowhere to go except down and out by your spinal cord, which creates the herniation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm now very curious how brain activity relating to say, higher level thinking or emotional thinking, is impacted differently depending on head shape/size/skull thickness after a traumatic event.  I'm an NFL fan, and there are some smart people out there on the field, so it makes me wonder what makes them more likely to get knocked silly, permanently.  I get the concussion/s (bruises) can impact different areas of the brain, but I'm really curious about the frontal lobe right now.  Anyone have a decent source to just link to? I'd be interested in reading about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a limit to the amount of force a human can generate so in the context of sports there is very few individual events that you should worry about.  It's the accumulation of head trauma that's the problem.  The only cases where I could see it work against you is when you're hit flush in a linear fashion and the person is hitting through you.  So a large surface area of your brain is contacting your skull and the person is still driving forward causing your brain to absorb all of the hit.  </p>
<p>That's why right crosses knock everybody out.  It's less common but when someone enters the pocket the opponent slides into the proper angle and switch or backleg kicks them in the side of the head flush.  Same effect the whole brain shifts contacts the side of the head and stays there for a bit.  Other strikes like hooks a small part of the brain might bounce off the side. Getting hit flush is a like open field tackle though.  Those are kind of the outliers were the force is closer to a car crash than a human and the single event might be more significant than many smaller traumas.  Everything else that could have gone wrong did and so now maybe the size of your skull comes into play.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
