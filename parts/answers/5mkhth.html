		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helmholtz_resonance" target="_blank">Helmholtz Resonance</a>. This is basically where there is a low pressure area outside your car because the air is moving relative to the car which, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli's_principle" target="_blank">Bernoulli's Principle</a>, lowers fluid pressure. The air in your car wants to equalize with the lower pressure outside your car, so it gets pushed out. By the time the pressures have equalized, the air is still moving out due to its inertia, so extra air gets out. This creates a low pressure zone in your car and the reverse happens. It flows into the car, but too much flows in, leaving another high pressure zone in the car, and the cycle repeats. This oscillating high and low pressure happens tens of times per second, which we perceive as sound.</p>
<p>Side note: u/fyrillin could be on to something with the bluff body vortex shedding. However, the reason I think he could be wrong is that I get this effect when only my sun roof is open. How could there be a winning side and a losing side if there is only one hole? It is similar to blowing on a bottle and making a noise, which is confirmed to use Helmholtz Resonance.</p>
<p>Edit: I mixed up where the high and low pressure zones start. Fixed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just imagine what happens to a soda bottle when you pour the liquid out too quickly. It's starts splashing and pulsing as it comes out.  The reason this happens is for the same reason your car &quot;flutters&quot; when you have only one window open.  </p>
<p>The air only has one hole to go in and out of. So as air leaves, it creates a slightly lower pressure in the car which wants to pull air back in now to equalize. But it has to go through the same hole, and it can't be doing both simultaneously. So this switching back and forth between exiting and entering air creates the flutter sound you hear. </p>
<p>If you crack a second window, the air will have multiple entry and exit points and you will not hear the flutter :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine the air entering your windows.  It gets sucked in because you have compressed the air in front of you and it wants to expand.  Nothing in nature is perfectly symmetrical so one side gets more pressure than the other for now.  However, because of the shape of your car (it's not streamlined with your windows open), the air from the winning side ends up swirling inside your car.  That creates a low pressure area toward the OTHER side.  The winning side gets pushed out by the other side - which becomes the new winning side, does the same thing, and the cycle continues.  You have just formed a &quot;<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_shedding" target="_blank">bluff body vortex shedding</a>&quot; event.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>New cars are so aerodynamic that air slips past the windows over a very thin boundary layer.  When you roll them down, air still slips past them, but the air moving past the open window creates a Venturi effect.  This drops the pressure in the cabin very quickly.  As soon as the pressure drops below a certain point, the Venturi effect breaks for a second and a slug of air gets drawn into the cabin.  The sudden increase in pressure reestablishes the Venturi effect, drawing air BACK out of the car.  This is cyclical and happens very rapidly. </p>
<p>Old cars rarely did this because they were much less aerodynamic and had huge boundary layers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
