		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is not one right answer - This phenomenon can be caused by various reason among which include genetic mutation as well. </p>
<p>That little pepper inside a bigger pepper is called an “internal proliferation.” Its form can vary from irregular and contorted to a near-perfect but sterile fruit.</p>
<p>A pepper growing inside a pepper is a type of parthenocarpy, which is the formation of fruits without fertilization or the formation of seeds. No one is sure what causes them, but temperature and nutrient levels have been ruled out.</p>
<p>Plant breeders, who consider this anomaly undesirable, keep an eye out for it when selecting for new cultivars, because the trait is inheritable.</p>
<p><em>More Details</em></p>
<p>During the normal development of bell peppers, seeds develop from fertilized structures or ovules. There are a multitude of ovules within the pepper which turn into tiny seeds that we discard before eating the fruit. When a pepper ovule gets a wild hair, it develops an internal proliferation, or carpelloid formation, which more resembles the parent pepper rather than a seed. </p>
<p>Normally, fruit forms if ovules have been fertilized and are developing into seeds. On occasion, a process called parthenocarpy occurs wherein the fruit forms with an absence of seeds. </p>
<p>There is some evidence that suggests there is a correlation between the parasitic pepper inside a pepper. Internal proliferations most often develop in the absence of fertilization when the carpelloid structure mimics the role of seeds resulting in parthenocarpic pepper growth. </p>
<p>Parthenocarpy is already responsible for seedless oranges and the lack of large, unpleasant seeds in bananas. Understanding its role in engendering parasitic peppers may end up creating seedless pepper varieties.</p>
<p>Whatever the exact cause, commercial growers consider this an undesirable trait and tend to select newer cultivars for cultivation. The pepper baby, or parasitic twin, is perfectly edible, however, so it’s almost like getting more bang for your buck. I suggest just eating the little pepper inside a pepper and continue to marvel at the strange mysteries of nature.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bell peppers, like a lot of modern fruits and veg, can be bred to develop without fertilisation. Sometimes, the ovules in a pepper get &quot;confused&quot; and develop into another pepper while inside an existing pepper. It just means there's been an error in communication in growth and development somewhere, as a result of damage or miscopied genetics or hormone confusion. Much as how humans can get cancers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
