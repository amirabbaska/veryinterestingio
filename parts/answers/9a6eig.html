		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can’t speak for other languages, but for Chinese, the tradition is to write in on bamboo slates, vertically from top to bottom. When a slate is filled, it is removed so ink smudges was never a problem. It’s possible that they use their right hand to do both writing and slate-moving, so right-to-left makes it easier. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of countries for a long time considered being right-handed to be &quot;normal&quot; and left-handed to be &quot;wrong&quot;. It would make sense if those were the ones writing L-R (which is easier using the right hand). </p>
<p>However, I believe also arab countries had (maybe even still have) strong feelings against being left-handed and still write R-L.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
