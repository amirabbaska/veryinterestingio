		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are. The orbital angular momentum quantum number can be anything from 0 to (n - 1), and n can be anything from 1 to infinity. The naming convention goes (starting from zero and increasing by 1 unit each time) like s, p, d, f, g, h, i, j, k, etc.</p>
<p>The problem is that we've only discovered 118 elements so far. We haven't got high enough in the ground state electron configurations to reach the g-orbital.</p>
<p>In nuclei, g, h, and i orbitals are easy to reach. The shell model even has a j-orbital at 168 protons or neutrons.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anything to do with energylevels?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, it's completely to do with the energies of the orbitals. Particles fill the orbitals in order of increasing energy. Atomic electrons fill all of the lowest-energy orbitals before they ever reach a g-orbital.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are. If 10 more or so new elements will be discovered, they should reach the first ones with electrons in <em>g</em> orbitals in their ground state.  I wouldn't be surprised if some of the g orbitals have been directly observed in some transitions of say Uranium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The formation of electron orbitals is basically a balancing act between the attraction between protons and electrons and the repulsion between electrons. The first s and p orbitals on the same layer can overlap relatively easily. Eventually, the attraction of different charges pulls electrons under the outermost layer and forms the d orbitals a layer down. This happens again with f orbitals, but two layers down.</p>
<p>In theory, more orbitals could be formed, it'd just take more proton-rich elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry to hijack the original question OP but I feel this is an appropriate thread. I was learning about valence electrons today when my prof said that there can only be 8 valence electrons. How does this work when the f orbital can hold 14 electrons? Shouldnt they have a higher amount of valence electrons?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
