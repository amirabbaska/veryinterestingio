<p>A security question like your first kid's name is something you won't forget, but it's not that hard for someone to bring it up in conversation. If someone casually asks my mother's maiden name, I assume they're trying to steal my identity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I started writing the response below as a joke, but I found a very interesting article that actually <em>does</em> trace back the question way farther back than I initially thought.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The first record of querying someone about their mother's maiden name goes back much farther than questionnaires or forms for personal information or identification security.
Back in the 19th Century it was used as a way to segregate bastards or orphans from those who had (presumably) birthrights.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So here's the article that really <em>does</em> trace this back to the 19th Century:</p>
<p><a href="https://splinternews.com/your-mothers-maiden-name-has-been-a-security-question-s-1793846367" target="_blank">Your mother's maiden name has been a 'security question' since 1882</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In many cultures around the world, the woman's last name is &quot;lost&quot; when they marry, as they become part of the man's family. So, while a kid would know that his mom used to be Jane Doe, most people would only know her as Jane Smith.</p>
<p>This backfires when you are in a culture in which the names are added, like Hispanic cultures do. In Spain or Mexico the Jane Doe Byrd married John Smith Anderson, and their kid is James Smith Doe, so everybody knows little Jimmy's mom's maiden name.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
