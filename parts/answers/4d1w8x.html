<p>The OS X filesystem identifies files by an independent file ID, which remains fixed if the file is moved or renamed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another aspect of the problem is that Windows has something called a <em>share mode</em> on open files—basically, an application can open a file in <em>exclusive</em> mode meaning that no other program can do anything with the file. It is not possible to circumvent the share mode. This is extensively used in Windows and part of the reason why you have to reboot to apply updates.</p>
<p>UNIX-like systems (like Linux) only have <em>advisory</em> file locking which can be ignored by other processes if they decide to. Once a lock is violated, the process is notified of that circumstance and can proceed to handle the case. A rogue process cannot lock up critical files with no way out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question is incorrect.</p>
<p>While all these other answers do point out valid differences between Windows 95 and Linux, the <a href="http://pastebin.com/B5m3a0RM" target="_blank">thing is that you actually can.</a> It just depends on the lock level - if the lock level is too high (likely because the application cares about the path not changing) the file can't be moved.</p>
<p>The reason is simple: regardless of how the file system represents a file, both Windows and Unices (Mac, Linux, BSD, etc.) represent a file as a handle once you open it. The filename is only used to create that handle - it can change afterwards, it no longer matters.</p>
<p>As for NTFS, the on-disk representation has similarities to Linux. The argument about inodes only applies to FAT - i.e. Windows 9X.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Windows, the file is like your full name, and in unix like os it's like your social security number.</p>
<p>If you change your name, nobody knows you're you anymore. But if you change your name, you can still be identified by your social security number.</p>
<p>It's like a photograph of you wearing specific clothes versus a DNA imprint.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
