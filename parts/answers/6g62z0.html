		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an analogy that a five year old might understand.</p>
<p>Imagine you have a piece of paper. You get your crayon and divide the paper up into squares. In each square you can write a limited amount of information (for this example, let's say one letter), <a href="http://i.imgur.com/lsGrjPk.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a>. If you tried to write any more information in each square, it would be unreadable because the crayon is too thick to write smaller letters.</p>
<p>You can make more storage space by creating a book using more than one sheet of paper. The extra paper costs more money compared to using a single sheet. Another way to make more space is to replace your crayon with something smaller, and more expensive, like a pen. You <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zlKIipz.jpg" target="_blank">can see</a> that more information would fit on the sheet compared to when you were using a crayon.</p>
<p>Once you've made your large storage device using multiple sheets of paper and a pen, you might want to make artificially smaller sizes (read about price discrimination for more on why you might want to do this). You can do this by removing some of the sheets, or by painting over some of your squares <a href="http://i.imgur.com/D8JNzAJ.jpg" target="_blank">like this</a>.</p>
<p>To get back to your original question: The physical differences are different numbers of platters (the sheets of paper in the analogy), and different density on each platter (the different writing sizes in the analogy). Whether they cost the same depends on how a manufacturer decides to produce their different sizes. If they use fewer platters, it might cost less to make a smaller drive. If there is no physical difference and they just disable part of the drive for their smaller capacity drives (painting over squares in the analogy), then all sizes will cost the same to produce.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are differences usually, and it depends on the type of drive.</p>
<p>Solid state drive use flash chips to store data. Larger drives either use more chips (up to the max that the controller can handle), or they use higher capacity chips. As a general rule, controllers that can handle more chips, larger chips, and faster chips tend to be more expensive.</p>
<p>Mechanical hard drives have platters with magnetic dust on them. The platter is divided up into sectors, and the orientation of the magnetic field determines whether each sector is a one or a zero. Larger drives have more platters, generally. It is possible to artificially limit the capacity of a platter in order to make additional sizes.</p>
<p>For both types of drives, size increases over time come from higher density. The flash chips in solid state drives improve every few years like CPUs (they are both silicon-based semiconductors). Mechanical hard drives advance more slowly.</p>
<p>In either case, simply adding more storage media (chips or platters) is a significant engineering problem, so improvements in capacity are tied to improvements in the underlying tech.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ones and zeroes used in binary coding are stored within a disk within the hard drive called a platter. Just as you can magnetize a nail this platter is divided into billions of sections each one able to be magnetized or unmagnetized to represent a 0 or 1. Depending on how many sections you can make that platter into and how many platters you can fit into a hard drive dictates the amount of memory you can fit in it. </p>
<p>I was interested with this too so I decided to do some investigating and came up with this as he best explanation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking only of hard drives (not solid state drives):</p>
<p><strong>More space to write</strong></p>
<p>I want you to write a bunch of words, so I give you one sheet of paper and a big marker.  If I want you to write twice as many words, I can simply give you a second sheet of paper.  Hard drives store data on a spinning metal disc (called 'platters').  Once way to store more data is to just put more spinning discs in the hard drive.</p>
<p><strong>Smaller marker</strong></p>
<p>I have another sheet of paper, but I want you to write more words on it than you did the first time.  So I replace your big marker with a really nice fine-tip pen.  Now you can write your words smaller than before, so more words fit on the same sheet of paper.  In this case, 'improving the marker' on the hard drive isn't so much a physical change as it is a software change.  As time goes on, hard drive makers get better at packing more data into the same amount of space on a platter.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>TL,DR</strong>
Hard drive makers get better at writing data in smaller and smaller spaces over time.  They can also add more writing space by adding more metal frisbees (platters).  So in 2010, a drive might have used 1 platter to store 500Gb.  Thus, a 500Gb drive from that time would have one platter, while a 1Tb drive from that time would have 2 platters.  Fast forward a couple years, hard drive makers have better 'markers', and you can find a 1Tb hard drive with only a single platter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot to consider about a hard disk, perpendicular/parallel magneto-resistive surface, glass/aluminum media, magnetic density of surface, how many disks/heads inside and so on.
But if you are talking about same technology there's 2 options to double the hard disk capacity, double the number of disks inside or use only one side of them (in this case, halves the capacity).
On both cases there's a small savings on the lower capacity versions, as the components are cheap compared to the final price of the hard disk.  The big savings comes at quality control, if something doesn't work, there's a chance that part of it still works.  Selling it at cheaper prices reduces the work and increases the profit comparing to recycling.
