Assuming all the heat that is in the 3 buckets to start with is all there at the end you will have the same amount of energy in the combined buckets no matter how you mix them, which means exactly the same temperature.</p>
<p>You could certainly take different paths to get there, and maybe mix things in such a way that there is a temperature gradient for a time.  For example, if you poured in the cold bucket first and then very slowly and carefully poured the hot buckets across the top you could potentially make the cold water stay at the bottom and hot water stay at the top for awhile.  However, given enough time they will mix and the temperature should equalize.</p>
<p>If you want an analogy for this to make sense then instead of the abstract concept of &quot;heat&quot; we can just replace the heat with something tangible.  For example, imagine three buckets of sand instead of water, two of which have a lot of marbles mixed in while one only has a few.  No matter how you mix the three buckets of sand together you will always end up with the same number of marbles in the mixed bucket at the end.  Swap marbles for heat and you are good to go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Expanding on the other well explained comment, if you take the surroundings into account and introduce a time difference you'll get some different results.</p>
<p>There is the common example of adding cold milk to your hot coffee that you wish to drink later on in the future. If you want to come back to your coffee later and want it to be as hot as possible, should you add the cold milk straight after brewing or later on just before drinking the coffee.</p>
<p>As you'll imagine there will be heat &quot;lost&quot; from the coffee to the environment. The trick its that this heat &quot;loss&quot; is proportional to the temperature difference between the coffee and the environment. (See for example Fourier heat transfer)</p>
<p>So adding the milk straight away is the best course of action since the cooled down mixture will loose less heat during the time it is sitting there.
If you add the milk at the end the hot coffee looses more heat while it is sitting there so when you mix in the milk the mixture has a lower temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>Hot water cools faster than cold water in a given air temperature, due to a higher temperature differential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poured hot water loses its temperature faster than still hot water, due to increase surface area.</p>
</li>
<li>Poured cold water will warm up towards the ambient air temperature, for the same reasons.</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, to end up with the hottest water possible at the end of the experiment, pour the cold water into one hot water bucket, which will reduce its temperature difference from the air and slow its cooling; then pour that one into the remaining bucket of hot water, as quickly as possible with minimal disturbance to its surface.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an imaginary closed system, no, the order you combine the buckets would not matter once the water mixed.</p>
<p>In the real world, where nothing is a truly closed system, there are all sorts of ways to lose heat at different rates (and ways to gain heat, but that's harder).  The amount of time you take pouring your water gives the hot water more or less time to cool off.  The way you pour water could give the water more or less contact with the air (more surface area on the water means more evaporation and more heat loss).  The buckets could absorb heat and a warm bucket could make cold water warmer.</p>
<p>In short, there are lots of factors that could influence the temperature of the final mixture, but the order of mixing is probably not a significant one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, if the mechanical process of adding one bucket to another involves pouring. Evaporative losses during the pour is greater than in static state in the bucket, these losses are generally accounted for in pool designs with waterfall features. Hotter water will lose more temperature during this pour due to air's capacity to retain moisture at higher temperatures. So pouring the hot water buckets into the cold water bucket will result in a lower temperature than pouring the cold water bucket into either hot water bucket. </p>
