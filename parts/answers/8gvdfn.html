<p>While certain gods came and went, and some were considered newer even when they were actually quite ancient, for the most part the gods that the Greeks worshiped remained, as far as this question is concerned, the same. Essentially their pantheon was inherited from the proto-indoeuropean roots much like their language. The gods that we are familiar with, Zeus and the like, have their roots in gods which, as far as we can tell, functioned very similarly based on PIE linguistics. Zeus and Jupiter (Roman equivalent) are both etymologically related to a reconstructed deity <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyeus" target="_blank">Dyeus Phter</a> which just means &quot;sky daddy&quot;. This makes sense because they are both fatherly figures of the sky.</p>
<p>So where did all the titan stories come from? Well, a few places. For most of human history cultural information was passed down from generation to generation in the form of stories. It helps to have a compelling story to tell and, at times, certain embellishments can be made. Over the course of hundreds of generations and even more embellishments you will eventually wind up with a full fledged mythology. However, that does not mean that all of these stories are embellishments, strictly speaking. One of the interesting facets of Greek ritual observance is their willingness to adopt gods and appropriate their stories and fold them into their own mythologies. This is essentially what is happening at the beginning of Plato's Republic; it opens with a Greek festival to a foreign goddess. Over time, it becomes quite difficult to separate native stories from original stories from adopted ones.</p>
<p>So, were the titans worshiped before the gods? Perhaps, but not by the Greeks. However, it is also important to remember that some of the titans were worshiped with much the same vigor and veneration as the gods, they all had their ritual roles to play in the overarching mythology.</p>
<p>Addendum: It is also worth noting that some mythologies, such as some of the Roman origin stories, have ancient peoples that founders encounter worshiping deities such as Saturn. Instances such as this could really go either way, as a religion that got subsumed or as literary embellishment. However, most material evidence points to the extreme antiquity of much of the core pantheon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not Greek but the jotunn or ice giants from Norse mythology were likely personifications of the glaciers they encountered in Scandinavia, especially embellished by a cultural memory of surviving the last ice age. In lots of mythological traditions there are representatives of wild destructive elements of nature contrasted against the benign and beneficial elements that serve man. The Titans and the Greek gods, the jotunn and the vanir of Norse mythology, the fomorians and the Tuatha de Danann of Irish mythology. Even demons and angels from the Abrahamic faiths </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on exactly what you mean by the &quot;Greeks&quot;, that word is applied to a number of related civilization that existed in the region over about 3000 years.</p>
<p>The Minoans were the earliest, dating to about 2600 BC.  We don't know much about their gods, partly because their language remains undeciphered.  But it does appear to be centered around a sun goddess figure and bulls, and bears little relation to Classical Greek gods.  Part of their tradition may live on through the legend of King Minos and the Minotaur.</p>
<p>The Mycenaeans came about around a thousand years later, after the Bronze Age collapse.  Their gods are precursors to the well known Greek gods, but with many differences.  Poseidon appeared to be the most central figure and was the god of the depths of the earth, not of the sea.  Zeus existed, but was not the chief god, but merely the god of the sky.  Many gods of the Greek pantheon were missing, and others in the Mycenaean pantheon have no Greek equivalent.</p>
<p>The Archaic Greek period started about 800 BC, with the familiar pantheon.  Some speculate the Titans represent earlier shamanistic religions, in much the same way Easter, Halloween, and Yule are remnants of extinct European pagan religions.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
