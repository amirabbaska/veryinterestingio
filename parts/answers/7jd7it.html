<li>
<p>It's hard to stop once you've been doing it long enough because it becomes easier to do it then not to do it (i.e. to constantly remind yourself not to).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It's just difficult enough to provide your fingers/mouth/brain with something to focus your spare energy on but not difficult enough to make it not worthwhile.</p>
</li>
<li>Once started, leaving the results of a half-picked/chewed area is usually more irritating then to just see the picked/chewed area through until it's either no longer irritating or it's too painful to continue.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm, chewing my lips right now.</p>
<p>My dog does the same thing (well, not her lips). She chews at her legs, like she's try to scratch a spot. Maybe it's something built into all mammals as a form of self-care?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
