<p>This is a nice overview:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not the primary benefit that epsom salts claim, but dissolving salts in water (or solutes into any solvent) makes the solution denser. So you're going to float slightly easier in an epsom salt batch than a normal one. Whether this makes any difference physiologically I have no idea.</p>
<p>edit: The amount of people that made it through school without learning what a salt is is depressing me. Yes, epsom salts are salts. They are primarily a salt of magnesium, magnesium sulfate, just like table salt is a salt of sodium, sodium chloride.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody has mentioned it, but I've always thought it had to do with magnesium, which when taken as a supplement has calming and muscle relaxing effects. I can't speak for whether it is actually absorbed through this medium, though. Can anybody elaborate on this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When this was posted on r/skeptic six years ago (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/f4t6y/fellow_skeptics_does_epsom_salt_in_a_warm_bath/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/f4t6y/fellow_skeptics_does_epsom_salt_in_a_warm_bath/</a>) the conclusion was no, there is no validity to such claims.  Although there are some chemicals which can enter the body through unbroken skin, that is not the case for the magnesium sulfate we call Epsom salt (after the town in England, so &quot;Epsom&quot; probably should be capitalized, and &quot;salt&quot; is singular).  If you want to put some magnesium sulfate into your body for some reason, you will have to ingest it.   If you put it in your bathtub, any perceived benefits will be strictly imaginary, and your money will go the same direction the water goes when you pull the plug.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Epsom salts are a form of magnesium. </p>
<p>According to <a href="http://www.epsomsaltcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/report_on_absorption_of_magnesium_sulfate.pdf" target="_blank">this study</a> it appears that magnesium is capable of being absorbed through the skin. </p>
<p><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/magnesium/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a nice resource that may provide information regarding its (empirically-supported) efficacy and clinical uses. </p>
<p>In essence, the relaxing effect of magnesium appears to be due to magnesium's neurological functioning. From the examine page: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;Low Magnesium levels are associated with neuronal hyperexcitation and random firing, and secondary to higher activation of NMDA receptors more calcium appears to be released.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At a rudimentary level, glutamate (what works on NMDA receptors) exerts a stimulatory function. </p>
<p>From the data above, it appears that magnesium reduces the amount of glutamate that is operating in the brain when you are at a sufficient level (or optimal, really...there are issues with the RDA level as it pertains to optimal health).</p>
<p>A study found that magnesium helped attenuate symptoms of ADHD, and that may serve as clinical support for this neural mechanism in humans. </p>
<p>There was further data supportive of this relaxation claim that was found in elderly people, their sleep quality increased and cortisol decreased. </p>
<p>Overall, it's undoubtable that a comprehensive overview of how magnesium works is easily explicable. It certainly operates in myriad ways, so just know that it does. </p>
<p>Edit: added a link to a study that found that epsom salt baths may allow for systemic magnesium to rise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
