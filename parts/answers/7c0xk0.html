It pulls the molecules tightly together and the closer they pull the more compact they are leading to a spherical shape. A sphere is were you achieve the tightest possible grouping of particles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The surface tension of water makes it much like a balloon. the surface want to be as small as possible, but the volume of air is still constant because it can't get out, so what happens is that it goes towards the shape that has the smallest surface area, given the constant volume, which is the sphere. </p>
<p>A balloon isn't perfectly round because it has the opening and the rubber might not be equally thick everywhere, but a bubble becomes perfectly symmetrical because there is no reason any side should be favored over another, so everything is evenly distributed. (Gravity might make it slightly thicker at the bottom I suppose, a bubble is so thin and light that the gravitational force is very small and hardly noticeable)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bubble is a thin film of soapy water that is surrounding a volume of air.  </p>
<p>The thin film of soapy water is comprised of molecules that want to pull each other together - and they do.  The air that is surrounded by the thin film of soap is being contracted by the film - because it is a gas, it exerts an equal force on every surface point touching it.  </p>
<p>The film contracts until the forces causing the contraction are balanced by the pressure of the trapped air (which exerts a force that would otherwise cause the bubble to expand).  At this point, the two forces are in equilibrium (balanced).</p>
<p>Mathematically, the only possible resultant shape is a sphere.  Any other shape would have some soapy film molecules closer together than other soapy film molecules in the film and would cause the resultant shape to no longer be in equilibrium with the compressed gas - the shape would then undergo a change towards equilibrium - and the only resultant shape in which <strong>every</strong> soapy film molecule is pulling on an equal number of soapy film molecules is a sphere; the only shape in which every single point on the sphere is exactly the same as every other point on the structure (this is untrue for every other geometric shape).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a given volume, sphere has the least surface area. </p>
<p>If a cube, a sphere or some other object have the same volume, the sphere will have the least surface area. It is also symmetrical. All points on the surface are equidistant from the centre (which will be the centre of mass mass for the object).</p>
<p>If external forces are not acting on a liquid, it will tend to form a shperical shape.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
