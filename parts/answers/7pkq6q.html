		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the old days, CRT TVs would sweep an electron beam across the screen, line by line,, with the amplitude of the video signal translating to the intensity of the beam. Things got a little more complicated when colour was added, but it largely works in the same way. Just with a few more parts.</p>
<p>Digital video signals are a bit different in that they're a series of 1s and 0s. With a digital LCD or OLED display, you can control each individual sub pixel with precession, with an intensity value anywhere from 0 (off/black) to 256 (full intensity). By varying the intensity of each sub pixel, you can mix red, green, and blue to make various colours. Millions in fact. A computer inside your TV or monitor processes all this data. The video signal though may not actually contain all the information the TV needs, in order to save bandwidth. So the display does some fudging that exploits limitations with human vision. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Video engineer here. Oh goodie! One of those rare times when my job skills are actually useful outside of work!</p>
<p>Basically, we see the world around us because of electromagnetic radiation - y'know, light and colors and stuff? That radiation (so... light) vibrates up and down. Some colors vibrate up and down faster than others.</p>
<p>Our TVs kind of work the same way, except the colors they see vibrate a lot slower than the colors we see. The TV has special electronics that can listen very carefully and turn these relatively slowly vibrating waves into a signal of ones and zeroes. We call this a digital signal. These ones and zeroes spell out some really fancy computer code that describes pictures, sound, and text! </p>
<p>Then, the TV has even more whiz-bang electronics that can take that computer code, and turn it back into pictures that OUR eyes can see on its screen! It does this by shining a super-bright light behind tons of dancing little red, green, and blue color filters. Each one is like a dot on a page, and with millions of dots we can see a moving color picture!</p>
<p>Slightly more technical: Over-the-air, satellite, and cable broadcasting all use various modulation schemes to transmit digital data over analog radio waves / RF. The receiver (be it a TV, satellite box, or cable box) has a de-modulator (aka tuner) that recovers the digital signal from the RF. This digital signal is typically an MPEG Transport Stream describing a series of discrete programs, each in turn describing audio and video streams. </p>
<p>These streams are compressed because totally uncompressed audio and video are really really big. Like, REALLY big. Totally uncompressed typical 1080p60 RGB video (like the kind your computer might feed to your monitor) is about 3 Gigabits per second!!! You only get ~5-20 Mbps for an HD TV channel, so compression and other trickery like component video (aka YCbCr), chroma subsampling (aka 4:2:0) and gross legacy stuff like interlacing (aka 1080i vs 1080p) is absolutely required.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Video is generally compressed using MPEG-2 / H.262, MPEG-4 AVC / H.264, or MPEG-H HEVC / H.265, from oldest to newest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Audio is usually MPEG-1 Layer 2, Dolby Digital / AC-3, or Dolby Digital Plus / E-AC-3. </p>
</li>
<li>Closed captions / subtitles aren't really compressed since they're small, but are stored using standards like EIA-608, EIA-708, SCTE-20, or DVB Subtitling. </li>
</ul>
<p>The TV / satellite box / cable box has special hardware and software that can decode these compressed essences into uncompressed video and audio signals, compose them into a synchronized stream, and pipe them out to your screen over HDMI (or directly, in the case of an internal tuner).</p>
<p>Typical LCD displays have a backlight of some kind (be it a flourescent cold cathode or a matrix of LEDs) that shines through a large array of color filters, generally one red, green, and blue filter for each dot on the screen. The filters selectively darken to mix red, green, and blue for each pixel. OLEDs are sort of similar, except each pixel is a combination of tiny red, green, and blue lights that you can control the brightness of independently.</p>
<p>So that's how that works.</p>
<p>If you want more info, read the wiki articles on DVB and ATSC, or any of the acronyms I listed above :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's all just a matter of splitting up the received commands and sending them to where they need to go(screen vs speakers).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You know how you can mix paint colors together to form any color possible, all from the three primary colors red, green, and blue? Well light can be mixed the same way. Your TV gets a signal that tells it what colors to mix for every little tiny bit of your screen. For example, it will receive a set of three numbers (red, green, and blue) for every tiny spot (called a pixel) on the screen. It then lights the pixel up with the amount of red, green and blue that the numbers specified. Repeat this for every tiny pixel on the screen and you end up with a full picture. </p>
<p>I think how those images are encoded and transferred isn't really what OP was after, so this is a true ELI5 of the fundamental
concept of how it works. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
