		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastics are made up of long interlocking hydrocarbon chains. When plastic items leave the factory, these hydrocarbon chains are semi-randomly entangled, like a drawer full of computer cables or a well-stirred bowl of spaghetti. This is called an amorphous crystal structure, and it happens to be rather transparent to the human eye. </p>
<p>Bending/stretching/slightly heating this amorphous crystal leads to the hydrocarbon chains aligning with one another, meaning the crystal becomes more ordered, more tightly packed (density increases), and harder (work-hardening). This is like the dry spaghetti when they're still in the box: long chains running (mostly) in parallel. This changes the refractive properties of the plastic, making it opaque. Another effect of this process is that the plastic becomes more brittle, which is why if you bend it back and forth a few times, the piece of plastic will break in two along the hardened line you have created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bending a clear plastic deforms the material and the small amounts of friction on the inside and outside of the materiel. Heating a polymer changes the crystalline structure of the plastic and way light scatters though the object and thus changes the transparency </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other explanations are good but not really ELI5, so here's mine: </p>
<p>Plastic may seem smooth, but if you look through a microscope, it's a little rough, and reflects only certain colours to your eyes, these are the colour we see to begin with. When you bend or stretch it, it becomes smoother, likens polished surface and reflects more light, and if we see all the colours at once, we see white.</p>
<p>Extra: the reason it becomes smoother is because plastic is made of lots of little long chains of plastic and when we stretch it, they slide over each other to hold on, but it makes the plastic a little thinner as they all squish up and become smoother. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the type of plastic involved because not all colored plastic items turn white when bent or broken. </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>I am holding in my hand a broken 12-inch red rigid plastic ruler that is broken at the 3-inch mark. The broken edge is red all the way through. I just bent the broken ruler enough to make it no longer flat and no white is shown where I bent it, and if I bend it enough it will snap to reveal a broken edge like the one it already has that is red all the way through. </p>
<p>I am now holding a blue bendable plastic straw that I bent and it did not turn white when I bent or cut it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
