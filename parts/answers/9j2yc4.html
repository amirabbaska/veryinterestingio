		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there, I worked on a paper for fuzzy logic a while ago, we were computing with words:</p>
<p>Here is a bit of the abstract</p>
<blockquote>
<p>An expert opinion describes his or her opinion about a quantity by using imprecise (“fuzzy”) words from a natural language, such as “small”, “medium”, “large”, etc. Each of these words provides a rather crude description of the corresponding quantity. A natural way to refine this description is to assign degrees to which the observed quantity fits each of the selected words. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was from 5 years ago, ill try my best to remember:</p>
<p>We have 3 words: small, medium and large.</p>
<p>small might be from 0 to 4</p>
<p>medium might be from 3 to 6</p>
<p>large might be from 5 to 8</p>
<p>You can see that they overlap, that is because with words something small for someone might be medium for someone else. Things get interesting when we start saying things like this is &quot;small or medium&quot; which can be represented with 0 to 6.</p>
<p>Now the hard part, when you say small we dont know which number you are trying to say, however we know that for everyone it might be 0 to 2 since medium starts from 3 but small also includes 3, so we are left with probabilities. </p>
<p>Now think of the size of your dick: small, medium or large? I believe as you read this you gave different sizes to each word and those are different from what other person might think... so we work with probabilities of said values and thats basically how it works, and there is a lot of complex math with that.</p>
<p>TL;DR words have ambiguous values, and we work with probabilities around them.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>'Fuzzy' is a term used to indicate that you're treating normally discrete phenomenon in a continuous manner.</p>
<p>For example, consider classic set theory. Let's say you have a classification scheme of 'fruit', 'vegetable' or 'meat'. You look in your refrigerator and sort everything you see into one or more of those categories. Each item you sort is fully within a category or fully outside of it. If something is a 'fruit', it is 100% a fruit.</p>
<p>A 'fuzzy' version of this would be to permit something to only be <em>partially</em> within a category. So something might be '50% a fruit'.</p>
<p>In terms of its applications, that's harder to say. 'Fuzzy math' is pure mathematics rather than applied mathematics. It's an intellectual framework for discussing such phenomenon. As a result, you can describe all sorts of different systems with fuzzy math, but almost no one actually uses fuzzy math to build those systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say I have a big ol bowl of fruit, and want to define a set for the apples in the bowl. Apples are very clearly part of the apple set, and oranges and pears are very clearly not part of the apple set. If my bowl had weird apple hybrid fruits in it, those fruits are not very clearly in or not in the set, but they can be &quot;sort of&quot; in the set depending on how much apple is in there if I decide to have a fuzzy set instead.</p>
<p>In regular set theory, an element either is or isn't a member of the set. In fuzzy set theory, elements can have different levels of &quot;membership&quot; defined by a membership function.</p>
<p>You can apply mathematical rules to make sets into other mathematical structures, like groups, rings, topologies, categories etc. and you can also apply rules of groups and topologies to get fuzzy groups and fuzzy topologies.</p>
<p>Similarly, fuzzy logic defines &quot;partial truth&quot;. E.g. I can have binary true or false (a value of 1 or 0, if you're programming) or for fuzzy logic a statement can be valued anywhere between 0 and 1.</p>
<p>For applications, Wikipedia mentions linguistics and decision making (e.g. artificial intelligence / machine learning).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since nobody has mentioned this and I do think it's worthwhile to point out, the term &quot;fuzzy math&quot; does get thrown around in politics quite a bit, and there it has a distinctly different meaning than in classic mathematics. In politics oftentimes we hear someone accusing someone else of using &quot;fuzzy math&quot;, and in this application it means that somebody is cherry-picking figures usually of a statistical origin.</p>
<p>So politician A says &quot;I created x jobs in my term,&quot; and politician b might say &quot;You're resorting to fuzzy math, since jobs were already increasing in your predecessors term and so how can you claim you created that growth?&quot;</p>
<p>I know it's not at all the exact explanation you're asking for, but I feel like a lot of non-math people probably would associate &quot;fuzzy math&quot; as a term with cherry-picking statistics so it's worthwhile to point out what that means in that application.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks all for your replies,</p>
<p>I'm interested in a 10,000 foot high explanation because I'll be joining a research agency where the director has a bit of background in fuzzy mathematics, though my position doesn't directly engage with it.  The agency is essentially  social science research entity, so if anyone wants to take a stab at  basic description of the relationship between fuzzy mathematics and social science, I'd love to hear it.</p>
