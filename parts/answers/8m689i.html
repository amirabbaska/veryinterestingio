		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was the spread of data I was once given, from combining tens of thousands of people from different studies. </p>
<p>new studies may have different numbers, but they are not going to be significantly different:</p>
<p>Correlation (out of 100%) between different IQ tests</p>
<p>The same person tested Twice: 87%<br />
identical twins reared together: 86%<br />
Identical twins reared apart: 76%<br />
Fraternal twins reared together: 55%<br />
Biological Siblings: 47%<br />
Parents and Children living together: 40%<br />
Parents and children living apart: 31%<br />
Adopted Children living together: 0%<br />
Unrelated People Living Apart: 0%</p>
<p>Basically an identical twin with a shared upbringing is indistinguishable from the same person taking multiple tests, in terms of repeat-ability. </p>
<p>Raising twins apart drops the correlation, which suggests that upbringing has <em>some</em> sort of effect.  </p>
<p>Fraternal twins have significantly less correlation than identical twins, meaning that genetics are playing a large role.  However, they have a higher correlation than regular siblings.  Which means that either sharing a womb has some sort of result (shared conditions of mother while brain developing, or similar external stimulus of epigentic factors), or perhaps having a constant companion of the same age causes some sort of convergence of development. </p>
<p>Biological Siblings are next in line.  Not surprising. A big effect, but still a lot of variation.  It's notable that siblings correlate more amongst themselves than with their of their parents.  The mixed result of the parents genes are playing a role.</p>
<p>Adopted Children living together having 0% correlation contradicts something earlier - that suggests that nurture (alone) has zero influence.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, General Intelligence (normalized for age = IQ) seems to be a lot like height.  It is obviously heritable, though there can be variation.  Additionally, your genetics seem to outline a particular <em>potential.</em>  You're not going to get <em>taller</em> by doing some sort of workout or eating some particular food or anything like that.  You might get <em>larger</em>, but you're really not going to increase your height that way.</p>
<p>However, if you are <em>malnourished,</em> you can certainly end up shorter than your body's 'blueprints' intended.  See - the entire population of North Korea.</p>
<p>So too it goes with intelligence.  It seems as though your genetics proscribe a more or less fixed potential.  Brain damage, mal-nourishment, or an utter lack of mental stimulation can impede your achievement of this potential, but once you reach a certain minimum of care, you're not going to do anything to push your intelligence <em>beyond</em> that.  As sad as it may be to say, 'positive' nurturing doesn't seem to have a big effect on IQ. Though negative nurturing is certainly capable of hamstringing it.</p>
<p>There are various activities, solving mental puzzles and such, that will <em>temporarily</em> increase performance on IQ tests.  Which isn't that surprising.  You practice at something, you get more efficient at doing similar things.  But these do not fundamentally alter your brain structure.  These are always shown to have diminishing returns.  Gifted Learner programs in elementary schools, for instance, are shown to have - among other things - an effect on IQ scores of the kids taking them.  But if you test kids' IQs more than a year later in middle school, there is no way to statistically <em>distinguish</em> the kids who participated in the program vs a controlled group that did not (based on their IQ scores.)</p>
<p>But to answer your question -  yes, very heritable.  Which, to an extent, may not be preferable given how much intelligence is a predictor of success in life (obviously.)</p>
<p>But it should be said it is not the end-all, be-all. Conscientiousness (ie, dedication, focus, hard-work) is right up there with it.  And while people vary widely  on that, and it is also heritable to a lesser degree, it is a behavior that is far easier to force.  You can buckle down and do work in a way that you can't buckle down and just <em>be smarter.</em>  And that kind of work ethic will often take your further than raw, untempered intelligence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It definitely is, though researchers have been unable to agree on a number in the nature vs nurture debate. Twins that have been separated at birth tend to end up largely similar in intelligence regardless of upbringing, kids that are adopted at birth are more likely to score around the same as their biological parents, not their adoptive ones. It doesn't matter if it's a 50/50 or 95/5 split, intelligence is definitely hereditary.</p>
<p>I think the idea that intelligence is hereditary should be fairly obvious - people readily agree that pretty much everything about us - height, appearance, predisposition for illness and defects etc - is genetically determined - so why should cognitive function be an exception? The only reason that people who believe in genetics would believe otherwise is because it's a touchy subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The maximum IQ of a person is mostly determined by genes.  However, many things can lower a person's IQ and a few things, beyond healthy diet and exercise, may even increase IQ.  Height is often compared to IQ and is a mostly effective comparison, both are very heritable compared to other personal characteristics.</p>
<p>IQ is the broadest form of intelligence that can be reliably measured.  It can be thought of as the average speed that a person learns a variety of different things.  It is widely recognized that there are other forms of intelligence.  These other forms are harder to measure, and heritability is therefore hard to determine.  However, IQ is so highly heritable that other forms of intelligence are likely less heritable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Certainly there is a hereditary component to intelligence, but there are a host of other factors involved. </p>
<p>The general health of the woman carrying the baby, access to proper nutrition, in some parts of the world environmental components also play a major role.</p>
<p>There have also been some studies linking IQ reduction to a pregant woman smoking cigarettes during her pregnancy. Studies have also shown cognitive defects due to marijana use by the mother while pregnant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
