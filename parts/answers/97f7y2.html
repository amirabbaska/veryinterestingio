		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geologist graduate here:
Before Pangea, we had a supercontinent called Rodinia, and another prior to it (evidence gets weaker over time due to crust destruction). Depending on the direction and movement of plates, some continents will collide again, and some will tear apart (east Africa).
The process of moving the plates relies on how much the mid ocean ridges are pushing out new oceanic crust, how quickly the old oceanic crust is getting sucked under bouyant continental crust, and movements in the asthenosphere.
To be honest, i have no idea how long away the next supercontinent is. Pangea was approx 200mya, Rodinia approx 750mya. Rodinia also hung around for a longer period of time than Pangea.
I hope I helped answer some of your questions. </p>
<p>Fun fact: they believe the initial move to break up Pangea was caused by insulation under the land mass, which heated up, allowing magma to melt above crust and swell and push the land masses apart. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A very general answer to your two questions - absolutely not a guarantee but yes it is possible, and a LONG time. The land masses we know today have come together and separated more than once over the last 4.5 billion years, and could come together again as tectonic plates continue to interact with one another - pulling apart, pushing together, and/or sliding past one another.  However, there's no guarantee they'll simply meet up on the opposite sides, as there are complex and varying forces acting on the tectonic plates, so we can't, or shouldn't, assume their trajectories after pulling apart will be linear over the following hundreds of millions of years it would take for them to move towards one another once again. And just a tad more about how long it could take - the tectonic plates containing the US and Europe are currently moving away from one another at a rate of approximately 1 inch or 2.5 cm per year, roughly at the pace at which our fingernails grow. While some plates may move more quickly, others can move even more slowly, so again, the theoretical timeline for another supercontinent is a long ass time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To my knowledge, there are some reasonable answers in this thread already. It could happen but it would take at least a few 100 million years. In geology landmasses drifting apart and then rejoining again are part of a process called the Wilson Cycle (not to confuse with the Supercontinent Cycle). Therefore, it’s actually more likely that the continents will rejoin again on ‘this side’ of the earth than on the opposite side. To visualize this I found a great video for you on YT:  <a href="https://youtu.be/uLahVJNnoZ4" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/uLahVJNnoZ4</a>
The video is made by C.R. Scotese who is a leader in this field of research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the plates are complex systems, it's not possible to predict very far into the future. We know that the mid Atlantic rift/spreading zone is pushing NorthAm to the west where it's overriding the Pacific plate in many areas. </p>
<p>but very much prediction that far into the future is impossible, because the interacting factors are too great.</p>
<p>This is the problem with complex systems. It's very hard to predict outcomes with them, which is why weather forecasting is likely forever limited, because extremely tiny effects can greatly grow into unexpected, emergent phenomena. such as tropical storms, and cyclones. Volcanic eruptions and major quakes along faults have the same kind of problems with predictions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
