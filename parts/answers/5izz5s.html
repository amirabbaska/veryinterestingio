		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fingerprints start at a junction layer of skin called the Papillary Junction. It's where the dermis and epidermis meet. The friction caused by different growth rates of these layers of skin causes tension and, in turn, the fingerprint ridges. </p>
<p>Strangely, the above is just a leading theory. There's really no agreed upon it fully researched answer, mostly because who cares? And why care? </p>
<p>So, as others have said, damage past that junction and you've damaged the &quot;source&quot; of your fingerprint. </p>
<p>Source: extracted fingerprints from internal 3D scans of the fingertip for my Research. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fingerprint extends pretty far into the layers of skin, pretty much all the way through.  So new growth follows the old growth pattern.  Though, If you cut deep enough and remove a large enough area the fingerprint will not grow back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how deep the cut. Several years ago I sliced right into my pinky and smashed the bone up. I now have a scar where I cut - not finger print.</p>
<p>Also, finger prints can be worn away over time - people such as builders can lose they finger prints.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One time I cut the ring finger on my left hand to the bone while cutting carrots. After washing the wound I pushed the meat back in and superglued it shut.  The finger print scarred when it healed.  The print is still &quot;warped&quot; around the white line of the scar.  Four years later, the print is still altered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
