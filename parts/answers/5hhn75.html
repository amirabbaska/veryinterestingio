		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fact that black holes have a temperature was first discovered by Hawking.  The temperature of a black hole is inversely proportional to its mass.  The bigger the black hole, the lower its temperature.</p>
<p>But it takes a really small black hole to get a temperature you'd consider warm.  If the mass of the Sun were compressed into a black hole, it would be about .0000001 degrees above absolute zero.  To get to a black hole whose temperature was around room temperature on the Earth, you'd be looking at a black hole with about half a percent of the mass of the Moon (it would be about a micrometer across!)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Given that a black hole's singularity is an infinitely dense object (theoretically) is it infinitely hot?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we talk about black holes, and especially the temperature of a black hole, we are generally talking about the event horizon, and not the singularity, as the later can't be observed, and thus in a sense don't have those kinds of traits. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
