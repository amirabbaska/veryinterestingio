		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The clue is the less protection part. In a car you have a safe cage around the occupants and a lot of crumple zones and airbags to keep you save in the event of a crash. So the best place to be is firmly in place strapped inside the car to the seat where all the protection works best. However in a motorcycle there is nothing protecting you in a crash. You are already sitting on the outside of the vehicle. So the best way to avoid injury is to get away from any potential heavy pieces of wreckage as possible. You would rather have the bike hit something after you have gotten away then if you were squished in the middle of the collision. This is why motorcyclists have protection to their bodies instead of on the vehicle. The helmet, suit, boots and gloves are designed to give someone good protection from smaller bumps and scrapes which make a collision survivable as long as you are able to get away from the biggest impacts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, in a bike accident it's safest to &quot;throw&quot; the bike away and hence avoid being hit by it / trapped under it. Watch some bike racing crash reels, you'll see the riders literally throw the bike away in a crash and go &quot;ragdoll&quot; to avoid injury.</p>
<p>Second, bikes are one of those inventions that would never be allowed if they hadn't been around for 100 years. If we didn't have them already, you'd never be allowed to introduce them.</p>
<p>In many places, riding without a helmet is an offence - although ironically it means the police may not chase you for fear of causing you to fall off &amp; kill yourself. Certainly the case in the UK, a lot of young scrotes on illegal/unlicensed scooters &amp; dirt bikes deliberately ride without helmets so they can't be chased.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer is that for a motorcyclist it is <em>more</em> dangerous to be strapped to the bike. In a car you crash and have a seatbelt you're kept relatively safe, the safety devices can activate without you're head being in the wrong area where it'll do more damage than protection, the seatbelt is about keeping you safe in a confined space where many things can hurt you.</p>
<p>On a bike, being connected to it can lead to worse outcomes. If it crashes and begins sliding, you need to be able to leave it so it doesn't drag you along asphalt at 60mph, or under a guard rail into a dangerous drop, or even into more vehicles. The ability to disconnect yourself from the crash is more important. That is why the safety precautions are focused on the individual separate from the bike (helmet, padded suits, etc.) A car can't safely take you out of the crash, so it has to make it safer for you during a crash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>ELI5:</strong> Cars and motorcycles are different so there are different rules.</p>
<p><strong>ELI15:</strong> Motorcycles are inherently unsafe. Making them safe turns them into a car.</p>
<p><strong>ELI30:</strong> Insurance companies push safety laws. There are 210 million car drivers and 8 million motorcycle drivers. Also, motorcycles are cheaper and usually do less damage in an accident. Car accidents cost more and are more frequent than motorcycle accidents so insurance companies focus their lobbying money in that area. (Motorcycle accidents often kill the cyclist so health costs are morbidly minimized.)</p>
<p><strong>ELI50:</strong> Why are you asking me? You made the laws!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because a seatbelt is not giving extra protection on a motorcycle since in the case of an accident being bound to the motorcycle is actually more dangerous than flying off.</p>
<p>In the case of a car the seatbelt is increasing the safety in the case of an accident very much and is preinstalled in every car, so the only reason not to wear it is you being too lazy to put it on. Therefore they introduced the punishment to make sure people would use it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
