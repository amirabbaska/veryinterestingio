This only works with complete severing. A partial severing of the arteries will result in severe hemorrhagic blood loss and rapid decline to death. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arteries have muscle in their walls. This muscle can clamp down and even large vessels can occlude themselves after trauma.  There's a big problem with partial injuries though.  Basically a partially cut artery bleeds more and can't close itself off by the muscle in its wall squeezing.  A completely cut artery has a much better chance of doing so.</p>
<p>Even so a big injury and a severed femoral artery in amputation through the thigh or big laceration is very likely fatal without immediate assistance. The black hawk down scene where the soldier dies after the leg wound showed this in a very accurate way.
A radial artery (wrist) will usually close itself off spontaneously after being transected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seeing how there're already 186 comments on this post, this's probably already been answered, but - I don't feel like scrolling through it all to check. </p>
<p>SO - in case it hasn't been answered - basically the difference between a limb getting severed and a laceration of the limb is the surface-area of exposure of the blood vessels, along with blood vessel elasticity. </p>
<p>In the case of a laceration, a large section of the blood vessel will be compromised (especially when it's a tear down the length of it) which prevents platelets from being able to fully staunch the bleeding. </p>
<p>In the case of severing, usually the blood vessels are cut more or less cleanly cross-wise, so there's a much smaller 'hole' for the platelets to do their clotting work, which means they are more effective. Also - the blood vessels themselves will draw up inside the severed stump, due to their elasticity, where the clotting (now inside the 'meat' of the stump is made even more effective.</p>
<p>Think of it this way - if you have a leaky jug of water, is it easier to plug the leak if it's from a hole, or from a large gash?</p>
<p>This is not to say that a person with a severed limb cannot still bleed out. It depends on how high up on the limb is (ie, how large the major blood vessels are, in that part of the limb), and how cleanly cross-wise the blood vessels are cut.</p>
<p>In either case, you'd still want to apply a tourniquet as soon as humanly possible in the case of a stump, and also in the case of a laceration if the blood is forcibly squirting out (that means it's an artery, which is .. very bad), OR if you apply a tight pressure-dressing over the laceration, and the bleeding hasn't stopped after another minute or two.</p>
<p>And - always - when you apply a tourniquet - DO NOT remove it. When you put one on someone, you are effectively &quot;giving up&quot; on that limb (you're completely cutting off the blood supply for an extended period), and it should always be a Last Resort, when you're faced with a choice of either losing the limb, or losing the patient. </p>
<p>AND ALWAYS MARK A &quot;T,&quot; AND THE TIME YOU APPLIED THE TOURNIQUET, ON THE VICTIM'S FOREHEAD (write it with your finger, using their blood - it's gross, but it's also very quick, and time is critical!). This let's the Doctor that removes the tourniquet know how long it's been since you put it on, so they can determine whether the limb can still be saved, or whether they will need to amputate. Otherwise, not writing &quot;T+time&quot; pretty much means they will lose that limb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trauma nurse here. Some of this comes from the approach to injury. A severed limb is obviously going to lead to exsanguination, so a torniquet will often be applied immediately, or close enough to immediately. Something penetrating, or from blunt force, such as pelvic injuries from a road traffic collision, or a stab wound that dissects the SFA artery, might take some time to identify, stop the bleeding and treat. Young people can often maintain pulse and blood pressure for some time even taking massive blood loss into account, they often shock in very late stages of hemmorhage.</p>
<p>When it comes to treatment, its easy to close a bleeding vessel you can see. Something like a vessel in the pelvis, or something through the aorta, subclavian vessels, hepatic arteries etc. is a lot harder because teaditionally you would have to first identify the bleed via CT angiogram before stopping the vessel by exploratory surgery. However, increasingly, surgical innovations like interventional radiology or REBOA are improving patient outcomes for the bleeding vessels which are harder to find by being less intrusive and stopping the bleeding sooner.</p>
<p>Very happy to talk more about REBOA if people are interested as our hospital completed the first successful procedure in the UK. BBC’s ‘an hour to save your life’ has an episode which features this procedure as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Try to remember that people regularly die from both of these events. Its not like people getting limbs severed are surviving more, its just possible, and everything is circumstance. If you lose a limb in the middle of a national forest you're likely toast. Same with severing a major artery in your leg (or anywhere). Its possible, but they are both mortal wounds that take peoples lives regularly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
