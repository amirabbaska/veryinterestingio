		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually studied musicology and cultural attitudes towards music, so this is an informed answer!</p>
<p>tl;dr: It's complicated as fuck.</p>
<p>Let's start low-level.  Attitudes towards harmonies, scales, musical tones, etc. seem to be mostly cultural.  People across cultures recognize the octave interval (because it's natural; going up an octave means doubling the frequency of the note).  The octave interval is universally pleasing to one degree or another.  Beyond that, it is hard to make any generalizations about what sounds &quot;nice.&quot;  In most Western cultures (with a shared musical tradition), the major scale sounds &quot;nice,&quot; but that is not true in other cultures.  Arabic music involves minute pitch changes, which Westerners would either not notice, or would perceive as unpleasant or foreign; those who grew up with Arabic find it pleasing.  So the first step in developing your musical tastes is <strong>what is reinforced culturally</strong> on a very low level like note intervals and chords.</p>
<p>After that, we can move up a level to things like chord progressions.  These are still culturally informed, but not as strongly.  The I - V - vi - IV progression, famously <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4I" target="_blank">parodied by Axis of Awesome</a>, evokes various emotions of redemption or hope in Westerners, but that is only because we've been exposed to movies and TV shows and songs which use that pattern emotionally.  People who grow up with no exposure to Western music do not show that kind of emotional response to this pattern.  <strong>Emotional content of music is not inherent, but what you're trained to hear</strong>.</p>
<p>The same thing applies to subcultures.  Someone who is not interested in speed metal, and who has very little exposure to it, will literally just hear it as fast noise, because they don't have cultural/emotional associations tied to it.  If you grow up with speed metal, or you start listening to it because of your friends, you will become &quot;fluent&quot; in its &quot;language&quot; and certain tropes will become more meaningful to you.  <strong>You can learn appreciation of musical tropes</strong>.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, musicians or those musically trained show a higher emotional connection to music of all kinds, because they're fluent in a wide range of compositional techniques)</p>
<p>Beyond that, it gets weird and complex and is an area of active research.  There's lots of evidence that exposure to music can make you get used to it and even like it, and music is definitely used as a social tool, so the conclusion there is that <strong>your tastes are affected by what your family &amp; friends like</strong>.  Some research suggests that given <strong>personality traits are linked to musical tastes</strong>; this may seem like an obvious conclusion, but with things as nebulous and hard-to-nail-down like &quot;personality&quot; it's an important question to approach scientifically.  People with a high degree of empathy seem to prefer mellow music like indie rock or some pop, while people with an analytical brain prefer complex/harsh music like metal (Greenberg, Baron-Cohen, Stillwell, Kosinski, &amp; Rentfrow, 2015).</p>
<p>Finally things can get even more wild.  There is evidence that high testosterone levels, particularly in men, are correlated to a dislike of complex music.  Neurological differences in the brain may impact what you get out of music.  It's an exciting area of research!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A current study shows that it's what your father forced you to listen to in the car as a child.  In one study, a 6 year old girl became suddenly a huge fan of Rage against the Machine and Haken's &quot;Cockroach King&quot;. She also displayed a fondness for Metallica&quot;s &quot;Call of the Cthullu&quot; after being told who H.P. Lovecraft and the Cthullu was.  And oddly &quot;Abracadabra&quot; by The Steve Miller Band is also an outlier.  The study is ongoing but the hypothesis is that musical tastes are driven by initial exposure and evolve over time from that point of initial exposure.  </p>
<p>Source - I force my kid to listen specific music and see what she likes.   Thus far, she has good taste.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about familiarity. Whatever you've heard before, you'll like more. They call it the &quot;mere-exposure&quot; effect in psychology. Wikipedia has a nice overview with some simple experiments to explain the effect:</p>
<p>&quot;Tones of two different frequencies were played to different groups of chicks while they were still unhatched. Once hatched, each tone was played to both groups of chicks. Each set of chicks consistently chose the tone prenatally played to it.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Zajonc (a researcher) tested the mere-exposure effect by exposing Chinese characters for shorts amounts of time to two groups of individuals. The individuals were then told that these symbols represented adjectives and were asked to rate whether the symbols held positive or negative connotations. The symbols that had been previously seen by the test subjects were consistently rated more positively than those unseen...Members of the group with repeated exposure to certain characters reported being in better moods and felt more positive than those who did not receive repeated exposure.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Zajonc, the mere-exposure effect is capable of taking place without conscious cognition, and that &quot;preferences need no inferences&quot;.</p>
<p>So, you like certain music cause you've heard stuff like it before, even if you didn't really think about or notice it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading somewhere that our music taste is mostly affected by the music we are exposed to when we are young. This makes that &quot;New Gen&quot; music is mostly written off as shit by someone who listened to (their) &quot;good&quot; music. If we don't keep this in mind, we will all yell: &quot;Old music is way more better&quot; at some point - which may be true, but you need to have grounded arguments to back up that statement.</p>
<p>For me personally, I actively try to maintain an open mindset when it comes to different genres, different styles etc. Nowadays any noise can be classified as music (looking at you dubstep), so don't go and argue whether it is or isn't. Whenever I hear a new song, I say to myself: &quot;There must be a place, a time, a situation where this song will be a perfect fit.&quot; And by that logic I will try to enjoy it for what it is. Experience also tells me that frequent exposure to things you initially don't like can make it more tolerable - some songs/artist need to be listened to more than once before you can form a good opinion. It is an acquired taste after all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
