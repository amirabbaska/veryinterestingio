		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a completely unnecessary concept. It's also ambiguous. If you define relativistic mass such that you maintain the non-relativistic expression for Newton's second law, you actually get <em>different</em> relativistic masses depending on the direction of the acceleration relative to the velocity of the object.</p>
<p>Physicists prefer to work in terms of Lorentz-invariant quantities whenever possible, and relativistic mass is not Lorentz-invariant. The only mass we ever need to talk about is the invariant mass. That is what physicists refer to simply as &quot;mass&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>We already have a different name for it - energy. If something is relativistic physicists tend to work with units where the speed of light is 1, and then energy and relativistic mass are the same. There is no point in two names for the same thing.</li>
<li>You would have to say &quot;rest mass&quot; all the time instead of &quot;mass&quot; for this important concept.</li>
<li>You can't use the relativistic mass as mass most of the time. You want F=ma with the relativistic mass? That works for forces orthogonal to the direction of motion, but not for forces along the direction of motion where you would need a separate law.  Acceleration and force don't have to point in the same direction in space - you can't save that law unless you consider 4-vectors. You want F=GMm/r^(2)? Well that doesn't work either with the relativistic mass. It needs yet another modification.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to all this, it also confuses. Because people start saying things like &quot;But if photons don't get a relativistic mass, how come they can be bent by gravity?&quot; or &quot;But if particles don't get a relativistic mass, how can two light particles create one heavier particle?&quot; Also, people start thinking that in order to have a light particle decay to a heavier particle, you just need to accelerate it to get a higher relativistic mass than the particle into which it should decay. </p>
<p>Obviously these kind of things do not directly come from the definition of relativistic mass, but relativistic mass makes it easier for people to fall for these fallacies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
