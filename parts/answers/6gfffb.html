		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the old meanings of &quot;late&quot; was &quot;occuring in the recent past&quot;. Nowadays this meaning only really survives in the phrase &quot;of late&quot; and the adverb &quot;lately&quot;.  </p>
<p>In this sense, when a person was described as late it meant that they had only recently died (i.e. they were a living person up until the recent past).  </p>
<p>And although it no longer fully carries the connotation of the death being in the recent past, it is still only really used for people who were alive in living memory (eg it would sound odd to refer to &quot;the late Ludwig van Beethoven&quot;, just about OK to refer to &quot;the late Jimi Hendrix&quot;, and fine to refer to &quot;the late Chuck Berry&quot;).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
