		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an interesting question actually, hard to give a definite answer.  Venus in a Mars orbit would certainly be much warmer than Mars due to it's atmosphere. It would still have a dense atmosphere of carbon dioxide with almost no oxygen (edit: ,nitrogen and hydrogen), but life could possibly adapt to this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing everybody failed to mention is Venus, unlike earth, does not have a strong magnetic field or a magnosphere. Without it, large quantities of hydrogen is lost to solar wind. Without hydrogen there cannot be water, hydrocarbons and almost every other building block of life. Even today atmosphere of Venus is very dry because the planet doesn't have hydrogen to form water. </p>
<p>Even if you switch it's location with mars it would still lose its hydrogen. It would perhaps be a cooler version of Venus, but calculations are needed to predict how cool or hot would it be compared to earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since Venus is about the same size as Earth and made of roughly similar proportions of elements, it should be a cooler version of Earth if it were in Mar's orbit.  The main factor that is different is the absence of a moon like ours.  It is already assumed that Venus could have had water in its earliest days but that its oceans, if any, evaporated and the water molecules were broken apart in the upper atmosphere by solar radiation, hydrogen was lost to space (being lighter) and oxygen combined with carbon to help form the dense CO2 atmosphere it has today.  From what I understand, Earth and Venus have about the same amount of carbon, the key difference is that it is all up in the air in Venus due to its high temperatures which would melt limestone or any other form of carbon that would otherwise be sequestered in the crust.  Lack of water means no plate tectonics to keep most carbon out of the atmosphere nor oceans to absorb lots of carbon dioxide.  It is possible that Venus in Mar's orbit could be a frozen world too, as this has happened to our own planet more than once before significant animal life evolved.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
