		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>While the other answers are correct in their physics, I don't think they exactly answer your question. When a laser &quot;bores&quot; through a material, generally it's simply burning it. Just like using a magnifying glass to burn a hole in a piece of paper.<br><br>This happens because the photons contain energy E=hf where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency of the light. If the material absorbs the photon, then it gains that energy in the form of heat. Heat it up enough then it evaporates. If you're afraid of someone attacking you with lasers, if you cover yourself in shiny material, then instead of absorbing the photons you reflect them away from you.<br><br>The other momentum based answers are interesting though in that you'll gain a tiny amount of heat from the change in momentum (the result being the reflected light is a litter redder than the incoming light) and, more importantly, this method can be used at small scales to push objects around. Some instances are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_tweezers" target="_blank">optical tweezers</a> and other instances are in attempts at fusion where lasers compress a material to attempt to get it dense enough to fuse.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Photons have energy and momentum. Having no mass just means they cannot travel at any slower speed than the speed of light. They never slow down or stop. The equation you quote is the REST mass, which does not apply to photons.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I don't think anyone actually answered your question. There is a mistake in your premise. <br><br>A laser like one used to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_cutting" target="_blank">cut through metal</a> doesn't cut in the same way as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_jet_cutter" target="_blank">compressed water jet</a>. The water jet cuts using physical collisions with water molecules at high seed and knocking material free. Lasers used for cutting impart energy in the form of heat which either melts or burns the material being cut. A laser does impart a small amount of momentum, but it's essentially insignificant compared to the heat produced. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There's a lot of confusion between rest mass, m0, relativistic mass, m, rest energy, E0 and total energy, E in this thread. Maybe someone else has explained, but I can't see it while skimming down, so I'll try.<br><br>A lot of people are saying that E=mc^2 isn't the end of the story, and that you need to use E^2 =p^2 c^2 + m0^2 c^4 for photons, which is true. Unfortunately, I haven't seen anyone point out that you have to use m0 in the latter equation, and is probably causing a lot of issues. Anyway, this does not mean that E=mc^2 is <em>wrong</em> when used in the correct situations. It actually works for E0=m0c^2, to get the rest energy using the rest mass. It also works for total energy for a moving mass, E=mc^2, but here we have to use relativistic mass, where m=gamma<em>m0. You can look up the gamma function, but it relies on the velocity of the rest frame of the mass in question compared to the observation frame. The problem with applying E=mc^2 for photons is that they don't </em>have<em> a rest frame, and so you have to use the </em>alternate* equation E^2 = p^2 c^2 + m0^2 c^4, where m0=0.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
