		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ex-Submarine Officer here. Actually, the deep ocean water (deeper than about 1.25 miles) actually stays very close to 4C. It typically hovers between 3C and 5C, staying closer to the lower end of that range.</p>
<p>The water is salty too, so that affects its density as well. The ocean is constantly churning and flowing, so there's mixing which helps distribute the minimal heat you have. The currents that come from the poles (much cooler water) also sink and ride along the bottom of the ocean because of their density. This also churns the deep ocean water and keeps it fairly uniform.</p>
<p>This Effect isn't noticeable in shallow waters (&lt;1.25miles) because in shallow waters you have atmospheric warming and cooling and solar warming. The largest affect above 1.25 mile depth is solar radiation (how much sunlight is hitting the surface). This gives seasonal effects in shallower waters.</p>
<p>Here's a really nice site that helps describe what's happening: <a href="http://marinebio.org/oceans/temperature/" target="_blank">The Ocean and Temperature</a></p>
<p>TL;DR: The deep ocean stay very close to 4C, but variations in salinity and ocean currents causes that to fluctuate between about 3C and 5C. Shallow water is affected by solar radiation and atmospheric effects so it doesn't exhibit the same tendency as the deep ocean.</p>
<p>EDIT: An interesting side note about ocean water density: Submarines have to account for salinity as they pass through different parts of the ocean. If the salinity drops the submarine will start to sink since the water around it is less dense and the sub will displace less water mass. This is particularly noticeable near the mouth of the Amazon, which spews enough fresh water into the ocean that a sailor on the surface could drink straight from the ocean out to sea for about 200 miles! The freshwater stays in the top layer of ocean because it's less dense. </p>
<p>See the picture on this site for an idea of how much water the Amazon dumps out: <a href="http://amazoncontinuum.org/research" target="_blank">Site</a></p>
<p>EDIT: Dummy me used &quot;affect&quot; instead of &quot;effect&quot; thanks to my brain-voice's Texas accent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is only true for fresh water. Salt water continues to become more dense as the temperature decreases, right to the freezing point (-1.7C depending on salinity). As a result the deep ocean is around 1C.</p>
<p>This <em>does</em> occur in fresh water lakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>4°C only applies to fresh water. Saline water increases in density with decreasing temperature until it freezes (which typically won't happen until ~ -2°C), so basically the lower you go the colder and denser it will be (with regards to density, <em>mostly</em>).</p>
<p>You're also assuming that ocean waters are uniformly mixed in terms of their properties. In the ocean there are what are called masses of water, which are given names based on their origin geographically, which also have distinct physiochemical properties. Measuring things in the ocean tends to be difficult due to the changing pressure with depth, so density is calculated from other properties like temperature and salinity. Salinity is straight forward, but temperature is not, again due to changes in pressure with depth. If you want to start getting into in situ vs potential temperature, let me know. Here's some light reading on the <a href="http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/ocng_textbook/chapter06/chapter06_05.htm" target="_blank">concepts</a>.</p>
<p>The short way to put it is that salinity is involved and that pressure is a bigger factor in the ocean. An example of that is in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antarctic_Bottom_Water" target="_blank">Antarctic Bottom Water</a>, specifically from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weddell_Sea_Bottom_Water" target="_blank">Weddell Sea</a>. The pressure from ice makes the water below colder without freezing. Water with different properties tend to make the ocean much more heterogeneous than people expect it to be. It pretty much depends where the water came from, and can be visually presented in what are called <a href="http://oceanworld.tamu.edu/resources/ocng_textbook/chapter13/Images/Fig13-11.htm" target="_blank">T-S diagrams</a> (temperature-salinity diagrams), which typically have temperature and depth (in bars, which are pressure) on the y-axis and salinity on the x-axis. High salinity and low temperature tends to increase density, and there's another phenomenon called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabbeling" target="_blank">cabbeling</a>, where two masses of water will mix and have higher density than either of the two individual masses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was in response to a deleted comment, but I wanted to post it anyways in case it is interesting to read for anyone else:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are atoms of oxygen dissolved in the water?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, exactly that. It can be difficult to think of oxygen as &quot;dissolved&quot; because we usually think of it as a gas, but it dissolves in exactly the same way as, say, food coloring dropped into water. Individual molecules of food coloring (or oxygen) disperse until they are evenly distributed within the water. It can be slightly more complicated than that due to molecular charges and such, but that's a pretty accurate way to think about it in general. </p>
<p>Why doesn't the oxygen just leave the water and go into the air then? It does, actually. Except at the same time some oxygen is leaving, some oxygen is also entering the water. In this case, the surface of the water is actually something of a barrier for oxygen entering or leaving the water, and it takes a bit of time and energy for the oxygen to move from water to air or air to water. </p>
<p>As a thought experiment, if you put water with no oxygen in a sealed jar and then put some pure air oxygen in the jar with it, oxygen will start to dissolve into the water. At the start, there won't be any oxygen in the water, so it will be a one-way transfer of oxygen from the air into the water. Once you have some oxygen in the water though, a little will seep back out into the air, but it will still be less than what's entering the water. Eventually, given enough time, the amount of oxygen entering and leaving the water will be the same, and you'll have reached equilibrium. The amount of oxygen in the water will appear to stay the same if you're measuring it, but in reality, a small amount is always entering and leaving the water. </p>
<p>Lakes are slightly more complex, though. There are things that are both producing oxygen (algae mainly, also some underwater plants) and things breathing (i.e., consuming oxygen, basically all animals and non-plant life). During the summer, the top layers of the lake that are warmed by the sun ALSO support algae, since the light is needed for photosynthesis. These algae near the surface produce more oxygen than the fish and other things can breathe, so the lake actually ends up &quot;supersaturated&quot; with oxygen, meaning there is more oxygen leaving the lake than entering it from the air. </p>
<p>This changes in winter if a lake freezes over though. Suddenly, less light is making it into the lake and the temperatures are colder, so less algae is living in the lake and producing oxygen. So suddenly you have tons of fish and other things breathing, but the only source of oxygen is what can enter the lake from the air, and you have a giant ice barrier slowing that exchange. The fish and other stuff can literally breathe enough to take most of the oxygen out of the water, and they suffocate from lack of oxygen. This is called a &quot;<a href="http://www.michigan.gov/dnr/0,1607,7-153-10364-119822--,00.html" target="_blank">winterkill</a>&quot;, and as you can imagine they generally happen during particularly long or harsh winters. You can tell they've happened when you suddenly see large numbers of dead fish floating on the lake, often right after the surface ice melts.</p>
<p>I know this was a ton more info than you asked for, but you hit on a super important aspect of lake life with dissolved oxygen. If you just measure dissolved oxygen in a lake, you can tell an amazing amount about what type of lake it is, what type of pollution it is exposed to, etc etc. I skipped over a few more interactions (temperature being another main one), but you can do a pretty good job modelling seasonal life in a temperate lake just by thinking about dissolved oxygen. </p>
<p>I tried to find some real data to look at, but most of the sites I know that post data have taken their instrumentation offline for winter because ice eats sensors. But Dorset in Canada has their system up yet, which is awesome, and you can see their real-time data here: </p>
<p><a href="http://desc.ca/data/THELMA" target="_blank">Dorset Buoy  </a></p>
<p>They don't have a dissolved oxygen sensor (sadface), but the bottom graph is a graph of the thermal profile, so they have a sensor...it looks like every 15-25 centimeters. You can see that the current warmest water is at the 18 meter sensor, which is depth from surface, so it's 18 meters down. It's sitting at 3.32 deg celcius, which is close to 4, and I don't know enough about the lake to know why it isn't exactly at 4. </p>
<p>The Global Lakes Environmental Observatory Network (<a href="http://www.gleon.org/" target="_blank">GLEON</a>) often has more links to real-time data, but again, right now much is offline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
