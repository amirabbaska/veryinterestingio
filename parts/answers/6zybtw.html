		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's simply so little of it. A couple of dust impacts over a whole mission, maybe.</p>
<p>I'd be interested in seeing what happens to voyager in a billion years, maybe it would run into some occasional bits in interstellar space and become a cloud of dust heading in one direction. More likely it won't run into much and will eventually get stuck in a huge orbit around a black hole after being swung around a few it was too fast for. Maybe align close enough to something like a star or black hole and get sucked in. A couple billion years from now. Would love to see the condition of it before that happens, though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spacecraft are shielded to prevent damage from micrometeoroids. These are normally called MMOD (Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris) shields, though the debris part is only relevant in Earth's orbit, not in the case of Cassini in a far away planet.</p>
<p>The basic principle is using several layers of a shielding material to break the incident micrometeoroid into dust before impacting successive layers that will stop the fragments. The first layer will be inevitably penetrated if the micrometeoroid is big enough as all the force is concentrated in a very small area. But when it breaks, smaller pieces of dust will expand and hit the successive layers over a much larger area, so they can resist well.</p>
<p>Of course this can't stop micrometeoroids of arbitrary size, so there's always some probability of penetration. There are models of micrometeoroids and orbital debris to estimate these probabilities, such as ESA's Master 2009. They are mostly based on data from NASA's LDEF and ESA's Eureca spacecraft. The shields are then calculated to stop particles up to a certain size so that the probability of hitting a bigger one becomes low enough to be acceptable.</p>
<p>Here's a slideshow that is focused in the ISS but the basic principles of shields are roughly the same: <a href="https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120002584.pdf" target="_blank">https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20120002584.pdf</a> . The main difference is that the ISS is in a much more harsh environment due to the abundance of orbital debris, and safety is more critical as it bears human lives. (Not sure if Cassini's orbit brought it very close to the rings - in that case, yes, it must have faced lots of micrometeoroids).</p>
<p>Edit: found a source that mentions Cassini specifically: <a href="https://engineer.jpl.nasa.gov/practices/1107.pdf" target="_blank">https://engineer.jpl.nasa.gov/practices/1107.pdf</a></p>
<p>It confirms Cassini's environment is much less aggressive, they only care about very small particles, so the MLI (Multi-Layer Insulation for thermal control) is enough protection to work as a micrometeoroid shield at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Space tends to be really, really empty.</p>
<p>Even places that are known for having stuff in them, like the asteroid belt, are mostly empty.</p>
<p>So while every collision is a high energy event, there tend to be too few of them to matter in the life of these crafts, and the few that happen tend to hit in places that still work with a little damage.</p>
<p>Now if you want to create a ship that has to survive for several generations while also protecting these same fragile generations, it gets a little more complicated. But even then radiation is a bigger issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was hoping to contribute, but it's probably a bit late for that. I actually did research on dust - impacts on spacecraft this past summer! The answer to the question really is that the dust is so small (nanometer/micrometer) and moves so fast that on impact, the dust and some of the surface if the spacecraft turn into a plasma. The amount of material taken from the he spacecraft is small. The lab I worked in had a cassini model and they were looking to see long-term effects of dust impacts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
