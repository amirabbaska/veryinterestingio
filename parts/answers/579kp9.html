		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurophysiologist here, who, earlier in my life, spent over a decade studying the neurophysiology of tinnitus.</p>
<p>There is a lot of bad information here.</p>
<p>Tinnitus is the phantom perception of sound.  This means that a person with tinnitus hears a sound (usually a ringing or a whistling sound) that cannot be heard by others.  In a very small percentage of cases, a sound actually exists (usually a vascular anomaly, like an aneurysm, that causes blood to make a swishing or squirting sound) - this subgroup of people with tinnitus does not represent the majority of people with tinnitus.</p>
<p>In most cases there is no source for the sound that is perceived by the patient.  The truth is that we don't know, exactly, what causes tinnitus.  </p>
<p>What we do know, however, is that tinnitus can be caused by injury to the cochlea (the organ in the inner ear that houses the hair cells that detect vibrations in fluid that are transduced by your eardrum).  Tinnitus can also be caused by injury to the auditory nerve, and by injuries (strokes, for example) to the brainstem, midbrain, and cortex.  </p>
<p>We also know that tinnitus can be caused by exposure to noise and by certain drugs that damage the hair cells in the cochlea.</p>
<p>We also know that even when tinnitus is caused by injury to the cochlea (such as by trauma or by drugs that kill hair cells), you can remove the cochlea or cut the auditory nerve (that connects the cochlea to the brain) and the perception of tinnitus (in most people) still remains.</p>
<p>This fact tells us that, in most people with tinnitus, the generator(s) of tinnitus lie somewhere in the brain - even when the initial injury to the auditory system occurred in the inner ear (i.e. to hair cells in the cochlea).</p>
<p>Most people who study tinnitus believe that neural plasticity is involved in tinnitus.  Neural plasticity is the ability of the brain to rewire itself in response to environmental stimuli and to injury.  This ability is very useful - it enables, for example, the brain to recover some or all of its function after stoke.  </p>
<p>We think that some neurological disorders are caused when injury or environmental stimuli (like noise exposure) result in the activation of neural plasticity, resulting in one or more circuits in the auditory system to become altered - and this altered function results in the perception of sound when no sound exists.</p>
<p>For example, we have shown that chronic exposure to noise results in a change in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters in certain parts of the auditory cortex and midbrain.  This change in the balance of inhibition and excitation results in a net increase in excitation - with both theoretical and experimental evidence that this change can result in the phantom perception of sound.</p>
<p>TLDR:  The cause(s) of tinnitus in most patients is unknown, but strong experimental and clinical evidence points to neural plasticity in the brain being the reason for the phantom perception of sound.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the top post explained it well, but no one has mentioned hyperacusis or many things to do to avoid getting tinnitus in the first place. </p>
<p>Backstory: I'm 35 and has mild tinnitus for 2 years which recently got more noticeable and developed mild hyperacusis. Most people know what tinnitus is, but hyperacusis is the next progressive step which lowers your ears decibel threshold and increases sensitivity to loud noises. Loud noises are much louder and sharper than they once were and normal activities and life can be entirely negatively affected if it is severe. </p>
<p>My right ear is the main problem which started way back in my teens from a diving incident. I went down 30 feet, my ear equalized around 20 feet, I cancelled my dive and returned to the surface, but my ear was stuck at -20 foot pressure level for hours. It caused internal issues which made my right ear much easier to pop than my left and easier to get ear infections. Side note: any issues like internal damage or tubes at a younger age put you at more risk of hearing damage.</p>
<p>Throughout my 20's I noticed extremely loud volumes were perceived louder than my left ear. I didn't think much of it, but I embarked on a 10 year concert and festival binge which ultimately brought out the tinnitus. Early on I didn't use earplugs that often, but eventually o got some hifi earplugs and have used them religiously over the past 5 years. </p>
<p>When I went to see Portishead 2 years ago, I decided to spoil myself and skip earplugs. Bad idea, I came home from Europe with an ear infection and noticeable tinnitus. The ear infection went away after taking medications, but the tinnitus stuck around. It was relatively mild and easy to ignore unless it was real quiet. </p>
<p>Fast forward to now. The past 2 years made me much focused on wearing earplugs whenever needed. A few incidents while wearing earplugs (usually hifi and only 15db of protection), that were really loud would still send my tinnitus haywire for a few days or even a week at times. Concerts, yard equipment, and power tools being the culprits. </p>
<p>I went to Europe this summer including Glastonbury which is a 5-day music festival, and came home with eustacian issues along with more noticeable tinnitus.  It stayed that way for a month or so before the eustacian issues disappeared and the tinnitus got worse and developed mild hyperacusis. </p>
<p>Anxiety comes out swinging once hyperacusis and tinnitus get very noticeable which tends to aggravate it more and leads to sleepless nights and lots of research to get help to manage it. You quickly learn triggers for what makes tinnitus worse, alcohol, smoking, high blood pressure, stress, anxiety, and loud environments increase the ringing. Also hyperacusis makes it much much easier to aggravate tinnitus. Every day may be different when it's that sensitive. </p>
<p>ENT's tend to be quite unhelpful for many people, mine was particularly bad and just told me I shouldn't have been around loud volumes with tinnitus. Although true, he could have been more helpful when I visited him previously. Since he wasn't  useful other than prescribing Xanax for sleep issues, I went to UT Dallas to their tinnitus clinic. Everyone was super helpful and I had another hearing test which showed that my hearing wasn't worse since a year ago, but did confirm my right ear diving issues. I also ordered custom fitted earplugs which I should have got long ago. </p>
<p>Anyways, with that said, here are some tips I have learned the hard way regarding tinnitus and how to prevent it or keep it from getting worse. </p>
<p>Get a decibel meter app for your phone. It's good to be aware of how loud volumes are. It may not be 100% accurate, but it's a good ballpark to know when hearing protection is required. For me: driving my car is around 90db and that's my upper limit before earplugs are required. I managed one more concert after hyperacusis kicked in, but even with custom plugs or foam earplugs it was still way too loud with 95db sustained all the way up to 103db peak volume. My ears just can't handle that anymore.</p>
<p>Buy some good earplugs and keep them on your keychain. If you have tinnitus, you need the best protection you can get. Foam or custom plugs with 25 db filters are the best bet. Custom fitted musician quality ear plugs are around $200, but should be mandatory if you play music or go to a log of shows. I used etymotic hifi earplugs which sound great but only lower have 12-15db of protection. Foam earplugs give around 30db, but tend to mute the world. </p>
<p>Use foam earplugs whenever using power tools. Especially if they are above 90 db. I had a blast going to concerts for years before developing tinnitus, it would suck if I got tinnitus from mowing yards or using a leaf blower or an impact wrench. Small motors are terribly loud for me now and can give me issues even with earplugs.</p>
<p>If you are at a concert wearing earplugs and you can feel the bass in your bones, your ears will feel it also. Earplugs are helpful, but volumes that loud can still do damage regardless. This was a key point mentioned by the head of audiology when I was chatting with him. In front of the speakers is incredibly loud at times. If you are there, hifi earplugs don't cut it, you need foam or custom plugs, or just move to a different area.</p>
<p>If you have noise induced hearing damage, go see an ent immediately on that day or the next. Prednisone is a steroid that can reduce the permanent damage level if taken at onset of the damage. If you wait a few days it may be too late. Just keep this in mind if it happens to you or someone you know. </p>
<p>Earbuds at loud volumes will probably create an epidemic of kids with tinnitus, we see it all the time in the r/tinnitus subreddit. Too loud volumes are the main cause of tinnitus. Also, go there if you need help or have questions.</p>
<p>If you have any differences in ear issues, like volume sensitivity or pressure issues, or tubes surgery as a kid, you are much more likely to get hearing damage than other people and need to be more protective of your ears. You may never have issues, but it could happen much easier also. </p>
<p>I may add some other stuff if I think of it, but the goal is too avoid making tinnitus worse or preventing people from getting it in the first place. I am probably done with loud concerts unless my ears drastically improve, I shouldn't have tried for one more show after it kicked in, it was just way too loud to deal with. There are many quieter adventures to embark on in life. I'm just glad I had so much fun, but wish I would have been more protective of my ears. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The inside of our inner ears have tiny hairs which receive vibrations from the eardrum, which we perceive as sound when they send electric signals to the brain. Sometimes when sound goes above a certain amount of decibels (clapping right beside a person's ear causes ear damage),  or sustains damage long-term (if someone clapped besides your ear non-stop for hours) it causes permanent ear damage which can be a cause of tinnitus. </p>
<p>What actually produces the sound of tinnitus is when the little hairs are dead, and the brain fills in sound from what those hairs should be receiving. The sound of tinnitus and frequency differs from person to person, and can be more or less severe. </p>
<p>Me for example, have had worse bouts of tinnitus when I have stress, so I believe that is my trigger. Others triggers include caffeine, or various other conditions. </p>
<p>AFAIK, tinnitus currently does not have a cure, but tinnitus suffers can look up masking noises (various types of white noise can mask the sound and make it less annoying). </p>
<p>TL;DR: Depending on what caused the ear damage, it can permanently kill the tiny hairs in your ears, which receive vibrations from the eardrum, and convert it into electric signals sent to the brain. Brain doesn't know how to comprehend zero sound from the hairs, and produces it's own sound to make up for it. </p>
<p>I have a degree in Linguistics from University of Toronto, and suffer from mild tinnitus in my right ear. I can link sources if necessary, I'm currently out. Also, I might have missed a few key facts to how the brain actually produces the sound. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have SSCD, superior semi-circular dehiscence, which is basically a small hole or thinning of bone above ear.  Your ear is supposed to work in a closed system, like a radiator in later model cars.  My ear system has a small leak that lets stuff in and out that shouldn't be there.  So I have tinnitus and can also hear my own blinking, my own heartbeat, etc.  The whole thing also messes with pressure, so I get severe vertigo attacks as well.  They say I probably had it since birth, but it appeared at age 29; 24 years later I still deal with it.  You learn to adapt.  Surgery to fill hole is an option, but they have to lift up your brain to do it, and it's just too much risk for infection or brain damage for me.  For now, I manage with some medication and lifestyle changes, but if it get debilitating, I'll reconsider the surgery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've suffered with tinnitus for years now. At first I thought my life was over, I just randomly got it one night and it never left. Caused a year of anxiety and stress for me. That being said, it does get better. I don't know what caused mine and I've been to numerous doctors etc but it eventually gets to the point you don't notice it at all unless you pay attention. Stress does make it worse and lack of sleep. Sorry I couldn't answer OP's question, but maybe I can offer a little comfort to those experiencing it, it definitely gets better and can get to the point you don't even hear it unless you really focus. Mine started out louder than everything, it was rough at first but now I barely even notice it :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
