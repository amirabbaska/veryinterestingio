		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Posting this again as a top level to get material science upvoted over hearsay...</p>
<p>The pop is actually the rupture of the balloon material. The inflation (internal pressure) causes the material to stretch (creates a tensile stress).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The balloon is inflated the material is forced to stretch. You are turning internal pressure into tensile stress at the external surface of the balloon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is some point on the balloon where there is a material defect or stress riser which is the weakest point of the material.</p>
<ul>
<li>This could be a bit of dirt (inclusion) in the latex, or other geometric cause (folded material in the knot cannot stretch)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As we continue to inflate the balloon we reach a point where the induced stress is larger than the tensile strength of the material. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The material fails, at the instant of failure there is a small point where the failure originated. This would be the weak point mentioned earlier.</p>
</li>
<li>The failure point then is rapidly propagated throughout the material until it has released the stored energy, you hear this release as a &quot;pop&quot;. This is the sound of all that material ripping apart in the few milliseconds it takes for the balloon to pop. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TafQvch0p9o" target="_blank">You can even see this on high speed camera footage.</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The crinkle from plastic packaging is the same process. You are disturbing a natural arrangement of the material which releases energy, that is why no matter how slowly or carefully you try to open up that pack of candy the whole movie theatre can hear it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Within the elastic continuum model there are only two ways this ‘extra’ energy can be ‘dissipated’: either by emission of
elastic (sound) waves from the crack-tip region, or by the creation of rough crack surfaces, thus increasing the surface energy stored on the created crack surfaces. </p>

<p>Failure mechanics and crack propagation are the phrases to google if you want to learn more. The more energy stored the louder the pop, crackle, or bang. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
