		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't really &quot;orbiting&quot; in the traditional sense of a closed orbit with a definite period IIRC. It is a near-Earth object with a relatively stable orbit around the Sun. The earth's gravity tugs on it and affects its orbit, but it is outside of the Earth's &quot;Sphere of Influence&quot; (~0.01 AU or 1.5 million km), where Earth's gravity dominates. The moon on the other hand has a well-defined Earth-centered orbit (~384000km from surface) and lies well within the Earth's SOI. </p>
<p>I am assuming this is the object you are talking about -&gt; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_HO3" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_HO3</a></p>
<p>As for your questions:   </p>
<ol>
<li>It is highly unlikely that it collides with the moon as it doesn't even come inside Earth's SOI. It's too far away and too small to affect the tides.  </li>
<li>Orbital calculations indicate it has been a &quot;quasi-satellite&quot; for almost a century.  </li>
<li>Well, technically you can send a spacecraft there. It is a matter of figuring out the trajectory for whatever type of mission you want. Depending on it's mass, the &quot;Landing&quot; may be more of a &quot;docking&quot; due to extremely low gravity.  </li>
<li>The Wikipedia page says the object has an &quot;absolute magnitude (H)&quot; of 24. Magnitude is a way of defining brightness and the smaller the number, the brighter it is. For comparison, the moon full has an H value of +0.25. I think a difference of 1 in absolute magnitude translates to a 2.5x decrease in brightness (I may be wrong with the exact figure). So +24 is extremely dim. You would probably need a huge telescope to see it.  </li>
<li>No idea really. I would think because it is in a relatively stable orbit w.r.t the Earth, we are safe.  </li>
<li>Depends on what is on there. We really don't know much about it at this point. It is way too small and very far away. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never thought about it before, but shouldn't there be many thousands of asteroid satellites buzzing around any large mass? Surely of all the meteors that come at us every day, some would hit the sweet spot where they enter orbit rather than burning up or bouncing off?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main thing to remember is this thing is <em>tiny</em>.  Less than 100 meters wide.  The thing that killed the dinosaurs was 10,000 meters wide, and presumably moving faster relative to Earth!  This is twice as wide as the thing that made Meteor Crater, which was a 10 megaton explosion, so we shouldn't ignore the North Koreans if we see them attaching a bunch of solar sails to the thing.  But it's not capable of affecting tides or breaking the Moon or anything else earthshattering.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So it doesn't seem like it could collide with the moon, the article there states that our gravity keeps it within 38-100 times the distance of our moon at all times, so its far to distent to do that. </p>
<p>it isn't big enough to effect our tides in any way</p>
<p>it is also fairly small, so with the naked eye id doubt, but wih star gazing binocs or a telescope you could, assumeing you could zero in on it (again its rather quite small)</p>
<p>based on the article it doesn't seem like it could impact earth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In answer to your mining question:
In theory, sure. We could design and build a craft capable of mining it or bringing it closer to Earth to be mined but the expense of all the manpower, fuel, and time probably outweigh the value of whatever minerals are up there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
