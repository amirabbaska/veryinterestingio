		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be fair, Most of those marks you see our drawn on for beauty or style. I forget specifically when this became a trend but I believe it was in the 20s or the 30s when a big female actresses did this.</p>
<p>The ones that are real are usually moles.  We don't really know what causes birthmarks but people who have an excessive amount also have a risk of skin problems ranging from being easily burned to a higher risk of skin cancer. And if that's true, that would kind of explain why it's on the face since your face gets more sunlight in the rest of your body. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you were to sample all people you would probably find that moles occur in equal amounts all over the body. Ones around the eyes and mouth are considered pretty, so people with them are overrepresented in art and media </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe someone can help me out with this because I have a question too. I have this one pretty irregular indent between my eyebrows. It's nothing noticeable unless you really looked at it, and it's not a discernible shape like a circle. But I was at a party the other week and saw a girl with the exact same mark in the exact same shape and location. It was cool, then I asked where she's from and we have the exact same background. Are we cousins or some shit?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
