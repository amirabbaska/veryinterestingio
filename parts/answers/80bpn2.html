		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Orange juice is very sour and very sweet. Your tooth paste temporarily makes you unable to taste sweetness. Without the sweet there to balance it, the sourness of orange juice becomes kinda overwhelming.<br />

Admittedly far easier said than done. Perhaps it’s the god of oral hygiene who’s punishing us all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the chemicals in your toothpaste (SLS) breaks down the lipids that normally cost your taste buds and dull your sensitivity to bitter tastes. Then, the taste of a chemical that is in orange juice tastes much stronger than normal. That layer eventually restores itself awhile after brushing and your fullness to bitter is restored.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
