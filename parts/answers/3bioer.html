		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>We don't know if there's a maximum temperature.<br><br>In certain models -- string theory is one of them -- there is a maximum temperature called the <em>Hagedorn temperature</em>.  This arises because the number of possible high energy states increases sufficiently fast that as you put more energy into the system, it gets spread out over more and more states in such a way that the temperature decreases less and less for a given amount of heat put in.  Net result is that there's a temperature that is the upper limit of the temperatures that can be reached.<br><br>I'll add that even in string theory, some people think the Hagedorn temperature might not be an actual limit, but more an indication that there is a phase transition (like when a liquid turns to gas), but that's even more speculative.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>If you're interested in &quot;what is the hottest temperature achievable&quot; that may be an unanswerable question (or at least one I cannot answer), but if you want to know the defined lowest temperature, it is -0K. <br><br>It turns out any negative temperature (in K, not C or F) is actually hotter than any positive temp. The temperature scale goes something like this:<br><br>0K,... inf K, -inf K, ... -0K<br><br>This may seem odd, to answer why this is the case, you must understand a fundamental property of temperature. While temperature is defined as <a href="http://scienceworld.wolfram.com/physics/Temperature.html" target="_blank">T = dE/dS</a>, aka- Temperature is defined as the derivative of energy with respect to entropy. See, normally as entropy increases, energy increases, but you can arrange systems where the opposite happens, as entropy increases energy actually goes down. That means that temperature will be negative. <br><br>Since we know from the Second Law of Thermodynamics that in a closed system, entropy will increase, that means that energy will flow from a negative temperature system to a positive temperature system, because when a system has a negative temperature, by decreasing the energy in the system (heat), the entropy will actually go up (and in a positive system, increasing energy will lead to increased entropy, so entropy goes up there too). <br><br>And that's why negative temperature is hotter than positive- heat will flow from the negative temperature to the positive one, and a higher temperature item will have heat flow from it to a lower temperature one. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Maybe.<br><br>Steven Weinberg addressed this question in the 1996 updated version of &quot;The First Three Minutes&quot; (Afterword P 190-191)<br><br><em>...the continued success of the &quot;asymptotically free&quot; theory of strong interactions has by now made obsolete the speculations in Chapter VII about a maximum temperature of two million <br>million degrees Kelvin (10^12 ºK). At higher temperatures, nuclear particles dissolve<br>into the quarks they are made of, and the matter of the universe behaves, quite<br>simply, as a gas of quarks, leptons, and photons. The description of matter only<br>becomes greatly difficult at the much higher temperature of 100 million <br>million million million million degrees (10^32 ºK), where gravitation becomes as<br>strong as the other forces. Theorists have been speculating about the theory that<br>governs matter at these temperatures, but we are a long way from any direct<br>experimental test of these speculations.<br>The most exciting speculative theories studied since 1977 have been the<br>string theories. These replace the description of matter in terms of particles with<br>a description in terms of strings—tiny one-dimensional discontinuities in<br>space-time. The strings can be in any one of an infinite number of modes of<br>vibration, each of which appears to us as a different species of elementary <br>particle. Gravity appears not only naturally but inevitably in string theories; the<br>quantum of gravitational radiation is one of the modes of vibration of a closed<br>string.</em> <strong>There may be a maximum temperature in modern string theories, but it<br>would be in the neighborhood of 10^32 ºK, not 10^12 ºK.</strong><br><br><em>Unfortunately, there are thousands of versions of string theories, and we do<br>not know how to evaluate their consequences or why one string theory rather<br>than another should describe our universe. But there is one aspect of string <br>theories that is of great potential importance to cosmology. Our familiar <br>four-dimensional space-time continuum is not a truly fundamental ingredient of string<br>theories, but arises in the approximate descriptions of nature that only become<br>valid at temperatures below about 10^32 ºK. It may be that our real problem will<br>not be to understand the beginning of the universe, or even to decide whether<br>there really was a beginning, but rather to understand nature under conditions<br>in which time and space have no meaning.</em></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
