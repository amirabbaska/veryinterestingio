		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello. Pilot here. There are a LOT of inaccurate replies to this post. Let me clear some things up.</p>
<p>Concord stopped flying for a huuuuuuge range of reasons. No one factor or reason killed it by itself, but as a combination they mounted up and where eventually too much. I will list the main reasons that killed it off.</p>
<p><strong>1. A tiring airframe</strong></p>
<p>Aircraft have a shelf life of sorts. Unlike a car, an aircraft is exposed to a lot of stresses and strains during its operational lifetime that weaken it's structure and components. Different parts of the aircraft have different life expectancies (The engines being the largest components with the shortest life expectancy) but generally an aircraft lifespan is measured in something called cycles. Depending on the aircraft, one cycle is either one complete startup and shutdown of the engine, or one take off and landing (Regardless of how long the aircraft is actually in the air). An aircraft can only do so many of them before specific maintenance has to be carried out to extend it's life so it can do more cycles. The more it is extended, the more expensive and in depth that maintenance becomes. Eventually there comes a point where it's just not worth it and it has to be retired.</p>
<p>Concord was getting close to this point. She was an old aircraft and extending her life further and further would soon have come with complications like shortened flight hours, restrictions of movement/speed and all kinds of things that is undesirable in a commercial aircraft. I will allude to this more later, but many people view the Paris Air France crash as the end of the Concord. It wasn't. Her airframe cycle life would have killed her off a few years later regardless, but we will touch more upon that later.</p>
<p><strong>2. A reluctant maintenance company</strong></p>
<p>Airbus had a contract to maintain the Concord and it was said that they where somewhat reluctant to continue on with it beyond its renewal date. Maintaining the Concord required extremely skilled people and sophisticated facilities only a company like Airbus could bring to the table. When Airbus indicated they did not want to do it any more, that was a big problem that did not really have an immediate solution.</p>
<p><strong>3. A downturn in it's economy</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, Concord was always profitable. It can never be said to have been a huge source of profit for BA/AF and it might be fair to say it sometimes was closer to breaking even but it never ran at a loss. The reason for this was economy of scale. It ran on a schedule that allowed it to break even. Concord never flew with empty seats. The price of a ticket was astronomical and that reflected its operating costs. The upside of this was that flying on it was almost a zero wait experience that got you from London to New York in 4 hours 15 minutes once check in time was calculated. There where no queues at the airports or checking in three hours early or anything like that. Minimum check in was 45 minutes before the flight, it had it's own baggage check lines and security for only 160 people. Your time in the airport was kept to an absolute minimum. The downside of this was you couldn't book a flight to fit your dates, you fitted your dates round flying on Concord. An aircraft on the ground that isn't flying and carrying passengers absolutely haemorrhages money for an airline, but in the case of Concord the time spent on the ground was unavoidable so it was factored into the cost of a ticket.</p>
<p>That being said, there was a downturn in it's economy that began to pinch into this. As fuel prices and maintenance costs rose, the ticket prices couldn't really begin to keep up, high as they where already and it was predicted its maintenance costs would outstrip what could reasonably be claimed back in it's ticket costs in the near future. This meant at some point, the aircraft WAS going to begin operating at a loss.</p>
<p><strong>4. A loss of confidence and increased safety measures after the crash of an Air France Concord in Paris</strong></p>
<p>Many people like to believe that the loss of the Air France Concord in Paris was the final nail in the coffin for Concord. It wasn't. In fact all other things being equal it would barely have phased BA/AF in terms of worrying about the aircraft's future as the aircraft had a near flawless safety record at that time. At some point in time, every airframe has a crash for some reason. The fact Concord had operated for so long before it's first fatal accident was a testament to the aircraft.</p>
<p>However it was just one of the factors that weighed up against the aircraft.</p>
<p>A lot of safety measures had to be retrofitted to the aircraft after the crash. It's worth noting though if the crash had been directly to do with a fault in the airframe then Concord would likely have been scrapped there and then. It's no secret in the aviation world that the damage to the engine and resulting fire from the tyre debris striking the fuel tanks did not destroy the Concord. Had it remained on the ground and come to a stop it would likely have been possible to get some or maybe all of the passengers off. Sadly what destroyed the aircraft was that the plane took off before it's take off speed had been achieved and the aircraft basically stalled into the ground. Therefore BA/AF where confident that with the adaptions to the engines and fuel tank strengthening the aircraft would be as safe as it could be. However they where hugely expensive to implement and BA/AF where never fully sure of being able to recoup the costs against a potentially nervous and very small (Due to the cost of a ticket) customer base. Then 9/11 happened which further had a bad ripple effect across the airline industry and Concord unfortunately had to take some of the brunt of that as well (One of the huge impacts was no longer being allowed to visit the cockpit of Concord mid flight which was often a big part of the experience).</p>
<p><strong>5. BA/AF did not want to share their toys</strong></p>
<p>After it was announced that the Concord's would be retired, British Airways and Air France had a multitude of offers from several aviation companies to take or buy the aircraft and continue flying them. One of the most likely offers was  from Virgin Atlantic. However Richard Branson did not believe he should have to buy them after they where basically gifted to BA/AF by the French and British governments. As it turns out BA where not willing to continue operating them but they sure as hell wheren't going to let anyone else have the prestige of operating them, and as they legally owned them, they said no. It was entirely feasible they could have had a few more years in them, but BA did not want them appearing in someone elses livery.</p>
<p>Hopefully this clears up the main reasons why Concord stopped flying. It was a shame she stopped flying when she did but make no mistake, her time was coming to an end regardless of any crashes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For two reasons. </p>
<p>Firstly, was the France disaster, where a Concord took off, suffered some major malfunction, and wound up upside down on the ground, with everyone onboard dead. While it was a genuinely magnificent plane (and I did get the chance to see one arrive at my local airport once, when I was a kid), such a well-publicized disaster occurring to one of the very few Concords in the world (iirc, there were only 12 in commercial operation) killed the brand stone-dead. </p>
<p>Work was done go recover things. After years of investigation and reengineering, Concord was prepared and readied to fly once again. A press event was arranged, and a crew of press, enthusiasts, and airline senior bods were assembled for a flight from London to New York, which they hoped would reestablish the Concord as the premier choice for those who wanted fast, luxury travel. The flight was successful, the landing event for the press went exactly to plan, and everything seemed poised for success. And then, just thirty minutes later, the first plane hit the World Trade Centre. Concord's return was overshadowed by about the single worst thing that could possibly overshadow it. </p>
<p>The aviation industry took a long time to recover from those attacks. Concord's relaunch didn't stand a chance, and was given up on in mid 2002.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Concorde was never a financial success.  It cost as much as a 747 to operate, with a third of the passengers.  And when you figure all the non-flight time involved in door-to-door travel across the Atlantic, it wasn't that much faster, you are still going to waste most of your day in transit.  Finally, because of the sonic booms, it could only travel at full speed over the ocean.</p>
<p>Then in 2000, Air France flight 4950 hit some debris on the runway during takeoff, ruptured a fuel tank, and wound up crashing into a hotel.  Over 100 people died. The Concorde was grounded for a while, and by the time it returned to service, 9/11 happened, result in a decrease in air travel.  The airplane was also badly outdated and due for a major upgrade.  British Airways and Air France instead decided to pull the plug at that point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of what other people have been saying, the relative time advantage of a faster flight disappeared.</p>
<p>Let's say the flight is 3 hours vs 6 hours. That's twice as fast, that's a big deal. You could easily wake up in the morning, fly to Europe for an afternoon meeting, and fly back home in time for dinner with your family. Indeed, this is how they originally pitched it.</p>
<p>Over the years, airports have become busier, security has become tighter. You can't just hop on a plane anymore. You need to show up for your flight a couple hours in advance. Factor in the extra time you spend getting to/from the airport because a lot more people fly these days. Pretty quickly, the whole advantage of having a flight that's faster starts to disappear.</p>
<p>Even if you had the Concord available today, you couldn't really fly to Europe for your meeting and get back the same day anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wendover Productions YouTube channel has some good videos on the airline industry. They did one on the [Concorde] (<a href="https://youtu.be/n1QEj09Pe6k" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/n1QEj09Pe6k</a>) failure. </p>
<p>Plane was really expensive to operate because it had horrible fuel efficiency. It also could only seat about 1/3 as many passengers as a typical transatlantic flight so tickets were very expensive for what was basically just a coach seat. Those who could afford it, opted to pay the same price for a luxurious first class seat on a slower flight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
