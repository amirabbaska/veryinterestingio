<p>What do you think the chances are that we've already received an artificial signal of ET origin but have failed to identify it?  What are some of the challenges that might complicate this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>What is the largest technical challenge that the SETI program is faced with (computing resource availability, or signal detection techniques, etc)?  </li>
<li>Would you be able to give us an idea of the funding SETI receives from governmental sources?    </li>
<li>A more personal question: How often do your family and friends give you a hard time about finding ET?</li>
</ul>
<p>On a personal note, SETI's mission captured my imagination from the moment that my AP physics teacher discussed it in class (I believe it was around the time that SETI@home was released). More recently, my previous lab group had 12 pretty hefty desktops that were chugging away during non-business hours. </p>
<p>Shameless (and unaffiliated) plug for <a href="http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">SETI@home</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
