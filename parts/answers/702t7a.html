		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s not a matter of which direction the electricity is flowing when the appliance is on (because it’s AC as you pointed out) but which side of the circuit is live when the switch is off. In the US, polarized plugs use the smaller prong to supply current to the appliance and the wider prong as the neutral. </p>
<p>If both prongs were the same size, you could have the hot leg on either prong and therefore on either side of any switches. While this wouldn’t matter when the switch is on, it could matter if the switch is off. If you plugged it in “backward”, the appliance will still turn off but all of the internals will still be live at 120v which could pose a hazard. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your distribution system just had 2 wires, with no orientation and no grounding then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_electricity" target="_blank">the earth's atmosphere would cause potentially lethal DC voltages to build up on your system</a>.  This might cause your appliances to fail or for you to get shocked.  The solution to this is to take one of your 2 wires and ground it.  At various points in your distrubution system you literally drive a metal pole in the ground and electrically connect it to 1 of the wires.  Grounding this wire allows your system to discharge those high DC voltages.  To keep track of which wire is grounded you change its color to white.  So now you have a black (hot) and a white (neutral) wire.  Problem solved.  </p>
<p>Almost.  </p>
<p>The problem with grounding 1 of the wires is that it makes the other wire potentially deadly.  Before, with neither wire grounded, the only way to get shocked was to touch both wires at the same time.  Now that 1 of the wires is grounded, the earth becomes part of the circuit so if you are making good electrical contact with the earth and your touch the non-grounded (hot) wire, you will get shocked.  </p>
<p>The solution to this involves many things.  Make sure everybody knows that white wires are grounded and black wires are hot.  Make sure that when people wire up outlets and lights and switches that they wire things up the same way every time.  Make sure that engineers who design appliances are very deliberate about the circuits in their products ... if, for example, the appliance has a metal housing they will want to make sure the chance of the hot wire touch the metal case is practically zero.  You also need to make sure that homeowners always plug in their appliances the same way every time.  Afterall, if electricians are wiring houses the same way every time and engineers are designing products with the assumption that 1 wire is hot and 1 wire is neutral, then none of that is going to make a difference if the people who plug those appliances in do it differently than how they were designed to be plugged in.  </p>
<p>So that means making the plugs fool-proof.  You only let people plug them in 1 way.  The easiest way to do that is to make one of the prongs big and one of them small.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Only one of the three holes in electrically charged.</p>
<p>Common US wiring has three wires:<br />
Black, charged, small prong;<br />
White, supply neutral, large prong;<br />
Green or bare, local Earth neutral, long / cylindrical prong.</p>
<p>The power entering a house has three wires:<br />
Charged A,<br />
Charged B,<br />
Return.</p>
<p>A and B are alternating current but opposite; if one is positive, the other is negative. They both have maximum (absolute) voltage at the same time, and are 0V at the same time. Common circuits get one of A or B as their black wire. Heavy duty circuits (like electric clothes dryers) get both A and B. If the loads on A and B are unbalanced, charge passes through the Return (White wires) to balance everything out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
