		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gauge symmetry is the ability to make a gauge transformation on some physical system, and have the system remain invariant under that transformation.</p>
<p>Classical electrodynamics is a theory of electric (<strong>E</strong>) and magnetic (<strong>B</strong>) fields. The behavior of the fields is encoded in Maxwell's equations.</p>
<p>You can define a set of potentials (φ and <strong>A</strong>) by <strong>B</strong> = curl(<strong>A</strong>) and <strong>E</strong> = - grad(φ) - d<strong>A</strong>/dt.</p>
<p>Since the electric and magnetic fields only depends on <em>derivatives</em> of the potentials, you can obviously shift any potential by a constant and the <strong>E</strong> and <strong>B</strong> fields remain exactly the same. This is the simplest example of a gauge transformation. In fact, there is an infinite family of potentials which will lead to the exact same fields, for <em>any</em> set of fields you can come up with. </p>
<p>Classical electrodynamics (Maxwell's equations) are invariant under all of these gauge transformations, so the theory has gauge symmetry.</p>
<p>Gauge transformations take on a slightly different meaning in quantum field theory, but quantum electrodynamics (a QFT describing charged particles and their interactions with the electromagnetic field) is a gauge theory.</p>
<p>Gauge transformations can be divided up into global gauge transformations, and the more restrictive class of <em>local</em> gauge invariance.</p>
<p>Global gauge invariance is the symmetry leading to conservation of electric charge in QED. Enforcing local gauge invariance is the motivation for the theory to have exactly massless photons. Experimentally, the upper bound on the photon mass is extremely small, so it appears that this assumption in the theory is indeed justified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a description of electricity and magnetism as gauge forces <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/60z871/what_are_magnetic_fields/dfbnx08/?st=j9hzln4g&amp;sh=f1dc5c94" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is actually similar to gravity warping space, but it warps something else called the U(1) gauge group. That's a fancy way of saying that there is some kind of circle attached to every point in spacetime (a point with x,y,z,t coordinates), and the points on each circle are connected to the points on the neighboring circles.</p>
<p>The simplest case is just having each point on the circle connected to the same points on the neighboring circles, but that's kind of boring. Instead you can twist these connections so that the points are connected to points slightly clockwise or counterclockwise as you follow the connections to nearby circles. Since there is a circle at every neighboring place in spacetime, you can choose a different way of connecting to nearby circles for every direction in spacetime.</p>
<p>The connections can also be twisted in a more interesting way. If you choose a point on the circle at one place, and trace a path through points on the neighboring circles, you can choose points on those circles that were connected to the previous points in an unbroken line. You can even trace a loop in spacetime that starts and ends in the same place. But surprise! You don't always end up at the same point you started with on the circle. This is called curvature, in analogy to the curved surface of the earth. If you drive 1 mile east, 1 mile north, 1 mile west, then 1 mile south, you won't end up exactly where you started because the earth is curved (take that flat earthers!).</p>
<p>The amount of curvature (how far off your point was from the point you started from) depends on which direction in spacetime you traced the loop. And if your loop goes a bit in the x direction, then a bit in the y direction, then in the -x direction, then in the -y direction, the amount of curvature you get is called the magnetic field in the z direction (as we can see, it would be more correct to say that it's the magnetic field associated with the x-y plane). And similarly, the electric field in the z direction is the curvature in the z-t plane (the t direction is the future, -t direction is the past).</p>
<p>So now we see why there are 6 components of the electromagnetic field. There's 6 independent ways of choosing a loop to go around, by choosing a direction x,y,z,t to start the loop from and a direction to end it with. Tracing the connections between the circles at the places along the loop brings you back to a different point on the circle, and you can use the curvature of these connections along these basic directions to figure out how different your point is for any loop you choose. The curvatures in the y-z, z-x, x-y directions give you the x,y,z components of the magnetic field, and the x-t,y-t,z-t curvature gives you the x,y,z electric field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So what is a gauge symmetry in this context? It's a way of relabeling the circles by rotating them by some amount (after all, what does the left or the top of the circle even mean here? What really changes if the labels on the circle get rotated?). A global symmetry would be rotating them all by the same amount, a local symmetry is rotating each one by a different angle (though it has to be continuous, if the circles are nearby then they have to be rotated by nearly the same angle). </p>
<p>The interesting part is that the connection between circles doesn't get changed by this symmetry transformation, since you can figure out an equivalent connection for the new circles by unrotating the new circle, applying the old connection, and rotating it back. This combined procedure defines a new connection for the new circles that contains all the same information as the old one, even though all the labels on it have been changed by the gauge transformation. The electric and magnetic fields (the curvature of the connection) don't change either, so everything still works the same with the new labeling, so it's called &quot;gauge equivalent&quot;. </p>
<p>Charges are a way of applying this gauge transformation to things other than the electric and magnetic field, so that even though they are interacting through these gauge forces, the gauge transformation keeps everything equivalent. To accomplish this, each charge has a &quot;phase&quot; that keeps track of where on the circle it is, and when the rotations get applied they get applied once to something with charge +1, twice to something with charge +2, or the opposite rotation gets applied if the charge is negative. </p>
<p>This is how it works for the circle group U(1), the gauge group of the electromagnetic field. The Strong Nuclear force is the exact same thing with the group SU(3), though the results are more complicated because it matters in which order the transformations get applied. That complication is the reason why gluons have color charge, as opposed to photons which don't have electric charge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Words are tough for this kind of stuff.  The most accurate &quot;word&quot; definition of a Gauge symmetry, with all math jargon stripped out, is probably not very illuminating: A gauge is a redundancy of mathematical description.  In a nutshell, the goal of physics is to provide a predictive (mathematical) framework that makes quantitative observable predictions that can be verified by experiment.  This means that the sole &quot;philosophical&quot; job of a set of mathematical equations that compromise a theory in physics is that they correctly output observable predictions.  But a key corollary there is that mathematical descriptions have a freedom of expression, because they may actually say more &quot;things&quot; than can be observed.</p>
<p>From this, &quot;the rub&quot;, as they say, is that it's possible for DIFFERENT equations, when the same observable inputs are given, to produce the SAME experimental predictions outputs, for all inputs.  This is not the same as saying you can have different equations that give the same VALUE for all inputs.  This isn't possible (or I suppose trivial, depending on perspective, f(x) = x is the same as f(x) = x + 1 - 1, which is the same as f(x) = x + 5 - 2 - 3 and so on).  However, if the ways those values are different aren't actually experimentally observable then it is possible.  The different equations give different values, but those values have a commonality that happens to coincide for all the stuff we can observe.  Thus, when this happens you are said to have a gauge symmetry, which as I said is a &quot;redundancy of mathematical description&quot;.</p>
<p>When you have such a redundancy one can then also think about concretely constructing a bit of math that allows you to transform one redundant set of equations into another, which is a gauge transformation.</p>
<p>Beyond this I don't know how much can really be said without going into math, but perhaps there's enough here to motivate the idea that when you find that this has happened there is an air that there is a &quot;hidden&quot; structure to the experimentally observable phenomena.  In a sense, a complete understanding of the phenomena does not just include the experimental prediction but also this redundancy which has a concrete mathematical form.</p>
<p>In fact, the mathematical nature of these redundancies and the transformations between them is such that it turns out to be a very powerful and useful way of both categorizing and GENERATING new sets of equations intended to match phenomena and, through extension, a way of understanding and categorizing phenomena themselves. </p>
<p>For example, let's say I'm at &quot;The Bar Between Spaces&quot;, an inter-dimensional, inter-universe bar where people who live in different universes with different laws of physics like to have a drink and talk and I'm chatting up T'ed from the Dark Dimension and I want to explain to him that in my universe we have these things called electric fields and magnetic fields and they are related to each other through these complicated Maxwell's equations where the vector curl of the electric field is related to the negative of the time rate of change of the magnetic field and the... and so on and so on.  What gauge theory tells us is that to make Ted understand this thing I actually DON'T need to give him so much information.  All I really need to say is &quot;In my universe we've got a field which has both U(1) and Poincare local gauge invariances&quot;* and we're done.  If he's smart enough, he's got the picture.  With just that he can go and derive Maxwell's equations himself.</p>
<p>That's the power of this &quot;gauge&quot; perspective on physics.</p>
<p>*I'm probably missing a requirement there, but you get the idea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to give a functional description above this, although they've pretty much said everything else. </p>
<p>If something has gauge symmetry, applying some gauge transformation (which is not every kind of transformation mind you) does nothing to the physics. A field will have a Lagrangian that is invariant through a gauge transformation under certain Lie groups. This becomes important in the fundamentals of Particle physics, where gauge symmetries hold explanatory powers that range into how mass is generated, where gravity comes from etc. </p>
<p>Look up Noether's theorem, action of a Lagrangian of a free particle and the U(1) Lie group as a starter if you want to learn more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are actually better than mine; but if you want a more basic explanation, gauge is the same thing as scale or magnitude. Symmetry of gauge is a symmetry of magnitude of something, so if you change the absolute magnitude of something, and nothing observable changes, then it can be said to have a symmetry of its gauge. The classic example is voltage, because if you perform an experiment in an isolated lab, then raise everything in the lab by ten million volts and repeat the experiment, nothing will change. Therefore, it is said that the E field has a symmetry under transformations of magnitude, or gauge. It's the same thing as saying you can never say what the absolute voltage of something is, but you can define a difference in voltage. Lots of other quantities work the same way. If so, they have that type of symmetry. (Math people are getting ready to stone me for saying this all wrong, because they have a much more precise meaning.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
