Another way to think of it is that you have a fine motor hand and a gross motor hand. You specialize one to do details and the other to act as an assistant. The assistant acts in a support role for balance and stability. </p>
<p>The benefits of this can be seen when using any type of tool, a pen, a pot, a stick. Each arm has a a job and you don't have to think about it...its more efficient. </p>
<p>In ambidextrous children, I typically recommend that once children begin to use writing tools, that parents choose a hand and teach the child to write with that hand. Experience is critical for developing fine motor skills, so by doing that they can build up the brain cells needed to develop to the best of their ability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you go to work or school, how often do you take a different route? if you're anything like me, once you've found a way you consider best, you just kind of stick with it because it's easier than making a new decision every time. </p>
<p>Your brain is no different. As a matter of fact, your brain was the one that chose to take the same route every day in real life to start with. </p>
<p>Different activities use different parts of the brain and as a result, different parts of the brain are more active and easily engaged with, because you do business with those parts of your brain more than others. The result is that the parts you use the most get developed the most. Over time they become the best parts of your brain at handling tasks.</p>
<p>tl;dr - habits have real and tangible effects on the brain</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
