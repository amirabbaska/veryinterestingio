		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The arc in that movie went through his legs. If the ground was wet and he didn't have rubber soled shoes on it would likely go through one leg into the ground and into the other leg to the ground wire or simply to the ground if it was a better path.</p>
<p>If he had rubber soled shoes on it would move up one leg through his hips to the other leg and out the ground wire.</p>
<p>In either case the arc would likely avoid his vital organs (namely lungs/heart/nervous system controlling those systems). If the arc was weak enough he would likely not be harmed enough to die. If the arc was weak the bolts in his legs would heat up and burn him there, but unless the current was strong enough it wouldn't burn the skin itself for some time. Assuming it's strong enough, most likely he'd be burned by the arc until such point that the burns were life-threatening and at that point he would die from shock.</p>
<p>If the arc went to his abdomen it could cause his muscles there to lock up and make breathing difficult or impossible and he may then suffocate. Another possibility would be the convulsions caused by the electricity causing muscle contractions to cause his head to bang into the chair or a wall and be may die of blunt force trauma.</p>
<p>So how long he would live depends on a number of factors. Most probably he would continue to feel some amount of pain until he went into shock or became unconscious.</p>
<p>However, the draw of a short circuit like that would likely blow a fuse or trip a breaker before too long. Although if I recall it was some sort of ghetto third world set-up so who knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand-</p>
<p>If sufficient current crosses the heart, the heart will fibrillate and fail to pump properly and death is certain.  Even if current is removed the heart may not be able to go into a functional state- also within a few seconds with no blood flow, brain and organ damage begin.</p>
<p>But if you don't put current across the chest, extended current will of course be painful.  It will destroy nerves and muscle.  After that sort of torture, nerves may generate stinging pain indefinitely, or simply lose feeling.  Muscle may be damaged, or the nerves may be unable to function and move the muscle.</p>
<p>This- and many forms of torture, including burns- may further injure or kill by causing rhabdomyolysis (&quot;rhabdo&quot;).  This is where proteins from damaged muscle tissue leak into the bloodstream.  This protein is very toxic to the kidneys and can lead to kidney damage or failure, untreated kidney failure will lead to death.  Rhabdo could happen from bruising with batons, electric shock... also simply an overly aggressive exercise workout during training can result in some degree of rhabdo, it can be &quot;light&quot; or &quot;serious&quot;.  Trainers talk a lot about that risk from pushing yourself too far.</p>
<p>That's what likely happens when you hear of a prisoner being &quot;beaten to death&quot;.  A single bruise has no life-threatening consequences.  How could a person die from this?  Bruising over half the body with batons without medical attention will probably cause rhabdo- blood poisoned by protein leaking from damaged muscle, the kidneys will fail and the most immediate symptom is the kidneys' failure to regulate potassium levels.  The abnormal potassium level will cause abnormal heart rhythm and sudden death.  I don't know how fast this would set in, not within an hour.  A person injured as such might not survive the night or it may take a few days, I don't know.</p>
<p>&quot;Saving&quot;  a victim of torture may mean kidney dialysis and measures taken to stabilize the potassium level and the heart.  The external injuries and broken bones are secondary concerns.  Eventually a kidney transplant may be needed.</p>
<p>Same thing here though.  Probably &quot;cooking&quot;  a person's leg with electricity- while avoiding any fatal heart shocking- will cause rhabdo, kidney failure, and potassium-induced heart failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry if this a bit incoherent but I have 400 pages of charts and text to parse to get you the relevant bits, so bare with me.</p>
<p>What happens is dependant on persons individual impedance, voltage applied and phase and frequency of the current.
A LOT also depends on how big a fuse that house's outlet has protecting it but let's assume it's standard 16A then a Gg-type fuse burns in 0.4s as long as the current exceeds 137,5A at 220V C-type automatic fuse would be far worse requiring 160A.
These figures assume that electrics are done according to specifications.</p>
<p>As for skin the visible reaction depends on how much a current per area is spread (A/mm2).</p>
<p>In general for hand-arm hand-hand the resistance can be said to start from 500ohm, however a study shows that skin short circuits at 220v so actual effects of electric current can vary.</p>
<p>So for spasms you would need 10mA of current and to feel a current you would need 0,5mA.
interesting thing is that according to study heart failure is very unlikely at small currents when passing from left hand to feet.</p>
<p>How ever for skin to get charred you would 20-50A/mm2 for burn marks and over 50a/mm2 for charring where electrodes touch the skin.</p>
<p>Long term (over 1s) affect of currents over 300mA will cause burn marks et c. confusion and loss of conciousness, long term currents of over 1A often cause death or severe burns.</p>
<p>TL;DR the man dies a low agonizing death but mercifully loses conciousness before he dies.</p>
<p>Current with the (earlier in text) assumed average of 500ohm body impedance and 220v in short circuit would be 241mA when assumed as 1-phase short circuit in a 3-phase system.
The fuse would need 140A to blow up so it would likely never break the circuit because human body has such a high impedance thus limiting the short circuit current considerably.</p>
<p>Results however from the short circuit approximation formula cannot be used directly for personnel safety as the actual values can be much higher (engineering programs have better algorithms for calculating short circuits that are very complex and very precise).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well French outlets are 230V (I think that's where it happens) which would definitely cause some damage on short contact.  Primary symptoms include burns and potentially cardiac arrest <a href="http://www.emedicinehealth.com/electric_shock/page9_em.htm#electric_shock_prognosis" target="_blank">source</a>.
I couldn't comment on hooking someone up and letting them simmer...</p>
<p>I suspect based on absolutely nothing but speculation that that guy died of a heart attack or asphyxiation from prolonged muscle contraction.</p>
<p>This kills the bastard.</p>
<p>Edit: Actually wikipedia has a pretty extensive page for this surprisingly: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_shock" target="_blank">here</a>
Seems that prolonged exposure that doesn't cause death does cause neuropathy which makes me think it will just keep hurting if you dont die.  Prolonged exposure is associated with a higher likelihood of death.  Pathways that include the heart or brain are usually fatal; I cant remember how he's hooked up.  Doesn't seem like a good situation all around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
