		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matter can definitely be created and destroyed. Mass-energy, however, is preserved. Now if you want to go further with &quot;then how was mass-energy created?&quot; you're getting into &quot;Beginning of the universe&quot; stuff and we don't know how that functioned.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that a physical law doesn't mean &quot;Mother nature has to obey the speed limit&quot; it means &quot;We pretty much always see Mother Nature obey the speed limit.&quot; It is an observation of how we see the universe functioning, not a limit we put on how the universe can function.</p>
<p>edit: Changed mass to mass-energy to clarify that I was not strictly speaking of Newtonian mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you're asking a metaphysical question about what existed before the universe.  Even though physicists do have theories and speculate about such things, these speculations are just that... speculative.  In general our theories state that the big bang didn't <em>create</em> the mass of the universe, or at least the scope of the theories don't cover whether mass was <em>created</em> or already <em>existed</em>.</p>
<p>As for the technicality in your question, matter can be destroyed.  It happens every time there is a nuclear reaction.  The total <strong>mass-energy</strong> of the system cannot be changed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matter can be created (from energy) and destroyed (into energy). </p>
<p>The total mass-energy of our universe seems to be zero. Gravity is acting as negative energy. </p>
<p>There's a great lecture on this called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EilZ4VY5Vs&amp;t=2m13s" target="_blank">A Universe From Nothing</a>. Watch it, it's a lot of fun and quite easy to understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Start with 0.</p>
<p>Then 0 = 1 + (-1)</p>
<p>Now take the -1 and hide it somewhere that we can't really see easily. The 1 is our universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gross oversimplification here!</p>
<p>Why? because the components still exist. They will not simply cease to exist because they've broken down into simpler parts they'll just be those parts. This is why it cannot be destroyed.</p>
<p>Why can it not be created? simple there is a fixed mass of parts which are just shifted about. In essence the universe is Lego. In this Legoverse you have a fixed number of parts but you can make whatever your little heart desires as long as it fits within what the blocks can do.</p>
<p>Now how did the universe begin? well it didn't. What!? it rearranged those base components into this current decaying form. Soooo basically we had a big old ball of Lego and it broke into many small blocks those little blocks got mashes together into everything we have now. They continue to break apart because like Lego the bonds are not permanent. </p>
<p>So what made this whole mass of blocks? fuck if I know. It is possible that the mass of blocks came from another arrangement of blocks, a previous Legoverse if you will, that fell into entropy and the process is infinite. What caused the big old mass of blocks fall apart then? well I don't know but given what happens when you compress matter... I'd venture a guess that all the matter in the universe being in a single spot caused it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
