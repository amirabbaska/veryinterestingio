<p>Well, if you weren't wearing a space suit, no matter where you started you would die almost instantly because there is essentially no oxygen at any level of Jupiter's atmosphere.
But let's say you do have a space suit. What do you mean by &quot;step foot on it&quot;? Jupiter is, as you noted in your question, a gas giant, meaning it's made of gas. There is no solid surface. And just like Earth's atmosphere, the gas doesn't really have a &quot;top&quot;, it just gets thinner and thinner as you get further and further from the planet, until at some point it is indistinguishable from interplanetary space (which, you may be interested to know, is not a true vacuum.
But let's say you just get dropped from some height way outside of Jupiter's visible atmosphere. Once you got within about 200,000 miles (about 300,000 km) of the planet's surface, you'd die fairly quickly from radiation poisoning.
But let's say your space suit has radiation-resisting superpowers. Well due to Jupiter's extreme mass, you'd quickly accelerate through the tenuous upper atmosphere at about 2.6 g, and burn up just like a meteor flying through Earth's upper atmosphere.
But let's say we dropped you in the middle of Jupiter's upper atmosphere, where the pressure were just about the same as Earth's surface pressure (1 bar). Now we're getting somewhere. You'd be falling, but since you're already in the thicker part of the atmosphere, your terminal velocity will be fairly low (taking Jupiter's higher gravity and the atmosphere's lower density into account (it is mostly hydrogen, so its density is about 10 times less than Earth's even though the pressure is similar), your terminal velocity would be about 3200 km/h (2000 mph)). This is probably slow enough that frictional heating and heating from supersonic compression would not burn you up.
But hell, for shits and giggles, and in the name of keeping you alive as long as possible, let's give you a parachute, a little smaller than the one given to the Galileo probe, so that you fall at about the same velocity initially (~100 m/s, or about 360 km/h, 220 mph). Now we're cooking. Not literally though, because the temperature at this level is fairly comfortable: The temperature is just about 0 C (32 F), so you'd actually be pretty comfy.
So okay, now you're in your radiation-proof spacesuit, with your handy parachute, falling through the atmosphere just at the top of the clouds. These clouds are made of ammonia, but let's just assume your spacesuit and parachute are okay with that. You'd actually be okay for quite a while; maybe a little bored, but hey, you're on motherfucking Jupiter.
After about 5 minutes, you've fallen to the 2-bar level (about twice the average surface pressure on Earth). You are now falling through different clouds, made of ammonium hydrosulfide and ammonium sulfide. They don't look much different than regular clouds, but they do have a brownish tint that gets browner the deeper you go. Some people may find this surprising, but you won't feel many ill effects, even as the pressure increases rapidly. The bends are only seen with rapid decompression; the only ill effects from rapid compression are if the compression is too rapid to allow your body cavities (such as inner ear, sinuses, etc) to equalize. So as long as your ears are clear of wax, you should be fine.
About 10 minutes later, you have reached the 4 bar pressure level, which is about 4 times the average atmospheric pressure at sea level, or about the pressure you'd experience under 30 meters (100 feet) of water. The temperature has actually gotten quite cold, and is now around -40 C (-40 F). But assuming all the capabilities your spacesuit already had, I'm sure it wouldn't be too much to ask for a small heater. You are now passing through clouds of water ice, just like you might see at high altitudes on Earth, but it is getting very dark. You are also being whisked along horizontally by winds reaching 200 m/s (450 mph, 720 km/h), but you barely notice as they are not very turbulent.
15 more minutes go by, and you are now at a pressure of 10 bar, or 10 times normal sea-level atmospheric pressure. At bit before this level you should have changed the mixture of air you are breathing; if you breathed normal air at a pressure of 10 bar or more, you would suffer from acute oxygen toxicity, which can be quickly fatal (oxygen is actually toxic at much lower pressures, but it would take much longer than our quick decent through jupiter). At the same time, you can suffer from nitrogen narcosis, which has similar symptoms to inhaling nitrous oxide initially, but can quickly progress to severe symptoms like coma or death. So as you dive deeper your magic space suit also changes the mixture of air you are breathing, so that the partial pressures of oxygen and nitrogen remain the same as you are used to breathing, with the rest filled with helium or neon, which are the only known gasses which don't exhibit a toxic effect at high pressures. But provided this is all taken care of, you are actually quite comfortable, as the temperature has risen back up to about 23 C (73 F).
Another 25 minutes pass, and you are starting to realize you're in trouble. You are in complete darkness now, and the temperature has been steadily increasing as you go further down: now over 100 C (212 F) and still rising fast. Your spacesuit's systems are starting to fail. Within a few minutes, the temperature is over 200 C (392 F), and you don't have much longer to survive. Not wanting to endure a miserable, burning death, you take your conveniently placed cyanide capsule and end your interplanetary adventure.
But your body keeps falling.
Down into interior regions where we have little ideas of the exact composition. Pressure and density are increasing drastically, slowing your descent to a crawl. The atmosphere of mostly hydrogen is actually a liquid now, and is now several thousand degrees, but with essentially no oxygen around your body turns into a charcoal-like substance. Your parachute cuts away, but your spacesuit remains intact because it is convenient to the story, and your compressed, dead chunk of bodily substance slowly sinks, beyond 1,000 bar, beyond 10,000 bar...
Until finally, at an insanely crushing pressure of 2,000,000 bar (and a temperature of 5,000 K, about the temperature of the surface of the sun!), you stop sinking. Because your super-spacesuit is conveniently still intact, your body is still mostly water, which is essentially incompressible, even at these incredible pressures. As such, at this level, where the density is about 1 g/cm3 or about 1000 kg/m3 (this is approximately the density of water) you and the surrounding atmosphere are the same density, so you will no longer sink! So there your carbonated corpse floats, for all eternity, until the heat death of the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jupiter is known as a gas giant due to most of it being made up by gas.</p>
<p>Billions of years ago, when the planets formed, there was what is known as a protoplanetary nebula around the Sun - basically a big puffy pancake of gas (mostly hydrogen but also helium, oxygen, nitrogen, oxygen etc) and dust (pretty much everything else). There is way more gas than dust though.</p>
<p>The dust clumped together, first into small lumps similar to how you get dust balls hands a bed, then by bumping and sticking into each other, bigger and bigger until these lumps were the size of busses. Some of these lumps would then get 'ahead of the game' by pure chance and would dominate their local areas, growing up to about the size of the moon or Mars. These big bodies are known as &quot;protoplanets&quot; while the smaller ones are known as &quot;planetesimals&quot;.</p>
<p>The protoplanets are then bombarded by the planetesimals over millions of years, the smaller lumps getting caught by the gravitational pull of the larger bodies, pulling them in. Some protoplanets crash into each other too. This is how planets form and for rocky planets like the Earth, this is pretty much it.</p>
<p>However, remember that I said the protoplanetary nebula also had loads of gas in it too? Well all this planetary growth is going on in the middle of all this gas. It doesn't really do too much to the smaller lumps although the bigger protoplanets are, the more it drags them around in the disc. The larger protoplanets will be able to capture some of this gas, this is largely how planets get their atmospheres.</p>
<p>Most planets don't manage to capture much of this gas before it disappears though (it only sticks around for a few million years before he heat from the Sun basically evaporates it away into surrounding space). However, some planets manage to get big enough that the way they can capture gas goes wild - they kind of get big enough that they grow faster, which makes them bigger which makes them grow even faster etc etc - it's called runaway growth. This happens when a planet is about 5-10 times the mass of the Earth. Note this can only happen if there is enough gas left in the disc, which is why rocky 'Super Earths' are discovered quite a lot by astronomers.</p>
<p>The planets that do manage to do this manage to soak up all the gas in their region of the disc and in doing so, become gas giants like Jupiter and Saturn. Others that start a bit late or start too far out in the disc where the gas is sparser become 'ice giants' like Uranus and Neptune.</p>
<p>So gas giants do mostly have a solid core that's several times the mass of the Earth at their centre when they form (there is another way that gas giants can form but it doesn't really work for anything other than really big planets that are really really far from their star so I've ignored them for now). Whether they still have a solid core later on is up for debate though. Saturn is widely accepted to have a solid rocky core of about ten times the mass of the Earth but with Jupiter, we just don't know right now. At the super high pressures at the centre of such a large planet, things kind of get weird physics wise - the hydrogen gas is so compressed and dense that it is as dense as the rocky core and quite a bit of 'mixing' where it all gets blended and crushed together can take some of the original rocky core away and mix it around the planet. It might still have a rocky core, it might have smooshed it around so much that it's pretty much gone.</p>
<p>Firing a rocket through it wouldn't really work - it gets so so dense near the middle and there's so much pressure that anything like a rocket would just get crushed. Even if there isn't a solid core, the hydrogen is squished so incredibly tightly that it may as well be a solid. In regards to an astronaut 'landing' on it, while there could be a way to float in the upper atmosphere of Jupiter with the help of big balloons or something, it is such a hostile environment that any astronaut would likely already be dead a hundred times over.</p>
<p>I hope you've enjoyed my simplified but still overly long talk through how Jupiter was formed. I know it's relatively late in the day in regards to this 11 hour old post but as an ex theoretical astrophysicist who worked specifically in giant planet formation, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to share some knowledge love. :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>What do they mean by the gas thing?</strong></p>
<p>Gas planets (&quot;Jovian&quot; if you wanna impress girls) are called so because they are just so damn...... <em>gassy</em>!</p>
<p>So the planets just sit there all stupid, trying to collect and hang on to as much stuff as possible. But the sun is a big asshole that steals shit away from the stupidest planets that sit real close in it's &quot;personal space&quot;. So the inner &quot;Terrestrial&quot; (ladies....) planets can really only hold on to the heavier elements, so they make like Adrien and do Rocky.</p>
<p>But the other guys, way out there, are too far for the sun to pull any of it's bullshit, so they can keep all the lighter elements as well. Hence all that sweet sweet gas!</p>
<p><strong>Can I shoot it?</strong></p>
<p>Jupiter is a big big big big big planet. You know that big oval thing you see in like every damn picture of Jupiter? That is a storm that is roughly the size of 2-3 earths. </p>
<p>So now think about as you swim deeper into water, you feel that pressure on your ears? Imagine that on a big stupid planet stupid scale! The deeper you go the more stupid high the pressure gets.</p>
<p>So assuming that you can make a rocket able to withstand the pressure at the core (which you can't, not even close) you will be stopped by something even more stupid! Which leads to your last question:</p>
<p><strong>Can I land on it?</strong></p>
<p>Let's pretend you had the magic stuff to withstand the pressure of all that gas on top of you. As you drop lower into the atmosphere you will start seeing silly things like all this gas condensing into liquids. Imagine taking a dip into liquid methane, like swimming in a sea made of farts.</p>
<p>There is no real way to tell if there is an actual solid rock core, but the general thinking is that there is probably a dense core of some stuff, with like a liquidy metallic layer of hydrogen and helium, followed by stuff like liquid farts, then regular farts on the top. Imagine a giant T-1000 who just ate at taco bell.</p>
<p>So maybe you could land on it? But it's probably more like you splash into it and float around on all the farts. Then you see that one rocket you tried to shoot through, but it couldn't make it through, because the farts just got too thick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
