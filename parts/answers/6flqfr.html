		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is some data compiled by the WHO on the burden of water borne and sanitation related diseases worldwide (in 2012, I haven't found anything more recent that is as thourough as this). </p>
<p><a href="http://www.who.int/gho/phe/water_sanitation/burden/en/" target="_blank">http://www.who.int/gho/phe/water_sanitation/burden/en/</a></p>
<p>So, to answer your question, in countries with poor access to clean water, a lot of people suffer from water borne diseases, and this leads to substantial morbidity and mortality, especially in young children. </p>
<p>That being said, healthy adults in these countries have higher resistance to some pathogens compared to people who grew up in countries that have easy access to clean water (hence traveller's diarrhea).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a bacteria called Campylobacter jejuni, it causes 'Traveller's diarrhoea' and is the most common cause of a bout of the poops for travellers. Most locals wouldn't be affected as they've developed an immunity to it.  But immunity to things like this take time and although diarrhoeal illness of children is considered 'normal' it is also a major killer of children under five.
So there is an immunity developed to certain bacteria (not so much parasites) but diarrhoeal illness is pretty common place when there is no clean water. Also this is compounded by issues like HIV and malnutrition as to have an immunity you need an immune system. </p>
<p>For people asking why locals don't boil the water, it takes a kilo of firewood to boil a litre of water. When resources are limited they would rather use the wood to cook. </p>
<p>I did my PhD on using Sunlight to disinfect water in developing countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our wastewater treatment plants in the United States use a lot of different techniques to eliminated mostly everything. Aside from chemicals, the water is physically filtered through gradually smaller mediums until things as small as giardia cysts cannot pass. Boiling, ozone treatment, and reverse osmosis also kill cysts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer your question with another question assuming you live in a developed country.</p>
<p>Have you ever met anyone from where you live with a helminth (worm) infection? Probably not and if so you know very few people. In fact there are about 1.5 Billion people with helminth infections globally. Unsanitary water is a huge problem in developing countries. It isn't very easy for the immune system to prevent infections from worms, instead its general means of clearing them is the use of granulocytes after infection. So yeah it's very common for people to be infected with parasites from dirty water. </p>
<p>Edit: I noticed that you also asked about bacterial infections. Generally something like E.coli is harmless. There are some exceptions like 0157:H7 which produced shiga toxin. In general it's much easier to clear/prevent bacterial infection but that leads to the fact that people In developing countries have weaker immune systems. That's the topic I wrote my senior thesis on. Let me know if you'd like more info on that specifically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Waste Water Treatment:
Waste water treatment is done through two modes, primary and secondary treatment.
Primary treatment is more physical based and removal of solid organic matter etc, and getting the sludge ready for secondary treatment</p>
<p>Secondary treatment is where the real action is at. There are two main ways that sludge is treated, one making use of naturally occurring biofilms, but both ways rely on two critical factors.
Aeration of the sludge, and the addition of active microorganisms that will clean the sludge and kill the sludge bacteria- such as your cysts.
All of the microbes that come from your stomach will be AnO2, the aeration of the sludge by pumping O2 into the tank will create an aerobic environment not supportive of their respiration. The addition of active microorganisms is to clean up the sludge itself which is full of N, P, C and many other nutrients.</p>
<p>either way the tanks are set up so that treated effluent flows off from the top for usually a third treatment (chemicals, UV, etc) while the sediment or any not fully treated bits sink to the bottom and are flushed through the system again. While inactive/excess sludge goes to a separate tank for Anoxic digest.</p>
<p>A great bioconverter is algae it sequesters CO2 gas from the atmosphere to make O2, and recycles the organic matter in waste water too!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
