		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm from the southern US and now live up north. I learned to cover my southern accent intentionally as a kid to sound less stupid (yes, that stereotype also exists in the South). Now, after living in the northeast for almost 7 years, I don't have to cover it intentionally anymore.</p>
<p>My husband, also from the South, has undergone the same transformation. We both still had accents when talking just to each other for a few years, but now we sound more SAE (Standard American English) even when we're alone. My brother says I sound Canadian when we talk on the phone (we live in Maine, so...).</p>
<p>The worst part is that when we lived in the South, we would do a really intense southern accent when telling stories about someone stupid we had encountered. Since that stereotype doesn't work as well in New England, we have lost a funny part of our conversations. Or at least until we get good enough at the Maine accent to switch to that one...</p>
<p>Edit: Also, I should add that if you learn a new dialect/language after what's called the &quot;critical period&quot; for language acquisition, you'll always revert back to your original language/dialect when drunk or tired or whatever. That's the same reason why if you learn another language after age 14 or so, you'll never master the accent and will always sound &quot;foreign&quot; (with few exceptions).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It takes effort (unconscious effort after some length of time) to maintain a different accent than your first; when you're drinking your accent reverts because you don't have as much focus/energy to expend on maintaining the newer accent. It's the same reason people slur their words when they've had too many (less focus / energy to properly enunciate).</p>
