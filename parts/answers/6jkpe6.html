		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oohh! I did this for a living!</p>
<p>I did background checks on chemists, armored car drivers, etc.</p>
<p>You fill out your application including work history or include your resume.  Your prospective employer then sends it to me.  They can get everything including credit check, criminal background, past employment history (most common), and education (also most common).</p>
<p>I then call your previous employers and ask them about you.  Some tell me you were great, some call you an asshole, some require your signature to speak about you (which you signed on your application), others transfer you to HR where they have 2-3 generic responses:  terminated, not eligible/eligible for rehire, gave notice, etc.  Typically not eligible/eligible for rehire is legal HR code for if you were a good employee.  Sometimes I had to verify responsibilities, hours, and pay.  If you're not confident that your boss was tell people you were an assistant manager, don't put it on your resume.  It makes you look terrible when your previous boss says, &quot;no. He was just a janitor.&quot;</p>
<p>If the company closed you're still not safe.  I'll call the business next door and ask if they remember you, know anyone who used to work next door, etc.  the Chmaber of Commerce will remember all small business owners in a little town and give me their contact info.  I will look up who owned the McDonalds franchise that closed, cross check the property address, use the white pages to find the previous owner, and call them at home and ask about you.</p>
<p>I do the same for your education.  I can call your HS or check a school's registrar database for your degree.  If you put HS diploma and you got a GED I had to mark &quot;No high school diploma.&quot;  This one always killed me because one particular application just had a check box for &quot;graduated from HS?&quot;  If it's a diploma mill or you never graduated I make a note of that.</p>
<p>For scientists/chemists (pharma company) I would have to call references.  I would speak to a grad student's professors.  They were the meanest most brutal people.  &quot;Student doesn't really stand out. Average.&quot; &quot;No personality, wouldn't let them work for me.&quot;  Just brutal personal attacks.  All other references were obviously the persons friends and they gave the answers you'd expect. </p>
<p>Background checks are automatic along with credit history.  If you turn out to be a child molester we research that to confirm it's you because the system is fairly flawed.</p>
<p>Some companies/people would put through &quot;rush&quot; requests which was basically just a note to gather all the info you can and send it within 24 hours.  Most times we would have 3-5 days. </p>
<p>It was an interesting job and I have a compulsive need to pursue things to the very end so it was good for that.  However I don't like &quot;gotcha moments.&quot;  They don't bring me the joy they bring others.  </p>
<p>Ironically the company realized I had IT experience so they switched me over to IT work but wouldn't promote me officially (read: pay me appropriately) because I didn't have a degree.  </p>
<p>Edit:  This was years ago that I did this job.  Social media was a thing but we didn't really check it and submit anything from it.  I do know of several hospital systems that do and will check for anyone getting privileges.  Keep your stuff private.  It's just good common sense.</p>
<p>Edit 2: I didn't hire anyone.  I just collected the data. I don't know what the end user did with the data or what specific criteria they cared most about.</p>
<p>Edit 3:  I'm going to bed.  I'm sorry if I didn't answer your question. I tried but my email doesn't show all reply's on mobile.  I'm done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said it all starts with basic record checks to verify the information you're asked to provide (degrees, criminal history, possibly finances, residences, and employments). Each state either has a statewide law check they can run or individual counties are checked instead where there are no statewide agencies (CA for example). If they get a &quot;hit&quot; on a routine law check they'll follow up with the PD or Court in question for the details and disposition. If you've ever seen a person at the traffic court window with a laptop and stack of files and they're not at the Attorney window then chances are they're record searchers for these routine background check places.</p>
<p>Now Federal Investigations are a little more complex. They'll still do all of the above however will also check DOD and other Federal Law Enforcement Agencies for record &quot;hits&quot;. If you were ever fingerprinted in connection to a crime they will have a record of that, even if you were never convicted and/or told the record would be expunged (so don't lie). They will find it, and then you'll have to sit down with an Investigator that is going to confront you with this derogatory information and ask you why you lied about it on your form. Super awkward conversation and you'll feel like an idiot.<br />
Depending on the clearance level (Public Trust to TS/SCI) they'll either send out letters of inquiry to your prior residences/education/employers for confirmation or send actual Investigators in person to interview anyone and everyone possible to corroborate your information, all while attempting to unearth derogatory information you may be hiding. Never lie. The whole point is to identify potential sources of coercion for you, and by lying about it you're essentially saying &quot;I'm super not okay with anyone knowing this about me&quot; to an adjudicator.</p>
<p><strong>AND A MESSAGE TO ALL MILITARY RECRUITS: DON'T LET YOUR RECRUITER FUCK UP YOUR SF-86</strong> Make sure you answer the questions fully and with full honesty, and don't listen to them tell you something doesn't apply or convince you to leave that time you smoked pot off your security questionnaire. Spoiler alert: they have a quota and just want you in as fast as possible. Double spoiler alert: <em>it doesn't matter</em>. If I had a nickel for every recruit I've interviewed that had either smoked pot or <em>wasn't even a citizen of the United States yet and their parents were illegal residents</em> that was still able to get into the military and still able to get a clearance then I'd have, like... well probably only $5 but still.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When most people think of a background check they think of a simple criminal history check. In reality, a background check is much more than that. It’s the process by which you find your best candidate by looking at, yes, criminal records, but also education and employment history, civil records, references, etc. Each is a very important piece of the puzzle. What does a background check look for? </p>
<p>A background check helps your company stay safe through the criminal history check. It helps ensure that applicants can do what they claim they can through employment and education verification. It verifies that applicants are who they claim to be and aren’t wanted internationally. Background screenings, background checks, pre-employment screenings – call them what you will, they help protect your company, your employees, and your clients. </p>
<p>There is no standard background check package because different industries, and even different companies within the same industry, will have different criteria regarding what constitutes an eligible candidate. Your company should have packages set up based on business necessity, packages that should be different for different types of jobs. Any executive position should be subject to more stringent testing than a basic minimum-wage employee. </p>
<p>The depth of your screening should reflect the risks arising from criminal misconduct in each specific position. When creating the packages, remember that if screening guidelines are too lenient you may hire criminals and welcoming unnecessary risks to your business, but if screenings are too stringent you may miss opportunities to hire well-qualified applicants who pose no threat – and you may even run afoul of the EEOC.</p>
<p><em>How long do screenings typically take and how are they done?</em></p>
<p>As with anything, how long the screenings take depends on which specific service you choose and how that service is done. Many searches simply require the company to enter the relevant information into a database, yielding instant results. However, most services take longer due to the need for a live record search. A few services require a combination of database and live searches and some take a more unique approach.</p>
<p>Instant, database-driven searches include criminal history searches, credit history, name and address history, national security lists, sex offender registry and SSN verification/trace searches, while live searches include county, state and federal criminal history.</p>
<p>Some services require phone interviews. Those include education and employment verification as well as reference checks. How long each of these services takes also depends on a few other factors.</p>
<p>Another factor to consider is which company you choose. A company that has an interface with a county will take less time to search that court than a company that has to send someone to the physical courthouse. Then you have to consider where you are requesting the information from. Records from a Department of Motor Vehicles can be accessed instantly in many states, but can take three days in others.</p>
<p>The most important contributing factor (aside from how information is gathered) is the difference between hits and clears. For instance, many companies, that run a criminal database check, will know instantly if there is no record. However, depending on the type of search ordered, if the database returns a hit, the information may need to be verified before it can be passed on.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I got my job with the feds with a very low level security clearance, I had federal officer come to my home and interview me, come to my new place of work to interview me, visit my neighbors and interview them about me, and visit my former employers to, you guessed it, interview them about me.</p>
<p>This agent was very personable and did a excellent job of making me feel comfortable.  Which is a tactic to get people under investigation to open up.  When getting a security clearance, it's like /u/NinjaJediSmurf said, it doesn't matter if you've done illegal things in the past.  What matters is that you aren't doing them now, and you aren't lying about your past history.  Don't lie.</p>
<p>On the flip side, I've got a buddy that has a high level security clearance and works for the DoD.  When he got his job, he had two days on the polygraph.  His description of the event sounds very stressful.  He was locked in a white room with sensors strapped to his body facing a white wall.  His interviewer was behind asking a series of question.  It sounded unfun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jesus look at all these super long answers!</p>
<p>This is how it works for me:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Interview person referred by HR </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like person, decide to hire person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 months later after person turns out to be crap, have HR ask if I checked references... did not. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receive smack down by HR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let person go &quot;I'm sorry, it's just not working out&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Interview person referred by HR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Like person, decide to hire person</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 months later, person is still good, still forgot to check reference</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Receive smack down by HR</p>
</li>
<li>Rinse, repeat</li>
</ul>
<p>HR usually has fairly good policies regarding reference checks... but... as the hiring manager it is up to me to ensure I follow HR's guidelines provided they are not doing the reference checks themselves. Because we know the details of the job best, we usually check references.</p>
<p>Trouble with references is, it's hard to get useful information from them. If you sucked it doesn't mean your reference will say bad things about you. That being said, if you were awesome, that also doesn't mean references will say nice things about you. In fact, they may say nice things about you to help get you a job because they don't want you knocking on their door again. They may also say bad things about you because when I called, I got the one person in the office that actually hates you. </p>
<p>Hiring good people is really challenging. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
