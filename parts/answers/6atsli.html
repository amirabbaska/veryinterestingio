		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cartridge has a built-in battery. This battery keeps the part of the catridge that has save file going when it is not being provided power (in the gameboy). So, just like a normal clock, it just keeps on going. Thus, if this battery runs out, your save file is gone and its time to re-buy the game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: there's a little clock and a little battery to run it built in to the cartridge.</p>
<p>That game was released on the GBC 17 years ago.</p>
<p>The game system itself was dumb, it just ran the cartridge.</p>
<p>Game cartridges from that time period would have a small battery that keeps it and all its save information alive when the Gameboy is turned off if they were meant to keep a save intact between sessions.</p>
<p>Some games, like the one you are asking about also included time based functions.  In order to accomplish thes, the cartridge would also have a little digital clock built in to it that could track what time it was.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cartridge has a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_clock" target="_blank">real-time clock</a> chip in it.  It does exactly what it sounds like, tracking the current time and day.  It's basically quartz watch without a display.</p>
<p>It's powered off the same battery that powers the RAM that holds your save data, which others have mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is because the cart has a RTC (Real Time Clock) chip on the board that is powered by a coin cell battery. The power draw is in the order of if I recall microvolts so a 2.7 or 3.5 volt battery will still have a adaquate charge for decades. I still have computers from 25ish years ago that still keep their time and have not dumped their primative BIOS yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
