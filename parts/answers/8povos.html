		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two issues here.  First, they need certain triggers to fall asleep - whatever they usually have, such as a rocking motion, you singing a lullaby, drinking a bottle, etc.  They ideally want the same smelling sheets as last night and the same amount of light in their room. If the trigger is missing, they have a lot of difficulty falling asleep.  This is why I always warn moms to be aware of this if they nurse the baby to sleep.  That baby most likely is not going to quietly drift off at 3 am in Dad's arms.  If you think about it, you probably face the same issue when travelling.
Another issue that comes up is their instinctual need to be close to you.  Babies can sometimes get distressed if their primary caretaker isn't there.  Newborns don't seem to notice as long as they are full, dry, and cozy.  However, a few months later they seem to realize that mom and dad can leave.  That combined with missing their sleep cues, and it's scream city, even if they slept well in earlier weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this has been mentioned yet but another reason babies and young children cry before going to sleep is because that is how they decompress. They don’t have solid language skills and aren’t emotionally developed enough to sit there and tell you “So I was really over stimulated today by all the fun things we did. I think I’ll take a nice long walk and listen to some music or a nice warm shower to just chill out. “ So they scream to release stress. Also when they’re over tired forget about it- something happens and they get delirious and turn into banshees. Many haven’t learned coping skills or the ability to self soothe which is a very important skill for them to obtain. Thus screaming commences. Parents often refer to the “witching hour” which is often about dinner time for adults. It’s a very real thing. Kids are exhausted and have pent up stress, parents are hungry and tired themselves so they aren’t full of patience and it’s a perfect storm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Child care provider/hopeful future postpartum doula here. When babies/toddlers are overtired, their bodies produce cortisol to help them stay awake. This stress inhibits sleep and results in the hormonal/emotional mess you speak of. </p>
<p>Edit: I've learned that what I thought was right is not accurate. My information comes from baby sleep specialist sites like <a href="http://sleeptightconsultants.com/2014/06/avoiding-perils-overtired-baby/" target="_blank">http://sleeptightconsultants.com/2014/06/avoiding-perils-overtired-baby/</a> and I haven't found backing from sources with more authority. I never bothered to check for myself because the explanation made sense to me and aligned with my experiences. Sorry, guys!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The behavior you describe indicates that the child is overly tired or had little warning that it was time to rest. Children who are up past the time that their body needs sleep become fussy due to stress hormones building up. Their level of frustration increases, while they also begin experiencing rushes of adrenaline as their body attempts to cope with the stress. Hence why these children can be silly one second and weeping the next. Their ability to cope with minor set backs decreases to a critical point at which most caregivers will go &quot;Ohhhh, you're tired&quot; and immediately attempt to put the child down for nap. But interrupting whatever they were doing and going straight into nap is also a potential conflict, as they don't perceive themselves as ready for nap. They're busy trying to rip the wall paper down (or something similar).</p>
<p>So now, you've got a baby who is stressed (due to exhaustion) and frustrated (due to having to stop what they were doing for this 'nap' thing you're raving about) and over stimulated (due to adrenaline). And we're expecting them to lie still and go to sleep.... all three of the above things are reasons children cry. It defuses  energy and expels stress hormones, and it communicates to you &quot;I need help, something is wrong with me&quot;.</p>
<p>So, how to prevent this. Have a routine... it doesn't have to be extensive. Even just 1)diaper change 2) a lullaby and 3) I put you in your crib can be enough for some children. And in addition to their routine, you have to notice their first tired cue and begin the routine. Rubbing eyes, bags forming, yawning, slowing down, becoming clumsy... these are all cues and each child is a little different. Once you know a child's cue, begin the routine as soon as they have one or two and BEFORE their tiredness upsets them.</p>
<p>Other helpful nap time tips -</p>
<ul>
<li>limit screen time. Children under 3 especially are highly influenced by tv and other video devices. Not only do programs and games make them sedentary so they are not burning energy through physical or mental play, but the blue light messes with their circadian rhythm and sleep hormones.</li>
</ul>
<p>-get outside. Sunlight is best for helping children's sleep hormones regulate appropriately.</p>
<p>-avoid relying on tricks or devices to put children to sleep if possible (swings, cars, on top of the washer etc.) These limit a child's ability to learn what it feels like to fall asleep and build this skill. Some families desperately need them to survive the first few years, and if it's what they have to do, that's fine. But a young child will eventually have to unlearn those habits... many healthy infants and toddlers can learn to fall asleep with minimal support. But it does take a lot of trust and patience from caregivers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
