		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well a couple reasons. One is that the type of tissue that makes up the inside of your mouth has more blood supply than say your skin. More nutrients means it has the tools to heal faster.</p>
<p>Also it's a great deal simpler than just regular skin.. You have like layers on layers of highly specialized cells on the skin of say your hand.. Where in your mouth it's just a mucous membrane with a smattering of fiberous tissue</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's <a href="https://youtu.be/fRTFxphF93Q" target="_blank">an episode of SciShow</a> that explains a little of what's going on here, but the gist of it is that human saliva, and that of some animals contains a protein called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tissue_factor" target="_blank">Tissue Factor</a> which they claim helps with the blood clotting process. They add that saliva also has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lysozyme" target="_blank">Lysozyme</a>, an enzyme which can inhibit bacterial growth by attacking the cell walls of certain bacteria.</p>
<p>Edit: yes, the video I referenced is about why animals lick their wounds, and yes it applies to humans and no, I don't advise you to do that. Use some neosporin or something you animals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's one reason that I didn't see mentioned here. It HAS to. It's got a lot of things going for it that help it heal quickly, but when you get right down to it, cuts, abrasions, and burns in your mouth have to heal quickly or else they'd become really nasty festering wounds. Mouths are really nasty biological cesspools, and if you get an injury there, you're a lot better off if the skin cells in there are actually programmed to react to damage with superspeed repairs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's highly vascularized and it's keratinized stratified squamous skin tissue. Keratinized cells are generally the types of cells on the body that are regularly exposed to the outside world, they tend to be tougher and repair quickly due to the fact they are hydrated and are often exposed to simple trauma. They are arranged in a manner that allows them to slough off and be replaced easily without the deeper layers of tissue becoming exposed.
Edit: sorry didn't know what ELI5 meant before I posted this. Was excited there was a question I knew the answer to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partially because of certain healing factors found in saliva and in the cheek, even though the entire process is not fully known/ agreed upon. Also, as previously explained, the saliva is antibacterial due to proteins such as lysozymes and others. </p>
<p>Another reason is that the saliva will keep the wound moisturised, and that there are a lot of blood vessels in your cheek that can stimulate healing quickly. </p>
