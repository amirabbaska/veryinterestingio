		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are stimulating your retina from the outside. </p>
<p>You'll notice if you press on the bottom-outside of your eye you see a spot in the top-inside of your vision since that part of your retina receives the light from the top-inside of your visual field. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phenomenon is called &quot;phosphenes&quot; and the cause is still unknown when this occurs without applying pressure to your eye. When you rub your eyes you see light because the photoreceptors ( light receptors or the thing that recognizes light in your eye) are modified mechanoreceptors (receptors that perceive pressure or touch). That means when you push on your eye you can make this receptor think it's seeing light by applying pressure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light hits the retina, which sends signals to the brain for interpretation.</p>
<p>The random stimulation that is caused by squishing your eye is just that: random.</p>
<p>However, your brain still wants to make sense of it, so the randomness is interpreted into something you already know, like TV static, or lights flashing, or colorful geometric shape patterns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
