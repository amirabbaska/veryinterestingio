		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For me, it's not that it avoids a knot, but that each individual connector somehow avoids becoming twisted.  Even looking at the simple one that goes from the top of the cube to the bottom of the image, I can't quite grasp it.</p>
<p>Also, thanks for this.  Learned something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty hard to explain in words. The topological concept that is being depicted is the double cover of SO(3) by SU(2), along with the fact that SU(2) is simply connected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you ask a question like &quot;why doesn't X do Y&quot; it means you expect X to do Y, and it doesn't. It's very hard to answer why something doesn't do a thing, but it is feasible to explain why someone's expectation is not met, or is wrong.</p>
<p>Can you tell us why you think it <em>should</em> produce a knot?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers so far explain this to someone who knows about the theory of Lie groups, but for those who don't know what any of that stuff is, notice that the cube in the middle is rotating half as fast as the belts on the top and bottom, while dragging the other belts around at the same speed. In other words, the cube goes around twice for every one time the belt on the axis of rotation goes around once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not topology expert, but engineer. The 'ribbons' for lack of better term never cross paths. Each ellipses thatvis traced out exists inside or outside of the next. If paths are never crossed there can not be a knot created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
