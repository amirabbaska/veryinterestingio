		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When learning a song by ear, usually a good start is to ask &quot;is this a major or a minor key?&quot;
If a song is &quot;happy&quot; sounding its in a major key. If its &quot;sad&quot; then its in a minor key... then from there you can figure out what exact key the song is in by playing a lead of sorts over it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look a piano keyboard. There are black keys and white keys.</p>
<p>If you start at C, and play all 12 notes to the next C -- white <em>and</em> black, in order left to right -- you will be playing a chromatic scale. In a chromatic scale, each note is one semitone higher than the last.</p>
<p>Now do the same again, but play only the <em>white</em> notes. This time, you'll be playing the scale of C major, which goes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C. But notice how between some of the white notes, there is no black key -- no black key between D and F, and no black key between B and C.</p>
<p>In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li>between C and D is a whole tone</li>
<li>between D and E is a whole tone</li>
<li>between E and F is a semitone</li>
<li>between F and G is a whole tone</li>
<li>between G and A is a whole tone</li>
<li>between A and B is a whole tone</li>
<li>between B and C is a semitone</li>
</ul>
<p>That's why, by the way, you can never have the note E♯ or F♭, or the note B♯ or C♭ -- they don't exist.</p>
<p>This, then, is the pattern of a major scale: tone - tone - semitone - tone - tone - tone -semitone.</p>
<p>Now play the white keys again, but this time start at A. This is the scale of A minor, and it goes like this: tone - semitone - tone - tone - semitone - tone - tone.</p>
<p>It's actually a bit more complex, because there are different <em>types</em> of minor key, but this is the bare bones of it: it's about the sequence of whole tones and semitones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are twelve places on a wall where you can put shelves, equally spaced apart.<br />
Say most musicians put three shelves up and call it a CHORD, because reasons. The floor is called the TONIC and let’s put the first shelf straight down on it.<br />
The top shelf, let’s put it in the #8 bracket which just is over your head. (The spaces between shelf places are half steps, which is why I will call that #8 slot the FIFTH. Just doing that to annoy everyone, obviously.)  </p>
<p>The difference between Major and Minor is where the middle shelf hits you when you <em>walk into that wall.</em> Major - shelf is in slot #5 and it <strong>touches your heart.</strong> “Happy” feeling
Minor - note, uh, shelf is in slot #4 and <strong>hits you in the gut.</strong> “Sad” feels </p>
<p>I have other metaphors, like why the “crowdedness” of the shelf levels can cause other, virtual shelves to manifest, or the influence of Gravity on melodies, but we quickly get away from the ELI5 realm don’t we?</p>
<p>(edit to add the word ‘places’)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh man.</p>
<p>So, a key is basically taking a subset of notes that can be used in a song, based on their intervals. You use keys because notes that share a key will sound <em>harmonic</em> (pleasant to be heard together) and you will minimize dissonance (think about amateur musicians playing/singing a &quot;sour&quot; note).</p>
<p>The notes in the major scale are determined based on your root notes, and what notes exist when you move up in intervals from the root: Starting from your root note, and going up from the last note, the notes in the key are:</p>
<p>I: Root note<br />
II: whole step (from the root)<br />
III: whole step (from the last note)<br />
IV: half step<br />
V: whole step<br />
VI: whole step<br />
VII: whole step<br />
(VIII: half step (to octave of root note))</p>
<p>So for C as your base, the notes in your scale are CDEFGAB(C), as there are a half-step between E&amp;F, and a half step between B&amp;C, and full steps between each other note (a half step between these notes would be sharps or flats)</p>
<p>The minor scale is a derivative (or <em>mode</em>) of the major scale: if you look at any minor scale and look at the 6th (VI) note, it will be the root for your minor scale, so your intervals are going to be whole half whole whole half whole (whole to octave)</p>
<p><em>typically</em> a song in a minor key will sound sad or scary, while a song in a major key will sound upbeat or cheerful.</p>
<p>Another fun thing is that you can figure out what notes are in a chord by looking at the relevant key, and finding the first, third, and fifth notes of the key. So an A minor chord would have the notes A, C, and E in it, while a C Major chord would have C, E, and G.</p>
