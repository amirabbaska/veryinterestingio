For any large game, the asset creation is a major task, and people working on that tend to greatly outnumber the programmers.  Good tools can help automate a lot, but still there's a reason why there's 3000 people on RDR2 credits list - it does take a <em>LOT</em> of manpower to make games in such detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants, trees, and rocks can be generated programmatically. For instance, SpeedTree is software that automatically generates an infinite variety of tree models. A designer might then start by writing a function that randomly places these trees throughout the world. Then he would rearrange them as he sees fit. Likewise, you could randomly generate terrain and then go in and customize it. So there are some shortcuts that can be taken.</p>
<p>Here's an example of someone physically placing each object and sculpting the landscape from scratch. It takes a really long time to do it this way, but I wouldn't doubt that this is more or less how Rockstar did it (because they're crazy and they can afford to):</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Games are made in game engines. These are software which allow a streamlined process of creation. A modeler will create a rock in a 3D program; maybe it'll take them an hour. Someone will make the geography of the map, someone will model buildings and trees and fences and grass and everything that goes in a world. Then, everything is put into the engine, where it's assembled.</p>
<p>It's much like how a car is made on a production line: hundreds of people all doing their own wee things l, sculpting and painting, coding and testing, and then at the end it's all put together.</p>
<p>Like a car, we have now advanced where many things can be done automatically. A game such as Pong would have all been hard coded, but now we have tools for automation. Tools to generate trees and textures, people and clouds, animations and sounds, smoke and explosions.
The game engine does a good deal of the heavy lifting.</p>
<p>So, with a game like red dead, while most of the objects that are in the game are likely fabricated by real people, but you might find that an area such as a forest has been almost completely generated at random (from the assets people made) with a few tweaks here and there from a real person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brushes. So many brushes.
A lot of macro terrain creation is done through &quot;sculpting&quot; a 2D mesh into a basic desired shape. On top of that the vegetation and rocks are &quot;painted&quot; (think like a normal Photoshop brush but as you drag it, trees appear rather than a colour). At that point, people will go in and place/tweak things by hand but the bulk of the work is done. Details don't take too long, relatively, when you have 200 people working 10 hours a day for 6 months. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so I work as an independant game developer, so maybe I can try to explain it as simply as possible.</p>
<p>A video game is made of quite a few main components made by different people with different skills. The 2d and 3d artists make all the graphical elements, like a texture, or a virtual object. It can be a tree, a weapon, a character, anything you SEE in the game. Animators will make objects and characters move, sound designer will make the sound effects. Then all of this is placed into a Game Engine. The Game Engine is like the motherboard of the game. It allows all the different components to work and be displayed together. This is also where the programmers are going to add the code that makes all the components interact the way we want them to. Without the programmers, you could actually move around in the game but everything would be still, there would be nothing to do. Any action you want to accomplish need to be programmed into the game, from simply telling your character that you want to walk forward to much more advanced stuff like AI.</p>
<p>Once the graphical elements are inside the engine, level designers and set dressers will actually take them and place them in the virtual world to make it look like something. For example, they will make a village out of many different pieces of houses, doors, windows, walls, add plants, lights, effects, until it looks real. Most of the elements are just the same copied and pasted in different ways. It's mostly a lot of tricks.<br />
This is a very basic explanation, it's more complex than that.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
