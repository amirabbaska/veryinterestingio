<p>Executive orders however don't let you make law. They let you control and issue orders to things directly or indirectly assigned to the executive branch. According to Article II. Section1. of the U.S. Constitution: &quot;The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.&quot; This means he can order things to happen as long as it doesn't violate the laws that Congress has passed. You should read up more on this here: <a href="http://www.thisnation.com/question/040.html" target="_blank">http://www.thisnation.com/question/040.html</a> If Congress doesn't like an executive order, they can pass a law overruling it and Congress's law will take priority. The president can veto the law however, so basically to overrule an Executive Order a 2/3 majority is needed in Congress to overrule the executive order. This is why the Republican controlled congress couldn't stop Obamacare from happening. Though a Republican president can simply reverse previous executive orders unilaterally. Specifically though, areas of foreign policy, national defense, or the implementation and negotiation of treaties are given specifically to the President in the U.S. Constitution and Congress has little ability to over-rule an executive order in these cases.</p>
<p>Edit: Additionally, I should add, the courts also have the power to overrule an executive order if it's determined to be in violation of the Constitution, this has happened several times but it's relatively rare. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#Legal_conflicts" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_order#Legal_conflicts</a></p>
<p>And you should also read our Constitution, every citizen should have at least read it once even if you don't fully understand it. It's the core of our country and it's not very long, only a couple pages, even if some parts are somewhat confusing. <a href="http://constitutionus.com/" target="_blank">http://constitutionus.com/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The legislative branch makes laws. The executive branch executes those laws. The judicial branch considers whether actions taken by the executive branch or laws written by the legislative branch are constitutional.</p>
<p>In executing the laws, the executive branch has an interpretation and certain resources. For example, a law might be created to institute something like the FCC, whose head is nominated by the president and follows the president's orders. The president needs some way to tell the various departments and bureaus what to do, so he uses executive orders.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with executive orders. You just need to understand what they do. All they do is to give instructions on how to handle cases requiring regulatory approval or oversight within the bounds of the responsibility of that department as assigned by congress.</p>
<p>If they overstep the bounds, then the action can be challenged in court. If the dept. itself is unconstitutional (for example, congress creates a department of religious affairs to say what religions can and can't be practiced) then it will be challenged in court. </p>
<p>An executive order is not unconstitutional until declared unconstitutional by the courts. Despite what conservatives would have you believe about Obama's executive orders. I don't necessarily agree with what Trump is doing, but he's well within the law on this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Constitution says that Congress gets to make laws and the executive branch, led by the President, enforces laws. The courts interpret laws, resolve disagreements, and determine punishment within the bounds of laws set by Congress.</p>
<p>There is a fourth shadow branch of government that you don't learn about in school: administrative agencies. These are entities-- some famous, like the EPA, NASA, FTC, FCC, and dozens that you've never heard of-- that are created by Congress and told to do certain things. Usually (and this is grossly oversimplifying) Congress will say, &quot;we are creating this agency. Here is how agency heads are appointed. This agency needs to regulate X Policy Area (environment, communications, whatever) consistent with Y Vague Standards. They must pass rules and can bring actions against entities that violate rules.&quot; The rules made by agencies have to be enacted, usually, by procedures outlined in the Administrative Procedures Act, which is like a handbook for agency actions. The APA requires that a proposed rule be published, the public have a chance to comment, and then a final rule must be supported by a statement justifying why the rule is appropriate. Rules passed by agencies have the force and effect of law.</p>
<p>Under these grants of authority, agencies actually pass WAY more rules than Congress.</p>
<p>Here's where things get interesting: agencies, because they are carrying out laws (enforcing the law created by congress), they are under the executive branch's ultimate control. The President usually has some level of power to appoint and remove agency heads, the President wields political control over agencies, and the President sets the policy agenda.</p>
<p>The President, through executive order, can direct an agency to make a rule on a certain topic as long as the rule generally falls within an agency's power. Similarly, the President can direct agencies to NOT enforce a given law! (Think, for example, the choice to not enforce the federal ban on marijuana, or President Obama's DAPA and DACA programs).</p>
<p>Presidents since Reagan have seen agencies as extensions of their own policy agendas, and while SOME limits exist, the immense breadth of agencies and delegation of rule-makong authority to the executive branch means that the President has a lot of practical control over federal lawmaking and enforcement through executive action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a presidency scholar, so I can answer this pretty well. In inhibiting executive action, there are four really key things. </p>
<p>The first is that the POTUS is not the Executive. By that I mean that the man signs the thing, but the institution must do any of the actions. If, for instance, Trump wakes up cranky and decides, by executive order, to have arrested on sight anyone who makes fun of him, many will simply not do it. Their reasons for disobedience will vary from moral to legal arguments, but many will not. It wasn't an order, rather a firing, but this scared Truman shitless when he wanted to fire MacArthur. </p>
<p>Second, there is Congress. Congress can pass law contravening Executive orders, in which case the law takes precedent. Congress can also de-fund offices, projects, etc. that try to do the will of POTUS. So if, for instance, Trump decides we should not do trade deals, but congress signs laws mandating him to do so, we'd be headed in the direction of #3...</p>
<p>Third, there is the Supreme Court. If someone sues POTUS for doing something wildly illegal (for instance, violating the fourth amendment by requiring us all to wear ID badges indicating citizenship status), SCOTUS would then decide the issue. </p>
<p>Fourth is political expediency. In the past, presidents would have rather used orders sparingly; they really piss off Congress and have the nasty attribute of being tied to the man himself very, very directly. This may be lessened if, for instance, the POTUS has no idea what political capital is and is already willing to simply ignore congress. This, I think, is the most common but hardest to study insomuch that it is the non-event, the deed that gets done without order that matters here. More orders happen under divided government or when the party in power has no one single mind on an issue: executive orders are a desperate tool to try to get something done when the normal legislating process works. I am willing to make the scholarly argument that Obama had to use so many for the sole reason that the modern GOP would have filibustered everything Obama wanted, even if it was a proposal for a bill to have the floors waxed in the Senate to keep the building nice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
