		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. --- An X-ray is MUCH more like a regular photograph than you think. X-ray film is essentially black and white film. It is loaded into a cassette that keeps the light out, but on one side of this cassette <strong>inside-- next to the film</strong> is a phosphorous based material that will fluoresce (light up) when x-rays hit it. </p>
<p>When x-rays are shot through say your arm, held next to an x-ray cassette with film in it, the phosphorous lights up where the x-rays were not blocked (bone will block them) and exposes the film with that light. The film is now developed and presto, what is basically a black and white negative is produced. <em>the dark part of the xray that you look at was exposed to light and the lighter areas are where light was not</em> remember it's a NEGATIVE</p>
<p>I have used x-ray film in my large format camera, and other than minor differences in speed and that the emulsion is often produced on both sides of the film, X-ray film will produce very nice negatives.</p>
<p>EDIT:-- yes, someone pointed out that a camera takes a picture of reflected light, and the X-ray is like a shadow image where the object creating the shadow is between the light source (x-ray) and the film. (sort of like an eclipse)...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference between x-rays and visible light photos is that the x-rays can't be easily focused. So we capture shadows made by rays from a small source. </p>
<p>Gamma rays are sometimes used like x-rays for checking metal objects. </p>
<p>Visible light can also make shadowgraphs. </p>
<p>Radio waves in the FM band have a roughly 3 meter wavelength so they can't be used to image things of that size or smaller. AM radio waves are around 300 meters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and indeed we do.</p>
<p>Although, they're not usually called cameras, but detectors. </p>
<p>All a camera is, is a series of photon detectors arrayed in a grid. You can make them to detect any energy photons you want, UV cameras, Infra Red Cameras, X-ray detectors, Gamma Detectors etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's more like the opposite of a camera.</p>
<p>A camera records light bouncing off an object. An x-ray machine shoots x-rays through the object and records the lack of x-rays on the film (shadows) to see the internal structure.</p>
<p>Camera records photons, x-ray records lack of x-rays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Right x-rays, photons, infrared, UV radio, visible light, etc are all the same thing, electromagnetic radiation at different energies. Higher energy = shorter wave length = higher frequency. Visible light is actually an incredibly small subset of this spectrum but it just so happens that Earth's atmosphere of friendly gasses is quite transparent to the range of light that our eyes are able to see, coincidence? no. <a href="http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/irwindows.html" target="_blank">http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/cosmic_classroom/ir_tutorial/irwindows.html</a> </p>
<p>X-rays work great for imaging because if you shine them on a body they pass right through soft tissue but reflect off dense objects like bones. Put a piece of film sensitive to x-rays behind your body or teeth, and it's quite easy to pick up cracks and cavities as the x-rays shine right through them.</p>
<p>As pointed out already, what's tricky is making a lens that can focus x-rays onto a single plane like a handheld camera. What we can do though is put someone in a device surrounded by sensors, shoot a  collimated x-ray beam at their body and see what direction the rays bounce off. Studying the deflection angles and moving the collimated beam around you can build up an incredibly detailed map of internal structure, this is how CAT scans work.</p>
<p>Now gamma rays are a step higher in energy than x-rays but you start to run into the problem that they're absorbed quite readily by our soft tissues and cause severe damage. Great for burning out cancers, not so great for imaging. Now x-rays do as well, sit in a CAT scan for days on end and your body won't be in great shape but in small doses the imaging knowledge far outweighs the damage inflicted. In astronomy and particle physics through we do have detectors built to image high energy photons flying out from controlled collisions or shining at us from distant objects. </p>
<p>Radio waves on the other hand don't work well at all for imaging objects at the human scale because their wavelengths are too large, which is good because otherwise AM/FM signals wouldn't travel very far and many a road trip would be left in awkward silence. For astronomy though the game changes and radio waves are really interesting to look at, but you need large arrays of radio telescopes to &quot;see&quot; anything useful and that kinda of camera isn't something you just hold in your hand. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
