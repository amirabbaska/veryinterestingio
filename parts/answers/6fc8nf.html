		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic economics of Crytocurrency mining comes down to some simple (ish) math - real money earned per unit time versus the cost of the power, and the average lifetime of the hardware used.  </p>
<p>So say a 100 dollar GPU will on average survive long enough to produce 200 dollars in Crypto currency, but in that time it will take 50 dollars in electrical power.  Net gain, 50 dollars.</p>
<p>So the more complex discussion is around Bitcoin specifically and China (and to a lesser extent Russia and Iran and a few other places).   In that case, and as is generally the case with bitcoin, the largest use of the currency is to evade government currency controls (where countries simply don't let you buy other currencies in large amounts), evade sanctions (where US and EU companies aren't allowed to sell stuff).  Since both of these are hugely important activities to the right people - in the case of China particularly rich people with ties to the government, who are using it to enrich themselves and get money out of the country and import stuff they can't get otherwise.  For those guys and with bitcoin in particular there is and was a significant financial motive, and to do it, they were and are willing to spend a lot of money, in many cases on custom hardware that is supposed to be really fast at the crypto math for their particular problem.</p>
<p>So enter etheum and other cryptocurrencies, and enter the world of ASIC's and semiconductor foundries and yields etc.  Hardware built specifically for bitcoin may not be easily repurposed  (or repurposed at all) to other cryptocurrencies, and lots of people are very wary of problems with bitcoin in terms of scaling and in terms of who is in control of the currency supply and decisions about what happens with scaling.   And as much as custom ASIC's aren't too bad, they need to be designed and manufactured, and if that's a custom job that adds costs.  AMD, or more accurately Taiwan Semiconductor and Samsung and Globalfoundries (and Intel) are constantly improving their manufacturing processes, doubling performance roughly every 2 years - moore's law - If you bought a custom ASIC 4 years ago that was twice as fast as the general purpose graphics cards, well, guess what, today's GPU's might be twice as efficient/fast especially if your ASIC supplier can't or won't make what you want when you need it.  TSMC, Samsung, etc don't want to talk to you if you don't want to buy a few billion dollars in components per year.  The total value of bitcoins in the world is something like 42 billion dollars, TSMC does 30 billion dollars in business a year, bitcoin is too small for them to care unless you have a big order.  So semiconductor manufacturing is getting better constantly, as is ASIC work, but ASIC's are expensive and if you need to replace them often they lose a lot of their economic value.  </p>
<p>So that's where AMD comes in, their graphics cards happen to be better at the raw floating point math cryptocurrencies require than say nvidia GPU's are.  While cryptocurrency mining and gaming have similar requirements, particularly graphics crunching where you're working on 4 vector blocks of 32 bits each (so 128 bits at a time) to do all of your processing, gaming has much more memory dependent behaviour (since the same things stay on screen at a given time), and gaming you can take chunks of the world or chunks of the screen and work on those somewhat independently on each pass, crypto mining doesn't have a lot of need to retain data.  Gaming also allows a level of imprecision in math (notably when doing decimal division) where a 0.001% error in values isn't a problem, oh no, that red is 0.001% not red enough!  Cryptomining doesn't really tolerate that sort of thing.  (Nvidia actually have their own fast math modes in GPU Programming you can use, or not, and for video game rendering it's perfectly reasonable, for scientific simulation or crytomining it wouldn't be).  </p>
<p>Along with that, of course are the fluctuation in the price of cyrptocurrencies, in march mining ethereum wouldn't have been even remotely profitable on AMD hardware, but now it is.</p>
<p>This is of course the sort of thing where people in certain countries might be willing to take a loss in their own currency to be able to buy foreign currency (remember, a lot of the big players in this are trying to get money out of the country or to avoid taxes and evade sanctions, even 0 apparent gain is worth quite a lot to them).  That's much less common in this day and age, but you used to see people on the street offering you much more for US dollars than the official bank exchange rate in India or China for example, because US dollars were restricted by the government.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are generally a good deal cheaper than Nvidia cards and for a good while now the architecture That AMD has been using (GCN aka graphics core next) turns out is really good for mining operations and better than Nvidia. So it makes sense for miners to use AMD since the cards are cheaper and they get better mining performance with AMD cards. So they make more money and cover their investment faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To expand on /u/HeavyDT's answer:</p>
<p>Bitcoin (and generally, any coin using SHA-256 as its proof of work) benefits more from a larger number of lower-power cores able to work in parallel. AMD's cards have this; NVIDIA's don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
