		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in the day, night vision goggles relied on vacuum tubes, specifically, photomultipliers, that were much more sensitive to light than human eyes. These tubes basically, as the name suggests, &quot;multiply&quot; light, making it easier for us to see. Now, the displays worked like old-school computer screens, or &quot;tube&quot; monitors, where an electron beam would light up a &quot;phosphor&quot; coating on the screen, making a bit of light that we can see. It just so happens that our eyes are more sensitive to green, and if I recall correctly, green phosphor was easier to produce in a stable form. Basically, we can see green easier, and they kinda worked like old tube monitors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I understand it, the human eye can distinguish between and see more shades of green than any other color, so having NVGs display in green allows us to &quot;see&quot; better. Also why some lights with a map reading mode are green </p>
<p>A lot of illumination sources for being all sneaky have red tints because illuminating things in red preserves our low light vision better than any other color. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human eye is the most sensitive in the green part of the spectrum. Because of this, people can identify more shades of green. Night vision technology doesn't pick up color too well, so instead of color you get a grayscale. Gray (or any other color) isn't as easy to see as green, so it's just like black and white only instead it's a greenscale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During the day, the cones in our eyes are their most active and pick up on red light much more effectively than they do green light. During the night, we cross over into our night vision by undergoing a process called dark adaptation. Our rods in our eyes become more active than our cones because their primary function is to pick up on the absence or presence of light (i.e. light or dark). The rods have basically no job during the day other than say the obvious, &quot;There is light everywhere!&quot; But, at night, the rods have a much more interesting job to do. The eye's focus on using its rods also makes the cones perceive green as brighter than red since the cones shift their focus and now have the easier job. This is a perceptual reason why night vision goggles and displays use green light. It is also the reason why the vast majority of alarm clocks use red light to avoid disrupting sleep as much as possible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A point that I don't think has been mentioned yet: the reason why being better at seeing green is so important is because then the eyepieces can be dimmer, using less power and meaning that the user's eyes will take less time to adapt after removing them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
