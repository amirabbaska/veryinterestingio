		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paper cups are coated with a waterproof layer on the inside, but not on the outside. When they contain hot drinks, the liquid is touching this impermeable barrier, so doesn't get the paper wet. However, a cold drink cools its container, making water vapour from the atmosphere condense on the outside - that's why your ice water glass &quot;sweats&quot; on a hot day: the water forming on the outside is not seeping through the glass, but rather condensing out of the air, just like when you breathe on a mirror and it fogs up. </p>
<p>However, the paper cup only has a waterproof barrier on the inside. This condensation on the outside of the cup can soak into the paper and make it go soggy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I posted this to another comment 1st but if anyone wants a little more information than the top comment provides:</p>
<p>It has to do with relative humidity. The relative humidity changes with temperature, and as the temperature grows colder and the humidity approaches 100%, it condenses. This is known as the dew point. So for instance the outside temperature might be 70 degrees with a 50% humidity, but the cold cup causes a small layer of air around it to reach much colder temperature (maybe 35 degrees) and will now have a humidity of 100%.</p>
<p>The reason for relative humidity is much like putting sugar in coffee - after a certain point the coffee contains as much sugar as it can possibly hold and now has a relative sugar capacity of 100% Any extra sugar stays at the bottom.</p>
<p>The reasoning behind why the relative humidity lowers with temperature is because cold air atoms are less excited than warm ones and are thus more dense. So with a higher density there is less space in between for water vapor to exist. It is forced out and condenses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cups used for cold and hot beverages have different coatings. </p>
<p>The better made cold cups are coated with wax inside and out. The exterior coating prevents the condensation  that forms on the outside from soaking into the cup causing to fall apart.</p>
<p>Hot drinks don't cause any condensation so the hot cups are only coated on the inside. They are poly coated instead of wax.</p>
<p>If you use a hot cup with for a cold drink, it will fall apart. Conversely, if you use a cold cup for a hot drink, it will melt the wax and contaminate your drink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
