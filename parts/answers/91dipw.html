		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most extreme bond I can think of is two surfaces chemically bonding together, effectively into a single object. If you’d qualify it as “sticky”, I’d say that vacuum welding is a prime example. When you get two extremely clean metal surfaces, not surrounded by protective oxide layers or other contaminants, and press them together, they can spontaneously (and permanently) stick together. This happens because there is nothing in the way to prevent atomic diffusion between both blocks of material. Diffusion occurs and the interface is just mixed away by small atomic movements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tack is not the same as adhesive strength, but people often assume that tackier adhesives are stronger. Adhesive formulation requires tuning the modulus of a pressure sensitive adhesive to balance the adhesive strength, tack, and other properties of the material. There are practical limits when formulating adhesives. PSAs rely on elastic storage and viscous dissipation of energy to resist debonding. The tack that you experience is the result of both the adhesive strength of the PSA and the speed with which the PSA builds up adhesion by wetting a surface. Harder adhesives dissipate more energy as they deform and debond, but are slow to wet out and don’t feel tacky even though they might be very strong. The Dahlquist criterion represents the upper limit for the modulus of a PSA. Softer adhesives wet out and build adhesion quickly, but they don’t dissipate much energy during debonding and don’t feel tacky. When formulating a PSA, maximum tack is often achieved when the greatest ratio of loss modulus  to storage modulus occurs at the application temperature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To properly answer this you'd need to clarify what &quot;sticky&quot; means. How might someone measure stickiness? Wet superglue is runny and doesn't adhere things at all until it dries, but trying to use already dry superglue won't work at all. </p>
<p>If superglue can have a stickiness value given to it, then anything that join things together after solidifying should too. Does this mean that a steel weld also has a stickiness? </p>
<p>You could argue that the carbon atoms in a diamond (or anything) are stuck to their neighbouring atoms. If you did then the answer to your question might just be whatever substance has the strongest chemical bonds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had the opportunity to study under Dr. Duncan Irschick at Umass Amherst; he has written many articles on adhesion <a href="https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/85/3/385/2691600" target="_blank">Here's an example</a>.</p>
<p>While I could not possibly answer this, there is no doubt in my mind that he could provide a comprehensive answer to your question. </p>
<p>Frankly, anyone else attempting to answer this would fall short. You'd do best to try and contact him; possibly see if he would agree to an AMA. Good luck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
