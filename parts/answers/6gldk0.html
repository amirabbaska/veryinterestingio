		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a Marine Science Centre, so I can't speak for Zoos, but whenever a large marine mammal passes away we either haul them out using fork lifts or cranes. Usually we'll notice a deterioration in their physical health months or even up to a year beforehand, and so would move them to a separate &quot;quarantine&quot; pool to give them proper treatment or end-of-life care, and this pool can facilitate their removal when/if they pass.</p>
<p>Once removed they're taken to a local animal sciences facility (any of a few local universities) where they undergo a necropsy (autopsy for animals). Samples are taken and tested to determine cause of death (whenever possible) and usually these samples are also preserved for further/future scientific study. </p>
<p>Depending on the animal and the permits aquired, certain samples like skin and bones can even be re-used for educational, public programs to teach folks about the life in our oceans! Surprisingly few public actually realize or are knowledgeable of the diversity of life beyond our beaches and ports.</p>
<p>Edit: formatting/spelling   </p>
<p>Edit 2: I appear to have recieved gold on one of my comments here. Just wanted to say if you, dear Redditor, so wish to gild, please instead consider donating to a local (or favorite) AZA (Association of Zoos and Aquariums) or CAZA (same as AZA but Canadian) accredited Marine Centre or Zoo.</p>
<p>Not all of us are evil and for profit or entertainment. Sometimes (as per the federal government) an animal is unfortunately deemed unreleasable and without facilities to house them they would otherwise be euthanized.</p>
<p>And they can help further scientific research into their species and hopefully continue to preserve their species in the wild. Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked at a couple of zoos now where larger mammals (rhino, elephant) have died. In both situations a necropsy was performed first - they're almost always performed for any zoo animal. Afterwards, chainsaws and a whole lot of manpower are used to cut up the animal into movable pieces and transport them for disposal. Depending on the kind of enclosure, cranes or other kinds of moving equipment may also be used.
For smaller (but still large) animals, like alpaca or kangaroo, they're usually hauled onto a tarp, carried by a team and loaded onto a van. These are typically cremated or properly disposed of depending on city ordinance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the zoo or aquarium. They almost always do a necropsy on the animal. Depending on the size, they'll offer the body to local zoological lab/museums or natural history museums for their collections and research if they have a way to prep it(I worked in a museum prep lab). Otherwise they'll either bury it or incinerate it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
