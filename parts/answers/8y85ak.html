		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A sunburn is not like a typical burn where you touch something hot and immediately feel pain. The damage is done more by UV radiation than by heat, so the temperature receptors in your skin aren't set off in the same way. The skin cells die from the damage, triggering inflammation (which is why your skin becomes warm, red, swollen, and painful). This is not an instantaneous process and can take hours to ramp up, which is why you don't notice it immediately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some excellent responses higher up about the damage a sunburn inflicts, but it also has to do with how your body responds to a painfull stimulus. In a effort to protect the affected area, it will cause that  area to be more sensitive to noxious stimuli via a process called hyperalgesia (painfull stuff get's even more painfull) and allodynia (normally non painfull stuff becomes painfull). That's why even a gentle touch on a burned piece of skin can hurt. It's a complicated mechanism and it has both central and peripheral components, but the inflammation (redness, swelling, hot feeling, pain, etc.) you notice around a sunburn is at least partly caused by the nerves that picked up the damage in the first place. Those nerves (called nociceptors) can fire both ways, towards your spinal cord and towards your extremities, and in response to pain they will exibit something called a 'axon reflex'. In short, it means that those nerves will release all kinds of chemicals that make surrounding nerve endings more sensitive (via inflammation), lowering their thresshold to pick up pain. All this takes a while to happen and it's possible that you pick up on the increased sensitivity after you've moved out of the sun, allthough i'd imagine you'd start to notice it anyway if you stay put long enough. Hope that helps! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
