		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sebaceous glands are tiny skin glands that secrete sebum, a waxy or oily substance that lubricates the skin and hair.  </p>
<p>Sebaceous glands are found inside the pores of our skin, all over the body, except the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There are more sebaceous glands on the face and scalp than elsewhere.  </p>
<p>As the glands produce sebum inside the pores, new skin cells are constantly growing, and the outer layers of skin are being shed.  </p>
<p>Sometimes, dead skin cells are not shed. They remain in the pores and get stuck together by the sticky sebum, causing a blockage in the pore.  </p>
<p>Pore blockage is more likely to occur during puberty, as the sebaceous glands produce more sebum at this time. </p>
<p>Oils build up inside the pore as it slowly swells in size, and in the case of acne where bacteria feeds upon the oils within the pore, white blood cells also accumulate, causing an even more violent and accelerated development of sores under the skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current top comment is about oil which is modestly accurate but if you're talking about cysts that doesn't apply. Staphlyococcus, a common skin bacteria, can get caught in all that oil and dead skin. When it does, it will multiply. </p>
<p>When it reaches an appropriate number (quorum sensing itself for an infectious dose), it will begin secreting a fibrinogen. Basically a biochemical that will create a matrix to harden and seal off the skin. This will allow them to create a perfect &quot;bubble&quot; that will give them good growing conditions and prevent your bodies immune response from interfering. Then they will multiple with any and all available resources. </p>
<p>Once they run out of resources, build up too much toxic end product (think bacteria shit), or space, they will secrete a fibrinase that will thin and destroy this wall. When the wall is wrecked, it pops and sprays concentrated bacteria all over the skin, where it hopes to start the cycle all over again.</p>
<p>This is why antibiotics are typically effective against frequent acne sufferers and the main reason they try to encourage you to wash your face &amp; use alcohols is to get the bacteria off of it.</p>
<p>If any of this information is wrong, my Microbiology degree sucks, I suck and the world is a cruel place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
