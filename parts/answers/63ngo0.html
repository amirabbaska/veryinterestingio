		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answers so far are a little too dismissive. The answer is that it depends on what you mean by one infinity being more than another.</p>
<p>The cardinality of the two sets measures how many elements each has. It is the same for both sets because you can re-label every element in [0,1] to get [0,2] and vice versa.</p>
<p>The (Lebesgue) measure of the sets corresponds to their &quot;length.&quot; The interval [0,1] has measure 1 and [0,2] has measure 2, so it's larger in that sense.</p>
<p>Edit: A third way to compare largeness of sets is the subset operator, ⊂.  Think of ⊂ being analogous to a less than symbol, &lt;. In that sense, a set A is larger than B (ie, B⊂A) if B is a subset of A and not equal to it. The problem is that, using that operator, not all sets are &quot;comparable.&quot; For example, [0,2] is neither larger or smaller than [1,5] using that definition. This type of operator is called a &quot;partial order&quot; in mathematics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think all of the previous answers are missing the fact that there are different notions of the 'size' of a set.</p>
<p>One concept, which others have mentioned, is cardinality, which amounts to counting the number of points in a set. In the infinite case, two sets have the same cardinality if you can find a mapping which uniquely maps a point from one set to the other (<em>injectivity</em>) so that each point is mapped to (<em>surjectivity</em>). For the sets [0,1] and [0,2], the function which maps x to 2x meets this criterion.</p>
<p>Another concept for the size of a set are 'measures', which basically behave like volume measurement functions. For simple sets like [0,1] and [0,2], the so-called Borel measure can be used, which would be 1 and 2 respectively. For most of the more complicated sets, a generalization called the Lebesgue measure can be applied. It also forms the basis for the modern definition of integrals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, it's the same size of infinity. The way to handle it is to consider a mapping between the two sets.</p>
<p>For every number between zero and two, you can divide it by two to find a partner in the set between zero and one. Every number is mapped so the infinities are the same size.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No they are equal. To prove that they are equal, we can pair up each value between 0 and 1 with 2 times itself in the values between 0 and 2. Since all the values will be paired up with one from the opposite set, we can say that the two sets contain the same number of values. This shows that the two infinities are indeed equal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question and it was a huge problem a few hundreds years ago. </p>
<p>The issue here is what you mean by &quot;size&quot;. We have to make this precise. How are we judging the size? Clearly, the interval [0,2] is longer than the interval [0,1] - in some sense, if we were to <em>measure</em> the two sets, the first one would be bigger. </p>
<p>But does that really mean one has &quot;more&quot; points than the other? Perhaps... there are points in one interval that are not in the other interval.</p>
<p>But is this enough to conclude that the &quot;amounts&quot; of points are different? And this is where the idea of countability comes in. There might be points in the first not in the second, but that doesn't mean that the two sets are of different &quot;sizes&quot;.</p>
<p>How would we count if we were a primitive tribe that didn't have numbers? Let's say you got into a fight and lost some fingers. How would you be able to tell if you have more or fewer fingers? The best way would be to pair them off, each finger on one hand to the corresponding one on the other. You know that if you can't do this, then the hand which is missing fingers has fewer fingers. </p>
<p>Georg Cantor used this idea to determine the &quot;size&quot; of certain sets of numbers. There are three kinds of sets: finite sets, countable sets, and uncountable sets. </p>
<p>A finite set does not have an infinite amount of stuff in it. </p>
<p>An infinite set can be countable or uncountable. What is a countable set? A countable set is one whose elements can be enumerated - just like our example with hands and fingers, if you can match up the items in the set one-by-one with the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,... then your set is countable. </p>
<p>An uncountable set, in some sense, is bigger than a countable set: no matter <em>how</em> you do it, there is no way to match up the counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4,... with the elements of an uncountable set. If you tried to make such a list, there would always be elements that are not on it. </p>
<p>The interval [0,1] is an uncountable set. The interval [0,2] is also an uncountable set - it's gotta be, because it contains all the numbers between 0 and 1, too. But are they the same size? Yes - because, just like with our fingers, we can come up with a rule for matching them up one by one. </p>
<p>All we do is use the rule which maps one numbers to its double: so for any number in the first set, just correspond it to its double. </p>
<p>Because this rule associates precisely each element in [0,1] to [0,2], and we know that any number in [0,2] is the double of some number in [0,1], this rule perfectly matches the sets. The only way the sets can be perfectly matched up like this is if there were as many elements in each set, just like with our fingers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
