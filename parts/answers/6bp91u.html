		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm familiar with the fact that tardigrades (waterbears) can survive exposure to certain levels of ionizing radiation from the solar wind encountered in outer space. </p>
<p>But what prospect is there for organisms to actually derive their energy or sustenance from this type of radiation? </p>
<p>Put another way, are moderate amounts of ionizing radiation always harmful to organic cells â€” or are there existing (or engineer-able) cells which could thrive on such radiation? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
