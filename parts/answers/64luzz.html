		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly cues from our environment which influence what are called our circadian rhythms. This is something like our body's &quot;sleep schedule&quot; which can be thrown off if our environmental cues change (like traveling to a different time zone) or if we become accustomed to being awake at different times (staying up too late on the weekend and waking up feeling like a zombie). There is also an area in our brain which can keep track of time independently from these cues and rhythms, however I don't know much about what it's called or how it works</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
