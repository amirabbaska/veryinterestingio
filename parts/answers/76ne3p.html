		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are there any ideas yet about why LIGO has seen a 1.1 solar mass neutron star in this binary, but we have <em>never</em> seen such a low mass neutron star before either as pulsars or in X-ray binaries? How do you make such a low mass neutron star? </p>
<p>EDIT: 1.1 is the lowest NS mass, but it looks like the distribution is not so tightly peaked as I was thinking: <a href="https://stellarcollapse.org/sites/default/files/2016-05/table_0.pdf" target="_blank">https://stellarcollapse.org/sites/default/files/2016-05/table_0.pdf</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>On the LIGO livestream they said that VIRGO didn't detect the signal. However it actually helped them localize the source since they knew to look into VIRGO blind spots. Would a VIRGO detection actually have helped localizing the origin of the signal or made it harder? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
