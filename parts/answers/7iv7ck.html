		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A common way is to use a nuclear reactor. The chain reaction produces a lot of neutrons. By construction a neutron transparent &quot;window&quot; into the reactor, some of the neutrons will escape through the window, in a crude beam. You can then place the experiment in the beam.</p>
<p>Some experiments, can simply be done in the reactor - and a small test tube containing the experiment can just be installed into the reactor core.</p>
<p>While fission reactors are low tech and can produce very large numbers of neutrons, they are limited in the energy of neutrons that they can produce. Many designs of nuclear reactor use a &quot;moderator&quot; to reduce the neutron energy for the chain reaction, and this will reduce the energy of the neutrons available for experiments. Even &quot;fast&quot; reactors without a moderator are limited to the maximum energy of fission neutrons.</p>
<p>Where faster neutrons are required, a fusion reactor can be used. However, while fusion reactors can be constructed extremely cheaply and compactly, this type of design has been limited to very low power and therefore very low neutron production rate. A new generation of advanced &quot;compact neutron source&quot; fusion reactors optimised for very high neutron production rates (<a href="https://www.phoenixwi.com/product/high-yield-neutron-generator" target="_blank">https://www.phoenixwi.com/product/high-yield-neutron-generator</a>).</p>
<p>Some of the latest technology versions are so powerful and efficient, that they are often easier, cheaper and safer to use than fission reactors. Due to the risk of fission reactors being subverted for production of nuclear weapons, many governments are pushing for research institutions to replace their fission reactors with fusion sources. You can always add a moderator to reduce the neutron energy if the fusion neutrons are too fast for your experiment.</p>
<p>For experiments requiring neutrons which are faster than the maximum fusion neutron energy, then you need to use a particle accelerator and a &quot;spallation target&quot;. A proton accelerator is produce a beam of high energy protons - which are directed at a target made from a heavy metal. The protons hit the nuclei in the target and smash off neutrons. These can have energies as high as the proton beam energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the projects I work on uses a dense plasma focus machine, also known as a z-pinch machine. Trying to keep it ELI5, it uses a huge electric current to create plasma in a tube filled with tritium and deuterium. The way it's designed, the extreme magnetic fields crush the deuterium and tritium together, which causes a fusion reaction, to provide a burst of high energy neutrons. We then place the target in the path of those neutrons next to the source. I don't think I can really get more technical without leaving ELI5 territory, but at least I don't have to worry about what is and isn't classified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The second way of doing it is to take very fast moving protons (the middle of a hydrogen atom) and smash them into Tungsten. A process called spallation happens, but basically the protons are moving fast enough to 'knock' some neutrons out. This works well for scientists because essentially if you turn of the proton source you turn off the neutron source, unfortunately it requires building particle accelerators, which is quite an expensive thing to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have discussed the two main processes of producing a beam of neutrons, namely spallation and nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>I thought it should be mentioned that these two provide different types of neutron beams that are more or less suited to particular experiments.</p>
<p>In general, neutron scattering experiments tell you information about where the nuclei in atoms are, how they can be excited (e.g. Vibrations), and things like their magnetic moments due to the dipole moment of the neutron. This is very useful for a huge range of applications, including materials science / engineering, condensed matter physics, chemistry, biology, archaeology etc, there really are a huge variety of neutron experiments performed every day at facilities around the world.</p>
<p>In a reactor source, you have a continuous source of neutrons, whilst in a spallation source you get pulses of neutrons. A spallation source will have a much lower flux, however it is important to know the initial energy of the neutron, and it is here where the pulsed nature of spallation sources has a great benefit. Since neutrons are created at well defined times in bursts, and since neutrons have mass and so do not travel at the speed of light, it is possible to work out a specific neutrons energy from its speed. Since the distance from the source to the detector is well calibrated, and the time of creation is known, it is possible to use how long it took to detect the neutron (aka its Time Of Flight) to label the energy.</p>
<p>In this way, reactor sources give very high flux of a specific energy, whilst spallation TOF give access to a range of energies, that can be separated out with the TOF, and is more suited for broad surveys where more than one incident energy is required </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
