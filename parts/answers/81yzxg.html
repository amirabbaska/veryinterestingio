		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Itâ€™s called an after image, the way the light receptor cells work in your eye is that when they interact with light they emit a chemical which triggers surrounding Neurons and the signal is sent to your brain, but there is a delay in the amount of time before that receptor can be activated because it must first reabsorb the emitted chemical.  In the case of looking at a bright light, your receptor cells are releasing a lot of that chemical and as a result take longer to reabsorb, in the time between being reabsorbed the chemicals are constantly activating the surrounding Neurons which results in a persistent image being perceived.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not completely sure but I guess I'll try to explain it and someone with more specific knowledge will correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>To explain this, we first need to look at the nervous system's structure and how our body detects stimuli.</p>
<p>Our nervous system uses four different types of cells to detect a stimulus. First, there are receptors, which are found on the end of sensory neurones. Receptors are sensitive to one type of stimulus. Our body has specific receptors for light, pressure, heat, pain, etc. The sensory neurone also is made up of an axon (imagine like an insulated wire made of cells). When coming into contact with a stimulus, energy is transferred from the stimulus to our body. Receptors convert this energy to electrical energy, and send an impulse down the axon of their sensory neurone (this initial signal is called a generator potential). But it's not as simple as just sending electricity down a wire, it works more like this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Energy from the stimulus causes sodium ion channels on the membrane of the axon to open.</li>
<li>Sodium ions move into the axon through the open channels.</li>
<li>Sodium ions are positive, so this causes the axon to become more positive. This is called depolarisation. For the signal to be transmitted further, enough sodium ions need to move into the axon to reach a threshold value. This is why stimuli that are very low in energy are not detected by our body.</li>
<li>The change in potential (think of it as charge, though it's kinda different) inside the axon causes other sodium channels further down the axon or in other connected neurones to open (these channels that open because of the change in potential are called voltage-gated channels, because the voltage change causes them to open).</li>
<li>This means that more sodium ions can move into the axon further down the axon.</li>
<li>Channels where the sodium ions are done moving in close, so this causes something similar to a chain reaction that is unidirectional.</li>
</ol>
<p>The electrical impulse that I referred to as a chain reaction is called an action potential, because its transmission to the effector cells (cells that respond to the stimulus, such as muscle cells) will perform an action if this action potential reaches them. Also, an important thing to note is that a stimulus with more energy will cause the sodium ion channels to open more frequently. This means that, upon reaching synapses (gaps between neurones), something called temporal summation can occur. This means that more action potentials pass through a neurone per unit time, so a stronger action potential can be transmitted, for longer.</p>
<p>Now we're ready to answer the question.</p>
<p>The human eye has specific receptors, called rod and cone cells. Rod cells detect light and dark, whereas cone cells are better at detecting colours. Each cone cell detects one colour. These are found in the retina (a layer of cells inside the eye). </p>
<p>Light hits these receptors. The energy from the light will be used to open sodium ion channels in the membrane of the axon of the sensory neurones. Because the light is so strong and high in energy (typically light that is naturally this high in energy is white light, which is made up of all colours), the cone cells for every colour will be stimulated, and a large amount of them. Evidently, all the rod cells will also be stimulated. This means that sodium ions can move in, creating a generator potential. This then causes an action potential in the neurones.</p>
<p>The light, however, was so strong that some receptors might be stimulated even after the light is gone, or maybe temporal summation occurs, meaning that you might still be having action potentials after the stimulus is gone. As a result, your nervous system is still sending impulses to the brain even after the stimulus is gone. And that's it.</p>
<p>Another explanation might be that, after the sodium ions move in, they need to be moved back out by chemical pumps, whilst other ions are moved into the axon instead of the sodium ions (the axon was depolarised before, now we need to repolarise it). This takes time, and you would therefore be able to kinda detect the stimulus without it being present.</p>
<p>This is probably not 100% right but I believe it's on the right track. Whoever reads this, if you know more, feel free to correct me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
