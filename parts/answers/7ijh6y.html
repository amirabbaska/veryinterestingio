		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are parts of Australia where the local people <a href="http://www.environment.gov.au/topics/national-parks/kakadu-national-park/natural-environment/six-seasons" target="_blank">recognise six seasons</a>. Hindus also <a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/the-six-seasons-of-india-p2-1770072" target="_blank">recognise six seasons</a>. One scientist believes we should <a href="http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/ag-blog/2011/04/should-australia-have-five-seasons/" target="_blank">recognise five seasons</a> in parts of Australia - the four-season model we transplanted here from Europe doesn't fit local conditions. </p>
<p>You just happen to live in a culture which recognises four seasons. The number of seasons is purely arbitrary. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the seasons are kinda arbitrary, it's not like you wake up one day and suddenly everything is different. It's all gradual changes. </p>
<p>How we've come to regard it, is basically there's a warm part of the year (summer) and a cold part of the year (winter); and a bit where it's getting warmer (spring) and a bit when it's getting colder (autumn or fall). Warm or cold is a binary choice, so think of it being the two extremes plus the two transitions. </p>
<p>What could you call a fifth? </p>
<p>I mean I guess you could start to split it up more, you could have the bit where it's starting to get warmer but isn't really warm yet (early spring), the bit where it's warm and still getting warmer (late spring). </p>
<p>I suppose you could even divide each season into three, a start middle and end. Then you'd have 12 seasons, about 30 days each. </p>
<p>See what I mean it's arbitrary?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different setups for planetary systems, don't forget.  There  could be a planet in a highly eccentric orbit, where it gets close and far from the star.  There could be a tidaly locked planet, where one side always faces the star and one always faces away.  Or no rotation at all so that half the year you have sunshine and darkness for the other half.  Stranger yet, the axis could be pointed toward the star like Uranus. All of these things could profoundly affect seasons.  The planet could even orbit the barycenter of a binary star system, or just one star of a binary system, perhaps affecting the climate on geological time scales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
