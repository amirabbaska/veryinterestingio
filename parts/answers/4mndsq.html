		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> For any given water molecule, the odds are basically negligible. But the odds that you've drank at least one water molecule twice are pretty much 100%. </p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Think in terms of the numbers of water molecules on earth. In a cup of water there are about 10^24 water molecules (100 g / 18 amu ~ 10^(24)).</p>
<p>The total mass of water on earth is approximately 10^24 g of water, which works out to about 10^46 water molecules on earth. </p>
<p>So if you pick 10^24 molecules out of 10^(46), put them back into the 10^46 and mix them back up, and randomly choose another 10^(24), what are the odds you'll pick at least one atom twice? We can approximate it in the same way we do the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Approximations" target="_blank">birthday problem:</a> P = 1-e^(-n^2 /2m ) where n=10^24 and m=10^(46). Turns out this number is basically equal to 1, so the odds are <em>almost certain</em> that any two glasses of water will have at least one atom in common. This generalizes between <em>every</em> cup of water - in that cup of coffee you're sipping right now, the odds are good that it has shared atoms with basically every person to ever live. </p>
<p>It's pretty cool how Big Numbers^TM work out. A tiny probability, given sufficient chances, becomes a certainty. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a guaranteed 100%, and you don't even need to do any fancy statistics. </p>
<p>Pour yourself a glass of ice water.  What happens?  Water starts condensing on the sides of the glass.  Some of those water molecules are from your body, that you drank previously.  You are actually breathing out water molecules which condense on the glass.  Take a sip from the glass and some of that condensation will enter your mouth again, meaning you drank the same molecule twice.  Additionally, as you drink from the glass you will leave some saliva behind, that is more water from your body.  Take another drink and you're ingesting that saliva, drinking the same water again.</p>
<p>There are probably many other ways that you could drink the same water molecule twice, but this is the one of the easiest and most certain ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>plot twist. hydrogen bonding in water means that hydrogen atoms routinely are exchanged between water molecules. Therefore a water molecule doesn't really stay the same three atoms for its entire existence. I would say this significantly decreases your chances of having drank exactly the same water molecule. you can observe this with deuterium exchange experiments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The chances of you licking your own sweat is so high that you're pretty much guaranteed to have consumed the same water molecule twice. What I wonder is how many times this has happened, as a percentage of all the water molecules I've consumed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
