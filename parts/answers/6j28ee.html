		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In heat, your blood moves from your larger blood vessels to your smaller ones that are closer to your skin.  Your skin sweats, and decreases your heat.  You cool off. </p>
<p>When you eat, your blood carries nutrients away from your GI system. </p>
<p>When you eat, you lose a portion of your available blood that could be useful for cooling down, so your body releases hormones to suppress your appetite. </p>
<p>It's a lot easier to die of heat stroke on a hot day than starve.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some can be attributed to needing less input.  If your body does not need to create any warmth of its own because the weather is doing that for you, your body uses less than its normal amount.  Keeping warm is just one use of food energy, but a significant one.  Less drawn from reserves means less desire for food input.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its not just that it needs less energy, its that eating and digesting food produces a ton of heat. Digesting protein and fat, for example, produces a lot more heat than carbs or just fiber. That said, the body's goal is to maintain temperature balance for obvious reasons and so it aims to decrease digestion when already overheated. Thats why you never crave a really heavy fatty meal when its burning hot outside.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you pay careful attention you will probably notice your body feels cooler after going a while without food. Similarly, eating a big meal always warms me up. Subconsciously you are probably avoiding the extra heat when it's warm outside. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
