		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SSD prices have been on a steady decline over the last several years due to improvements in the manufacturing technology and the overall volume decreasing</p>
<p>The rather abrupt price drop($0.13-$0.17/GB now from $0.22-$0.30 a few months ago) is currently being blamed on excess supply due to missed forecasts on smartphones.</p>
<p>Chip makers struggle to make <em>just the right number</em> of chips because too few will drive prices up and people will push for more capacity but too much will mean they have a lot of excess inventory they need to move so they can start producing the hot new chip on the line.  Chips also have an odd life cycle where some companies only want to be in at the beginning where its low volume but great margin, and other companies only want to be in in the middle when its tiny margins but oodles of volume to help make up for it.</p>
<p>It would seem they made enough flash for the forecasted growth in laptop and smartphone sales, but smartphones remained flat and they were left with a lot of NAND chips they needed to ditch.  The semiconductor industry doesn't hold onto product for any length of time because it'll be old tech by christmas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
