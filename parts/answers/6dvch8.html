		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Zipf's &quot;law&quot; is a property that's been observed across many heterogeneous domains, including word frequency, city sizes, income, and even television viewership. A Zipfian distribution is one where the frequency of a particular observation is inversely proportional to its rank, so that the most frequently occurring observation occurs twice as often as the second most frequent observation, and three times as much as the third most frequent observation, and so on.</p>
<p>It's something that's stumped statisticians for decades. A word like &quot;statisticians&quot; is extremely rare, but we aren't boggled to see it in a sentence. In fact, we see rare words all the time, because even though any particular &quot;rare word&quot; is observed very infrequently (compared to common words like &quot;and&quot; or &quot;to&quot;) there are a lot more &quot;rare words&quot; than &quot;common words&quot;, and these factors mysteriously balance out to form a straight line when you plot frequency vs rank. In fact, a flat distribution over a broad range of frequencies, i.e. having the rare and common words &quot;balance out&quot;, is mathematically equivalent to Zipf's law. That's a key insight, but <em>why</em> they balance out is still unclear.</p>
<p>The best explanation I've come across is from the recent paper <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005110" target="_blank"><em>Zipfâ€™s Law Arises Naturally When There Are Underlying, Unobserved Variables</em></a>, by Laurence Aitchison,  Nicola Corradi,  Peter E. Latham. Their argument is that latent variables can combine multiple, non-Zipfian distributions into a Zipfian distribution. Let's unpack that a bit, in a loose, hand-wavey way that doesn't just parrot the excellent and very accessible paper.</p>
<p>In a sentence like &quot;Alice likes the icecream at that shop&quot; we've got relatively rare nouns like &quot;Alice&quot;, &quot;vanilla&quot;, &quot;icecream&quot;, combined with relatively common determiners like &quot;the&quot; and &quot;that&quot;. In fact, if we break it down into a part of speech template:</p>
<pre><code>NOUN VERB DETERMINER NOUN PREPOSITION DETERMINER NOUN</code></pre>
<p>we can generate other sentences:</p>
<pre><code>Bob attacks the elephants at the zoo. 
Aliens control the weather on the moon.</code></pre>
<p>If we repeat this sentence generation many times, we'll start to see some patterns, because our grammatical structure dictates that we &quot;select&quot; words from the correct part-of-speech distribution. So when we need to pick a determiner, we've got relatively few choices, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;this&quot;, etc. Even though the sentences could be talking about completely different things, the determiners are going to be chosen from the same small set, so there's going to be a great deal of overlap. And even though nouns are a really broad set, in a wheel-of-fortune-like way, the sentence structure calls upon us to &quot;give me a noun&quot; quite often, so we end up selecting from that broad set a lot- more often than we would expect given how comparatively rare nouns are.</p>
<p>Obviously this glosses over the mathematical formalisms a great deal, but the intuition is basically intact: there's some unobserved structure to a lot of Zipfian distributions that &quot;selects&quot; from many different distributions over many orders of magnitude of frequency, and this &quot;smooths out&quot; the distribution so it becomes Zipfian. <a href="http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/figure/image?size=inline&amp;id=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005110.g002" target="_blank">This image from the paper sums it up really well</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three main explanations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The central limit theorem states that the distribution of a sum of random numbers tends to a normal distribution, but it has technical assumptions that don't always hold relating to how variable the numbers summed are. When they are highly variable, their sum can look more like a power law than a normal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>'Rich get richer' processes lead to power laws; sociologists call this the 'Matthew Effect' and mathematicians the 'Yule process's.</p>
</li>
<li>If you run a model for stock prices called geometric Brownian motion for a random amount of time you can get a power law.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many other explanations that are quite well understood by scientists (there was a bit of hype and backlash about power laws in complex systems a while ago but now most researchers in the field accept they are common but don't necessarily tell us anything surprising). These often require maths a bit beyond high school level making them hard to explain to an intelligent general audience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
