While this does stress the heart, it can help reduce resting blood pressure and heart rate since it trains the heart to be more efficient.</p>
<p>Anxiety, chronic tachycardia, and hypotension-induced tachycardia are the heart working hard <em>at rest</em>. This is the opposite of the effect that exercise has on the heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes there is!</p>
<p>The goal of cardio exercise is cardiac hypertrophy (heart muscle growth) of a specific kind. During exercise the body has a higher need for cellular nutrients (mostly O2) due to muscle use. Your heart beats faster to move more blood through your body. However, because your body has expanded blood vessels in response to the exercise it's actually easier for your heart to pump blood (your peripheral resistance is reduced) so your cardiac pressure is typically lower than it would be with the same heart rate but no exercise. This leads into the real distinction between exercise-induced heart rate increase, and heart rate increase from say, anxiety, caffeine, etc.</p>
<p>Without exercise, your heart experiences a severe increase in pressure. This pressure triggers cellular pathways to increase the density of a specific kind of muscle fiber, that is stiffer and less effective than typical cardiac fibers. So, if your heart rate increases from stress or a stimulant, your increased blood pressure (hypertension) with cause your heart to become more dense with a muscle type that doesn't pump as well, which can actually lead to a further increase in blood pressure in a run-away cycle. </p>
<p>When your heart rate is increased from exercise, your blood pressure doesn't increase as drastically, and the increased use of cellular nutrient from your cardiac muscle stimulates a different kind of muscle fiber growth. These exercise-related fibers are denser but still elastic, more efficient. So, your blood pressure and heart rate will actually be lower when you don't have the added load of exercise (i.e. most of the time) leading to better general cardiac health without any negative impact to blood flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think what is important here is to understand that the heart can be “worked out” for good and bad reasons. The heart is incredibly adaptive, so for a marathon runner, their heart will increase in size in response to the exercise strain, but as a result will develop effective working cardiac muscles which will allow for the heart to pump for blood per beat at rest, resulting in a lower resting heart rate. Where as someone with hypertension will put strain on the heart by making it overcome increasing pressures and causing it to grow abnormally which will result in excess, inefficient mass, leading to decreased blood being ejected per beat. This will result in needing a higher resting heart rate to accommodate the maintainer of a baseline cardiac output (mL/beat).</p>
<p>TLDR: heart growth is good with exercise, bad with disease states or abnormalities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Running, or any type of aerobic exercise will elevate heart rate. This is to deliver oxygen to working muscles and satisfy an increased oxygen demand. We also need to remove carbon dioxide. This is a good thing during exercise, and will improve cardiovascular function over time if you exercise regularly. At rest, we want to have a low heart rate. High heart rate, from anxiety for example, is not a good thing. It raises resting blood pressure which over years can put stress on organs and possibly lead to stroke. So, no, you will not improve cardiovascular function due to an increased HR at rest or during anxiety, and it’s actually bad for you.</p>
<p>As for the low blood pressure question, low blood pressure is healthier than high blood pressure, as long as it’s not too low. Excessively low BP can cause fainting. Ideally, if you are aerobically trained, your resting BP is in normal ranges. Sitting in a hot tub to lower your BP for a few minutes won’t be beneficial, and might lower it too much. Medications that lower heart rate, and thus lower BP, are effective and are a good thing for people with high BP.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Increased HR during exercise is beneficial, increased HR at rest is not a good thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
