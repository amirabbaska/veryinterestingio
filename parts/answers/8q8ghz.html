They replaced it with &quot;Active Calcium&quot; after the exact kind of argument you're making here. Their page about it is <a href="http://www.armandhammer.co.uk/science#active-calcium" target="_blank">here.</a> It is a company word, with no real scientific resemblance to liquid calcium, which only exists above 842 degrees celcius...</p>
<p><a href="https://chronicleflask.com/2013/08/02/liquid-calcium-why-words-really-matter-in-chemistry/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a fun article about the labeling of &quot;Liquid Calcium&quot; in toothpaste. It goes into more detail, and I think is exactly what you're looking for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It appears to be a proprietary formulation of calcium phosphate in a soluble/edible emulsion, which purportedly can deposit or mineralize directly into any microabrasions in the enamel of the tooth, reducing the adhesion potential of would-be bacterial colonizers.</p>
<p>This is not related to calcium's benefits in the process of bone development and maintenance as a dietary supplement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Marketing probably decided that &quot;liquid calcium&quot; sounded the cleanest amongst all the possible misleading terms they could have used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be helpful if you provided what brand of toothpaste you're using, and the calcium compound in question (calcium phosphate?), which should be listed in the ingredients list.</p>
<p>A cursory google search would suggest it's Arm &amp; Hammer with Liquid Calcium(TM) technology.  They're sneaky about using the (TM) trademark notation as to not exactly specify that you're getting literal liquid calcium - which would be incredibly hot - but that you're actually getting &quot;an ingredient up to 8 times more calcium and phosphate ions than the amount found in saliva&quot; per their literature..</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
