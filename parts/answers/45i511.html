		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047653" target="_blank">There was a study that has shown dogs are capable of social referencing in the same way humans are.</a> That is when we discover something new, we're influenced by those around us on how to behave towards it.</p>
