<p>When you pull it off the roll, some electrons get pulled from one layer to the one peeling off, making some bits positive and others negative.   </p>
<p>When you wrap it back over itself, those positives and negatives attract each other and it sticks.   </p>
<p>That's why it doesn't work if you leave it for a while before wrapiing or try to stick it to metal - the electrons go back to the right place making things neutral again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
