		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not exactly 50/50, but it tends to be pretty close. This is due to several factors that can occur, a big one being gene inactivation where since you have 2 copies of every gene, the cells will inactive one copy to allow proper dosage.</p>
<p>In your case where you have the genetic profile of yourself and one parent and you want to know specifically if the parts that don't match are from the other parent, the answer is most likely but not always. The reason it's not always is because new mutations can occur in the sequence of your genes during embryo development. These mutations are abundant and mostly harmless, but they can also lead to various diseases. A lot of known inherited disorders also tend to have a high percentage new mutation rate, meaning that even if neither parent had the genes for the disease, their child could due to a mutation during development. This child would then be able to pass the disease on to their children as it is now in their DNA. There's also some other more complicated events that can occur while the female egg cells and male sperm cells are being produced that can lead to slightly different gene arrangements and possible mutations that are not seen in the body cells but could be seen in the sex cells or vise versa. </p>
<p>Let me know if you have more questions about anything specific, I'd be happy to answer. I'm currently in school for genetic counseling, so it's a very exciting topic for me!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes that can be numbed from 1 to 23.  Assuming you are a normal human, you will have a single chromosome 1 from your father and one from your mother.  This goes for all 23 sets of chromosomes.  So in terms of number of chromosomes, you have 50% from your mother and 50% from your father.</p>
<p>Now, the number of genes contained in each chromosome varies, but chromosome 1 from your mother and 1 from your father will have the same number of genes.  This goes for all chromosomes with the exception of the 23rd chromosome, which is the sex chromosome.  As another user has posted, the X chromosome has significantly more genes than the Y chromosome.</p>
<p>However, sex chromosomes make up less than 5% of all genes.  So even if you get a Y chromosome from your father, you're still pretty close to 50/50 (maybe somewhere around 53%/47% mother/father).</p>
<p>What is much less clear though is genetic expression.  Just because 53% of your genes from your mother doesn't mean you're going to have 53% of her traits.  Your genes are like a complex set of rules for a game.  Some rules might cancel out or override other rules in certain situations, so you might have a but of genes that appear not to be used.  </p>
<p>There are certain traits in humans, such as eye color, that you may have heard referred to as dominant/recessive.  This means one trait (brown eyes) always wins out over another trait (blue eyes) when you inherit one set of each genes from your parents.  So you might have received the blue-eyed gene from your mother, but end up with brown eyes because of your father.  Reasons such as these is why you might end up looking 70% like your father, even though only 47% of your genes are from him.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are male, you definitely have more genes from your mother than from your father. This is because male children inherit a Y chromosome from their father, and the Y chromosome is much smaller and has fewer genes on it than the X chromosome that all children inherit from their mother. So barring odd chromosomal mutations, male children always have more genes from their mother than their father.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as getting genes from your parents, it's more complicated than just 50/50. </p>
<p>The chromosome that determines your genotypic gender are either X or Y chromsomes. If you get an X from mom and an X from dad, you are a female. If you get an X from mom and Y from dad then you are a male. It is true that the Y chromosome is smaller than the X chromosome. </p>
<p>There are 22 other pairs of chromosomes that make up your DNA. One chromosome from each pair comes from your mom and one comes from your dad. So genotypically, yes you get an almost exactly 50/50 split initially. </p>
<p>When an egg meets a sperm, fertilization happens, and the chromosome from mom and chromosomes from dad have a possibility of meeting up and mixing amongst the pairs. This can cause changes in the DNA. </p>
<p>Not to mention that not all your genes are expressed equally either. There are a huge number of factors that determine which of your genes are expressed or not. </p>
<p>Of course this is all assuming you have no DNA mutations. </p>
<p>Hopefully I've answered your questions adequately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL/DR:</strong> &quot;It's not an even 50/50 split you get a disproportionate share of your DNA coming from your mom. Really important.&quot;  - Robert Sapolsky</p>
<p>Here is the answer, in song form:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osWuWjbeO-Y" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osWuWjbeO-Y</a></p>
<p>In short, no. It's not 50/50, &quot;Slightly more than half of everything [we are] is thanks to [mom]&quot;.</p>
<ul>
<li>Males have more genetic materials from the mom given the X chromosome is larger than the Y.</li>
<li>Your mitochondria contains genetic material and that comes 100% from your mom. AFAIK, sperm has mitochondria in the tail but looses them when entering the egg.</li>
<li>On top of that most of your &quot;genetic framework&quot; (Mrna, transcription factors...) come from your mom.</li>
<li>Finally the prenatal environment has an effect in your epigenetics. This is largely overlooked since it's not exactly your genetic code, but it shapes you in a big way. A large part of that prenatal environment comes from your mom (temperature, hormone exposure etc.).</li>
