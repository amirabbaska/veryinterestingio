		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amplitude of waves in the ocean somewhat depends on the wavelength of them. For a longer unobstructed path, wind can have a larger compounding effect, leading to larger waves. The southern ocean is a good example of this, as it encircles the lower latitudes of earth (up to Antarctica) pretty much unobstructed. As a result, you'll routinely see 20 meter or higher swells going through there. Any scientist stationed at McMurdo has certainly earned his or her sea legs lol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As have many of you pointed out (you will most likely not see them) I have made a typo and it's actually Panthalassa instead of Phantalassa. <em>Pan</em> meaning <em>all</em>, while <em>thalassa</em> meaning <em>sea</em> in Greek.</p>
<p>Panthalassa is a superocean that existed during Palaeozoic-Mesozoic era during which it surrounded the supercontinent called &quot;Pangaea&quot;</p>
<p>If you wish to read more about it and sit 4 hours in a never-ending binge of knowledge here's a link:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The operative term is here is fetch, the distance that wind has to impart energy on water. The more fetch, the stronger the waves, until the two are in equilibrium. However, wind conditions are not constant as you cross an entire ocean, so the waves shift with the wind, making the total fetch somewhat irrelevant on oceanic scales. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So is that big wave on the ocean planet in Interstellar based on reality? Would a planet that is entirely covered in water, albeit shallow in some places, produce a massive tsunami like this? I imagine there would have to be an initial geological event or impact of some sort. I'm under the assumption, of course, that waves gain in size the longer that they displace water and wind conditions also push the water. So would there ever be a point in which this wave could reach a maximum size and be infinitely stable?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you need to factor in the submarine topography of the ocean floor and how plate tectonics aligns with it.  For example, the record 100-foot wave at  Praia do Norte, Nazaré, Portugal aligns with the Nazaré Canyon.  The semi-submersible mobile offshore drilling unit Ocean Ranger sank due to a rogue wave that hit the Grand Banks of New Foundland. Or the suddenly shallow reef at Teahupo'o where it is known for its giant wave surfing competitions.</p>
<p>Many submarine earthquakes are on or near by the edges of plate tectonics and many of the plate edges align with topographic rises in the ocean floor like the Southeast and Southwest Indian Ridges or Mid Atlantic Ridge. Combine them with wind and/or earthquakes and you get some pretty big tsunamis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
