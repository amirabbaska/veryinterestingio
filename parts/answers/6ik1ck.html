		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the contract with Disney for his work on Aladdin, Robin Williams obtained to include a clause giving him power to veto the use of his voice work in other production. It seems his goal then was to avoid being associated with lower quality spin-offs that might have come after the first film.   </p>
<p>In his will, Robin Williams stated that his work shall not be used for 25 years after his death. The purpose of this is to decrease the value of his estate in terms of projected income after his death in order to ease the estate tax burden on his family.   </p>
<p>Disney is still bound by the original Aladdin contract, needing approval from the Williams' estate before using his work. Disney is not directly bound by the will, but Williams' estate is, thus transferring the conditions of the will onto Disney. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Williams was given final say by Disney regarding which of his lines made it into the movies. It was on his contract. </p>
<p>This prevents Disney from using any of his outtake material (the stuff that didn't make it into the movies) for the duration of the will's legal binding, which is 25 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disney has the rights to use his performances for the original performances. So they could re-release the movies in their entirety but they could not use scene of it in other work or artificially create it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you sign a contract with someone else, you can determine who owns the rights to what.  Apparently Williams, and not Disney, owns the rights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
