		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former state food and drug auditor. In the US there are almost no regulations against dietary supplements. As long as they don't make any direct claims to treat or prevent disease they're ok to sell. Normally there's a disclaimer that the item is not meant to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease. Homeopathic remedies are sold in this way.</p>

<p>How is this not considered fraud, as it is intentional deception for financial gain?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Governments have regulated what claims can be made but homeopathic producers carefully avoid making legally identifiable claims. It is left up to the vocal community of private citizens to peddle the bull shit, and the actual producers just say stuff like &quot;Take this if you have a headache&quot; and not &quot;Cures headaches&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
