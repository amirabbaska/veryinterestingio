		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When in doubt, draw a free body diagram. In case you are unfamiliar, this where you draw arrows for all the known forces on &quot;body&quot; or object. We do this because of Newton's Law, and use it to help us better understand motions or stress on objects. We also take advantage of the fact that F(orce)=M(ass) x A(cceleration)</p>
<p>On the hovering magnet, it is motionless, so we know A = 0. Same for the magnet resting on the surface. On both magnets, we have multiple forces acting, but they all must cancel out, because no objects are accelerating. Since the directions exactly oppose each other the forces exactly cancel out, and there is no acceleration. </p>
<p>For the hovering magnet, we know the force of gravity is equal to the mass of the magnet times the acceleration of gravity. Since it is stationary, the magnetic force is exactly canceling out the force due to gravity.</p>
<p>For the magnet resting on a surface, we know the force of gravity is also the mass of the second magnet times the acceleration of gravity. We also know, since every action has an equal and opposite reaction (think of it as the hovering magnet pushing back on the resting magnet), that this magnetic force is equal to the gravitational force in the hovering magnet. But, since the stationary magnet is also not moving, we know there is a force opposite in direction that exactly matches the sum of the gravitational force and the magnet force on the resting magnet. The &quot;normal force&quot; of the surface pushing back against the magnet is equal to the sum of the force of gravity on the resting magnet, plus the force of gravity on the hovering magnet. Normal force is the &quot;effective weight&quot;, as that is what you would see read out on a scale. But, normal force is not the weight. </p>
<p>Thought experiment: imagine both magnets lose their magnetism, and now are just resting on top of each other. What are the forces acting on each body now? What is different and the same between this scenario and the scenario you bring up?</p>
<p>Edit: So to explicitly answer your question, the resting magnet does not &quot;gain weight&quot; by repelling a hovering magnet. If you put it on a scale, this would appear to be the case, but in fact, but that is because scales actually measure the normal force they exert, not the weight of the object on them. The term &quot;weight&quot; is reserved for the force of gravity on an object due to <em>its own mass</em>. Consider when you measure yourself on a scale, and a friend pushes down on your shoulders. Do you weigh more because a friend is pushing you harder into the scale? Do you weigh less if your friend is slightly lifting you upwards? The answer is no, the scale is simply reading out the normal force it is exerting, which is simply your weight plus any outside forces it must counteract to stop your acceleration.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yup. They will follow Newton's Third Law, for equal and opposite forces.</p>
<p>Although I'd be careful about saying &quot;weight placed&quot;- the force applied is via the magnetic force interacting between the two, it just happens to be equal to the weight in this particular set up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question has already been answered but I'd like to try a simpler explanation</p>
<p>Let's list down the forces involved </p>
<p>The <strong>top magnet</strong> is affected by gravity so it has a force going <strong>down</strong>. But it's also affectedâ€‹ by the magnetic force of the bottom magnet so that's a force going <strong>up</strong>. Together they cancel each other out so the top magnet floats.</p>
<p>The <strong>bottom magnet</strong> is affected by gravity so it has a force going <strong>down</strong>. <em>And</em> it's also affected by the magnetic force from the top magnet, so that's another force going <strong>down</strong>. Together it totals the weight of both magnets!</p>
<p>I tried my best to explain it without difficult words or needing prerequisite knowledge but I couldn't find a simpler word for force. Any suggestions are welcome</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity is pulling both magnets down towards the center of the earth.  The electromagnetic force is then pushing as well - each magnet pushes on the other.  The force is strong enough at close distances (as they follow the inverse square law) to push stronger than gravity. But just as the bottom magnet pushes up, the top, hovering magnet is pushing down with the magnetic force. </p>
<p>So the bottom magnet has both gravity pulling it into the ground and the magnetic force pushing it into the ground. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no:</p>
<p>Yes, there would be more force pushing the bottom magnet down.</p>
<p>No, the extra force is not called weight. Weight is a special name for the force caused by gravity on an object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
