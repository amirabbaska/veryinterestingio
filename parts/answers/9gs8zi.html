		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pigments in plant leaves are of organic origin.  These differ from pigments that are of mineral origin.  Most organic pigments have double bonds with delocalized electrons primarily between carbon atoms...such as C=C=C, and the nature of these bonds determine to a large extent the color of the pigment.  Mineral pigments derive their color from presence of various metal ions.</p>
<p>Photons of energy from the sun and oxygen in the atmosphere can break the double bonds between the carbon atoms found in organic pigments.  These processes cause the degradation of the various colored pigments.  When all colored pigments are lost (e.g., green, red, yellow, etc.) the leaf takes on a brown color.   </p>
<p>Now to your question...the reason pressed leaves, if stored properly , lose very little color is because they are placed in a dark environment and kept away from photons of light energy.   The level of oxygen in a isolated box kept in the dark also would lessen, but not completely, thus the reason all pressed leaves do gradually lose some color and begin to fade.   I think you can now determine why leaves on the ground all turn brown before winter.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Leaves, like all biological matter, decompose. This happens in two ways - biological decomposition and chemical degradation.</p>
<p>Biological decomposition is by far the main component here. When the leaf falls to the ground it is eaten by small invertebrates and microogranisms, fungi and bacteria. These, like all life, are to some extent, dependent on water. Even more so for simpler microorganisms. Water is universal to all life, and a damp, energy rich substrate like a dead leaf will be colonized and eaten (&quot;decomposed&quot;) quickly.</p>
<p>Take an identical leaf, but keep it perfectly dry - now you have made it significantly more difficult for microorganisms, especially fungi, to colonize and eat. They need the moisture.</p>
<p>Keeping things really dry is a an age old preservation technique to keep microbes away.</p>
<p>The second component is chemical degradation. Organic structures are large complex chemical structures. The bonds between them are based on probability, and while it can spontaneusly change into a more simple chemical configuration, it can not change back into a higher energy configuration/more complex (see Entropy). As such, things break down, slowly, by themselves.</p>
<p>The main culprit is Oxygen. Oxygen is highly reactive. It is why most all life use it as the oxidizer for our fuel/energy source (&quot;food&quot;). Sugar/wood/high energy organic structure mixed with Oxygen, add some heat, and you have a fire. Oxygen is what makes a fire. Our cells burn sugar and oxygen, but we do it in several steps, so we get the energy out in small bursts, not as a run-away fire. So, oxygen reacts with mostly everything, one chemical bond at the time. (Oxidative stress, one of the main reasons we age/wear down). Provide sun-light (high energy radiation), and the process will go a lot faster. UV-B and UV-C is the part of the sunlight that gives you sunburns and skin cancer. It literally breaks down organic molecules, including your skin, and it damages DNA. Oxygen and added energy through sunlight degrades mostly everything.</p>
<p>So, keeping the leaf dry wards off microbial decomposition, keeping it dark and sealed away from the air protects from the majority of chemical degradation.</p>
<p>As a side note, the beautiful colors of living leaves indicate that they are able to absorb some parts of the visual spectrum - these pigments are reactive and short lived. They are especially sensistive to degradation, and brilliant colors are a reoccuring theme in nature, in the form of sexual selection - showing off vibrant colors shows of good strong health to a partner.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Decomposition of leaves are done by several different organisms including insects, worms and microorganisms such as bacteria. When you take the leaves inside you eliminate the decomposition done by the invertebrates, so the shape will stay the same.</p>
<p>The colors turning to brown i assume is because of microorganisms (there might also be some chemical reason, but i'm not really sure on this). Microorganisms need a certain amount of moisture before they can grow, so by drying the leaves the microorganisms can no longer survive so the leaf stays intact. The same principle is why dry foods like corn flakes and oats keeps longer than fresh fruit and meat. If you want to know more about this you can look up &quot;water activity&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
