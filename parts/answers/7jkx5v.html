		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't really, it just chooses numbers it thinks are random, and it does a pretty poor job at it.</p>
<p>It usually starts by picking an unround number towards the middle of the range, with a bias away from numbers ending in 0 or 5 and towards odd numbers.  Then it is a game of &quot;what haven't I done recently&quot;, alternating between even and odd, high and low, cycling through digits you haven't used recently and picking numbers in the spaces between those you have already picked.</p>
<p>The result is going to be decidedly unrandom, to the point a forensic accountant can pretty easily tell when someone is just making up figures.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A simple way to put it is this. You are put into a panic so you try to think of the most random number.</p>
<p>Here is an example, from 1 to 10.</p>
<p>1 or 10 are the extremes and we’re just stated so that isn’t random enough.</p>
<p>Even numbers are out because their even, and not Odd, needs to be odd to be random.</p>
<p>3,5,7,9 are left.</p>
<p>5 is in the middle, 3’s too low and 9 is too close to 10.</p>
<p>7.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
