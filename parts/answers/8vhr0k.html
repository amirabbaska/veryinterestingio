		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok. You're the person to answer!</p>
<p>When we modify a gene and insert it into a multicellular host, how does that gene propagate? Since there are a vast number of non-modified cells why don't their descendants (as it were) overwhelm the cells with the new gene through sheer weight of numbers?</p>
<p>Or in other words, how does CRISPR cause system-wide changes without modifying the majority of cells?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
