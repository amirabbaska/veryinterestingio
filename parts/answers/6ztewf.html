<p>Not unlike how it's kind of miraculous that humans are bipedal.  Walking on 2 feet on uneven terrain and up stairs is pretty impressive too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>On a more serious note, they have hooves that have evolved to be able to climb these almost straight surfaces and I'd assume a lot more muscles than we do as humans. Also probably a combination of speed + muscles + agility --&gt; climbing up mountains </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To start with their hoofs are very sharp and their legs are thin. So even if there is a slippery piece of rock sticking half an inch out from the cliff they can put their weight on it without slipping. They also have a lot of balance and control over their movements so they can balance on those narrow ledges. And of course it does help to have four legs. So just like a rock climber can climb seemingly straight smooth surfaces a goat can use a lot of the exact same footholds to climb up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They have a real urge to get up on stuff and as babies they are terrible at it with lots of tumbles but they get better and better with time.  r/goatparkour</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
