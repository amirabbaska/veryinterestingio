		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neither is really advantageous for the next day, because lack of sleep is lack of sleep. My personal preference would be actually doing something though, instead of driving myself nuts just lying there.</p>
<p>That said, in the long run lying in bed is actually worse, because then your bed gets associated with wakefulness instead of sleeping. This is something that can prolong or worsen insomnia, and is targeted in cognitive-behavior therapy for insomnia (the gold standard treatment) using &quot;stimulus control&quot; techniques including getting out of bed within 15-20 minutes or so of not falling asleep and not returning until you are sleepy (i.e., wanting to fall asleep, eyes drooping)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My sleep therapist decades ago suggested lying in bed. Stop checking the clock. You have to wake up to check the clock. You'll get some benefit from resting and you may be dozing but not aware of it (since paradoxically you'd have to be awake to notice).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My gp and psychologist both recommend lying and meditating or relaxing in bed for about an hour. If I'm still restless, then getting up and having some water, doing some muscle stretching (which i can do I  the dark) might help. they say if i want to sleep i shouldn't turn lights on because light will reset the circadian rhythm and it will definitely then get harder to fall asleep. And then, if i still end up awake all night, do not sleep during the day! I'm up for the long haul so i sleep the next night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have the impression that we can be tired (and also restless) in different ways. For example, you can be mentally tired after a busy day. You can be physically tired, and you can also be physically underutilized (spend a day couch surfing and you may have a hard time lying in bed with the feeling of energy to get up and do stuff).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're mentally tired but have a lot of physical energy, staying up and working out hard can tire yourself out quickly enough to let you fall asleep. This situation happened to me a lot in college where I spent all day sitting in class or working on homework but was sedentary for most of the day. 20-60 minutes of hard workout solved my tossing and turning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're mentally restless under the effects of caffeine or whatnot, tiring yourself out physically can be enough to let you fall asleep regardless. I notice this most when I am out backpacking, I can just instantly crash even when I have a lot of caffeine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To go back to your question, I think it depends on your current energy reserves. Lie in bed if you think your body will get tired out too easily. Get up and do stuff if you think your brain chemistry can take it. Personally I tend to have better success with lying in bed, although if I feel like I have a chance of becoming sleepy I will go read something digestible in small chunks, like <a href="http://www.scp-wiki.net" target="_blank">the SCP wiki</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As my psychology professor said &quot;If you are in bed and not sleeping, get out and do something.  Otherwise you now associate the bed with <em>not</em> sleeping.  And never let clocks face the bed if you can help it.&quot;</p>
<p>It's the cues that tell your body that you want to stay up that can increase a sleepless night.  </p>
<p>As always, if you have a lot of sleepless nights, talk to your doctor and get plenty of exercise and stay off the phone while you're trying to sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
