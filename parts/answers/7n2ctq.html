<p>Sodium chloride stands out on this list. Sodium chloride build up is often due to sea water being trapped or secluded from fresh water. Over time the water will evaporate leaving the salt concentrated in that area.</p>
<p>As for concentration of other elements, despite starting out mixed, density will cause elements to separate out. Much in the same way a copper will sink in water, in a molten state iron will sink in silica. </p>
<p>A volcanic eruption can take some of the molten minerals in the magma nearer to the surface causing similar density of materials to appear near each other near the surface as they originated from a similar area/density.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When our planet formed, it was far less solid. The materials were able to easily separate themselves (over extensive periods of time) through differentiation: the separation of materials by density over time during a planet’s formation. This is why the crust is composed of nickel and iron, which are significantly less abundant in the Earth’s crust. Even when the Earth became mostly solid, materials were still able to differentiate. It simply took a long time. This differentiation caused the Earth’s layers, and has to do with why different layers have different materials, along with the conglomeration of minerals into larger groups. </p>
<p>Furthermore, some minerals (mainly lead) exist in large groups because they decayed from radioactive elements. Radioactive elements were far more abundant in the Earth’s creation, because they had yet to decay. When they did decay, they formed more commonplace elements such as lead. The radioactive elements would have come together easily because of their densities, which are very different from the densities of most other Earthly minerals. Once grouped together, they would decay into elements such as lead.</p>
<p>Lastly, the Earth was formed by the coagulation of different smaller celestial bodies when our solar system collapsed into a nebular disc. If one body was mainly composed of, say, radium, then the radium would stick together after the initial impact. It may move around, but it would mainly remain a clump. The reason one celestial body that formed our planet would be all mostly one mineral goes back to differentiation. That body would differentiate and have the denser objects in the core. Then, after multiple impacts that knocked pieces loose, the vast majority of the body would be one element. Generally whichever elements were the densest and composed the core.</p>
<p>Edit: the celestial bodies that would come to form our Earth also had similar compositions because they experienced similar conditions in terms of pressure, temperature, pH, and eH, as was previously mentioned by Earth_Dude. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, ore bodies mainly form through:  </p>
<p>Hydrothermal fluids - hot fluids rich in metal change chemical conditions (e.g Redox state, temperature, pH) and precipitate metal. Forms Cu, Zn, Sn, Au, Ag, Pb, Mo etc deposits.  </p>
<p>Density - heavy non-reactive metals/minerals (e.g Au, mineral sands) fall out of water and form placer deposits. Not as common as other posters suggest. </p>
<p>Magmatic - sulphides (rich in Ni, Cu, PGEs) fractionate from certain types of magma.  </p>
<p>Evaporative - shallow isolated basins in dry conditions concentrate alkali elements (like sodium, potassium, lithium etc) through evaporation.    </p>
<p>Iron oxide is a little different. Most comes from banded iron formation - that formed billions of years ago when the oceans oxygenated. Iron is soluble in reduced seawater but not oxidised, therefore most of the iron in the oceans precipitated out. Basically the same process a hydrothermal fluids, without the fluid being hot.  </p>
<p>I might have missed one, but this covers most processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>It seems that the original source for minerals was random and that they should be randomly, and relatively homogeneously spread over the surface of the earth.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>When everything is molten then yes it starts out homogenous. Although it's not clear if Earth was ever completely molten, it was very probably <em>almost</em> completely molten at at least one stage early on planetary formation. </p>
<p>It has already been mentioned that density is an important differentiator in these circumstances, denser substances separating out and moving towards the centre of mass ie. towards the core. </p>
<p>However, another important aspect is that of different elements preferred host phases due to relative solubilities with eachother. Four categories can be made based on this aspect (due largely to electronegativity of different atoms) and this forms the basis of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldschmidt_classification" target="_blank">Goldschmidt classification of elements</a>. So now we have a huge step towards understanding behaviour of different elements and materials as they occur on Earth - this is how geochemistry was born (insightful chap, that Goldschmidt). </p>
<p>Preferred host phases of different elements are why we might see uranium at the surface, despite it being an extremely dense element (uranium is a lithophile element which has a strong preference for hanging out with silica, the basis of the vast majority of crustal rocks and sediments, so it has refrained from sinking to the core).  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Yet minerals like iron oxide, sodium chloride, gold, silver, (and most others it seems) have had a significant tendency to be found concentrated in various areas, making mining them and collecting them a practical endeavor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many, many geological processes have operated for a long time and managed to concentrate different elements and minerals in various places through the Earth, some of these are of economic interest. Ultimately these are driven by continual heat loss and the fact that we have had an active plate tectonic cycle since fairly early on. </p>
<p>Most ore-forming processes involve hot fluids circulating in the crust and a common way of concentrating certain minerals is when they precipitate from these solutions, say when they come into contact with cold seawater (at hydrothermal vent fields) or jut cool off in the crust whilst travelling through faults, joints or microfractures. </p>
<p>Much of our gold resources and a few other precious metals are thought to have been delivered by asteroids during the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Heavy_Bombardment" target="_blank">late heavy bombardment</a>. </p>
<p>So, thanks to a dynamic planet which has had many processes operating on and in it, we have an uneven concentration of elements. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
