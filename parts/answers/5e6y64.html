		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liberal views within the social sense in the UK aren't very popular. Both main parties, Labour and Conservative, supported or at least abstained from voting on the Snooper's Charter. The Liberal Democrats, the third largest party until recent times, actively opposed such measures. Before the current government, there was a coalition between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, where the Liberals actively blocked any attempt to push any legislation through.</p>
<p>Britain has always been a fairly conservative country, with a small C. However, attitudes in the UK tend to be fairly placid when it comes to civil liberties until it affects our lives directly / until we feel the consequences immediately.</p>
<p>Theresa May is a very puritan prime minister with a sense of righteous public duty. Not my type of politics, but I can empathise with her method of approach. She has come from a fairly religious background with a sense of moral duty to ensure the populace adheres to a higher respect in moral standard. The Snooper's Charter is upheld to instill a sense of values and to also deter terrorism, deter crime and monitor individuals' behaviour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current Prime Minister, Theresa May, has been pushing for this law for a long time, since before she became Prime Minister (she did not win in an election, but because the previous PM quit over Brexit). She is quite old-fashioned, quite right-wing, and believes it's right to monitor what people do online.</p>
<p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, the UK secret services have been using many of the techniques that are being brought into law for years, illegally. Courts ruled last year that what they had been doing was illegal. So this is bringing the law into line with what the spies were already doing.</p>
<p>Thirdly, it's a way for the government to increase their power over what people do online. Part of that is about controlling minds - people will think twice about doing anything wrong because they know they're being watched. Part of it is probably that it will make it easier to censor anything deemed anti-British, or against the government, in the future. And part of it is that they will be able to monitor what people are doing online, helping them maintain control and prevent riots etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Within the current lifetimes of those MPs and others in government who enacted this law, there existed a time when the IRA and other groups planted bombs &amp; plotted attacks on London and other major cities in the UK. This is indelibly scarred in people's memories and has led to a culture where preventing domestic terrorism is seen as a very worthwhile and real cause (unlike in the US where it is used as a vapid threat to justify fighting an invisible enemy). This leads to much greater public acceptance of counter-terrorism intelligence.</p>
<p>And on another angle, the UK is a very close knit island with a dense population, isolationism and privacy (in the US context that is commonly viewed on this site) is not a luxury people have. It's a society where people must be social, and adhere to accepted social norms so that everyone can get on with daily life. In that regard, the level of social decency towards others is quite high, and the standards and codes of conduct the government is held to are also high. This means that when I hear that someone can see my emails or texts in the UK, I do not worry that the person reading them is some rabid right-wing Jesus loving nut-job agent for an apocalyptic police state, but a relatively educated professional who could be the person next to me at the pub. Therefore it is not something I worry about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
