		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of comments explaining the basic motor aspect of development and framing it as a pelvis size to baby head issue. This is one older theory that does not stand  up as well as another newer one (I’ve posted about it elsewhere on the thread but I’ll post it again). </p>
<p>Human babies are born developmentally premature for one main physiologic reason. There may be other non-physiological benefits (ie the socialization and language development during infancy that other primates do not devote energy towards). </p>
<p>It has less to do with pelvis size and more to do with the baby needing more energy (to grow its brain). While it’s true that babies heads would struggle to fit through the birth canal, there are other primates who have the same issue despite having relatively much smaller brains. This evidence may suggest that another factor besides size is at play. If you look at energy expenditures of the fetus, it happens to be that birth occurs at the moment they require more energy than they are getting via the placenta. They are essentially hungry for breast milk. This mechanism may be how birth is regulated in all mammals, but I only learned it in the context of human evolution. </p>
<p>Now, there are two types of genes which are battling against each other: one to ensure the baby is small enough to be safely birthed, and one to ensure the baby is big and strong. Either the mother or father pass on one of these types, and there are common genetic diseases related to the malfunction of their expression. These would be Prader Willi (father gene turned off) or Angelman (mother gene turned off) syndromes. </p>
<p>Edit: I’ve got a few minutes of free time, so I just wanted to expand on the last part: Prader Willi is characterized by children who have insatiable hunger. They lack their father’s gene (either being turned off or by having two copies of mom’s). This makes sense in the context of “genetic birth wars”; the mother gene wants the baby to be birthed sooner, so the fetus needs to feel hungry sooner. Angelman is not characterized by any hunger/satiety issues, but I’m not sure what this says about the genetic battle between Mom and Dad. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other explanations cover the biggest and most important answer but I'll add one more critical factor: humans are a social animal that have the ability through herd protection, tool use, and intelligence to actually ALLOW us to look after a baby for its first few years. So a part of the answer is &quot;because we can survive it.&quot;</p>
<p>There's different strategies for giving birth to helpless babies with survival rates that are enough to keep the species going. Many mammals, particularly rodents find a hiding spot for their large litters of small babies. Marsupials have an equivalent to a &quot;second womb&quot; that allows the baby to stay safe and nurtured even after birth. Many birds split nest-sitting duties with gathering food until the fledglings are old enough.</p>
<p>But with humans, we establish a social support network that allows a parent or surrogate parent to look after newly born helpless kids instead of devoting 100% of their time doing other stuff that's necessary for survival. And this approach to role specialization was good enough for our ancestors to have enough surviving kids so we could thrive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is that humans are born with underdeveloped brains relative to other animals. What you might also be wondering is, why are humans born with underdeveloped brains? </p>
<p>The answer to this is a little more complicated and, to be clear, there is not one single fully-accepted explanation. Two major competing theories are (1) the obstetric dilemma and (2) the energetics, gestation, growth hypothesis. Here's a snippet from a slide that I present to my class (Intro Psyc) on these two theories:</p>
<p>(1) Obstetric dilemma: Human birth canal very narrow because of bipedalism (i.e., as proto-humans transitioned to walking on two legs, this severely narrowed the birth canal); birth canal is too narrow to accommodate brain (and head) development of infant past approximately 40 weeks gestation (i.e., 9-months into pregnancy). In short, brain underdevelopment mostly about female anatomy (size of birth canal).</p>
<p>(2) Energetics, gestation, growth hypothesis: Fetal development requires increasingly large amounts of energy (from mom) to support; mom’s safe limit (i.e., the amount of energy she can provide baby without putting her [and baby's] health in serious jeopardy) reached at approximately 40 weeks; going into labor at 40 weeks basically saves the life of mom and baby, but at the cost of an underdeveloped brain. Post-birth development supported by energy-rich and efficiently produced breastmilk. In short, brain underdevelopment mostly about fetal energy requirements.</p>
<p>Both theories have evidence for and against them. My hunch is that they're probably both playing a role in babies' underdeveloped brains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human brain is amazingly complicated, more so than that of pretty much any other land critter. In order for that to work, we need big heads. The problem with this is that the human pelvis is too narrow to squeeze out a baby if the baby's head were much bigger than it is, so the brain is less developed at birth for humans than for other primates. Less development in the brain means human babies need longer to learn everything they need to grow up and be successful humans. Language is literally a huge part of our brains, and it takes a long time to sort out, never mind walking on two legs besides that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we walk upright we have a different hip-structure than most other creatures. Our hips are much narrower.</p>
<p>And because we have larger brains We require larger skulls which in turn would require wider hips to come out fully formed.</p>
<p>Instead, we come out partially mature with soft skulls and lacking motor controls. These instead develop over time.</p>
<p>It is a compromise of upright stature and intelligence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
