		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Finally something I can help out with! Source: I'm a lecturer in the UK (roughly equiv. to assistant professor in the USA) specialising in life cycle assessment, particularly energy sources.</p>
<p>I wrote a paper that's open access, which you can find here: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914008745" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306261914008745</a></p>
<p>The TLDR is that solar is good in terms of climate change but generally less good in terms of other impacts. Overall it's typically not as good as wind or nuclear power. However, bear in mind two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Impacts are very dependent on location. E.g. solar installed here in the UK is worse than in Nevada or Spain because the impacts are all up-front but you get much more energy output in sunny countries, therefore better impacts per kWh.</li>
<li>Solar technology is moving fast. I actually have some updated figures that I'd love to share with you but they're not published yet, so they're not peer-reviewed. Reductions in impacts in the past few years have been considerable: about 50% reduction between 2005 and 2015. So for instance I now estimate a carbon footprint of about 45 g CO2-eq./kWh for a UK installation or 27 g in Spain. This contrasts with the figure of 89g you'll see in the paper I linked.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.bnl.gov/pv/files/pdf/230_SolarEnergy_PV_LCA_2011.pdf" target="_blank">This study</a> is outdated, and things have likely improved, but it's nice and comprehensive and was #2 in my google search.  Some take-aways:</p>
<p>Greenhouse gas emissions for solar panel production is about on par with nuclear power production - both of which are about 1/500th the emissions of burning coal.  (Mostly from the fossil fuels burned by the  mining and processing of materials, which could also be eliminated with electric mining vehicles)</p>
<p>Heavy metal polution was a win too, though &quot;less&quot; of one - solar released 1/50th of the cadmium that burning oil does, and less than a third that of coal, due to the requirements that coal power plants capture particulates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
