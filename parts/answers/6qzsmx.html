		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do not have pupils. They have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudopupil" target="_blank">pseudopupils</a>, or what is sometimes called &quot;the pseudopupil effect&quot; or &quot;pseudopupil phenomenon&quot; because it's not an anatomical structure. Rather, it's an optical effect that has to do with the position from which the observer (i.e.
the person taking the photo) is looking at the eye. Some of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ommatidia" target="_blank">ommatidia</a> (the units that make up the compound eye), that are pointing toward the observer appear black because they absorb almost all of the light coming from that direction. Other ommatidia reflect light that is not straight on (and which reaches our eye) and so they appear green or some other color. You can use this phenomenon to figure out which way each ommatidium is pointing (its optic axis). There's a short description of this <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1547926?seq=10#page_scan_tab_contents" target="_blank">here</a> on p. 10 and in <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-66999-6_7" target="_blank">Stavenga (1979)</a>, but unfortunately I can't find a non-pay-walled version of the latter. The wiki link at the top of the post has some other citations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't have thousands of eyes, just two compound eyes (and those three simple eyes between the antennae). Each little hexagonal piece (called an ommatidium) is basically one sensor with its own lens. Just like we have thousands of sensors (rods and cones) on the back of our eyes to make one overall image, insects use data from each ommatidium to make an overall picture. </p>
<p>Movies that show &quot;bug vision&quot; with the full image repeated multiple times is wrong. Each ommatidium just senses the strongest color in its field and becomes one &quot;pixel&quot; in the overall image. So, they actually see a pretty low-resolution image with those eyes. But, they can see your pixelated hand coming to swat them from 360 degrees in vertical and horizontal planes. </p>
<p>So, imagine building a sphere out of red telescopes. The view piece of each one is attached to a green ball to form the sphere. From your point of view, you'd mostly see the sides of each telescope, so it would look red. But that one telescope pointed right at you would let you see the ball, and it would look green. This gives it the &quot;pupil&quot; appearance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Some straws due to the angle you can see right through to the black table but other straws are angled so you only see the white inside of the straw.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
