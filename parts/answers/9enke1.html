		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a whole body of research surrounding obesity and the immune system.</p>
<p>This claim that body size has an effect isn't so far off, as obesity has been shown to cause increases in inflammation throughout the body. Additionally, influenza tends to have a higher infection rate and mortality rate in obese individuals. So, to answer your question, yes, the duration and severity are both impacted.</p>
<p>Fatigue can also lead to worse contraction of a virus, so don't overdo the exercise.</p>
<p>Source: Used to work in metabolism research, know a lab that works on influenza and obesity. There are some scholarly citations here: <a href="https://www.stjude.org/directory/s/stacey-schultz-cherry.html" target="_blank">https://www.stjude.org/directory/s/stacey-schultz-cherry.html</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There has been some research into the relationship between fat-free muscle mass/limb muscle volume and immunity. Much of the interest comes from the evolutionary biology question, &quot;If more muscular men are much more attractive mates (as exhibited by modern surveys of volume of sexual encounters and age at first sexual encounter), why is there still such a large population of males with lower muscle mass?&quot; (please forgive the generalities in that question statement, it's not the main focus of this post so I didn't spend a lot of time on it).</p>
<p>Anyway, a likely answer to that question appears to be that higher ratios of fat-free muscle mass and limb muscle volume are negative predictors for C-reactive protein and white blood cell count (measures of native immunity). In other words, naturally fit or muscular bodies seem to have an inverse relationship to immune system fitness in male human populations.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138\(09\)00039-7/abstract" target="_blank">this abstract</a> for more precise language on the topic. I haven't read that paper thoroughly (couldn't find the research I was actually looking for fast enough) but you should be able to dig deeper into the fundamentals based on the language and references from there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
