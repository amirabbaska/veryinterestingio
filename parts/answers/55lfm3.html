So even some isolated farmer's backyard pond that's not even remotely close to a water channel can end up with a thriving fish population.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know this doesn't exactly answer your question, because it's not addressing ponds that have <em>completely</em> dried up, but I think it's relevant and really neat. </p>
<p>In the Everglades alligators are the reason most species are able to survive the dry season. This is because of what is commonly known as &quot;Gator Pits&quot;. They dig out large pits in existing bodies of water which are deep enough to hold water throughout the dry season. This gives the animals in the area a crucially important (though greatly diminished from the wet season) water source. If it were not for the alligators, the delicate ecosystem that is the Everglades would quickly collapse (or at least suffer a dramatic change wherein many species go extinct). Alligators are the Kings and Stewards of the Everglades.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the aquatic creature. </p>
<p>Some animals, like certain species of fish and amphibians go into a hibernation or suspended animation state in a little &quot;cocoon&quot; they make out of mucus and mud and bury themselves in the mud. When the pond gets filled again, the cocoon dissolves and they emerge again.</p>
<p>Many insects lay eggs and die, when the pond fills again the eggs hatch and the cycle begins again. </p>
<p>Others migrate to other water sources, and maybe move around when the rivers are full and/or flood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
