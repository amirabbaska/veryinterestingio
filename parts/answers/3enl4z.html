		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>When you are tasting table salt (NaCl), you are not tasting the compound NaCl, but rather the constituent ions Na^(+) and Cl^(-). In fact, it's more accurate to represent the ions as (Na^(+))aq and (Cl^(-))aq where the aq stands for aqueous and indicates that the ions are solvated by water, since the salt will be dissolved in the water of your saliva before you will be able to taste it. Studies have found that it is mostly the sodium cation Na^(+) that is responsible for the salty taste. However the anion still plays in role in how salty something will taste. For example, switching from table salt (NaCl) to baking soda (NaHCO3) will result in a less salty taste (and will also produce additional new tastes). Moreover, in animals such as humans (but not in rodents), other cations, such as those of lithium (Li^(+)), potassium (K^(+)) or even ammonium (NH4^(+)) will also evoke a &quot;salty&quot; taste, albeit one that is not quite as strong as that generated by Na^(+).<br><br>If you would like to read about the topic in more depth, here is a pretty good and accessible <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK50958/" target="_blank">review paper on the subject</a>.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>well, in addition to what /u/crnaruka said, there's the pretty simple answer that salt dissolves in your saliva, turning that into salt water or a sort. So really you're always tasting salt water, not the crystals themselves.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Salt water doesn't taste like salt, because you can't taste salt.  It tastes like sodium.  Here's a nice little way to confirm that:  Take some baking soda (sodium bicarbonate) and dissolve it in water, and then taste it.  Guess what?  It's salty!  Even though it's not salt.  Guess why?  It's the dissolved sodium ions!</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I think what you're trying to ask is why does salt in granular solid form taste the same as it does when it is in solution. I think it's probably because NaCl is soluble in water, so when you put it in your mouth, your saliva acts as the solution, in the same way that sea water acts as solution. So either way, you're tasting the same separated ions. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Try low sodium salt! It's largely KCL (or Na+ CL-). It actually tastes saltier than salt. The cation is what gives something its &quot;salty&quot; virtue from what I understand, while the chlorine anion is less active to taste. NaCl and KCl are both used as table salt.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
