		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asteroid  2004 FU162 is 4 to 6 meters across, about the size of voyager 1, and passed within 4000 miles of earth and we didn't notice it until a few hours before its closest approach. For reference that's well underneath GPS and geostationary orbit (13000 miles) and right in the top layers of the inner van alen belt. Still way above other satellites like Hubble (350 miles) It's not inconceivable that something that small could crash into the ocean without anyone noticing.  That is of course unless it was sending out rf signals of some kind trying to be found.         </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the part about retrieving it, difficulty in space is not a matter of distance: it's a matter of <em>speed</em>. Normally these two are related, as reaching farther requires achieving higher speeds, but this is not always the case.</p>
<p>It's all because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation" target="_blank">Tsiolkovsky's rocket equation</a>: propellant requirements grow exponentially with respect to the speed you're trying to achieve. For normal missions to Low Earth Orbit (LEO) this is already too bad: consider, for instance, that the Space Shuttle used to have a gross mass of 2000 tons at take off (off the top of my head, each booster had 600 tons of fuel and the main tank had nearly 700 tons of liquid hydrogen and oxygen), but only 80 tons made it to orbit at a speed of 7.6 km/s. All that enormous amount of fuel means money.</p>
<p>Voyager I is getting away from the Solar System at nearly 17 km/s. It's a very high speed for an object that far away from the Sun. If a similar object were approaching instead, it would be accelerated by the Sun's gravity and get close to Earth at much higher speeds. Haven't done the math but a certain lower bound for this is 42 km/s (the Sun's escape speed at a distance of 1AU). Earth is moving at 30 km/s, intuitively you may think we have to match the difference of 12 km/s but this is not necessarily the case: if it's moving perpendicularly to our orbit at the time of crossing it then the vector difference will be much larger. You have to match its velocity precisely to get a smooth approach.</p>
<p>Rendez-Vous in space is hard if you don't have control of the other object. Would it even be still working after several thousand years in a journey through space? If the attitude control system is broken (most likely it will be), then it will be just tumbling freely, making it difficult to grab. It could even destroy the ship that tries to retrieve it. And assuming it was built by an alien civilization, we wouldn't have any idea of its interfaces or physical measures to attach to. Forget about a smooth docking like they do with the ISS. Probably have to think about a net to trap it, which could damage its sensitive parts (antennas, cameras, etc) if it's spinning.</p>
<p>And then you have to accelerate it in the opposite direction to bring it back. Twice the delta-v doesn't mean twice the fuel, but much more. Blame Tsiolkovsky again for that. Be ready to put down a lot of money for this, which will most likely require several launches and assembly in orbit (like they did with the ISS).</p>
<p>Then we'd have to think how to make it survive atmospheric entry, strong acceleration and the shock of landing. If it wasn't designed for this and we don't have precise documentation about the details of the design, I'd say forget it. The Space Shuttle could retrieve objects in orbit and bring them back, as it did with the station's MPLM modules, but only because they were designed specifically for the attachments and physical measures of the Shuttle's cargo bay. You cannot do that with an alien object. You cannot even do it with a man-made object that was designed for a different launcher!</p>
<p>Aaaand engineers would have to design the mission with a very tight time constraint, as an object &quot;passing through&quot; the Solar System is certainly above escape speed and won't come back. Any delays in the design and manufacturing translate directly into a mission failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well Voyager 1 is over 130 astronomical units away. 1 AU is 93 million miles so thats quite far. We can still communicate with it. However if another probe from outer space wandered through our solar system, we would be very unlikely to pick it up.
We know EXACTLY where the voyager probes are, what frequency signal is etc. To try and search for them with out knowing any of these parameters would be the devils own job. I'm sure someone will come along to give a proper sciency explanation but thats the gist of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As noted above the distance isn't really the hang-up. Fantasizing about the probe, we can say that it can communicate via our highest available technology - lets say its full-light spectrum signals. So, both the probe and us are able to send and receive data via the entire light wave length broadband. This would be the fastest form of communication.</p>
<p>The problem is, the probe would have to travel at such a velocity and vector as to: not be obscured by local bodies or phenomena; move, emote, or otherwise behave in such a way to distinguish itself from local bodies and phenomena; direct its signal towards a populated section of earth with detection facilities (a telescope or satallite range, or even an orbiting station lets say); said installation must be looking in the quadrant of space at the same time; this all occurs whilst humans spend very little (comparative) money on extraterrestrial life detection.</p>
<p>In theory, we could visually or electronically (radio etc) detect a probe leaving its original system/cluster. Thats to say current technology can do this. However, having the fortune of our planet and station, and the intervening other space bodies, cooperate to align our fields of vision is probabilistic low.</p>
<p>Think of this, you and a friend are playing hide and go seek in a football stadium. To win you have to align a laser pointer directly into the other person's eye. You two are not alone in the stadium, as a seemingly random number of strangers and objects litter different sectors of the stadium. Now, each object, person (including the two players), and chair (etc.) has its own spin-velocity and trajectory. Oh, and the stadium lights flicker in somewhat of a pattern onto each section - with various colors and bulb types. </p>
<p>You could think of yourself squarely in the middle of eveything, desperately shining your laser pointer into the stands. Thats a rough idea of what detecting a probe would be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question doesn't appear to be about when we could detect the probe, but when could we start doing science on it. This mainly depends on how much time we have. </p>
<p>We could feasibly send a probe of our own to interact with it almost anywhere in the solar system, as long as we had a decade to plan and design the mission (assuming politics didn't get in the way of science). Plus a decade of travel time (it took Rosetta ten years to reach its destination and it's not even coming back). Depending on its size we could also feasibly bring it back to Earth orbit for further study.</p>
<p>If we wanted to grab it within a year or two it would need to already be in Earth orbit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
