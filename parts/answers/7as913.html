		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your question kind of makes the assumption that each function or action performed by the body automatically has a corresponding anatomy of the brain associated with it. You might be interested to know that newborns are estimated to half 2x to 10x the number of neurons as a full grown adults. But the difference between an infant and an adult isn't the number of neurons, but the connections between those neurons. These synapses become refined and reinforced by repetitively activating neural pathways in a process called Long Term Potentiation. The excess brain cells not developed into structured pathways undergo programmed cell death in a process called apoptosis. Think of a newborn brain like a block of marble which takes 25 years to become chipped into the sculpture of an adult brain. </p>
<p>To answer your question, the extra fingers in a polydactyl child will recruit motor neurons from the frontal lobe only if that finger is used regularly. If the finger is removed at birth, there is no reason for the brain to develop a motor pathway dictating dexterity of the 6th digit as it was never used. An individual who has lost a finger in their life will no longer use the regions of the brain associated with that parts, so thanks to neuroplasticity, that region will eventually be adapted for use by other, still existing, parts of the body, likely immediately adjacent to whatever is controlled by surrounded brain cells. Phantom limb pain occurs when those pathways are so ingrained into the brain (like with innervating an entire limb) that neuroplasticity doesn't erase those original pathways. What's left is a region of the brain still trained to move and feel something no longer there. </p>
<p>Hope that helps! Sorry I don't have sources other than being a medical student. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In cases of polydactylism, such as having an extra finger, I believe an appendage splits during very early development. One finger might split and develop into two but they are essentially treated as one finger by the nervous system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
