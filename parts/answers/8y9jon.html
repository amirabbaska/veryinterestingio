<p>The reason a child would be in a coma would be a brain injury, either traumatic (car accident, Shaken Baby Syndrome) or atraumatic (anoxic brain injury from drowning or a stroke; for example). If the injuries are severe enough to cause coma lasting longer than a week or so, the child is likely to suffer long term consequences. These include things like developmental delay, muscle strength and coordination abnormalities, difficulty with speech and swallowing, and endocrine abnormalities that can result in things like abnormal puberty and stunted growth. </p>
<p>Comas are indicative of severe injuries, with longer durations indicative of a worse functional outcome.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I imagine something like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genie_(feral_child)" target="_blank">this inability to learn correctly</a> could happen depending on how early the onset and how long the coma lasted. We learn most of our instincts very early in life, and after that our brain changes and it becomes more analytical based on experience rather than just a creative sponge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
