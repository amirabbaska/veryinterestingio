		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because water has momentum. The flow around a bend digs into the far side of the curve while it slows down and deposits sediments on the inside of the curve. </p>
<p>The result is that curves are exaggerated over time, and can even form circular oxbow lakes. The sediment deposits close off the circle and the river continues around it. </p>
<p>Over geological time, the actual path of a river can change a LOT, wiggling across the land, carving new paths. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does not erode all things equally fast. You have different kinds of minerals in the ground, some are harder than others. The minerals that are eroded don't erode uniformly. Think of it this way: every stone has weak spots, little cracks for example, or enclosures of different minerals that are softer and easier to erode. Water is lazy and always goes the easiest way downwards. Then, things will fall into the water or are washed out by erosion such as stones, plant material, dirt etc. This can form natural dams and obstacles. If you build a dam out of stones in a river bed, it will break trough where your dam is weakest, or overflow where it is not as high. If you build a good dam, the river will start flooding the grassland next to the river bed, creating a new river bed in the process.</p>
<p>Also, the landscape changes. There might be a forest in one century and then there isn't in the next. this all has an impact on the rivers in the area. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of it depends on the speed that the water is traveling.  Slow moving ox-box rivers are great examples of how the flow of water changes the landscape (especially when you fly over them and see them from a distance).  The water erodes the far bank of the end until it meets the other side, forming an island, until the cut off water dries up, then the process repeats itself all down the lazy river.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
