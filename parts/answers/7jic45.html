		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a pop science book that has a good overview of some of the theories related to it called The Red Queen by Matt Ridley.</p>
<p>One of the more popular theories is that sex evolved to fight off disease. The longer lived the species, the more likely they are to have sex, because viruses and bacteria have very short lifespans. If we didn't have sex, we would reproduce much faster. We wouldn't have to find a mate, and our genes would almost always be expressed. </p>
<p>However, a virus would be able to figure out vulnerabilities, by mutating over time. Your child would have the very same vulnerability. </p>
<p>It's been suggested that humans can subconsciously tell who has different immunities than themselves through smell and taste. People &quot;prefer&quot; smelling the sweat of people more genetically different than themselves. </p>
<p>Basically, over 80 years, a disease catches up to your immune system which is made up of x number of locks. The disease had multiple attempts to your one set and has now found the keys. If your child were born asexually, he would have the same locks. But you had sex with someone with a very different set of locks and you randomly swapped them around. Now that disease is at square one. </p>
<p>Bananas are an example of the issues of asexuality, since they are grown asexually. People used to eat a different banana species, but it was wiped out by Panama disease and we switched to a different type that was thought to be resistant. But there's another strain of that disease originating in Malaysia that kills off bananas even quicker. Scientists are trying to create resistant species before the disease can spread to the western hemisphere.</p>
<p>As to whether there are species with more than two sexes, yes. But they tend to be extremophiles. I believe some slime molds do. I remember reading about it in the book I mentioned. He spoke about why it's an exception, and that basically unless there are extenuating reasons to have multiple sexes, the vast majority of species will go to a 2 sex default. I remember this portion the least. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process of a cell splitting into two whole cells is called mitosis.  However, the process of a cell splitting two half cells, for germ-line cells like sperm or eggs, is called meiosis, and males and females obviously use different variations on that process.</p>
<p>Now, way back in the day when sex was new, there almost certainly was just the one type of germ cell.  It was mobile like a sperm, but carried a nutrient payload like an egg.  But as with all things biological, they were not uniform.  Some were smaller, some were slower, etc.  This created a situation where selection pressures went <em>against</em> the jack of all trades model, favoring specialization.  The smaller, faster, more mobile germ cells were more likely to find a counterpart to merge with, and the larger, slower, fatter germ cells provided the resulting offspring a bonus in the form of more starting nutrients.  Compromising between these simply provided a germ cell with the worst of both worlds.</p>
<p>So the trend continued until the mobile cells were little more than a genetic payload, while their counterparts gave up motility, since it was useless to them, and focused entirely on providing food for the future offspring.  That gives us the two different germ cell types.</p>
<p>Note that this doesn't necessarily translate to two different sexes.  Many plants and animals are hermaphrodites; &quot;my male part fertilizes your female part and/or vice versa&quot;.  So there's zero sexual dimorphism, or even different genders, just the two different types of germ cells and everyone produces both.  At the other extreme are elephant seals (males keep harems and outmass the females by ~3:1) or angler fish (males are tiny in comparison and latch onto the females, then wither away, becoming nothing more than sperm on tap).  The degree to which the sexes differ will be at the mercy of whatever weird selection pressures or behaviors the species has lived under.  It <em>tends</em> to mean that females spend more time worrying about offspring, since they usually put in more metabolic effort, but that's by no means universal.</p>
<p>I'm not aware offhand of any species whose reproduction involves, at the genetic level anyway, more than 2 individuals.  I wouldn't discount it.  There's plenty of organisms whose chromosome arrangement is wildly unlike our own and might be amenable to becoming based on triples rather than pairs.</p>
<p>What I would like to know is:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did the transition from asexual cloning to sexual gene-swapping involve?  What sort of critters did it take place in?</li>
<li>Was the invention of sex a singular event, or did it occur several times?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it has to do with the greatly increased genetic diversity possible with sexual reproduction. You have a source of variation outside of mutation - different combinations of mom &amp; dad dna. Imagine if humans were asexual and only changed via mutation. How long would the Neanderthal to modern Homo sapiens take?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even in single-celled organisms like bacteria, there are many instances of horizontal gene transfer by transformation or conjugation. During conjugation, (i.e. where bacteria transfer genetic material by physical contact through a tube-like structure called pilus) the donor bacteria has an extra gene called F-factor (Fertility factor) which helps them to form the pilus.</p>
<p>As for selection pressure, the recipient bacterium often receives genetic material which gives them an advantage, like antibiotic resistance genes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
