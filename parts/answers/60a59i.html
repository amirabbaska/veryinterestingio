		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually one of the least common tics, its a condition called corprolalia. It's famous because its the one people think is funny.</p>
<p>It's all pretty mysterious, even to doctors, but one theory is that it has something to do with the way our brain stores &quot;taboos&quot; in a separate part of the brain. An example of this is when you see Alzheimer's patients devolve into using foul language. They've lost access to their normal vocabulary, but this separate storage unit is untouched by the disease for now. So, if you think of TS as random muscle twitches, corprolalia is a twitch of the &quot;say bad words&quot; muscle. </p>
<p>The most common response when I have to explain my TS is &quot;I wish I had that, so I could curse whenever I wanted.&quot; I don't have corprolalia, but I still say &quot;Fuck You.&quot; That's like saying you wish you were in a wheelchair, so you could park in the handicap space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to have moderate/severe Tourette's, with swearing as one of my tics. There are two subsets of tics: vocal tics and motor tics. Both of them are caused by uncontrollable muscle movements, either in the vocal chords or other parts of the body. To diagnose Tourette's, <a href="https://www.tourette.org/about-tourette/overview/what-is-tourette/" target="_blank">at least two motor and one vocal tic must be witnessed over the course of a year (top of second paragraph)</a>. This means that you can have swearing tics (known as Corprolalia) without Tourette's.</p>
<p>Vocal tics have another subset, known as phonal tics. Vocal tics are grunts, sniffles, or other non-word related noises, whereas phonal tics are either words or more complex phrases. Coprolalia falls into the phonal category, as well as random or out-of-context words.</p>
<p>According to tourette.org, <a href="https://www.tourette.org/resource/understanding-coprolalia" target="_blank">fewer than one third of all people with TS exhibit this symptom at some time during their lives. (bottom of first paragraph)</a>. There have not been many studies on Coprolalia, and our understanding of it is limited. All we know is that it is neurological in nature (it's encoded into the nervous system, not something that can be controlled).</p>
<p>Tourette's in general is a difficult subject for researchers to understand. Because of the complexities of the brain and nervous system, it's hard to determine what causes Coprolalia to happen in some patients, but not in others. We do know Tourette's is hereditary, but unfortunately, we do not know what causes it to happen.</p>
<p>Hope this response helps!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tourette's isn't what you saw on Deuce Bigalow or &quot;Tourette's Guy&quot;. It isn't mental retardation, either, nor is it a disease, or related to autism, though research shows it may be related to epilepsy. I have Tourette's, and I've dealt with it since it showed up around age 4. I am 27 now. </p>
<p>Tourette's is a neurobiological disorder characterized by physical (motor) and/or vocal (which doesn't mean words, just sounds) tics. Phonal vocal tics are words, and while there is a very small subset of us who have phonal tics, and a fraction of that fraction have phonal vocal tics that are swear words, that's very uncommon, and is luck of the draw. </p>
<p>I'm sorry for being so blunt, it's just frustrating what that fucking stupid Rob Schneider movie did for those of us who actually live with the disorder</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't almost always profanity. Actually it almost always isn't. You just remember people yelling swear words for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>The most common manifestation of Tourettes would probably be jumping in place or obsessive blinking</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
