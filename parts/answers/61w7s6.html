		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgery. In most cases bleeding can be managed with administration of fluids, blood transfusions and correction of any underlying coagulopathy. However, some organs can bleed profusely if injured. If the spleen and its capsule are ruptured we do a splenectomy. If a lobe of the liver is lacerated we do a hepatic lobectomy. If a major vessel (aorta or vena cava) is bleeding we do an exploratory laparotomy and ligate/suture the bleed. If a non-vital organ like the urterus is bleeding they can also do embolization. This is where they go in with a catheter and artificially induce a clot upstream from the bleed. It leads to necrosis of the tissue and isn't ideal, but it can save the patient from bleeding to death. Surgery and other invasive procedures are not without risk, and at the end of the day it's a risk/benefit calculation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They close the hole surgically. I am a paramedic and we often will stay on scene for extended periods of time to treat serious problems if we can treat them. However, penetrating traumas or other causes of internal bleeding are what we call &quot; Load and Go&quot; situations. This is because we can do little for the patient besides try to keep them alive long enough to receive the surgical intervention they need. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From being in the OR I can tell you that a Exploratory Laparotomy is what they start off with and then will go in and suture what they can to control bleeding. They also use staples that are non toxic and are designed to have tissue grow over them. Sometimes if bowl is affected by the penetrating injury then they follow all 20+ feet of it, called running the bowel, cut what is torn (messed up jagged edges;hard to line up for healing) so they cut the part that is affected then bring them side by side like so (II) then they staple them together so it looks like PI then the cut a hole at the bottom section to rest a new opening and then they suture it. Sometimes if the bleeding can not be controlled but the patient is stable then they irrigate the abdomen and will pack it with gauze at the bleeding site waiting for a clot to form. Then a big plastic film is placed on the opening (kind of like Saran Wrap but it's sterile) and the patient is taken to the ICU. There he will stay until its stable enough to bring the patient back in to the OR to go back in and hope the clot formed and they can close him (by close I mean bring his chest/abdomen cavity together). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
