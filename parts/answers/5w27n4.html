		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I love this part:  Unqualified claim to be a medical doctor here.
Further unsubstantiated claim to treat these specific patients routinely.  Yet more outrageous claim to have specialized knowledge in this particular aspect of the problem and thus I am the sole perfect person to answer your question. Like you're 5 years old, I don't know.  Here is my $0.02...</p>
<p>There are the direct effects and the indirect effects of the drugs. The direct effects are the ones that cause damage to systems,  organs, tissues and cells.  The indirect effects are those that affect the whole human due to the behavior people engage in when they are high or trying to get high. </p>
<p>Direct effects of meth depend on how you use the drug. Snorting will lead to a bunch of problems with drying out your nose and throat, the muscles involved will get contracted and long term it causes erosion of the tissues. This leads to lesions of all sorts forming. Swallowing meth is probably the least damaging, but still over time will cause havoc in the mouth and throat. Smoking will cause lung damage and the traditional &quot;meth mouth&quot; by altering bacteria in the mouth and causing a drying effect which ruins enamel and causes teeth to decay faster.  The worst is shooting it directly into the bloodstream with a needle in a vein. This allows bacteria and other infectious things into the blood directly and causes abscesses and infection. The infections can range from simple to complex and routinely kills patients. Kidneys and livers fail all the time due to dehydration, toxic levels of crap for the liver to filter out and hepatitis is rampant.  Meth causes people to clench their muscles a lot and that causes little bits of muscle to die and the debris goes into the blood and can cause kidneys to fail trying to filter it out. Shooting is also the most potent way to get high and is a bad sign. Shooters have a hard time staying sober. </p>
<p>The effect of the drug in your bloodstream is that it reaches a lot of the cells in your body to some degree and each type of cell has it own reaction depending on if it can make use of the meth molecule. There are between 10 and 17 known and theorized receptors for the meth molecule and the density of the receptors on different cell types is an ongoing investigation. For the 5 year old it will suffice to say it causes a lot of trouble that becomes damage in the way the cells function over time. The damage accumulates and expands. Blood vessels constrict, causing decreased flow to and from tissues. Brain cells obviously let meth in, and in different areas of the brain, and at different rates with different effects. A common phenomenon is called de-arborization where the little connections between neurons in key areas of the brain get clipped due to the toxic effects of meth. Sort of like trimming the branches of a tree.  This leads to all sorts of damage but is mostly seen as early dementia.   Also there is neuron death which affects the ability to regulate mood. Meth has a large effect on dopamine in the brain (and everywhere else too) which causes people to hear voices, feel pleasure, get paranoid, want more.  Meth does affect connective tissue and causes fibroblasts (a cell that builds collagen and the matrix that it lives in in skin) to be more inefficient. Repair occurs slowly and healing takes longer.  This will make it look like the patient is aging faster. </p>
<p>The indirect effects are all the bad things people do to get high. The latest story I heard from a meth using patient was that he was in  a month long detox program (his 14th program over 10 years) and he and 2  people he met in the program decided to leave the program early. The patient called a friend he knew in high school and convinced the naive guy that he had graduated from the program and needed a ride. The friend picks up the 3 addicts and they go to his house with him and steal his car, his portable electronics and drive to a casino in the desert to get meth after selling the stuff at pawn shop or on the street. They stripped the car of stereo and battery, took a shit in the backseat and broke the key off in the ignition.  </p>
<p>Meth is very cheap and you can get really high for about $10-30 a day, but over time people wind up selling their bodies to get money. They &quot;hustle&quot; and hustle means a lot of things and they are all bad.  The effect of having sex with strangers for meth money is a lot of exposure to STDs and violence. The &quot;holed up in a motel being raped for 3 days&quot; stories I have heard are in the high 30s. Both men and women prostitute themselves to either gender for meth or money. </p>
<p>They don't bathe, they stay high for months, they don't eat, they live in squalor or on the streets. It is a very rough living and it erodes their humanity. What they do eat is sporadic and usually just caffeine, fat and sugar. They don't drink enough water ever.  All that hard living, bad diet, damage to body and soul shows up on their skin. They get skinny, their muscles waste away, they pick at their skin and get scabs, sometimes they get horrific acne.  It all ages them rapidly. </p>
<p>Opiates are another story, but kind of the same. I am feeling a little slimy talking about these things because there is a cost to hearing all these stories and it is that you carry the stories and horrors around in your head forever.   Suffice it to say there are similar effects from using heroin. Just different specifics. If you really want to know just ask. </p>
<p>I'm going to go shower now and go to bed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Mommy told you not to stay up late watching TV, but you do anyway. TV is great, why stop for bedtime? You watch one show, then another...and another and another. You're thirsty, but you don't want to miss the best part that's coming up. You're sleepy, but you want to see what's on next. Your eyes are dry as a bone from staring at the screen. You finally fall asleep in the early morning and awake a few short hours later to your mom telling you you're late for school. Your eyes are red with bags under them, your mouth is dry, and your tum-tum is growling because you have to skip breakfast in order to get to school. Everyone at school says you look like shit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of super sciencey answers here but let me give you a response from an experienced polysubstance addict. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You don't eat. Why waste money on food when I can just buy more dope and the food tastes shitty anyways. Also any calories you do consume are used to repair the massive damage you're doing to your nervous system. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You don't sleep. Fuck sleep. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You neither drink water nor brush your teeth. Dehydration is a biatch. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Intravenous drug use puts a lot of nasty byproducts directly in your blood. Lots of strain on kidneys. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will invariably do stupid shit to obtain bruises, cuts, and rashes bc you're fucked up a lot. </p>
</li>
<li>You don't eat, sleep, or take care of yourself, and you're injecting god-knows-what straight into ya blood! </li>
</ol>
<p>As a note, this applies to people in heavy active addiction, the ones you see and say &quot;Damn they are on drugs&quot;  </p>
<p>Trust me, there are shitloads of people around you every day that smoke meth in the morning and do a shot of heroin at night but you will never know because they have made decisions to take care of their bodies so they don't become that stigma. </p>
<p>Source: still maintaining a 9-5 while smoking meth and shooting heroin daily after 4 years, never once been piss tested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a prescription medicine called desoxyn, <em>in which the active ingredient is methamphetamine</em>, <a href="https://www.drugs.com/comments/methamphetamine/desoxyn.html" target="_blank">here are some reviews from several patients on the drug</a> (it is usually reserved for patients who other medications do not work for them). Most prescription users of the drug, experience little to no consequences, on the other hand they actually experience very positive effects towards their conditions.</p>
<p>Here is another example of it's medicinal use: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278584615000469" target="_blank">The neuroprotective potential of low-dose methamphetamine in preclinical models of stroke and traumatic brain injury</a></p>
<p>The risks associated with methamphetamine abuse come more from the <strong>dosage</strong> used (several hundred milligrams are consumed in recreational users vs. 5-30mg in prescribed dosages), the <strong>route of administration</strong> (abusers smoke the drug, prescription users take it orally), staying up for several days on the drug causes <strong>sleep deprivation</strong> that comes with it's own set of effects, and individuals with methamphetamine use problems <strong>disregard personal health and hygiene</strong> (i.e. stop brushing teeth, showering,etc).</p>
<p><strong>Those factors alone without the methamphetamine would still induce many of the issues associated with methamphetamine abuse.</strong> The fact that the drug is prescribed and a safe, useful medicine for some; supports the fact that <em>we need legitimate drug education globally to prevent the abuse of these drugs and promote safe usage to avoid serious consequences in drug users.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Meth abuse causes the destruction of tissues and blood vessels, inhibiting the body's ability to repair itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Acne appears, sores take longer to heal, and the skin loses its luster and elasticity, making the user appear years, even decades older.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Poor diet, tooth grinding and oral hygiene results in tooth decay and loss.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Meth mouth&quot; is characterized by broken, discolored and rotting teeth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The drug causes the salivary glands to dry out, which allows the mouth's acids to eat away at the tooth enamel, causing cavities.</p>
</li>
<li>Teeth are further damaged when users obsessively grind their teeth, binge on sugary food and drinks, and neglect to brush or floss for long periods of time.</li>
