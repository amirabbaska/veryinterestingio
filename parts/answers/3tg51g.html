		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the points about us all having more stuff are completely off base.  </p>
<p>I am 30.  I have $250K in student loans (Patent Attorney w/ Masters in Biotech).  I make $50k/year.  That's right, the least paid chump in my field.  My wife is about to have a baby (three weeks) and is a self employed florist.  Hence, she does not work.  We live in the cheapest apartment we can afford.  It includes free internet.  We have no cable.  We could only afford to buy one car.  While its more expensive in the long run, I currently lease a vehicle as we could not afford the payments of a financed vehicle.  We eat rice and beans nearly every meal...literally.  We do NOT have a lot of possession, because we do NOT have any square feet in our apartment to put them.</p>
<p>This is NOT a &quot;middle class have done it to themselves by buying too much stuff&quot; problem.  This is a problem created solely by the greed of employers and their shareholders, which is enabled by our oligarchical regime. </p>
<p>For Todd's sake, we are one of only 4 countries that does not guarantee any form of paid maternal or paternal leave.  WTF?</p>
<p>I would gladly trade places in time with anyone before the 1980's.  I would forsake my smartphones and shit in the woods for the rest of my life if I could escape these student loans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well you also have to realize that Union jobs have decreased immensely, on top of &quot;Globalization&quot; (How to fuck workers over by going to 2nd and 3rd world countries for cheap labor) of many jobs. There are fewer jobs per capita than there was in the 70s. And then you have to look at things like H1B1 visas and the sort.</p>
<p>Also, corporate and commercial culture changed as well where paying workers good wages became a liability and not a respected duty (See &quot;Ford's Five Dollars A Day Wage&quot;). </p>
<p>The real issue, and the easiest one to resolve, is to have workers get involved in creating jobs again and not merely relying on the rich to create jobs. Because the rich like to fuck people for the most gain when it comes to employing people. I know this because I work with rich people as their legal war dog (used to say Pitbull but I like Pitbulls too much to keep saying that). Many of the rich people I know bitch about not being able to get good employees for shit wages but they'll keep hiring scum for shitty wages because it fits their bottom line. </p>
<p>If you want things to start getting better for working class people than working class people have to organize and start creating businesses that suit their purposes as consumer and laborers. I have ideas but most people are too lazy, stupid, and small to pull it off. </p>
<p>Basically, the working classes like getting fucked and say &quot;thank you&quot; when the rich go in dry and rough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other arguments about inflation and wages not keeping up, think about how much more <em>stuff</em> the average household spends its money on. </p>
<p>Compare what we consider a middle class standard of living with 50 years ago. Cell phones are more expensive than landlines, we have personal computers and Internet bills, generally speaking more than one television, and so on. The cost to power all of the devices in our homes is higher, and it's less common for a family to get by with one car. </p>
<p>A lot of these things are only marginally more expensive, but it adds up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Women didn't join the workforce because they wanted to work minimum wage jobs at the mall. They joined because in the 1970s and 80s, wages were already unable to afford the standard of living of the 50s and 60s, and to maintain that standard of living, people had to take out credit cards, send housewives to work, or both </p>
<p>Seriously, people believe women would rather work at crappy Walmart for crap wages than stay home raising their beautiful children? Maybe lawyers and doctors want to work and love their careers, but that chick behind the counter at the gas station? She's only there because her husband doesn't earn enough to support them both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a hunch it is due to two or three main factors.</p>
<p>(1) Income distribution is a lot more uneven than in the 60's, 70's and 80's. Essentially fewer and fewer people take a larger and larger share of the wealth, to a degree it is threatening the existence of the US middle class as a financially secure demographic.</p>
<p>(2) A larger and larger part of the workforce and working time is &quot;non-productive&quot;, i.e. produces a work output that is not useful to anyone else. Thus, the amount of goods and services produced is less, contributing to inflation, outscoring and simply less goods and services to go around. The most blatant (but far from only) example of this is the US health insurance industry. For each dollar spent towards health care through the insurance system, only a fraction goes to the useful output of actual nurses, doctors and supplies. The rest goes to feeding the paper mill of people pushing claims around and distributing costs and profits (most of which do not end up in the middle class but with stock owners -see point 1 above.)</p>
<p>(3) [Other macroeconomic causes like the massive foreign debt the US has accrued through wars etc]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
