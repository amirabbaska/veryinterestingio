		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the humidity of the indoor room. If the indoor room is small and not ventilated, the moisture from the drying clothes will quickly raise the humidity of the room to the point that is significantly slows down the drying of the clothes. If you place a large dehumidifier in the small, ventilated room, or if you give it good ventilation (open some windows) it will keep humidity low and keep the drying time short. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how much you have of each.  &quot;Drying&quot; is just the water evaporating into the air, and the air can only take so much.  The sun only helps this to happen by raising the temperature, and the breeze only helps by moving the air that's already absorbed the water, and replacing it with presumably less saturated air.  </p>
<p>If you were in a sealed environment with 100% humidity, no amount of sunlight would dry your clothes, and likewise, no amount of breeze at 100% humidity blowing by would help your clothes dry.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitely a breeze,  hands-down. Without it the air close to the surface of the fabric will quickly saturate. Moving the air will keep the delta humidity between fabric and air high, creating a more efficient exchange. The sun on the other hand will add more energy to the system, increasing efficiency slightly. Consider how much heat energy you need to boil water.. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moisture on the clothes keeps continually evaporating at room temperature,  but it needs to be transfered to another medium like the surrounding air, or else it won't leave the cloth.</p>
<p>The transfer rate is affected by a factor that takes into consideration the cloth temperature (higher temperature means quicker evaporation) and the dryness of surrounding air. Thing is, the evaporation rate doesn't show a linear variation according to temperature, meaning doubling the room temperature won't double the transfer rate. Not even close. </p>
<p>No matter if you're in the desert or a tropical environment, it's true that the air in contact with the cloth is more humid than than the air that's a few meters away. </p>
<p>If you would model the moisture transfer speed, it should be something like</p>
<p><strong>Humidity transfer</strong> = <em>F(Cloth Temperature)</em> <em> </em>(Cloth Humidity - Air Humidity)<em> </em> (Air Flux) * K</p>
<p>Where:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>transfer is measured in [water mass / (surface unit * time unit)]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>K is some dark constant like Stefan Boltzman's but for humidity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Air flux is [volume/time]</p>
</li>
<li>F(cloth temp) resembles specific heat</li>
</ul>
<p>You see that transfer increases with temperature, difference of humidity between cloth and air, and air flux.</p>
<p>If you leave the piece of cloth in direct sunlight, without any breeze reaching it, the air surrounding the cloth will get so humid it can't take any more humidity. Some convection will happen that will make the air move without a breeze, but it will be slow and inneficient. Even at maximum F(cloth temp), the difference of humidity will be close to zero, and the air flux will be small too.</p>
<p>If you leave the piece of cloth in the shade, but receiving a lot of breeze, then you would be applying a high air flux, and the air surrounding the cloth would be continually refreshed, so it will never happen that the air's humidity level approaches the cloth moisture level. Even when the cloth is cooler than it would be under direct sunlight, the evaporation rate would still be in a similar order of magnitude.</p>
<p><strong>TD/LR: a lot of air, the dryer the better.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This sounds like just a thought experiment, but if it's real world:  The UV in direct sunlight is going to bleach anything that isn't white.  Shade/Breeze if you want your clothes to retain their color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
