		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear transmutation specialist here:</p>
<p>We <em>do</em> simply add protons, electrons, and neutrons together to make whatever elements we want.</p>
<p>The reason why most people aren't familiar with this is because it's <em>really expensive</em>, so this is typically only done in laboratories for scientific research.</p>
<p>Another reason why you typically don't want to use this for your everyday materials is that the resulting material is almost always radioactive.  And not just &quot;a little radioactive like bananas or human bodies&quot; but &quot;really radioactive like nuclear waste&quot;.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to make some gold (Au).  Well, you could start with some platinum (Pt), natural platinum is a mix of Pt-192,194,195,196,198.  When you bombard that with neutrons, you'll produce radioactive Pt-193 (halflife 50y decays to stable Ir-193), stable isotopes Pt-195, Pt-196, radioactive Pt-197 (halflife 20h, decays to stable Au-197), and radioactive Pt-199 (halflife 30m, decays to radioactive Au-199, which further decays with a halflife of 3d to stable Hg-199).  So if you do this, your sample is going to be radioactive for several centuries before you can get any non-radioactive gold out of it.  Also, you had to start with platinum, which is already just about as expensive.</p>
<p>But actually, there are some industrial applications for nuclear transmutation.  The most common is likely putting neutrons into U-238 to create U-239 which then beta decays into Np-239 which in turn beta decays to useful Pu-239.  This is done in the nuclear fuel cycle to create fissile Pu-239 out of non-fissile U-238.  About 50 years ago, nuclear scientists thought this process was going to be the future of nuclear energy and to produce a post-scarcity society.  But then we discovered that we have basically limitless reserves of uranium, and that it's actually a lot more expensive to design nuclear reactors which utilize this process than it is to just buy more uranium ore.</p>
<p>Another common one is the production of <del>fluorine-19</del> fluorine-18. This is done by bombarding water with protons to turn O-18 into <del>F-19</del> F-18 as it ejects a neutron.  F-18 is then used as a radiotracer in medical applications, notably PET scans.  This is actually rather common and large hospitals sometimes even house their own particle accelerator for this or similar purposes.</p>
<p>Another process (not sure if it's been realized yet or is still in the theoretical stages) is the collection of rare earth metals from nuclear waste, which is just the end products of U-235 fission.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In principle, we could. We kind of do that in particle accelerators, to a very limited extent, and also in experimental fusion reactors. Ultimately, what you're describing is 'just' fusion.</p>
<p>The difficulty is in getting the protons and neutrons together (the electrons are easy). Protons are positively charged and repel each other strongly unless you can get them close enough so that the attractive strong force overcomes the electric repulsion between them. That means to get two protons together, you have to give them a <em>lot</em> of energy or they will just repel each other before they get close enough to merge.</p>
<p>But that's hard, and also there is no guarantee that they will actually bind together; they could alternative decay into some other combination of particles. Two protons alone, for example, is unstable, so you'd have to first get a proton and neutron together. Neutrons are difficult to manipulate, though, because they're electrically neutral. You need to have a slow neutron source and wait for one to collide with a proton, but you can't predict exactly when or where that will happen. Since adding an extra neutron or proton to an already stable atomic nucleus often produces an unstable isotope (sometimes with very short lifetimes), you need to be able to add protons and neutrons very very quickly so that the nucleus doesn't have time to break apart before you get it into a stable configuration again.</p>
<p>In some ways this gets harder as your nucleus gets bigger. A bigger nucleus is more positively charged, which means you have to give new protons even more energy to overcome that repulsion. At some point, you're as likely to smash the nucleus apart as you are to just give it a new proton.</p>
<p>TL;DR We can't deftly manipulate protons and neutrons into whatever position we want. Remember, these particles are 100,000 times smaller than an atom. We have to shoot lots of protons/neutrons into some target of lots of existing nuclei and wait for some of them to 'stick,' but this whole process is very imprecise and difficult to control. In addition, doing this step-by-step must be done very quickly or the whole thing will decay while it's in a temporary unstable state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, first you'd have to isolate your protons (easy, ionise hydrogen) and neutrons (hard) (just looking at the nucleus here - the electrons don't change much). Then you have to find a way to combine them. They're pretty tiny (10^-15 of a metre) so that's pretty hard too. As neutrons don't have an electric charge it's damn near impossible to manipulate them. Protons <strong>do</strong> have an electric charge but that just means that they push each other away.<br />
Assuming that you somehow do manage to do that, what's going to keep them together? There are relatively few stable isotopes for any given element - if you don't hit the right combination your new nucleus is going to decay into something else (for more information look up the 'valley of stability' and the 'semi-empirical mass formula')</p>
<p>That being said, we do do sort of do this in a fusion reactor. We take hydrogen and/or helium and fuse them to make heavier elements. Of course in this process the goal is the energy that this process releases, rather than the nuclei that you produce...  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is entirely possible. We could take a neutron source, a proton collider, and let the electrons come from the air, and in theory we could make any stable isotope we wanted. We could also produce some quantity of many unstable isotopes, though they would eventually decay into stable ones.</p>
<p>A better question would be, &quot;Why don't we do it?&quot; and the answer to that is PARTICLE COLLIDERS ARE REALLY FREAKING EXPENSIVE. We can turn lead into gold in an accelerator, and we will only spend (number from thin air here. Do not take thin number as an actual representation of the exact cost) 50 times more on making that gold than we would buying it retail. (again, not real number, the point is whatever the real number is, it is much larger than the market value of gold). </p>
<p>When we make isotopes in an accelerator, we typically only make a very small amount of it in a fairly large sample. Then we need to separate the new material out chemically. To get a large amount of something using this method would take a long time, a lot of electricity (particle accelerators take TONS of power to run), and many man hours between running the machine and separating the products. We can do it, but we can't afford it and don't need to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
