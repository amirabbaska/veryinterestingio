		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't give you a general answer, but I can point to one example in particular: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_SR-71_Blackbird" target="_blank">SR-71 Blackbird</a>. It was designed to fly at very high speeds for long periods of time, which results in significant heating due to aerodynamic effects, which in turn results in pieces of the fuselage expanding by several inches!</p>
<p>In order to not lose performance at its top speeds (due to poorly-fitting fuselage pieces), they fit the fuselage with loose-fitting pieces on the ground, so that when they heat up they actually fit together and make a seal. Because of this, the plane leaks fuel on the ground until takeoff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work on the MQ-1 and MQ-9 as a crew chief. Lots of the time an engine won't reach max performance until its been run several times. This is especially true for the MQ-1 as it uses a four cylinder motor. As the engine wears parts tend to fit a little tighter and work slightly more efficiently, that is until something breaks. The MQ-9 on the other hand, uses a jet engine that needs to be ran to get all the preservatives out. Normally when we shut down a new engine smoke and flame shoots out the exhaust from the preservation fluid burning off. It also requires additional run time to help several seals that melt over fittings and holes in the combustion chamber, this only happens at full power runs due to the heat produced.</p>
<p>Landing gear on the MQ-1 is also something that reaches better performance over multiple landings. It's made of carbon fiber and loosens over time to give the aircraft a softer landing surface. The airframe of both aircraft is made chiefly of carbon fiber as well, meaning that over time the entire body tends to warp and bend, this is a double edged sword though. Sometimes it warps in a way to ease maintenance, mainly with installing panels, but it can also make life hell when installing an engine. It's a crap shoot on whether it will be helpful or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slightly off topic but used parts are more safe than new parts only because <del>most</del> often parts fail at the start off their life. This rule has limits clearly but parts that have had a 'run in' are safer than plugging in a new one. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bearings are a great example of what you are talking about. There is a run in period on bearings to help break them in which generally has the effect of lowering the bearings torque, lowering the opperating temperature. Self lubricating plane bearings also require a run in. This gives the bearings a change to transfer the lubricant (PTFE) to the mating components which reduces the friction and imrpoves service life.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, this is not common practice.  Most reliability models (<del>statistical or</del> mechanical) predict a product to be mpst reliable initially and deteriorate from there; as the chances of failure increase as the product is stressed (as the plane is flown).  </p>
<p>Why dont engineers design so that maximum performance occurs after some break in period?  Well first off, every product (airplane, in your case) will be used and flown differently; its parts will fatugue at different rates than the next plane off the assembly line.  So, we design so that a plane will perform best initially.</p>
<p>The other part of the reason we don't do that has to do with what happens as an airplane's (or more generally, any metal or material like it) parts fatigue (the material cracks/breaks). At an atomic level, mollecules are moving through the web of atoms.  These atoms moving will eventually lead to failure.  Why design the plane to operate at a material state that is closer to its ultimate failure?</p>
<p>I think more likely if an engineer wanted to use a fatigued material for its propertues, they would lilely use a different material that had those properties when new.</p>
<p>Fatigue damage is a <em>huge</em> issue for aerospace engineers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
