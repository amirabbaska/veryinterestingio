		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The important cells for this type of photoreception are not the rods and cones, but photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsically_photosensitive_retinal_ganglion_cells" target="_blank">pRGCs</a>). These are neurons in the retina that sense light by themselves and send that signal directly to the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain, where the circadian clock is regulated.</p>
<p>I only found a paper that shows the distribution of the pRGCs in rat retinas (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2885915/" target="_blank">it's open access</a>). In rats the pRGCs are pretty spread out across the retina, but I don't know how that looks in humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
