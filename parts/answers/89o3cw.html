		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are no global space cops.  That is, no global regulatory body for outer space activities.  The Outer Space Treaty says</p>
<p>&quot;the activities of non-governmental entities in outer space, including the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall require authorization and continuing supervision by the appropriate State Party to the Treaty&quot;</p>
<p>That means if you're an American company that wants to launch stuff, you have to get permission from the US government, if you're Chinese, from China, etc.  Each nation is responsible for damage or harm caused by its citizens' stuff.</p>
<p>In the US, that approval happens through the Federal Aviation Administration, which regulates the rocket launch, and the Federal Communications Commission, which regulates satellite radio communications, and orbits to the extent that they affect communications.  To my knowledge, nobody regulates the actual &quot;being in space&quot; part of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The FCC's approval of Space X's satellites is for the frequencies to be utilized by them; assuring that they do not encroach on frequencies already authorized for use by others. To do so is within their purview.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>SpaceX is an American company that would be launching American-made satellites from American soil that plans on marketing the service to American customers.  This means they need approval from the American government to launch &amp; build their system.  If they wanted to move their money out of the US, build satellites in another country, use non-US launch facilities and never try to sell their services in the US, they could probably avoid FCC approval.  Even then, if they took too many liberties with their use of the radio spectrum, the American government would step in and put pressure on the country they were operating from to reign them in.</p>
<p>That said...</p>
<p>Ajit Pai isn't some rogue bureaucrat, he's a puppet of the Republican Party who was hand-picked to do exactly what he's doing.  If he didn't do what they wanted him to, they'd fire him &amp; replace him with another puppet that followed orders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First that approval only covers the US, but if the rules work out into deployment it will form a template for smaller countries that don't have the resources</p>
<p>That way they can offer service in the US as soon as they get enough of the system deployed to be viable.</p>
<p>Also the FCC can determine whether the rule on satellite dishes is the same as for DirecTV and Dish Network or whether another rule needs to be crafted and if so it gives them time to go through that part of the rule making process</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hold up, going off of that. Wouldn’t Ajit Pai be against this in the first place?</p>
<p>Actions like this would only fuel the idea that internet is a utility, am I wrong? That’s kind of the whole basis for rolling back on Net Neutrality, isn’t it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
