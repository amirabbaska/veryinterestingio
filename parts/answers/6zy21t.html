		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as i understand it, no creatures have both as it is simply not required. One of the basic functions of a skeleton (exo or endo) is simply to provide structural support for the creature, so it can move. If it has a exoskeleton it has no need of an endoskeleton, and vice versa. </p>
<p>However i'm not sure if you would classify a creature which has an endoskeleton, but also has some kind of bonelike armour (not connected to the endoskeleton) under this category.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I nominate the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=boxfish&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;prmd=ivsn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi_l6aAqKXWAhUDTCYKHaguBUwQ_AUIESgB&amp;biw=768&amp;bih=928" target="_blank">boxfishes</a> and related <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cowfish&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;prmd=imsvn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjZjIGcqKXWAhWGLSYKHZFMBIUQ_AUIESgB&amp;biw=768&amp;bih=928" target="_blank">cowfishes</a>. </p>
<p>They have a (reduced) bony skeleton but their scales have evolved into hard, bony hexagonal plates like fitted tiles. If you look closely at the picture of these <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cooked+trunkfish&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari#imgrc=9E1JCg8EZ5vU2M:" target="_blank">cooked trunkfish</a>, you can see the hexagons (all of these fish are in the same family and have the same design). </p>
<p>They are also delicious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically all vertebrates have both.</p>
<p>Our endoskeleton is made up of the cartilage-derived bones of the spine, limbs, ribs, and cranial base. The rest of our bones are intramembraneously-derived and are effectively exoskeletal. This includes the face and cranial vault as well as parts of the shoulder. Reptiles, amphibians, and fish tend to have much more exoskeleton. In sharks, the exoskeleton is secondarily reduced are replaced with an array of tiny teeth called denticles.</p>
<p>So yes, most vertebrates have both.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
