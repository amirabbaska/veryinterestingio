What makes up the diet of the animal can change the fats and chemical composition of the animal too, so even within species you can have different flavors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the meat's flavor comes from fat, as most of the flavorful molecules are fat-soluble. Those molecules come partly from the diet of the animal. Chicken is so bland tasting, as it doesn't really have much fat, especially in the breasts. That's also why so many other lean meats taste like chicken.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>It's also quite important to note that much of the flavor you experience is a result of the cooking. Maillard reaction specifically makes meat taste so tasty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
