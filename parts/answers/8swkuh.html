		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking does rain fall in a pattern on the ground in your front yard, the current consensus is maybe, but not significantly for most applications.  While there will be a distribution of drop sizes (i.e., basically a bunch of small drops and exponentially less large drops), these drops are traditionally assumed to be randomly dispersed in space.  Now because they're randomly dispersed you can still end up with clusters where one patch might get more rain than another patch, but this is due to randomness.  Some more recent research has shown that there is some slight deviation from randomness, but these measurements are inherently hard to make [1].  While this non-randomness is going to be negligible for hydrologists and farmers, it can be really important for micophysical equations in our weather models.</p>
<p>If you're asking if it rains in large scale (multiple kilometer or larger) patterns, it absolutely does.  For example, near the equator is the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intertropical_Convergence_Zone" target="_blank">intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)</a> which is a band of thunderstorms like a belt across the globe.  This happens because of converging and rising air.  Conversely, there are large deserts on either side of the equator in the tropics due to this same air descending.</p>
