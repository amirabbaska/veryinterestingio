		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One interesting sidebar is that metamorphosis is also a survival strategy.</p>
<p>Take the dragonfly, as a greatly simplified example: </p>
<p>*Pre-breeders (larval forms) are aquatic: they live underwater, with gills, and hunt their food on the bottom of ponds and streams, etc.</p>
<p>*Breeders (adults) are terrestrial: they fly around breathing air and catching other terrestrial insects for food and only the females revisit the water, and only to lay their eggs.</p>
<p>One of the upshots is that <em>neither the pre-breeders nor breeders compete with each other for food (and other) resources</em>, unlike say, mammals, whose pre-breeders (post infancy), breeders, and post-breeders pretty much all compete against one another for survival resources. Brilliant!</p>
<p>This is not the only survival strategy metamorphosis allows, the dragonfly also &quot;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=k5MLmvuDnUsC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=%22escape+in+time%22+ecological&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DSNeMOn_oT&amp;sig=kiu0KO6m-NCjj985dlWRHET6_ak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8yd2U-nmJ5fpoATUjICgAw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22escape%20in%20time%22%20ecological&amp;f=false" target="_blank">escapes in time</a>&quot; as well as &quot;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=k5MLmvuDnUsC&amp;pg=PA247&amp;lpg=PA247&amp;dq=%22escape+in+time%22+ecological&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DSNeMOn_oT&amp;sig=kiu0KO6m-NCjj985dlWRHET6_ak&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=8yd2U-nmJ5fpoATUjICgAw&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22escape%20in%20time%22%20ecological&amp;f=false" target="_blank">escapes in space</a>.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have another question on this matter, so I will ask it here:</p>
<p>As far as I know, the butterfly/caterpillar evolved by natural selection. So the dog (info gotten from Cosmos), which evolved from the wolf, was born because the wolf exemplars which had lower hormone levels, hence lower stress levels were better st surviving due to the feeding they got from humans. (I understand that it's a huge assumption, but the principle stays the same) </p>
<p>So what were the mutations, the traits that were passed over and  eventually led to metamorphosis? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
