		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's much smaller scale, but for Expo 86, the Northwest territories towed an iceberg into Vancouver, and put it in their Pavilion. It was used to cool the space and to make the ice for the drinks in the attached restaurant. You too could have had a gin and tonic cooled by 50,000 year old ice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd be worried about the ramifications on the effective &quot;let's just not talk about it&quot; sort of land truce that the world has with Antarctica. If a country goes out and starts taking from it, it may drive the super powers to start leveraging their might at laying or enforcing their claims on the territory which could lead to a pretty unpleasant conflict.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found another article discussing some of the challenges. In particular making sure the iceberg doesn't break apart could be difficult. If a chunk of it snaps off then besides losing some of your water, the loose berg becomes a hazard for shipping. That said smaller icebergs have been towed for other purposes.</p>

<p>The other question is whether it's the most economic method. Liquid water can be transported by flexible barge or by tanker ship. Desalination is well established. It's not clear iceberg towing would be cheaper. On the other hand there seems to be an element of &quot;fairground attraction&quot; to the UAE's plans in which case cost is less of a concern.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The video on your linked article is pretty hilarious with the polar bears and penguins roaming the beaches of Fujairah, ignoring their misplaced habitat, but yet placing value on how much attraction the event will bring. The article subtitle is 'Firm says it will begin towing icebergs from Antarctica to UAE to harvest fresh drinking water' but then they show a video depicting endless desert dunes turned into fields of green pastures and gardens. A bit of a mix message at the least.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, this is straight out of the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001NJUORQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1" target="_blank">Don't Try This at Home</a>, which has a rather good rundown of the &quot;how&quot; it could be done (short version, wrap the whole thing in a tarp with valves in order to keep fresh water and salt water as separate as possible).</p>
<p>The problem is that the entire book is intended to be a semi-serious satirical How To book.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
