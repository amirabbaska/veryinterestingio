		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hepatitis viruses (including D and E also) were identified in a time when biologists and medical professionals knew very little about viruses, or where able to classify them appropriately. The word hepatitis means &quot;inflammation of the liver,&quot; so naturally this is what all the hepatitis viruses have in common. They all cause some form of inflammation in the liver which leads to symptoms that are similar. </p>
<p>Hepatitis A is in the picornavirus family of viruses, same family as polio. It's an illness that people get by drinking or eating contaminated foods (this is refered to as fecal-oral transmission) often in third world countries where sanitation is poor. It looks and feels way worse than it is, lasting only one month and almost never killing anyone who gets it. </p>
<p>Hep B is a member of the hepadnovirus family. It's transmitted through sex and needle sharing, making it a blood borne pathogen. It looks much like hep A at the onset of illness, resolves, but unlike hep A which has no carrier state, hep B has a carrier state which often times develops into chronic hepatitis (chronic liver inflammation) over the course of many years, and often presents with kidney failure and even liver cancer. whether or not this occurs depends on the persons immune system. Unlike hep A, when we find hep B infections we treat them aggressively with antiviral medications. </p>
<p>Hep C belongs to the flavivirus family, same as West Nile virus. It is transmitted only through blood, which makes it most common in people who share needles. Unlike hep B, hep c infections become chronic most of the time, leading to liver cirrhosis (hardening) and also liver cancer, same as hep B, but much more commonly. Infact, hep c is the most common cause of hepatocellular carninoma. We treat hep c as we do hep b, but cannot vaccinate against it (as with hep b) because the virus itself is too variable in the way it coats its outer shell. </p>
<p>In summary, the hepatitis viruses are not a family of viruses. They are a group of viruses from different famililies that all happen to affect the liver in some way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are caused by different viruses and therefore cause different illnesses. While they all cause &quot;hepatitis&quot; or inflammation of the liver, they are far from the only viruses that cause that. EBV (the most common form of &quot;mono&quot;) also can. As can CMV and other viruses...as well as many non-viral causes (autoimmune diseases, Fe overload, tylenol toxicity, fatty liver, alcohol, etc).</p>
<p>Speaking in broad strokes, Hepatits A tends to be transmitted through a fecal-oral route...meaning fecal contamination of food or water and is typically ingested. It often causes a brief illness that most people get over from,  but can be dangerous to certain groups of people.</p>
<p>Hepatits B is a virus made from DNA (the other 2 are RNA). It is usually sexually transmitted. It can also occur through blood-borne transmission (transfusions, sharing needles for IV drug use) and in some cases can even be passed from mother to child during pregnancy and birth. Unlike Hepatitis A which usually is only a transient illness, Hepatitis B can lead to immunity in some people, but other people can develop chronic disease which can eventually lead to cirrhosis or liver cancer (&quot;hepatocellular carcinoma)&quot;</p>
<p>Hep C is usually transmitted by the blood borne route. Most people do not develop immunity to it and have chronic infection which ultimately leads to either liver cancer or cirrhosis. </p>
<p>There is no vaccine for Hep C but there are new drugs that can kill the virus. Meanwhile, there are vaccines for HepA and HepB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my experience Hep A, wasn't nearly as bad as you'd expect. I somehow managed to get Mono (EBV) and Hep A (as well as tonsilitis and pharyngitis) at the same time, ended up in hospital for a week. My only real symptoms of EBV and Hep A were hot feverish sweats and headaches from EBV like a severe cold/flu without coughing and sneezing etc and yellow itchy skin coupled with really strong smelling brown urine and white excrement. Sleep was not my friend for about a month, thats to say uninterrupted sleep - even now 3 months later I can't get enough rest - what I wouldn't give for a good 12 hours sleep a day.</p>
<p>The only reason they kept me in hospital was to make absolutely certain my liver recovered ok and that there wasnt some kind of underlying illness on top.</p>
<p>For anybody interested both the hospital and my personal Dr seem to think it was caused by my work, I'm a broadband, and phone technician. I go into people's homes to fix faults, I used to have drinks sometimes when offered - not these days. Also I have to work in manholes in the street but take precautions but could also be that somehow. </p>
<p>This was probably about 3 months ago and I am still struggling with energy levels at work and home - about 1 or 2 in the afternoon I'm ready for a nap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add, while Hepatitis B is transmitted by blood contact, it is extremely transmissible via this route.</p>
<p>An outbreak in Sweden among cross-country runners was tracked to a Hepatitis B carrier who was among the faster runners - small cuts on his legs from grasses/flax and twigs provided a means of infection for following runners.</p>
<p>In New Zealand, there is a high endemic rate of infection among Polynesian groups due to maternal infection of babies who generally develop chronic Hepatitis B infection (95%). This impacts the general population, with &quot;playground infection&quot; a common infection vector.</p>
<p>I've been involved with treatment trials for chronic Hepatitis B, and there have been some really positive developments.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All are inflammation of the liver. Hepatitis literally means &quot;inflammation of the liver&quot; A is the easiest to catch though skin to skin contact or though food and is short lasting unless your old and in bad health....B is a bit harder to catch only through blood and other body fluids and can be both short or really long lasting...and c ( which I actually have ) is the hardest to catch and is only passed through blood to blood contact and is chronic with few treatments available (in the US). There also exist D and E and some other variations but they are much more rare and rarely seen in 1st and 2nd world countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
