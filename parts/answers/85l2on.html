		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grass goes into a dormant state as the weather changes, similar to how trees shed their leaves and go dormant. With the lowered state of metabolism, among other augmented processes, these plants can survive a winter. Imagine a car operating with 3 of its 4 cylinders disabled. It will still run, although at a low performance, and will consume FAR less gas. When the grass is back in full on summer mode it needs a consistent supply of energy and nutrients to stay alive. Nutrients and water it can retrieve from the ground, but the light from the sun needed for photosynthesis (making plant food) has been blocked by your cooler. At this point your grass, which is running with all 4 cylinders, has no gas. The grass will die.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really cool question (no pun intended), and the answer is pretty amazing.</p>
<p>Editing in a tl;dr:</p>
<p>Plants are really good at surviving the cold but only if it gets cold gradually. Gradual change gives them time to prepare for cold damage. Sudden cold can kill unprepared plants, through direct damage and by making them press a self destruct button. They survive snow because it insulates them from cold air and they've usually had time to prepare. Water coolers kill them because they're crushed, chilled and can't make food from sunlight. It's usually only the leaves that die though, and dead plants can regrow from their roots. Roots act as a kind of food bank, giving plants everything they need to make new leaves when the weather is good, or when water coolers are removed.</p>
<p>In depth:</p>
<p>I'm going to being with a brief crash course in plant biology, then move into answering the question.</p>
<p>All plants are sessile, which means they aren't capable of moving. This means that if they are going to survive constantly changing environmental conditions, they need to make major changes to their basic makeup. As a human, if you are exposed to cold temperatures then you can either generate heat or seek more favourable conditions. With the exception of exothermic plants which generate their own heat and are relatively uncommon, most plant species are the same temperature as their surroundings. This means they have evolved other mechanisms to survive the damaging effects of cold.</p>
<p>In general, cold temperatures don't occur suddenly. In the transition from summer to autumn and through into winter, day and night temperatures fall gradually. It's the gradual nature of the temperature decrease that allows a plant to acclimate (also known as hardening). When a plant acclimates, it changes its cellular composition to better cope with the cold. To really understand what changes are made, we need to look at some of the key damaging effects of cold.</p>
<p>Cold temperatures destabilise cell membranes. Each leaf is composed of thousands of cells. Imagine these cells as water balloons. When they are exposed to cold, their skin/membrane is weakened and the water begins to leak out. However, when a plant senses the temperature is getting colder, it invests a lot of the energy it gets from photosynthesis into strengthening its cell membrane. It does this by producing more robust membrane components. A rough analogy might be thickening the skin of the water balloon. Other components of the cell are strengthened too, but for starters we will only consider the membrane.</p>
<p>Another impact of cold is a decrease in metabolic rate, which makes sense. The cell is a mixing pot of hundreds of different chemical compounds. When the temperature drops, the free energy available for these chemicals to react with each other is decreased too. A poor analogy for this would be making a grilled cheese sandwich. If you heat the cheese at 60 degrees Celsius it might melt over the bread eventually, but if you heat it at 150 degrees it will melt a lot faster. When it's cold, the plant can't &quot;melt it's cheese&quot; or &quot;metabolise&quot; as quickly. This might sound fine, but not all chemical reactions produce good things and some chemical reactions can take place with very little heat availability, instead being triggered by light. Plants have evolved to utilise light energy very effectively in photosynthesis. The chloroplasts of a plant cell are very adept at harvesting light energy and converting it into chemical energy, i.e. sugars. The first step in the process is electron excitation. The problem is, when the temperature drops, the ability of plants to convert excited electrons into chemical energy is diminished. These electrons are very reactive and the result of reducing the efficiency of the system that processes them is damage through random reactions with cellular components. This usually occurs via things called reactive oxygen species, which are combated by antioxidants. When it gets cold, plants will increase the abundance of antioxidants in their cells, allowing them to scavenge potentially destructive reactive oxygen species produced by unprocessed &quot;excited&quot; electrons.</p>
<p>The final result of cold that I'm going to mention is decreased water uptake. Cold exposure decreases a plants ability to move water through its body, mainly through effects on leaf stomata. When it's cold, leaves can't open and close their stomata as effectively so the plant often opts to shut down and enter a period of reduced metabolic activity or dormancy. This means it doesn't grow when it's cold, but it does invest a lot of energy into surviving.</p>
<p>These changes are all made in response to cold and will help a plant to survive freezing temperatures, cold temperatures and snow cover. In fact, snow cover is often good for plants as the snow forms a protective, insulating blanket that traps warmth and shields plants from wind chill.</p>
<p>This brings us to the question of why grass can't survive a cold water cooler being placed on it during the summer. The answer is, the grass hasn't been given time to acclimate. When the water cooler is placed on it, two distinct stresses are introduced. The first is the mechanical stress of the water cooler, which will break up some of the leaf tissue. The second is the cold, which if the plant hasn't been given time to acclimate, will be very destructive, often resulting in yellowing of the leaves which is called chlorosis. When leaves go yellow, it is because the plant is recycling all of the nutrients in the leaf so they can be reinvested into the growth of new leaves when conditions are more favourable.</p>
<p>Add to this the fact the water cooler may have been left for a week and you have a plant that hasn't been given sufficient sunlight to grow, on top of the other stresses. The net result is death.</p>
<p>However, like others say, the leaves of a plant are only half of the story and plants are very resilient. Once the water cooler is moved, they are able to regrow from their roots, using nutrients they have accumulated over their life time.</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>think of grass as an underground tree. the grass are the 'leaves' and the massive amount of intertwining roots underground are the 'trunk'. cutting the grass doesnt kill the leaves...unless you cut too close, then you kill it. same thing with a cooler or some other heavy weight. but like any actual tree, give it some time and new 'leaves' (the grass you see)will come back</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
