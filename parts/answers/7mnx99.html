		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a big difference between those 2 things:</p>
<p>One requires more muscle mass. More muscle mass can generate more force. When you lift a weight you can slowly activate more muscles fibres contraction generating more and more force until it is enough to start lifting the object.</p>
<p>Running on the other hand is a very complex movement. You constantly change multiple different muscles between contraction and relaxation. And there is an upper limit how fast you can do this, as this requires actual chemical processes (besides the bio-electrical processes from neurons firing signals) within the muscles to achieve the contraction and relaxation processes in constant exchange. </p>
<p>There are different muscles that can do those processes faster, and you can also train them to a certain degree on a bio-electrical and chemical level to do those actions faster, but at some point you reach the chemical limit for the muscles to do that action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In simple ELI5 terms. </p>
<p>Humans are already optimized to run, so the average person is a lot closer to the maximum. </p>
<p>Humans are not optimized to lift heavy objects, so the average person isnt naturally built to do so, an thus when you optimize a person for that, they have a lot farther to go. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To refine your examples just a little...</p>
<p>There are no Olympic weightlifters that squat 1200lbs. There have been only a handful of powerlifters who have ever squatted over 1200, wearing multi-ply lifting suits. Olympic weightlifting does not compete the squat. Olympic lifters routinely squat 2-3.5x their bodyweight in training, with the heaviest in common knowledge at almost 800lbs.</p>
<p>Smaller lifters have a proportionately higher ceiling on their strength. The world record squat for a 123lb lifter is more than 5x, but the 308lb class record is just under 3x. This trend is mirrored in relative speed among different size animals, as well. The fastest animal on Earth is the Tiger Beetle, running almost 125 body lengths per second. Theyâ€™re so fast they go functionally blind while in motion. I guess that opens a whole new list of interesting questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Air resistance can be a big factor. It might help to use the example of a bicycle as I know the numbers involved with that. The best cyclists can sprint at 70kmh and they require around 2,000 watts of power to travel at that speed. An average untrained person should probably be able to do at least half that speed, 35kmh but at that speed they only need 250 watts.</p>
<p>That's about 8 times the power required to travel at twice the speed.</p>
<p>On a bicycle at least, doubling the power of the rider will usually lead to an increase in speed of only around 30%.</p>
<p>In the case of Usain Bolt, while he may be running twice as fast as an untrained runner he would be producing far more than twice the amount of power with most of that power going towards overcoming air resistance. Researchers calculated that Usain produced up to 2,619 watts at the 2009 world championships with 92% of that power overcoming drag.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lifting has a singular requirement, sprinting has two competing requirements. Speed, human or otherwise, comes down to power to weight ratio. A great runner can develop a lot of power while simultaneously be relatively light weight overall. Adding power may not pay off if it adds additional weight. A power lifter has no requirement to keep his weight down, it is all just a matter of how much power he can supply, how muscular he can become. He may add all the power he can without a downside that added weight would bring to a runner. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
