		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a good question, in the sense that it can be used to clarify multiple intertwined misconceptions about AI.</p>
<p>First, <em>what is artificial intelligence</em>?</p>
<p>In computer science, the field of AI research defines itself as the study of &quot;intelligent agents&quot;: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of success at some goal (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003). The central problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception, and the ability to move and manipulate objects. [1]</p>
<p>In colloquial use, what is implied by <em>AI</em> is what John Searle hypothesized as &quot;strong AI&quot; (Searle, 1999, &quot;Mind, language and society&quot;), which is inadequately defined. Quoting Searle: &quot;The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds&quot;. The field of AI initially was founded on this premise; the claim that human intelligence &quot;can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it&quot; (the Dartmouth proposal). It has become exceedingly clear this description eludes us (machines have no mind, and our emulation of organic brains has only been done at a very small-scale, see OpenWorm)  that's why CS has moved gradually to a definition that excludes (mental) facilities once thought to require intelligence: optical recognition, competing at a high level in strategic games, routing, interpretation of complex data, etc. This is the reason approaches like the CM-originated &quot;cognitive simulation&quot; have been abandoned.</p>
<p>This is the first major problem with &quot;true artificial intelligence&quot;: to test for it, one must first define it precisely and unambiguously.</p>
<p>Secondly, Searle's &quot;strong AI&quot; is now a <em>long-term</em> goal of AI research, and not part of its definition. Creating lifelike simulations of human beings is a difficult problem on its own that does not need to be solved to achieve the basic goals of AI research. Believable human characters may be interesting in a work of art, a game, or a sophisticated user interface, but they are not part of the science of creating intelligent machines, that is, machines that solve problems using intelligence. Its creation, existence, and implications are more relevant to the philosophy of artificial intelligence (Turing, 1950, &quot;The Imitation Game&quot;), the impact of which on actual AI research has not been significant (John McCarthy, 1996, &quot;The Philosophy of Artificial Intelligence&quot;, What has AI in Common with Philosophy?)</p>
<p>AI researchers have argued that passing the Turing Test is a distraction from useful research [2], and they have devoted little time to passing it (Russell &amp; Norvig, 2003). Since current research is aimed at specific goals, such as scheduling, object recognition, logistics, etc. it is more straightforward and useful to test these approaches at the specific problems they intend to solve. To paraphrase the analogy given by Russell and Norvig: airplanes are tested by how well they perform in flight, not by how similar they are to birds - aeronautical engineering isn't the field of making machines that behave like pigeons, to fool other pigeons.</p>
<p>So, secondly, due to its irrelevance to the modern understanding of the field as well as the complexity of its imprecise definition, &quot;strong AI&quot; is not an active area of R&amp;D.</p>
<p>[1] This list of intelligent traits is based on the topics covered by the major AI textbooks, including: Russell &amp; Norvig 2003, Luger &amp; Stubblefield 2004, Poole, Mackworth &amp; Goebel 1998, Nilsson 1998</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this question is more a philosophical one. What is intelligence? Turing test proposes that if it can function like a human it is intelligent. But then again i believe there are humans who would fail turing test. Also animals are also intelligent in their own way but do not function like a human. If we were able to create a true virtual dog it would not pass the turing test but i would still say it is a true artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>I think we have invented a true artificial intelligence when we have a system that has some kind of theory of mind (basically has it's own ideas and goals etc.) and that is able to adapt to arbitrary new situations (within limitations of it's sensory inputs of course). It does not necessarily have to be able to fake being human. </p>
<p>So my answer is, AI development is not much concerned with turing test and neither is the definition of intelligence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Turing test is not actually considered a reasonable test of AI by actual AI researchers. It's an interesting point in the development, but you could build a device that passed the test that was considered no where near an AI.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>True artificial intelligence is going to be a moving goalpost for a long time.  There will need to be a line drawn regarding if it counts as AI if it is just a huge matrix of preprogrammed responses to things.  Look at early models such as SmarterChild which was on AIM.  Some would argue that would count as AI because unless you tried to trick it, it could converse fairly well.  It could carry on better conversations than most 3-5 year olds depending on how you judge the quality of conversations, but you could easily expose the weaknesses of its design with creative phrasing.  There are also those 20 questions electronics games.  I could think of &quot;wombat&quot; and by answering yes or no questions, it could tell me I was thinking of a wombat in less than 20 questions.  This seems like AI at first but it is really just a flow chart with a over a million possible end points. </p>
<p>So even if we eventually have robots running around that can own a home, hold down a job, and even socialize with humans, is that a sign of real AI or is it just a more elaborate version of the 20 questions game that now uses its sensors to collect information of its surrounding and basically answer millions of its own questions to choose from one of trillions of different actions based on a huge flowchart that was generated through years of previous tests and simulations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
