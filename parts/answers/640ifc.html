		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it is one of the simplest self-organization principles, along with the golden ratio <em>phi</em> (which is the limit of the ratios of successive Fibonacci numbers), and the golden angle (which is the golden ratio applied to the circumference of a circle).</p>
<p>It would be useful for a sunflower to pack as many florets as possible into the space available, to increase likelihood of pollination and send as many seeds out into the world as possible. There are several ways it could do that: anything from randomly arrayed florets to some complex close-packing algorithm. But it's a plant, so it needs a simple rule that results in an optimal configuration: it needs a simple 'self-organizing' principle. And the simplest rules (known to plants) that lead to the greatest optimization tend to involve Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p>The spirals come in because they fill round spaces efficiently. Suppose a flower has <em>m</em> lines of seeds, each containing <em>n</em> seeds. If those lines ran out radially from the center, the seeds would be too crowded near the center and too sparse further out, wasting space and resources. So you decide to curve them, to wrap them around the circle. If you don't curve enough, you get gaps between the curves. If you curve too much, you run into the next curve. The way to get the most out of the space is to find curves that turn just the right amount and intersect each other at just the right place to put a seed. (Anything else would leave spaces between the seeds, where one curve hit the other at a non-integer seed position and left a useless gap.) Take all of those constraints together, and the simplest efficient self-organizing solutions occur when <em>m</em> and <em>n</em> are (often consecutive) Fibonacci numbers and, because these things go hand in hand, when the amount of curvature is related to the golden ratio.</p>
<p>(There are all sort of arrangements of <em>this</em> number of curves containing <em>that</em> number of elements where those numbers are <em>not</em> Fibonacci numbers, but they mostly run into the problem that plants are not very good at math. Fibonacci numbers and various related golden ratios are very simple, but lead to very efficient coverage. A plant that figured this out would suddenly have a huge edge over other plants; millions of years later most of the plants that exist have <em>some</em> sort of simple-but-efficient harmonious relations, often involving Fibonacci numbers.)</p>
<p>mini-tl;dr: When you look at a sunflower you can see some number of clockwise spirals, another number of anti-clockwise spirals; only when those numbers are Fibonacci numbers do the lines curve in such a way that every seed is the intersection of two curves and unused space is minimized.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the other direction, the golden ratio is a simple but efficient principle for self-organizing, and any time it affects the curvature of something there are resonances that occur when the numbers of the elements making up the curve are Fibonacci numbers. </p>
<p>These numbers are given <em>way</em> too much significance in the popular press, but they do show up - almost always as part of some self-organizing principle - in many parts of nature. Like: it would be useful for plants to stagger their leaves such that they receive as much sunlight as possible. Too far away, there might not be enough leaves to collect the energy the plants need. Too close together, and the higher leaves cast a shadow over the lower leaves. The number, size, and shape of leaves that leads to optimal energy intake are often related to Fibonacci numbers; the spacing of branches around trunks and leaves around branches is often related to the golden angle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why is the Fibonacci sequence so special? Because it occurs in nature quite often. That's the real Q&amp;A here, not the other way around. The sequence itself is not very mathematically useful (I think there's a way to check primes with Fibonacci?), but what's so special about it is that nature seems to like it, like how leafs grow and the pattern on shells, it's also tied to the golden ratio, which occurs in nature a lot too. That the golden ratio occurs in nature is very explainable by the way, it's the exact ratio of dividing a line in such a way that the ratio between the short and long part is the same as the ratio between the long part and the total length. This makes it the best ratio for expanding a shape onto itself without leaving gaps (what flowers, shells etc do to grow), <a href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/nature-golden-ratio-fibonacci.html" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Why is it always portrayed in spirals?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the golden ratio is the limit of the ratio of successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence, and the golden ratio shows up in a lot of weird places in nature.</p>
<p>Why does the golden ratio show up so often? No one has a definite answer to that question.</p>
<p>My guess is that its biology being lazy. The Fibonacci sequence is pretty easy to calculate with recursion and simple counting primitives, and it's pretty easy to accurately approximate the golden ratio from that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
