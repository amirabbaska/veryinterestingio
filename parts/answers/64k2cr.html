		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Great Barrier Reef is a zone which indicates a relative diversity of life on Earth, like Rainforests. The more diverse life is on the planet, the better, as we humans like to harvest things. Imagine if rubber trees didn't exist? Or if the fungi that made up immune suppressants didn't exist? Diversity is really good and when one of these places loses its diversity, we see that most other places are losing diversity too. Furthermore, an estimated 375 billion dollars are generated from food and tourism related to reefs, with about 500 million people dependent on their survival. Animals that depend on these corals for food go too. Entire food chains are disrupted. Imagine no more snapper, grouper, clams, or oysters! Fish rely on corals for protection from larger predators. </p>
<p>About 70% of Earth's oxygen comes from the ocean, from the smallest organisms to the largest kelp forests. Losing life in the ocean directly impacts our world's ability to sustain life. If the reefs, which are some of the most fragile ecosystems start to die, then it's an early warning sign that things are going to get worse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're just talking about the Great Barrier Reef, the most tangible effects are local. If the corals bleach and die, the reef structure will still be there for some time, but will gradually be lost to erosion. (When corals are alive, they balance out the erosion by laying down new calcium carbonate skeleton.) So first you'll lose the species that depend on live coral, like butterflyfish that feed on coral. Then you'll start to lose the species that depend on the physical structure as their habitat, including lots of fish that are commercially important. The reef structure is also important for dampening the force of waves coming into shore, so as you lose the structure to erosion you also lose protection from storms.</p>
<p>The bigger problem is that it's not just the Great Barrier Reef. Coral reefs throughout the tropics and subtropics all face the same threats (ocean warming which causes bleaching, ocean acidification which makes it harder for them to build skeletons) and they collectively support millions of people in coastal communities in terms of providing protein, coastal protection, employment (e.g. tourism), and cultural identity. The loss of coral reefs on a global scale is a huge looming disaster.</p>
<p>There are scientists working with coral to try and identify the ones that are most tolerant of warmer water, clone them (they can regenerate from fragments) and use them to build new reefs. This works on a small scale but it's hard to do it at a large scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coral Reefs are highly connected system where almost everything is interdependent on something else. Also it is important to understand the hard Corals are bleaching due to ocean acidification (due to increasing temperatures) which also have impacts on many molluscan species preventing them from building up layers of their calcium shell for defense. Corals and sponges play a particularly large role in remove nutrients from the water and with excess nutrients, there will most likely be decreased visablitly (reducing the photosynthetic capabilities of my of the reefs primary producers) and huge blooms of algae and plankton. This can have massive impacts on the surrounding reef organism and even change the coral reef to a less productive and diverse algae prone system. The point I am trying to get across is nature is extremely complex, far more complex than our models and estimation could ever predict. All we know for sure is that there will be change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The loss of diversity stinks, and coral reefs are incredibly efficient carbon sinks, but we'll live on without it. I don't expect it to have any significant consequences but I don't deny that we're on a path to extinction and this is just a marker along the way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
