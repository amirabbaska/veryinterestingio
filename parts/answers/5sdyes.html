		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We measure the size of the unobservable universe by measuring the curvature of the local universe. If it has zero curvature, the universe is flat and infinite. If it has negative curvature, it has a hyperbolic shape, and is also infinite. If it has positive curvature, it has a hyperspherical shape (like a sphere but in more dimensions), and we can use the curvature to work out the size of the universe.</p>
<p>Currently it really looks like the universe is very very flat, so it looks like it's infinite. Unfortunately, all measurements must have an uncertainty, which means that it's technically possible that the universe is finite in size - it's just that the curvature is so small that we can't actually see it.</p>
<p>Edit: For a flat universe, Ω=1. For a spherical universe, Ω&gt;1. We have Ω=1.00±0.02. For Ω=0.98, the radius of curvature of the universe would be about 30 gigaparsecs, which is on the scale of the total size of the observable universe - although we've only observed galaxies up to about 4 Gpc, and only with tricky lensing techniques.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think that the answers here are answering their own question and ignoring OP's-let me try to rephrase: Given that we have observed that the universe is expanding and also that the measured rate of that expansion is increasing (regardless of geometry-as a highly curved piece of paper is just as long as a flat one), can we project backwards to know the size of the universe based on the estimated time since the Big Bang? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've done quite a bit of reading on the subject and the answers regarding the &quot;flatness&quot; of the universe being an indicator of its size are accurate.  </p>
<p>That being said, there are inflation theories that predict the universe is <em>at least</em> a certain size.  This may be closer to what you were looking for - not sure.  </p>
<p>These theories suggest the minimum size of the <em>actual</em> universe is to the <em>observable</em> universe what the <em>observable</em> universe is to an atom.  Something like 10 ^ (10*30) times the size of the observable universe.  Incomprehensibly vast.  For all practical purpose, endless.</p>
<p>The math - coupled with observations - seems to suggest that the universe is very likely infinite, so this monstrously large minimum value starts to make perfect sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I might be too late to draw this distinction in the question but it seems a lot of answers are implying that space itself is infinite while ignoring matter. Are we to assume that there is an infinite quantity of matter within this infinite universe? If so how is that possible? If not do we have any idea how far matter extends into the seemingly infinite universe?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
