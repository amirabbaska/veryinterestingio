		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moore's law states that the performance of semiconductor technology improves by a factor of two roughly every 18 months.  For something like an sd card, the data is stored by effectively etching out a physical space on the semiconductor material for each bit of data to be stored.  These chips are created by a die (think of it like a printing press or vinyl press except at a really small scale, like nanometers) and draw out the circuits onto the semiconductor material.   As the die technology improves, the resolution that the circuitry can be created gets better and better at a smaller and smaller scale.    The theoretical limit of this particular technology breaks down once you can draw out circuits down to the scale of a single atom thick.  If you try splitting that atom to go smaller, that's called nuclear fission and would probably be bad for anyone in a several mile radius. I'm not sure when that projection is scheduled to be here, but there's a good chance that quantum computing will pick up before that limit becomes the commercially viable option.  Quantum technology has the potential to provide an even greater exponential increase in storage capacity and computational speed.  No idea on what that limit could be, but there's a chance we hit the next technology before that limit too... that is unless the robots win or we blow ourselves up with our godlike computational prowess :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Last I read, the SDXC standard put the maximum at 2TB of file space per card, though capacities haven't reached that yet.  Physical limitations on cell size my not allow this, and newer standards for SD cards are shifted to throughput speeds instead of capacity.</p>
<p>So right now, pending a new file standard, the upper limit is 2TB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not so much every month for space, rather for reliability and bandwidth. For instance I remember only a few years ago when solid state drives were not reliable at all.</p>
<p>I'm also a bit different, I would prefer having a 256GiB microSD over a 512GiB regular SD. I thought that whole 200GiB gimmick was silly and ingenious at the same time.</p>
<p>SD cards are more arbitrary, so it would probably be better to work in centimeters, I mean you wouldn't mind a 1 cm by 1 cm (square) by 10 mm thick card if it hit the theoretical limit, would you? It would also be easy to relate to the size of an SD card.</p>
<p>Even better is they use something called nanometer or nm gauged setups, which you get a million per centimeter. So 1,000,000 * 1,000,000 is 1,000,000,000,000 or a trillion bits. Since we use bytes instead of bits you divide by 8 and round to the nearest computing magnitude yielding 128 GiB. Why not 125? Because in computing the numbers work on doubling rather than incrementing like in decimal. This is called binary, or hexadecimal (meaning 6 and 10, or 16). Anyways, you're probably going to be looking at something like 2^40 or 1,099,511,627,776 bits rather than an even trillion.</p>
<p>So wait, we have cards that have 256 GiB that are much smaller than a centimeter and we're not even to a 1 nm process yet? What evil magic is this?! It isn't. It's called layers. I'm sure you don't want a card only a nanometer thick! All that itty bitty (to you and me) yet massive (to the switches) extra space lets you stack these cards! <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-launches-a-256gb-microsd-card" target="_blank">Notice here it says Samsung's microSD cards are made out of what? <strong>3D</strong> V-NAND</a>. They are saying they can make this up to 100 layers thick, and they are using a <a href="http://www.samsung.com/us/business/discover/solid-state-drives/assets/pdf/3bit_V-NAND_White_Paper.pdf" target="_blank">19 nanometer process (PDF file)</a> to do it. Yes, that's 20x less capacity than we've been working with here, but it doesn't matter when you have 100x more room.</p>
<p>If they ever do get that down to 1 nm you'll have 100 trillion little switches! Not only that but what if that allows them to increase the amount of layers by 20x as well? Then you're looking at quadrillions, or 15 zeroes. Those would be petabytes or PB. <a href="http://www.dietzellab.de/goodies/numbers.html" target="_blank">I can't wait until we are working at the DNA scale</a>, 10 base pairs at 3.4 nm. If we're that close to DNA already I'm actually quite a bit impressed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every time a new and smaller/denser chip technology is made, the size (eg 7nm) is not evenly spread. This isn't quite answer to your question but it's also interesting. Due to quantum tunneling and similar things we can't really go much smaller than that. This way of making only certain parts super small is a clever way of pushing the limits of current technology a bit further. But we can't really go much further than this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The theoretical limit is unbelievable large. If you mean on an actual micro SD card, u/Saberrus_Terras is right with 2TB. However, if you mean the question in a more generic sense, so how much data can fit on an SD cars sized memory chip, it's much, much more. Several people have mentioned that when you get to the atomic level, you're stuck. Sure, that's true. But then you can start stacking. The actual memory is very very thin, so with more advanced technology, we could likely stack hundreds of memory films in a small chip, each holding tens or hundreds of TB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
