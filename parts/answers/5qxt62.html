		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Unconstitutional&quot; = contrary to the Constitution.  &quot;Illegal&quot; = contrary to a law (including contrary to the Constitution).  To some extent both of these things are a matter of interpretation, of course, but when it comes down to it they're either decided in a court of law or not decided at all.</p>
<p>As for &quot;impeachable&quot;:</p>
<p>Before Gerald Ford became President, he was the Speaker of the House of Representatives.  At that time, he made a famous, quotable saying about exactly what &quot;impeachable&quot; means:</p>
<p><strong>An impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history.</strong></p>
<p>That is, in my opinion, actually a pretty accurate summary of the situation.  &quot;Impeachable&quot; is not terribly well defined.  The Constitution doesn't define it at all.  It does define some related ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The House of Representatives is the body that has the power to impeach.</li>
<li>The Senate is the body that has the power to try impeachment cases (i.e. after the House impeaches somebody, the Senate says whether they're guilty or not).</li>
<li>Some detail about how an impeachment case is tried (for example, it's required to be heard before at least 2/3 of the Senate (<strong>Edit:</strong> misremembered this - it's 2/3 for conviction, not 2/3 for hearing)).</li>
<li>Some detail about the limits of punishment of a conviction for impeachment (can't be more than removal from office and barring from holding future office, something like that).</li>
<li>If the defendant is a civil officer of the US (e.g. the president), and the impeachment is for &quot;treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors&quot;, then conviction will result in (at least) removal from office.</li>
<li>The president's pardon power does not extend to impeachments.</li>
</ul>
<p>But it's silent on what a person can be impeached for.  The &quot;treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; thing is the closest it comes to doing that, but it's not really that.  It's just saying IF that's what you're impeached for, then here's the minimum punishment.  It doesn't say those are the only things you can be impeached for.  And even ignoring that, it doesn't say what &quot;other high crimes and misdemeanors&quot; means.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest difference is that &quot;illegal/impeachable&quot; is meant to refer to actions that are &quot;criminal&quot;---things like theft or corruption or graft.</p>
<p>Many of those things might be unconstitutional as well (if done in an official government capacity), but unconstitutional is a larger umbrella that covers official government actions that turn out to be unconstitutional but aren't &quot;punishable&quot; except in that the courts will tell the executive it doesn't have the power to do that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Trump signed a presidential order that immediately changes the rules for Middle Eastern immigrants. The courts now are going to review that and decide if it's legal or not. </p>
<p>Nixon hired private goons to break into his oppositions headquarters to steal documents. </p>
<p>In the first case the president is trying to change law to fit with his and his constituents beliefs. Elected officials are always trying to push the law one way or the other and that this constitutes a healthy democracy. </p>
<p>In the second case a paranoid man is hiring people to perform illegal activities. Any person should know better, and the president more than anybody should know he's not above the law. </p>
<p>That's an anecdotal attempt at the difference as far as I see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question is predicated on either the legislature or the courts doing their constitutionally mandated job, the issue is they do not do this. Or they only do this when it is for &quot;questionable&quot; personal behaviour or when it comes to the internal affairs of the US and/or the rights of US citizens and not when it relates to foreign affairs or the rights of foreigners.</p>
<p>When the Reagan administration ignored the law and congress to trade arms with Iran, via Israel, to use the profits to fund right-wing death-squads in South America, or should i rephrase that, cocaine smuggling right-wing death-squads in South America, the legislature and the courts let him get away with it.</p>
<p>When the whole Bush administration was involved in the most horrific war crimes imaginable, torture, kidnapping, waging aggressive war, based upon lies, the Democratic party controlled legislature and the Obama administration did nothing, despite these crimes fall under federal stature for which the death penalty applies (causing the death of a protected person as defined by the Geneva convention is a federal capital crime). </p>
<p>The people that ordered the torture that resulted in the death of innocent people should of hanged based upon the Nuremberg principle. The US government hanged top Nazi's for the same type of crimes.</p>
<p>The courts also let the government get away with murder when national security is invoked or the evidence is deemed so secret that the plaintiffs can't prove the evidence exists or that they have standing.</p>
<p>Given these facts I think it is fair to say that the President and his administration are for all intents and purposes above the law and in the modern era there is no such thing as unconstitutional and or illegal/impeachable and executive privilege is unfettered and limitless in practice if not in theory.</p>
<p>The worst part is you can't even really blame the current administration, they are only taking advantage of &quot;facts on the ground&quot; created by a succession of previous administrations, Republican and Democrats alike who pushed the boundaries over and over without holding each other to account.</p>
<p>Speaking personally it angers me a lot that Obama and the Democrats had a opportunity to end this but chose instead to codify many of the abuses of the Bush administration into law and by default or design handed the current administration a turn-key system of oppression. The current administration is also safe in the knowledge that even if they start illegal wars, even if they engage in mass-surveillance on a global scale, even if they murder and torture, then the next Democratic administration, the one that is protesting loudly now, will do nothing to punish them once they get voted back into power.</p>
<p>I know this is not what people want to hear but it is reality, so please consider the facts before you react to me reflexively or defensively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are wondering if Trump can be impeached if his Executive Order regarding refugees is declared unconstitutional, the answer is &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>Likewise if Congress passes laws that are later declared unconstitutional, the members of Congress who passed or drafted that law are not criminals for having drafted and passed an unconstitutional law.</p>
<p>The Constitution grants certain rights to people by forbidding <em>the government</em> (not individual people) from infringing upon those rights, with language such as &quot;Congress shall make no law&quot; and &quot;no State shall&quot; and &quot;shall not be denied or abridged by the United States.&quot; The Constitution places limits on the actions of the government, not individual people.</p>
<p>The remedy for a law or executive order that is declared unconstitutional is to strike down that law or order, not to criminally charge the people who passed it or issued it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
