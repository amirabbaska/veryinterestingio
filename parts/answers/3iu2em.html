		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Their activies are tolerated because they are organized and don't mess with the government. A lot of times Yazkuza are part of the system where they operate. They protect local businesses for money in return. Sometimes even give homeless jobs. And because the Yakuza is so big it isn't possible to suddenly just arrest everyone. The Yakuza leaders are smart while the people that get arrested are the low level thugs that usually do stupid shit like be drunk in public and get all the dirty work. Also recently Olympus (camera company) had a scandal in which their president was dealing with the Yakuza. Basically Yakuza is behind the scenes doing a bunch illegal stuff but aren't doing enough to the point where it will lead to the government to crack down hard on them.<br><br>To elaborate on the homeless job part, there was news that Yakuza would go around telling homeless people they had jobs paying pretty high per hour but without giving much detail on where. What they were actually getting hired to do was dangerous work of cleaning up toxic waste around Fukushima. Basically Yakuza are also being used by corrupt companies as well to do dirty work while let the company look innocent and are closely connected with the big name companies.<br><br>Also the recruiting process is usually like this. They have people going around and if you look like the type they may ask you if you want money for work. Once you join though it's hard to get out. The thugs that do the low work also get punished by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yubitsume" target="_blank">Yubuitsume</a> which is usually getting the tip of your pinky cut off. However walking in the streets you won't notice them unless you're actively looking to join a gang.<br><br>To elaborate on how to tell who is Yakuza they usually have big colorful tattoos. depending on the tattoo drawn and its size on the back you can tell who is higher rank. Tattoos are really taboo in Japan and a lot of times onsens (bath houses) ban people with very large tattoos to avoid yakuza messing around. So sometimes foreigners face this too. <br>edit: my comment seems like I'm defending Yakuza. I'm not, just giving reasons why the government is preferring to not do anything and let them continue their work. In reality Yakuza are fucking scum that take advantage of those weaker than them by using intimidation. While Yakuza does things to get community's support like lets say raising money that is just propaganda. They don't give a shit about you and do stuff like that so they can run without people saying anything.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>When I was in Japan I had a brief, weird, but all around pleasant experience with the Yakuza. I wanted to go to a Pachinko parlor. A friend I had made there told me that Pachinko was actually illegal where we were, but you could go to one of the Yakuza owned ones. This kinda freaked me out, but he assured me it was fine. <br><br>The Pachinko place was huge; it was four stories tall, completely lined with machines. Although that's not actually uncommon. We played for a few hour and I got two jackpots, landing me a stack of bins filled with Pachinko balls. I took them to the attendant for a prize. She presented me with a plastic container, and inside was some jewelry. Really, really shitty jewelry, like the kind you get in a 25 cent capsule dispenser. One of them was a single metal starfish earring.<br><br>Disappointed and confused, I asked if there was anything else. I'd spend 30,000 yen at the machines, this didn't seem fair. The attendant didn't speak english, but she gave me a knowing and sympathetic smile. My friend came up and told me it was fine, just pick one. I got two of the starfish and a shitty cookie. Then my friend took me outside and explained to me that in order to avoid the government cracking down on the Yakuza for running an illegal gambling operation (because that's what Pachinko is) they keep their payout center separate from the Pachinko parlor. We go across the street to an unmarked door, manned by a guy in a suit (no cool sunglasses though). He let us in, and we went up a flight of stairs to find a number of people behind bulletproof glass. Taped to the glass were little menus, with pictures of the jewelry I'd seen at the parlor, and even of the shitty cookie (I'm glad I didn't eat it)! I gave them my &quot;winnings&quot; and they &quot;bought them&quot; off of me for the amount appropriate to my winnings. All of this done without saying a word.<br><br>And that's my experience with illegal underground Yakuza gambling rings. :D</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Pretty much all mafias work like this. Yakuza is no exception.<br><br>They are &quot;tolerated&quot; because to convict someone you need to have evidence, and mafia a) is mostly involved in activities that leave little evidence in the first place(&quot;primary activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. Secondary activities may be practiced such as drug-trafficking, loan sharking, and fraud.&quot;), b) most of these activities also indict the people engaged so they are less likely to report them(i.e. if you want to report you bought drugs from the mafia you have to also convict yourself of <em>buying drugs</em>), c) when caught, people involved will usually deny any knowledge of mafia as a whole so you almost always nab the small fish while the bosses keep their hands clean, and e) they know who to bribe.<br><br>So even if police knows who the leader of a mafia is(and they often do), unless they have solid evidence linking him to the crimes of his underlings, there's nothing they can do about it.<br><br>Similarly, even if police knows that everyone with a diamond tattoo belongs to the local mafia, they cannot possibly arrest and convict someone of criminal activity just because they have a diamond tattoo. Nor they can catch one man with a diamond tattoo dealing drugs and arrest <em>everyone</em> with a diamond tattoo on the charge of dealing drugs.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>They have a 'legitimate face' to provide the public with. Anyone that gets caught is practically supposed to so the higher ups don't. They don't care much about the bottom line because the top is where the usable money comes from.<br><br>Imagine you want to steal a <del>pack of gum</del> bottle of liquor from the store. You could do it once and probably get away with it if you were good, right? Even if you were caught in the act, you'd try to get away and just never come back. But if you went in with a friend, had them knock over that rack of unsold wine to distract the store owners and then ran out with the bottle, you'd have the liquor and no one would notice. Meaning you could do it again.<br><br>Apply that same logic to the Yakuza. They take powerful people with a reputation and use them as tools to control specific markets, ranging from nearly corporate-level things to maybe a gas station or corner store. They use their lower ranks to do the work and then the highest ranks to cover it up in some way or another. Maybe they threaten a company with money/buying power and in return get discounted shares to flip for an easy profit. They can use that sort of business to further the lower grade crime such as human trafficking and drug sales, laundering their money. They don't necessarily need huge numbers claimed to be Yakuza or part of a specific syndicate/family to even function well seeing as they could use smaller gangs, groups and control them like pawns. There's a million things they could do and have done that you can't imagine, let alone throw in a post without being a part of a syndicate.<br><br>Not sure if that helps but the tl;dr is that they're not much different than what you expect. Japanese laws may be somewhat different but it's really just how they operate that makes them succeed at all. I find it elegant, in a slightly sickening way due to how deeply seeded they are into the East.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The idea is that a yakuza organization is a collection of worthless people. Their name even comes from a worthless hand in an old Japanese gambling game. They are seen as an extention of the historical protective / ruling bushi  (warrior) gangs that were part of the village but not of the daimyo.<br><br>They are tolerated if they follow the rules, and those rules include not harming people outside of the game. They traditionally organize vice and protection - basically the stuff everyone knows and accepts will occur - with the tacit approval of the local governments because they kick back to the government and cooperate with investigations to a degree. In other words they are all the rotten eggs in a stink proof basket.<br><br>The problem is that when the corruption spreads they'll get more power and intimidate corporate types and seduce straights into their vice instead of just catering to their desire for prostitution or drugs. I mean, who else can a wore go to for help where prostitution is technically illegal but in reality practiced openly? Only a criminal thug.<br><br>The other issue is that the bosses become untouchable. In a well run yakuza boss is investigated for a crime an innocent underling will confess to it and his family will be paid by the boss, or he'll be forgiven for a failing or promoted while serving time.<br><br>There are also a ton of cases of seriously evil bosses tossing down the sword and becoming a Buddhist monk, taking a vow of poverty, passing the torch to their lieutenant, confessing to a litany of crimes and being completely forgiven and allowed to live in peace and happiness at a monestary.<br><br>In other words the samurai aren't gone, they're just tattooed and curse a lot more.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I'm far from an expert, but this is something I recently looked up.<br><br>So, Japan has historically outlawed gambling. I believe they still prohibit it. Like any prohibition of something enough people want to do, illegal enterprise grows from it.<br><br>Say you like cake. Cake is however not allowed in your house because your parents consider it and other sugary foods unhealthy. So, one of your friends agrees at lunch in school to share some of their cake they brought with their lunch. Then, they start to share other snack foods you aren't allowed to have at home. This friend exploits this a little, and starts to charge you in some way. Money, favors, the chance to borrow your new video games, whatever. Now, despite this you and this friend still get along, and treat each other well enough to stay close. Plus, they are your source for sugary foods.<br><br>Well, you bring this friend home after school most days. Your parents know this friend gives you foods they don't approve of. They can only remind you of their rules, or perhaps punish you for breaking them. But, they aren't going to chastise your friend directly because they aren't your friend's parents. Perhaps they call this friend's parents to complain, but then it's up to <em>those</em> parents to decide how they react to their own child's behavior. They can at least send this friend home if they really cross the line giving you snack food and candy, or outright ban them from your house.<br><br>But the thing is, your parents don't want to just up and cut you off from your close friend over sugary food. They consider it more reasonable to just handle each infraction of their rule about sugary food separately in their own way, despite a systemic problem that will likely continue. You want sugary food. Your parents prohibit you from having it, making your demand and want for it so strong you are willing to risk crossing the line a little. Your friend makes it easy to get sugary food.<br><br>The yakuza are your friend. Gambling, and other vices like prostitution or drugs, are the sugary treats. Your parents are the government of Japan. The government has to consider the desire of their people, even if this desire is corrupt and manipulated. Influential people want illicit things too. The prohibited things are what the yakuza make money on, and what helped build them up in the first place. The government (your parents) respects the leadership of the yakuza (oyabun; your friend's parents) enough that they will only do so much to curb the illicit behavior, and will deal with yakuza members fairly. Your parents could theoretically go over to your friend's house and confront their parents directly. They could even get violent, theoretically. But over snack food?<br><br>It's considered more reasonable, or less problematic, to just find ways to deal with the individual issues than try and correct the systemic flaw. As long as the yakuza are able to find ways to profit from prohibited things, and stay organized and reasonable in their own way, AND if the government is interested in being seen as fair and reasonable, then the yakuza will continue. Many organized crime syndicates start and continue this way.<br><br>Edit: Clarified and proof read.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There will always be inefficiencies in any system.  That's how you make money in Capitalism, by exploiting inefficiencies.  When your laws make exploiting an inefficiency illegal (i.e. providing drugs, prostitutes, black market goods, etc.), that acts to limit the supply, not the demand.  The Japanese, having lived under strict feudal law for generations, developed an institutionalized method of dealing with unjust laws (and subsequently skirting the &quot;just&quot; laws as well).  The Yakuza also serves as a method of controlling the actions of what are known as Furyo (&quot;Not Good&quot;) individuals who would otherwise introduce chaos into society (as is frequently seen with America's shooting sprees and general mayhem).  Japan has a lot of buckets for catching the people who don't quite fit in, and the Yakuza are just one of those buckets.<br><br>Unlike American gangs, the yakuza don't want to tear the system down.  They are given a path to success and enfranchisement, and it will always remain in the best interests of the yakuza leaders to keep their Buka (same word used by Yakuza and legitimate businessmen for those working under you) from acting too badly.  If you were to start arresting all the yakuza leaders, you would see this careful system of control crumble and a substantial increase in chaos.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Simple.  They exist with blessing of the government, by keeping social order among the under class and control popular dissent.  They keep the street safe for non-yakuzas and often offer assistant to local businesses.  In return they get to make money running vice and protection scheme.  For a lot of Japanese paying the yakuza for protection is almost like a paying into a neighborhood association.  Many legit businesses prosper under the protection and blessing of the yakuza - Nintendo, for example, started out as a business basically printing gambling cards for the yakuza.  They do not involve civilians in violence, unless the said civilian crossed the line or tried to join them.  <br><br>They do recruit high school delinquents to a degree,  but often when the kids turn 20 they are given a chance to return to civilian life, often by taking them to the local police box and apologizing to the police.  If after Hatachi (Adult Ceremony) the kid still wanted join the thug life, they are officially initiated into the yakuza and there's really very little means of getting out.  <br><br>This is how Japanese government keep low crime rate and an overall non-violent social system - those with criminal intent are quickly absorbed into the rigid yakuza system, and many petty crimes are taken care of by the yakuza w/o ever reporting it to the police.   If you are a common criminal running around robbing people w/o the knowledge of the local yakuza, you will &quot;cease to be a problem&quot; rather quickly.<br><br>Some loves them, some hates them, every Japanese accept their existence as necessary in some fashion.   </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>In Japan, as with the Italian mafia, It all comes down to the source of the cash. Without the cash, these groups would dry up like the Quakers. <br><br>There are many economic environments which are either, (1) necessarily, outside the law (like drugs,) or, (2) which operate in an environment where the proper laws are insufficient to keep the industry &quot;honest&quot; and productive (like gambling,) or (3) which are ripe for exploitation by those willing to use force and bribery to gain an advantage (local gov. contracts, (hauling, port work, construction) unions, events,...) <br><br>All of these areas have organized crime involvement. That means they run by a different set of rules -- If you have a problem you do not call a lawyer or a cop, you call a &quot;boss&quot; and he does not serve a warrant, but a warning. <br><br>Protection money is one source of income, but I think generally a minor one. People do not like extortion and it results in a lot of violence against honest citizens and without the tolerance of the local population, none of these groups can survive. <br><br>In the US, certain businesses are controlled by the mob. They do not force people to use these businesses because that would be bad PR. Instead, they discourage competitors from entering their market. It is easier to stop one guy from importing a foodstuff from Italy than it is to stop 1,000 supermarkets from buying from the competitor.<br><br>Another example - In Japan, every town has seasonal street fairs with itinerant vendors operating booths. Same as in US, although I think much more of a rip off (cotton candy usually costs about 500yen, or $4.00). These are unsavoury people and  the local organizers want to know they are not inviting crime into their town, so they contract with group that can insure the security of the event. The group makes money off the town, and the vendors. It is very lucrative. <br><br>Same with construction - Trump made a name for himself as being willing to pay off the right people to get construction done in NYC. Without the right payments, and cement would never show up, or unions would strike, or steel would be delayed,... and the buildings would take twice as long to build.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Yakuza is a mafia. Reasons they are tolerated is because of the services they supply. With the Yakuza different families control different parts of the country. These families will control the crimes in their areas. They make money from everything legal and illegal, people are paid or told to look the other way often. Only time they will go to jail is when they cause a big problem or they are told it is in the interest of the family that they go to jail. <br><br>The split is being caused by United States of America and the FBI. United states of America has put the Japanese government under pressure to be more like America. All legal Yakuza business's are under attack and quite a few have to sell them off to a shell company. All the attacks cause time and money. When you start to lose money you will start to lose followers. Loss of money is what is driving this split. One thing most people do not understand is that the Mafia controls crime. With the split crime will increase, then there will be a limited war for control of certain area's. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

They, however, are not who the Yakuza of today associate themselves with...it was their opposition that they associate themselves with.  The youth of the town who stood up to the ronin are who they claim.  They were called the machi-yakko (servants of the town) and they stood up to the hamamato-yakko (servants of the shogun).  By the time it became a modern crime syndicate this folk hero status was already ingrained into many aspects of japanese life.  It was only later that the sentiment would change.<br><br>&quot;Yakuza&quot; by Kaplan and Dubro is probably the preeminent book on the subject.<br><br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The split is within a specific gumi, or group.  There are multiple groups and all sorts of politics that go along with that.  The Yakuza operate incredibly openly and are basically tolerated by the police. (Where I lived in Japan there was a grey building with no windows in between the big shopping area and the bar and nightclub area.  The front was covered in security cameras and there were always 2-4 thugs in yakuza 'uniform' - pretty much everyone in japan wears a uniform- hanging around out front)<br><br>Basically they are seen as a stabilizing force- they bring in the drugs, but they keep the pushers off the streets.  Some groups will refuse to sell drugs to minors.  They run prostitution and gambling (gambling being the traditional income for yakuza) but they keep them off the streets and for the most part traffic in sex slaves from other parts of Asia so it isn't Japanese women who are being prostituted.<br><br>The police would regularly release incredibly detailed reports about the Yakuza activity, membership etc.  They know who these people are, and my guess is that they get the information reported to them directly from the yakuza.  Some yakuza groups even used to publish their own newsletter.  Some festivals the local yakuza would participate and you'd see guys walking around, nearly naked, covered in tattoos.  My first neighbor was an old chinpira (low level thug) who could only count to 8 on his fingers, and still worked a construction day job.  But I've heard they don't take fingers much any more and would rather impose large fines on members.  <br><br> As long as the yakuza doesn't make the police LOOK bad, the police couldn't give a shit.  I've even heard rumors that the police will occasionally go to the yakuza and demand that they provide someone to convict for a crime. The yakuza would select a low level thug to go down to the police station and confess. The police get to look good, the yakuza keeps making money and everyone stays happy.<br><br>My guess with the expected split there is going to be instability and fighting over territory.  While the official body count will be low, it will still upset the average citizen's perception of Japan being a safe, orderly country.  This will embarrass the police and government which might lead to them actually moving against the yakuza, at least in show, which will create more chaos in the public eye.  I'm sure the yakuza members involved are aware that keeping this out of the public domain as much as possible is in their best interests.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I was a hostess in Japan for awhile. The club where I worked had yakuza connections. Anyway, several yakuza bosses would come in and nobody ever had to tell you who they were- you KNEW. They were dressed impeccably, with perfectly tailored suits and an aura of quiet authority that filled the room. They also came in with a small posse of well-dressed henchmen who took care of all monetary transaction and other requests for them. Once, on my birthday, a yakuza boss took me and another girl(his &quot;friend&quot; asked us if we would go with them)to a transvestite club in the same building. We had a blast! They put on funny shows and the &quot;friend&quot; gave us each a pile of ichemons(around $100 USD)to tip all the &quot;ladies&quot; with when they finished their performances and we drank Dom Perignon and it was really fun. The big boss never spoke to us. He didn't speak very good English so his friend spoke for him. He then gave us 3 ichemons for &quot;taxi money&quot;.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Well, for starters, japanese government and media doesn't ever speak about Yakuza. They just address these organizations as criminal groups, which might well be a generalization that mixes common mob with the real yakuza.<br><br>In second place, Yakuza don't see themselves as criminal organizations, but instead as chivalry/knighthood orders, preserving loyalty and honoring their oaths with their life if needed. So their reason to exist isn't to cause mayhem, deal drugs, prostitution and gambling. These activities might be related to Yakuza organically, but not structurally. <br><br>Third, they are organized in a few meta clans, but each of them is in turn organized in dozen or hundreds local chapters and clans, and each one of them has thousands of members. You might know who's the oyabun of a main clan, but even if you had something to charge him with, the underlying organization is too diversified to be just shut down.<br><br>Lastly, Yakuza operate worldwide. There are more yakuza members in the world than any other ethnic related mob. The italian mafia, russian bratva and mexican cartels togheter have less members than yakuza does. This doesn't mean they generate less income, it's just about sheer numbers.<br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Yakuza are not &quot;that&quot; tolerated. Plenty of places such as bathhouses, hotels are forbidden to tatooed people (not the average hispter mind you, its specifically for Yakuza). They have their own places. One of the reasons why the Police look the other way is because in the Japanese culture they are fulfilling what is seen as a role/niche. Namely keeping in line the underworld and fighting other organized crimes (Chinese, Russian, especially). Remember CIA used the Yakuza as secret police back in the 60's for commies counterinsurgency  (like Mafia). This very relative tolerance goes with an implicit agreement: If a Yakuza killed someone, he is expected to surrender to the Police. It don't always happen, but the following crackdown from the Police will be harsch if the criminal don't surrender. Jail term conditions for Yakuza are notoriously easier than common criminal. Its basically a career hasard and the repression is considered useless.<br><br>Also: The very cultured smart, intelligent educated Yakuza is like the Opera-fan Capi. Its a cliche. Like mafia capos, most Yakuza are high school bullies who found a job. They are pretty uneducated and rude. But you got to be to keep the street.<br><br>Yakuza are considered a lesser evil than chaos and petty uncontrolled street crimes like in USA. Crimes figures seems to agree with this view.

These guys aren't hitmen or bank robbers. They're extortionists, embezzelers, and smugglers. The average everyday working class individual has almost no reason to be afraid of the Yakuza, so nobody goes out of their way to paint a target on themselves and call them out on their misdeeds.<br><br>To go a step further, the Yakuza have many layers of defense. First, the leaders are never directly connected to any potential crimes, so they can never be implicated or charged with anything. The small fry's take the blame and serve a small prison sentence, they don't rat out their boss, and they get compensated when they get out. Second, the Yakuza are in the pockets of some of the most influential Japanese politicians and law enforcement officials, and bribery is an extremely effective tool that they don't hesitate to use.<br><br>You also have to understand the social and cultural differences between Japan and other western nations. Even though a Yakuza boss is a criminal, they present themselves and honorable individuals and take an active role in helping their communities. It's hard to dislike someone who made a fortune off of minor criminal misconduct, who then turns around and uses his money to build a school and asks for nothing in return.<br><br>It's an interesting social dynamic that basically boils down to &quot;We could go after them, but it won't do any good so why bother?&quot;. That's how they've been able to survive as long as they have with such a notorious reputation.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I've actually dined at the Yatai (outdoor food stalls) in Nakasu (red light district) in Fukuoka that is very Yakuza heavy in presence. When I told people in Tokyo that I went there even though there were more Yakuza in numbers in Tokyo, they all seemed pretty shocked as if I went and walked casually in say Oakland, CA. Sitting there, I'm pretty sure I chatted in my limited Japanese and shared food with some Yakuza members. In addition, I'm also sure that some of the stalls receive &quot;protection&quot; or under the influence of the Yakuza as well. They all seemed pretty nice (Yatai workers and customers that seemed to be associated with the Yakuza) as I told them I was American even though I'm of Asian descent which probably allowed them to open up to me more easier, in addition to having a positive impression of Americans being &quot;cool&quot;. At most, the owners of the Yatai might keep asking you to dine at their stall but you could just walk on by.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>when I was living in living in Japan in a rough part of east Tokyo it was explained as there were two different types of Yakuza, Local Yakuza and Business Yakuza. Generally, the local Yakuza don't bother anyone and just run gambling, prostitution and other local illicit activities. Basically the local population don't deal with the Yakuza unless they look for those activities and know not to mess with them. This is on a neighborhood level. I actually lived across the street from a Yakuza boss (you can tell from the big house) and he was surprisingly pleasant to all his neighbors. On the other hand the &quot;Business&quot; Yakuza run massive corporations and are ruthless to anyone that crosses them. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>All the comments characterizing the Yakuza as racketeers are pretty good. At the risk of not being an ELI5 I'll recommend that if you want to know more read the reportage by Jake Adelstein (and his book Tokyo Vice, and the upcoming movie with Daniel Radcliffe starring as him). Adelstein is a gaijin who went to Japan for college in his late teens, and then became a journalist who specializes in investigating the Yakuza, especially Yamaguchigumi. He's an excellent writer, easy and fun to read, and utterly defiant of the Yakuza. You can read his shorter pieces linked from his tweets, or get the book. As an outsider he has a unique perspective and that status gives him access that he takes advantage of.<br><br>twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/jakeadelstein" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/jakeadelstein</a><br>about.me: <a href="https://about.me/jakeadelstein" target="_blank">https://about.me/jakeadelstein</a></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
