		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sounds like we have some circumstantial data and solid math supporting its existence, but no actual observations of the planet: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have pretty good constraints on its orbit,” Dr. Brown said. “What we don’t know is where it is in its orbit, which is too bad.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Is our next step to actually figure out where it is? Given its extremely large orbit, what are some observation techniques applicable for the kinds of distances we're talking about? </p>
<p>If that's not our next step, what is? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Theoretically, what would be the maximum distance an object could orbit the sun before gravity is no longer strong enough to allow for a repeating orbit? And to add, is there a minimum or maximum mass that object would have to be?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
