		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few people have explained some ways computers can actually become slower.</p>
<p>The other side of this though is that computers often only <em>appear</em> to be slower because the applications they're running become bigger.</p>
<p>Part of this is due to natural progression of software. But a lot of it is down to software consuming a lot more processing power and memory space to do the same thing. Go back 30-40 years, programmers had to come up with a lot of clever tricks to make a program that not only worked, but worked within the much narrower confines of the available hardware. Even a very basic word processing application, you have to use a lot of tricks to make that work with a 3MHz CPU and 64KB of memory. When you have 3GHz CPU and 64GB of memory, your code doesn't have to be nearly as efficient... and in reality, a lot of programs aren't as efficient as they used to be, because they simply don't need to be.</p>
<p>You can really see this happening with games in particular. PC games in the early 90s only a few dozen MB worth of hard drive space, and required maybe a couple MB of RAM. And yet a lot of retro style games on Steam, with the same level of graphics and sound, and similar levels of content, might take several hundred MB, or even GB of hard drive space, and require at least a GB of RAM.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Just to clarify one thing, this isn't necessarily a bad thing. Its not like the current generation of software developers are bunch of lazy good for nothing kids or something. 30-40 years ago, making your code efficient as possible was a high priority because the hardware demanded it. Nowadays, it doesn't. Time spent trimming a bunch of fat from your code is generally better spent working to add new functionality or extending an application to new platforms. You could make your code super efficient, but it's not going to make a noticeable difference for users compared to code that is simply adequately efficient. The application having new functionality or working on a new platform is noticeable to users though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple phenomena that cause computers themselves (the hardware) to slow down:</p>
<ol>
<li>If the fans fail, or the computer gets clogged up with dust, the computer won't cool as well. The CPU will scale itself down to keep itself from overheating. This can affect just about everything you do on your computer.</li>
<li>Solid-state storage (e.g., SSD, MMC) can get slower through heavy use. This is less of a problem now than it was 5 or 10 years ago and probably won't affect most people too much, but can't be ignored.</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to hardware problems, there can be software problems, especially for (sorry to single you out) Windows users. Contrary to what seems to be popular belief, how much software or how much data you have installed on your computer has nothing to do with how slow it is. However, how many services you have running (not just installed, but running) makes a difference. The software ecosystem for Windows in particular makes it very easy to have a tonne of garbage/crap running. Other operating systems can be affected, too, but it seems to happen to a much greater extent for Windows users.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hardware-wise, they don't. There are different reasons why they seem to slow down:</p>
<ol>
<li>Operating systems, software and websites become more complex. This is an ongoing process everywhere, and with every update to a more &quot;modern&quot; look and feel or the introduction of new features, more resources are needed. Most operating systems and software claim to improve performance with every update, but that's often just not true or is canceled out by newly introduced features.</li>
<li>They get cluttered over time. When you install software (or updates) every now and then, there might be more background services running every time, and the file systems hold more files. This is why a computer seems (and actually is) faster again when you format the drive and re-install the operating system with a minimal set of software. This depends a bit on the operating system. Microsoft Windows tends to clutter itself over time (fragmenting file system, poor cleanup mechanisms) more than Macs or Linux/UNIX do.</li>
<li>It's a psychological thing. Devices around said computer get faster, the internet gets faster, and compared to that the computer seems to get slower and slower.</li>
</ol>
<p>This applies for the typical home or work computer. When you look at machines dedicated for a specific use that run a limited set of software with only occasional patches they don't get cluttered this much and don't get slower noticeably. Servers are a good example for this, they often run many years with the very same performance.</p>
<p>There might be factors that actually slow down the computer, like aging hardware. E.g. if a hard drive has to deal with an increasing count of unusable sectors or if a CPU has to slow down because of decreasing heat management efficiency. But I'm sure that's the exception for most computers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
