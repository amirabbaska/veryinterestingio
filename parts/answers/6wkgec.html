		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People aren't as careful as they ought to be when they use the term 'entanglement', and tend to conflate 'entangled' with 'maximally entangled'.</p>
<p>Maximal entanglement can only happen with pairs of particles.  This is called &quot;monogamy of entanglement.&quot;</p>
<p>Non-maximal entanglement can involve a large number of particles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For three particles, two interesting and different way you can entangle them with each other is in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenberger%E2%80%93Horne%E2%80%93Zeilinger_state" target="_blank">GHZ state</a> and in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_state" target="_blank">W-state</a>. But as mentioned elsewhere, all kinds of different entanglements are possible for any number of particles.</p>
<p>In condensed matter physics, we are very interested in phases of matter where the entanglement is long-ranged, meaning even though you have some enormous (~10^(23)) number of particles, they all share some sort of entanglement with each other, even at &quot;far&quot; distances microscopically. So yes, you can have way more than a million particles entangled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
