<p>I have had a very tough time trying to convince people to move away from Jet. I even got reviewers complaining that Viridis has not enough contrast and that it shouldn't be used. How do you manage to convince the (often older) people who are reluctant to switch to more linear colormaps? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Question - Did you consider blue-yellow colorblindness in generating Cividis, or just red-green (which is more common). I imagine the same optimization process would work to generate a blue-yellow robust map.</p>
<p>A correction - I believe recent literature has shown sensitivity to more gradiations in grayscale than the thirty you report in the paper <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=2750996179177269393&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=5,33&amp;sciodt=0,33" target="_blank">source</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
