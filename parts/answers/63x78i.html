		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Fijian and Tongan iguanas form a genus of their own, <em>Brachylophus</em>, which is a part of the Iguaninae (also containing marine iguanas, spinytail iguanas, green iguanas, and others). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain their isolation. The most widely followed one involves rafting from the Americas. It is not unthinkable that iguanas would be able to raft for such long distances; they possess nasal salt glands and also thick skin. </p>
<p>Where exactly in the Americas they actually originated from is hard to determine. Interestingly, morphologically <em>Brachylophus</em> is more similar to the likewise arboreal <em>Iguana</em> than other island-dwelling iguanas like <em>Cyclura</em> and <em>Ctenosaura</em>, which tend to be ground-dwellers. <em>Iguana</em> is incidentally relatively widespread in South America. It remains possible that <em>Brachylophus</em> diverged from the latter through some ancestral population around Mexico or the Isthmus of Panama.</p>
<p>Like <em>Brachylophus</em>, the red mangrove <em>Rhizophora mangle</em> is known from Fiji and Tonga (and also Galapagos), but basically nowhere else in the Pacific. Interestingly, it forms a large part of the diet of <em>Cyclura</em>. <em>Iguana</em> and <em>Brachylophus</em> eat it too. Certainly suggestive that <em>Rhizophora</em> may have played a role in the dispersal of <em>Brachylophus</em>.</p>

Look at this map and consider that for tens of thousands of years prior to the end of the last ice age, sea level was more than 300 feet lower than it is now. There would have been a line of islands providing a route that many species could have taken to cross the pacific, including humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I looked into it a bit and seems like scientists were able to trace back the lineage of these iguanas on Tonga and Fiji to over 60 million years of isolation from common ancestors. If this is the case, the iguanas could have walked when there were still connected land masses. On mobile so I won't link right now to the article.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just watched a documentary about this. I believe they said Sri Lanka or America was the most likely origin, with Typhoons probably aiding in the distance thing. The Typhoons also create floating debris which was probably safer passage. The floating debris were sometimes rather big, housing a few animals in the process. Bugs probably helped feed their diet, but I'm not sure how long that trip could've been - they could've perhaps survived the entire journey without eating (granted it wasn't a long voyage.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Genetically speaking, do the iguanas on Fiji and Tonga have any commonalities with the American iguanas? If there are commonalities, perhaps they share a common ancestor that existed millions of years ago, before the separation of land masses that we see nowadays.</p>
<p>That being said, this question sounds like it was asked by a creationist... not that it matters (it's still a good question).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
