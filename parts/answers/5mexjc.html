		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a similar vein is a feeling known as &quot;the call of the void&quot;. It's that uncomfortable urge you get to jump when you near the edge of a tall building, or that super weird image that pops into your head of stabbing someone with the big knife laying on the table. There are several theories, but the one that makes the most sense to me is that it is an evolutionary safety mechanism. By calling these disturbing images to the forefront of your conscious mind, your subconscious is keeping you alert and aware of potential environmental dangers. The urge to jump from the building makes you hyper aware of the edge you are near. The image of stabbing people is your brain's fucked-up way of saying &quot;Sharp thing over there! Don't get careless!&quot; The urge to bite or squeeze a small, cute thing may be evolution's messed up way of calling attention to the fragility of those cute things. We get a weird urge to squeeze babies and kittens to death, but (at least for most normal folks) this urge is followed immediately by a feeling of distaste or disgust at our own thoughts - our brains have successfully alerted us to the fact that this tiny young thing is delicate and needs protection...and has done so in a super fucked up way because nature is terrifying.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Good smelling and cute looking babies also stimulate the reward part of the brain, which makes you want to bite things.</p>
<p>Another idea is that playful biting is a way for animals to show trust.</p>
