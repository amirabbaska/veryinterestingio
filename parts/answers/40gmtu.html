		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your cell phone runs at about 2.4-5.9ghz.</p>
<p>Your light bulb runs at about 400-700THz.</p>
<p>So your light bulbs in your house are far far closer to giving you cancer than wifi.</p>
<p>Ionizing radiation that can give you cancer starts around  750THz but our skin blocks it until around 1PHz (1000 THz) which is UVB.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long time lurker, first time poster. I haven't seen a proper ELI5 answer yet. The simple answer is that the waves are too big to cause damage to the little machinery of the cells and, perhaps more importantly, the DNA. Smaller wavelengths (higher frequencies than those allowed in WiFi, cell phones, etc.) can be ionizing as they are small enough to knock out a screw (electron) that has the potential to break the machinery in the cell and or DNA. But, as this is not the case with WiFi etc, the only way for damage to occur to humans is to pump so much power into them that they overheat the machinery which causes breakdowns in the cells when the body can't cool them fast enough. This second scenario will never happen. The FCC has very stringent regulations in this regard to prevent it from happening and many other things would go wrong before damage to humans would occur. </p>
<p>As a side note, even screws that get knocked out by smaller waves (electrons by ionizing radiation) are even necessarily harmful as the body has methods for fixing such problems and &quot;putting the screws back&quot; if you will. Also, fear of this radiation is almost entirely unfounded, but that is a discussion for another post.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll address the Wifi part, as that's what I've looked into.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wifi operates in either the 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz spectrum.</li>
<li>
<p>Your home router puts out somewhere between 100 mW (milliwats, or 20dBm) to 400 mW.</p>
</li>
<li>Water &quot;resonates&quot; at 2.45Ghz. (more accurately, the too-heavy-on-one-side water molecule will respond and change position when you alternate the field)</li>
<li>The average home microwave operates at 2.45Ghz centered, but will waffle down to around 2.3Ghz or so (they're not super accurate, and do not need to be).</li>
<li>The average home microwave puts out around 1000 W (Watts).</li>
<li>
<p>There's no such thing as perfect shielding; 1-2 W escapes from your microwave.</p>
</li>
<li>From this perspective alone, you get more 2.4Ghz radiation when you microwave a cup of tea in the morning, than you would ever get from your Wifi router all day.</li>
<li>From this perspective alone, if you stand in view of a gigantic fusion reactor for a few minutes, you'll get more 2.4 Ghz radiation than your router would likely provide you in your entire life.  We call this state 'daytime' and 'going outside'.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people claim that WiFi signals do have an adverse effect on them however the general scientific conciseness is that this is a placebo effect. There have been many clinical tests on the effects of WiFi on people that support this finding, however my favorite was a study done exclusively with people who claimed to feel adverse effects from WiFi. They were put in a room with a WiFi router rigged to turn its lights on and off independently of weather it was actually broadcasting a signal or not. The people in the study would claim to feel the effects of the WiFi whenever the lights were on even when the router was not broadcasting any WiFi. Furthermore the subjects felt no effects when the router was broadcasting without its lights announcing that it was doing so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
