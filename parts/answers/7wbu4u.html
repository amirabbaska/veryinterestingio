		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your nerve fibers are made of permanent cells, meaning that they can't really grow and they can't really spread out. So your actually nerve roots will remain fairly constant. However your body may manufacture more nerve receptors (free nerve endings, pacinian corpuscles, ect) for additional feedback in the skin. I could not find any reliable 2 point discrimination tests on obese vs non-obese people. However I can tell you obese people often have diseases that complicate feeling and perception, for example diabetes and cardiovascular and respiratory disease make the lower extremity circulation very poor; which in turn makes feeling very poor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a test to gauge the sensitivity of skin called ‘two point discrimination’. It involves using calipers to determine how narrow a gap the body can still distinguish two seperate points of contact. The gap is quite large on your torso, where you don’t need the high fidelity information, and it is quite small in areas like your face and hands. </p>
<p>At a guess I’d say that the nerves spread out as the abdomen expands, because there are only so many nerves that lead to the same brain area. </p>
<p>That said, it’s possible to train certain parts of your body to have more accurate sensation with practise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
