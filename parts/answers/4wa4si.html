		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The US Military operates under a brilliant piece of legislation passed in the 80s called Goldwater Nichols. GN completely stream lined the chain of command and arguably solved a problem dating back to the Romans: getting the Army and Navy to talk to each other... </p>
<p>Under GN, each branch of the US Military (Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marines) became known as a &quot;Force Provider&quot;. Their job is to 'recruit train and equip' military forces. Prior to GN each branch also had operational responsibility too. This worked (kinda) fine for big wars like WW2, but as wars have gotten smaller and more integrated (meaning the Sergeant in the tank needs to be able to talk directly with the pilot in the F-16 overhead), the old arrangement wasn't working. The most high profile example of this was the attempted rescue of the hostages in Iran where each branch blamed the other for failure. Post GN, the head of each branch (who's also a member of the Joint Chiefs) lost command authority over their forces. Individually each Service Chief is responsible for administration, and as a body the Joint Chiefs are an advisory board to the President and Secretary of Defense. GN also enhanced the power of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs to oversee it. </p>
<p>GN's biggest change was the creation of a streamlined and separate operational chain of command. Reporting directly to the Secretary of Defense are 4 star Generals and Admirals who are Combatant Commanders. The responsibility of each CoCom is governed by a document published by the Defense Department called the Unified Command Plan. The UCP and the Commands it creates aren't new to GN, but they each reported to a different Joint Chief and were heavily biased towards one branch (good luck being an Army unit assigned to the Navy controlled Pacific Command before GN). In addition to making each CoCom report directly to the Secretary of Defense, GN also required that the Officers given Command of a CoCom have a resume filled with Joint assignments. If you're an Army General who's never served on a Joint Staff, led a Joint Task Force, or been trained in Joint Operations, you won't be allowed to command a CoCom. The goal is to create CoComs that are neutral in terms of who Commands them (an Admiral in charge of a ground war in Europe wouldn't blink an eye today, pre GN though it be unthinkable). </p>
<p>Today there are 9 CoComs, 3 functional and 6 regional. The Functional CoComs are US Transportation Command (moving people and stuff from one part of the globe to the other by air sea and land), US Strategic Command (nukes, cyberspace, and space assets), and US Special Operation Command (which acts more like a service branch, it administers everything from Army Rangers to Navy Seals making sure they all play nicely). The 6 regional CoComs are US North Command (homeland defense), Southern Command (South America), US European Command (doubles as NATO Supreme Allied Commander), US Africa Command, US Pacific Command (biggest in terms of Area of Responsibility), and US Central Command (the Middle East). Each branch of the military is responsible for providing each CoCom with a Service Component Command. US Central Command's service components are the 3rd Army, 9th Air Force, 5th Fleet, Marine Forces Central, and Special Operations Command Central. Each Service Component Command can, if needed, serve as the foundation for a Joint Task Force (US Africa Command's 6th Fleet was made into a Joint Task Force to bomb Libya), or to service as a Joint Functional Component Command. 3rd Army is the Joint Land Component Commander, leading all Army and Marine ground forces. 9th Air Force is the Joint Air Component Commander controlling (kinda) all air units, whether it be Air Force, Navy, or Marine squadrons. 5th Fleet is the Joint Maritime Component Commander responsible for all Navy, seaborne Marines, and Coast Guard units. The Joint Functional Commanders report to the Joint Force Commander, who's either a Joint Task Force Commander under the CoCom for a specific operation (bombing ISIS), or the CoCom himself. Despite cool names like 3rd Army, most CoComs don't have permanent forces assigned to them, they are Headquarters units able to command massive forces, if needed. If 5th Fleet needs 5 Carrier Strike Groups, it's Central Command's job to request it, the Secretary of Defense's job to approve it (under the advice of the Joint Chiefs and President's consent), and the Navy's job to have forces ready to send. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think some folks haven't really answered your question with any clarity.  They have gone over something called the chain of command, i.e. A Major gets his orders from a higher rank like Lt.Col or Col. and then disseminates it to his lower ranking Captain etc.  Each branch has one.  Your question about who sets up who, when, where, why is much more complicated.  I'll try to give a simple example of how aviation would support the ground.  We have something called Command and Control (C2) and different agencies (Aircraft wings and supporting elements have compartmentalized cells dedicated to certain functions.  So as planning is underway, the top ranking general will set out and say &quot;this is what I want to happen&quot;.  Obviously Generals will be more detailed as you can expect that they are highly trained and intelligent in the art of war.  Then:</p>
<p>Ground Commanders:  Will evaluate their assets (number of troops, equipment, capability, supporting ground elements, how they will move [on foot, by plane, helo, trucks, etc] etc) and formulate a plan to fulfill the Commanders expectation. Again, this example is very basic, I can try to answer any questions.  </p>
<p>Air Commanders:  Will have their squadrons of fixed wing (think fighters/bombers/tankers and cargo), helicopters (both attack/transport), and supporting agencies that will most likely integrate all of these.  They will then asses their assets and formulate what they can do and try to align it all to the ground guys.  </p>
<p>Ground and Air guys talk, fight, fuss and then come to a conclusion of how it will go down with what they have and the expectation laid out for them.  This will go to the highest ranking General again, any and all changes are smoothed out and you have a plan.  </p>
<p>Intelligence plays a huge role.  That's the fine details and the nitty gritty of the who, what, where, when.  These intelligence cells (each agency or group has them:  Ground, Air, etc.) will list out where the known enemy is, their capabilities, when they were there, how they got there etc.  This is all taken in and analyzed.  Intelligence cells can more or less cause an &quot;audible&quot; with the information they receive as the offensive kicks off but each group (ground and air) has sever subsections of commanders who will get that audible and work to make the play happen while keeping with the end goal of the main commanders intent.  All in all, intel gives you the who, what, where, when before, during, and in the future of all operations.  </p>
<p>Now you may ask, &quot;how does ALLLLLLL this information get to everybody accurately?&quot;.  This is a good question, this comes back to C2.  There are dozens of programs and platforms that are all interconnected with one another so that information is passed in a timely, accurate and effective manner.  </p>
<p>Example:  </p>
<p>Ground guys:  &quot;We're being shot at.  We need a helicopter to come shoot the bad guys. HELP.&quot;  This request will go to one of their ground agencies where they will use radios, chat (think IRC), and various other C2 programs that track location and such and this will go to the air guys.</p>
<p>Air Guys:  They will receive that request for help and more or less say &quot;I got you fam&quot; or &quot;I don't got you fam, we have no planes&quot;.  This will use the C2 programs or radios and go to the right agency.  Then once it gets to say, an attack helicopter squadron, these guys will take off and go or if they are already in the air, divert to that location.  They will prosecute the targets and come home.  This is all attributed to the communication used with C2.  Basically think of C2 as several wizards of oz working behind a curtain making sure all info, locations, requests, updates, etc get to the right people at the right time.  </p>
<p>You can apply this to artillery, more ground support, you name it.  C2 makes the world go round.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In reality, its a massive chain. </p>
<p>There will be a few people at the top who are in charge of overall strategy. In recent conflicts, this probably includes members of the local government (afghan/iraqi).</p>
<p>From there, responsibility cascades down, with people at various levels having a certain remit to command within. The officer in charge of a region within a province in Afghanistan will likely have a certain level of discretion in how he wants to manage force projection. </p>
<p>The actual day to day movement is done by officers in charge on the ground - this is the only way to have a large force be very effective and responsive against a guerrilla style enemy (for a somewhat related example, see Battle of the Somme, for the issue in micromanagement of troops).</p>
<p>They will set frequency of patrols, rough routes etc, and will have some oversight from their direct boss, who will ensure they are keeping within the bounds they are set.</p>
<p>It is quite complicated in reality, as you have not just one strategy. You have the 2/3 branches of your armed forces, foreign forces, local actors, and those in neighboring regions who may interact with you.</p>
<p>It probably helps to think of it like a typical company - you have board of directors, who might be all the commanders of the interested armed groups co-coordinating together. They hammer out a broad strategy, and each passes on the relevant parts to their organisation. </p>
<p>Senior people are given areas of responsibility, and have some discretion as to how they meet those requirements - e.g. The objective may be Control and hold Helmand province. The commander can choose to do that in several ways - do I launch an assault on Taliban areas, do I go for creeping expansion of our control zone etc?</p>
<p>They would then task their subordinates to prepare for such an assault - they would then decide on times and dates, areas of priority, likely routes of assault etc. They would then task those on the ground to a) do recce work on the target to inform decision making, and b) get the status of troops so they can co-ordinate what movements needs to be made from other areas etc.</p>
<p>You then have the officer in charge of say a regiment on the ground. He will be told of the above, and be responsible for ensuring equipment is all in order, sufficient provisions and man power are in place, that troop commanders are up to speed with the area etc.</p>
<p>The troop commanders will then be responsible for co-ordinating their unit of 30 or so men, again ensuring preparations are under way etc. </p>
<p>The overall strategy for the attack will be set by the middle management type level, who will then tell regimental commanders on the ground. The regiment commander will be told 'your men will assault compound X as first move of the assault, and you will provide one unit of overwatch for the assault by regiment Y on compound Z'.</p>
<p>The regiment commander will divide up his troop commanders giving them these tasks.</p>
<p>The troop commander and troop NCOs will prepare orders detailing the exact route of assault etc, and then brief section commanders (junior NCOs at the rank of corporal).</p>
<p>At each stage, people have flexibility to tailor their response within the remit they are given. </p>
<p>As an aside, this cascading decision making is very important in creating a flexible military. At every stage, people are truely leaders, not just people delegated responsibility to carry out a plan - it is also why better militaries see higher rates of deaths amongst junior NCOs and officers compared to privates. Your junior commanders are in the thick of it, making key tactical decisions in real time - not some fat old guy on the end of a phone.</p>
<p>excuse poor grammar, as currently sitting on my phone on the train!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
