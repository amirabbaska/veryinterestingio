		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't answer your question as you're looking for exceptions, but ceremonial burial has been found as far back as Neanderthals nearly 300,000 years ago. The difficulty with your question is that it's much easier to find bodies that were buried in a particular way or with some sort of ceremony or meaning because those civilizations or pre-civilizations that <em>didn't</em> perform some sort of special funerary rites would have left very little evidence that they <em>didn't</em> do anything special with their dead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There's a lot of theorists, most prominently Ernest Becker in my field, who sees civilization primarily as a way of dealing with the terror of death.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spartan society didn't make much of a fuss about death, unless you were a man dying in battle, a king or a woman dying in childbirth you were not given a marked grave. All aspects of their culture geared them to never fear death, so it wasn't ever seen as a big deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about a South American tribe of native people that would pack up and move whole communities when some one died. They would leave the body where it was and just.... Leave. I can't remember for sure though but I remember thinking this would be a great idea for a culture that was probably susceptible to disease, as one might be in such a warm and wet environment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I seem to recall Zoroastrians leaving their dead out in these big amphitheater type of things, to be eaten by wild animals. Depending on your definition of &quot;honor their dead&quot; this may still qualify. I think they perceived death as just another thing that happens, and they were more disposing of bodies in a way that made sense to them. But they didn't cremate their dead or bury/entomb them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
