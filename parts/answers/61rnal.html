Instead they stick with premium goods at a high price. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hopefully someone will expand on this in greater detail because I'm on the toilet at work on mobile right now, but here goes. </p>
<p>IIRC German engineering grew into the powerhouse that it is today, following their defeat in WWII. One of the provisions within the Morgenthau &amp; Marshall Plans (basically a plan giving Germany the finger for being huge DB's during WWII, while trying to make sure they wouldn't ever be able to go for round III) was that Germany wouldn't be able to spend anything having to do with military operations or development. <em>Obviously this is a gross oversimplification, but I'm going off memory and I'm on the toilet so cut me some slack.</em> Consequently all of the engineers and businesses that had been part of the German war machine transitioned to private industries. Since the money that the German gov. had previously been spending on being dicks to all of Europe was now just laying around (not counting all the money they had to pay out for reparations), they decided to invest in domestic infrastructure. All of the aforementioned factors [many omitted], in addition to the efficiency of German production, and absolute necessity were driving forces in Germany's post-war reconstruction. </p>
<p>Tldr: Germany wasn't allowed to make shit that went &quot;boom&quot; after WWII, but the engineering nerds who were previously working in the war effort still needed to make money. Instead of designing/producing weapons &amp; war machines, they began focusing on making cars &amp; shit to sell to the chumps across the pond in Freedomland. </p>
<p>This is all going off what I remember from a one day section in my AP Gov class during my junior year of high school. There's probably more holes in this crude account of history than Swiss cheese, so hopefully one of the kids I used to copy off can pop in and clear it up for you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wouldn't say it has anything to do with any crazy engineering or anything. Germans just don't settle for shit. If something breaks or is unsatisfactory, they will let it be known. I think that is the main reason. If you are complacent and accept it, of course its going to keep happening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I was taught in Design History was that German products used to be of lesser quality before the 20th century, so they formed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutscher_Werkbund" target="_blank">Deutscher Werkbund</a> , an association of industrialists, craftsmen, architects etc. to make better products and rebrand &quot;Made in Germany&quot; as a sign of quality.</p>
<p>There was a TIL I think a few days ago about the Made in [Country] mark, saying the British invented it (near the end of 19th century) to mark foreign goods which were generally of inferior quality.</p>
<p>Another aspect of their current quality is the coupling of specialist high schools with the industry where they basically train their employees from day one.</p>
<p><em>disclaimer: I am a trained industrial designer, not a design historian, so I welcome any addition/correction to this</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
