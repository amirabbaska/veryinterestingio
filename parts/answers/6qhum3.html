		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could be for various reasons, depends on the situation, species, etc.</p>
<p>Usually it's somewhere with a damp breeze (downwind of a river or pond), and food.  They see something you don't and are hanging around where the food is for them.</p>
<p>Another reason is a mating swarm.  At certain times of the year some bugs swarm up to make the task of finding mates a lot easier (basically like a big mixer).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bazmonkey is right. Flies in particular choose a stinky spot with still air and the males loiter as females looking for mates fly in, pair off and fly out to mate. Not unlike our dive bars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What about, like, gnats and really small bugs? Sometimes I see them in a large-ish cluster maybe 2-300 strong. Are they likely mating? </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
