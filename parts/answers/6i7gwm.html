		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pangaea wasn't the original continent, it was just the most recent supercontinent. There have been lots of cycles of continents breaking up and coming back together - India (with Madagascar for the first bit) was an island continent like Australia from about 140 million years ago until it collided with Asia some time around 50 million years ago.</p>
<p>Using GPS (and other things) we can see how the modern tectonic plates are moving, and from present motions and our knowledge of what drives plates we can make guesses at how the continents might be configured in the future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, there is clear evidence that certain places are getting farther from some, and closer to others. North America and Europe are constantly getting further apart due to the mid Atlantic ridge. The Indian plate is ramming into the Asian plate, hence why the Himalayas are actually still getting taller. Those are probably the best and easiest examples known </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been metioned previously, Pangaea is merely the most recent supercontinent on our planet. Continents have continuously come together through earth's history due to mid-ocean ridge spreading only for a mantle plume driven hot spot to cause active rifting later on and split them apart again. The most recent example before Pangaea is Rodinia. There's a wealth of information out there on that through wikipedia and other sources.</p>
<p>When I was doing my undergrad I had access behing the paywall for <a href="https://deeptimemaps.com/" target="_blank">This website</a> which took the clock back much further into the Archean. In lieu of that information, you might find the more recent breakdown of the last ~650 million years worth of surficial evolution of our planet interesting available <a href="http://www.scotese.com/earth.htm" target="_blank">Here</a>.</p>
<p>How do we know so much about this evolution in such distant past? There are a bunch of clues hidden in the rocks that we can observe and (in the spirit of good geology) interpret to fill in the missing information. Things such as fossil assemblages and sedimentary load in the rock can tell us about the paleoclimate and thus the relative location this plate existed at when deposited. We can also track collisions between continental plates and other objects (other plates/volcanic arcs/other terranes) based on the resulting composition and alteration of the continental rock, along with anomalous sources of sediments showing up in our sedimentary record. Hope this helps answer your question a bit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A really strong proof of it is the fact that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal" target="_blank">the earth's magnetic polarity switches every so often</a>.  It happens irregularly, every 100 thousand to one million years or so.  As the mid-Atlantic ridge is formed, it is super hot and thus any magnetic domains in the iron in the rocks is absent (hot iron is not magnetic).  But as it cools it acquires the same magnetic orientation as the earth.  We've mapped out the magnetic field of the crust and the floor of the Atlantic ocean reverses every so often.</p>
<p>These magnetic &quot;fingerprints&quot; can be found in other places where hot iron cools, such as in lava events.  However, the ocean floor spreading is the most dramatic.</p>
