		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum tunneling is an important part of many chemical reactions. However, hydrogen is really the only atom that undergoes tunneling to a significant extent, since other atoms are too heavy. However, there are a few exceptions:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hydrogen tunneling plays an important role in many chemical and enzymatic reactions. Less common is the tunneling of heavier atoms such as oxygen and carbon. In this Perspective, McMahon highlights the report by Zuev et al., who have identified a reaction in which carbon tunneling increases the reaction rate by over a hundred orders of magnitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In your example of H2 and Cl2 gases, the tunneling probability isn't large enough to contribute a substantial amount to the reaction. Even though hydrogen is light, and can undergo tunneling in many reactions, in this case the gas molecules are too far apart.</p>
<p>Often, tunneling reactions are investigated using the kinetic isotope effect. Deuterium (D), being heavier than protium (H), will tunnel much more slowly. This is stronger than the usual kinetic isotope effect, which is caused by changes in vibrational energy states.</p>
<p>In the case of H2 vs D2 in reaction with Cl, <a href="https://aip.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1063/1.468486" target="_blank">the observed differences in rate</a> (and also see <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=vyHwCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA67&amp;lpg=PA67&amp;dq=D2+Cl2+kinetics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6ZBYWcPiGF&amp;sig=dMBQHaQ_kb7sAx_BQyXnRCBPbj0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjmvL_0r-zbAhWFExQKHWJbAuIQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=D2%20Cl2%20kinetics&amp;f=false" target="_blank">here</a>) aren't large enough to support a tunneling mechanism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we use transition state theory (TST) to predict the energy needed for a reaction to occur, then we will generally assume the transition state is at the lowest energy saddle point of the energy surface (the original TST used potential energy surfaces.  This is wrong).</p>
<p>However, in quantum mechanics, we know that there is a chance for tunneling across any barrier of a finite energy; this is true of particles as well as chemical reactions.  Think of this as molecules colliding without the necessary energy to cross the transition state barrier, but still proceeding to product.  For some reactions, this is completely negligible.  For others, tunneling can actually be a major pathway for reactants to go on to products.  I'm no expert in this; for a more thorough explanation, check out Anslyn and Dougherty's physical organic textbook.</p>
<p>To expand on a point related to my answer, but not necessarily your original question, tunneling isn't the only phenomenon that can cause is to miscalculate reaction rates with TST.  Recrossing is the phenomenon where, as reactants move along a reaction coordinate diagram, they may cross over the traditional TST transition state point, but then still go back in the other direction towards reactants.  In fact, one reaction can cross the transition state several times before finally going on to products.  When I discuss recrossing here, keep in mind I am talking about an irreversible reaction, not one we'd expect to go back and forth across a transition state as in an equilibrium.  Variational TST is a newer theory which seeks to place the transition state not at the saddle point, but where it can minimize recrossing and give a more accurate reaction rate.</p>
<p>There are other theories to address when traditional TST fails to accurately model the rate of product formation or the distribution of competing reaction pathways.  Issues such as translational momentum and non-statistical distributions of thermal energies have been discovered to play an important role in describing chemical reactions, but that's a post for another time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As everyone has mentioned, Quantum tunneling does in fact change reaction rates, and is the process with which certain processes can happen altogether. The most common thing to tunnel is of an electron due to that low mass. Hydrogen can as well as reported by Metacelsus. </p>
<p>However, I want to clear up a fundamental component of statistical mechanics. There is a probability of the reverse interaction and the forward interaction happening at all times. A mixture at equilibrium has these two rates happening by definition. This can also be predicted from the temperature distribution that there are particles with enough energy to react at any given time or even ionize.The rate may be so low that you don't expect a single molecule to change in a minute but by definition it is there. For a chain reaction to occur you need enough free radicals to on average generate more free radicals. This means the average number of free radicals added caused by UV ionization, must offset the reverse reaction as well as generate enough in a given area to cause a reaction. A critical value must be reached. Tunneling or other low probability interactions are going to be most visible in non-reversible reactions which are not kinematically allowed under standard conditions. You may still have high energy particles at the edge of the curve, but they may be less likely than tunneling. Generally in chemistry other processes dominate given the large range of energy states filled, and other statistical mechanisms allowed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
