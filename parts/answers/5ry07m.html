		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's often used as a example of excellent flexible packaging. It uses a cohesive layer (sticks to itself, but nothing else) that is laminated between two layers of film. These layers of film are laser scored slightly offset to each other to create the lip that once exposed by opening the package, giving you a resealable cohesive bond.
Long story short, once broken open there is a sticky part, but it's just sticky enough to stick to itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In medical devices they coat the surface being stuck to in low adhesion material like a thin silicone. This allows for some stick without allowing for a complete adhesion. Like the Post-it note, they use a powerful adhesive but coat it very thin. The thinner the adhesive layer the less it will tend to &quot;gum off&quot; and leave residual. </p>
