<p>Plants need a certain minimum amount of photons per second per square meter for photosynthesis to work. This has to do with the intermediate products of the photosynthesis reaction &quot;slipping&quot; through the membranes before they can react and form molecules for long term storage of energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photosynthesis occurs almost immediate when photons interact with plants.  The volume of photosynthesis that occurs from starlight is nearly nonexistent. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16916290/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/16916290/</a></p>
<p>states &quot;On Earth, starlight PAR is inadequate for photosynthetically supported growth. An increase in starlight even to reach the minimum theoretical levels to allow for photosynthesis would require a universe that was approximately ten million times older, or with a ten million times greater density of stars, than is the case for the present universe.&quot;</p>
<p>edit: a typo, startlight ... starlight</p>
<p>edit2: Moonlight is a no also. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The light dependence of the key enzyme in photosythesis, Rubisco, is actually really interesting. The reaction it catalyses exists in an equilibrium between the carbon fixing we think of as photosythesis, and the energy consuming reverse reaction. As a result, plants have a number of mechanisms to stop this reverse reaction, most of which boil down to preventing photosynthesis in the dark.</p>
<p>Because of these mechanisms, photosynthesis does not occur in low light such as starlight. Even if Rubisco were not inhibited in photosythesis, the reverse reaction would occur and actually consume the plants energy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, a bit of back of the envelope maths here.</p>
<p>Edit: my back of the envelope maths was faulty, correction courtesy of u/guesswhoimquoting </p>
<p>The sun is about 0.000<em>0</em>16 light years away.
The nearest other star is about 4.3 light years away.
So the closest star is 268750 x further away than the sun.</p>
<p>The formula that gives us relative light intensity is the inverse square law. Light from something twice as far is 4 times less intense etc.</p>
<p>For ease of calculation, assuming the light intensity from each is roughly comparable, the light intensity coming from the closest star is over <em>70 billion</em> times less intense than the sun.</p>
<p>A rough estimate of the energy landing on the earth surface from the sun is about 1kW/square meter. From our next closest star, we are looking at the range of <em>tens of nanowatts</em> per square meter which is negligible.</p>
<p>So to some extent this scales up as there are obviously many stars in the sky, but some of these are also much, much further away. So the overall energy delivery from distant stars is really next to nothing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely YES. These answers would be correct if photosynthesis were the only light-dependent process in plants.  However, it is not, and starlight can absolutely be physiologically important, which means that plants do indeed receive a measurable (in this context, physiologically useful) amount of energy from starlight.</p>
<p>Phytochrome is a family of photoreceptive pigments found in all plants, bacteria, and fungi.  They are responsive to light in the red and far-red spectra, and interconvert to active and inactive forms, depending on the wavelength of light that hits them.  These phytochromes trigger a wide variety of biochemical cascades.</p>
<p>There are three categories (with very different properties with regard to activation and escape from activation) of phytochrome responses dependent on intensity of light.  One of these is the Very Low Fluence Response (VLFR).</p>
<p>In short it has been shown that some seeds can be influenced to germinate and some coleoptiles can be influenced to grow by as little photon flux density as 0.0001 Î¼mol per square meter per second (0.007 lux).  This is moonless night-sky brightness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
