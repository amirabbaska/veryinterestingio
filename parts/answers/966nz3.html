		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is indeed evidence that we have cross-bred with other human species, namely <em>H. neanderthalis</em> and <em>H. dennisova</em>. The evidence is from comparative genome analysis. This implies the production of fertile offspring when this hybridation first occured. Original research to that effect can be found here:</p>

<p>However, it has to be noted that the introduction of these genetic contributions is not found in all <em>H. sapiens</em>. Populations from lineages which have remained in Africa mixed with neither of these 2 other species, while hybridation with the Dennisovans occurred in Asia and is exclusively reflected in the genetic heritage of present-day Melanesians. We thus cannot say that our species <em>originated</em> from a hybridation event, it was already well established prior to these events.</p>
<p>It certainly isn't as easy to hybridize hominids as it is orchids. <a href="http://www.aos.org/orchids/additional-resources/intergeneric-hybrids.aspx" target="_blank">Orchid intergeneric hybridization</a> is a thing and a bit of an outrageous outlier ... combining 5 different genera is not particularly an issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just an amateur assessment here but, despite the varieties of early Homo species found in Africa, the line of descent is still seen as rather had to determine so it would be hard to zero in on such an early hybridization. It's very possible that some crucial hybridization which occurred I occurred between groups both still unknown to the fossil record.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
