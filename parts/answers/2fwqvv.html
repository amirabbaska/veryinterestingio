		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You actually still can. It's called <a href="http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Check_kiting" target="_blank">check kiting</a> and it's super illegal, you will get caught, blah blah, disclaimer.</p>
<p>Get three separate checking accounts. Write a check from account 1 to account 2 for whatever you would like. Go to bank 2 and cash it. Now you can either run like the full force of the FBI is on your tail (because it is) or you can answer those siren calls and play the game a little longer. </p>
<p>For those who chose door 2: thats the spirit. Write a check from account 3 to account 1 to cover the amount and repeat the cycle until you're comfortable in your private island mansion, or more likely, rotting in prison. But don't forget to have fun!</p>
<p>How it works: there is no money in any account but because banks take so long to clear checks (called 'float periods'), they take a while to catch on. You just have to stay ahead of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Computers can generally only do things quicker or more accurately than people.</p>
<p>Try and ask yourself, why can't you withdraw all your money from 2 different branches today? The answer you might come to is that all branches talk to a central location that keeps track of your account. This central location prevents conflicting changes to your account (two withdrawals of your entire account at once for example) They communicate via a network of some kind.</p>
<p>That's really no different than how it was before computers. Except in those cases, your 'home' branch was in charge of your account. If you went to a different branch, they would call your home branch and do the proper checks (make sure there is enough money) on your account to withdraw the money. Your home branch would have your bank transactions stored on paper, so it was pretty easy to prevent two people from editing it at once.</p>
<p>There's also some social devices that worked as well. Most banks knew their local customers by face and would trust/not trust them accordingly. Even today, you might have a cheque holding period. That is to say if you deposit a cheque, it might be a few days before the money is actually in your account. Banks can waive this period if they trust you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Order of the Knights Templar had an early version of the cheques system in place during the Crusades. Local “branch offices” would collect payment pre-travel from the pilgrim and issue a letter of credit. When the pilgrim arrived they would turn in the letter to the Holy Land “branch” and collect an equivalent payment to what they left behind. This was a great system to protect the pilgrim, making it easier for them to travel and less likely to get robbed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the top comment did not like that I posted what I had to say as a reply so I guess I will post this to the original poster and what people who see this will see it.  What the top comment said is mostly accurate, except it creates a misconception that &quot;cash&quot; is more important than banking when banks predate what we would consider today to be cash by many centuries. </p>
<p>For example, the Bank of England didn't start issuing central bank currency until 1844 and the US didn't have Federal Reserve Notes until after the establishment of the Federal Reserve which of the top of my head was 1910s.</p>
<p>Prior to that - most form of settlement took the form of IOUS from banks - banknotes. Some countries had minted coin or gold, but the modern bank has existed since the 1400s in Italy and the rest of Europe to facilitate trade.  To expedite trade, you really tried to avoid transporting cash as much as possible.  Instead, banks would keep accounts open with each other and lend to each other and use their official paper to show that this person had money deposited and was good to take on new loans in a place. </p>
<p>Banks promised to pay each other using official paper in various forms (bills of exchanges, acceptances, letters of credit, cheques), all of which are essentially some basic form of I O U in one form of each other.
Now, you're right, the standardized check is the least reliable because its not certified as having funds available whereas all of the other instruments are. If you wanted to use a check in a new location, at a different bank, prior to phones, you would probably use a certified check or some other form otherwise you would wait a long time for the check to clear. I really don't think you would bother for mail confirmation unless what you're trying to say is send for collection.</p>
<p>This is a really great paper on the history of checks and other similar instruments: </p>
