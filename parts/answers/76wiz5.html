<p>Ignorant people are always very sure of themselves. Their world is small, simple, and doesn’t grow. Intelligent people are always looking for more so their world gets bigger all the time. It’s easy to be certain when you think you know everything and hard to be certain when you know you don’t. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you know very little about a subject, you probably don't know how deep the subject goes. Basically, you're standing on top of the iceberg of knowledge. The experts have taken the plunge and seen how much more is hidden from the surface. Someone else linked to the wiki page for the Dunning-Kruger effect; if you want more detail check that out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
