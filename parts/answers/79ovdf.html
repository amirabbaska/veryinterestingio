		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laughing is a way that humans diffuse conflict and promote bonds. Laughing signals to another person that you enjoy their company, but also that you aren't going to attack them. And it's audible for the same reason that we make other mouth sounds: more communication. This is a useful skill in a species that works in groups.</p>
<p>Imagine that someone accidentally trips you and you fall on your ass. You <em>could</em> get angry, and some people would. But others would feel compelled to laugh, even if it's awkward. We tend to like those people more, because they're reassuring the rest of us that the situation isn't that bad. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we see something dangerous we shout, it's an instinctive communication to other people that you've spotted a threat. Laughing is a similar response, but it's an &quot;all clear&quot; message instead of a warning. It means you've spotted something that <em>looks</em> dangerous but isn't. Like shouting, &quot;don't worry, false alarm!&quot; </p>
<p>That's why jokes are always about subverting an expectation, usually hinting at something dangerous or taboo. The difference between a smile and a laugh is whether or not the punchline, or realization of a non-threat, is surprising enough. Like the difference between noticing a scary shape in the shadows or having something jump out at you. The first might scare you, but the second startles you. Laughing is the &quot;all clear&quot; equivalent of being startled. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A psychology professor/researcher in CU Boulder has a theory around this called the <a href="http://leeds-faculty.colorado.edu/mcgrawp/Benign_Violation_Theory.html" target="_blank">Benign Violation Theory</a></p>
<p>From the site:  According to the theory, a violation refers to anything that threatens one’s beliefs about how the world should be. That is, something seems threatening, unsettling, or wrong. From an evolutionary perspective, humorous violations likely originated as threats to physical well-being (e.g., the attacks that make up tickling, play fighting), but expanded to include threats to psychological well-being (e.g., insults, sarcasm), including behaviors that break social norms (e.g., strange behaviors, flatulence), cultural norms (e.g., unusual accents, most scenes from the movie Borat), linguistic norms (e.g., puns, malapropisms), logic norms (e.g., absurdities, non-sequiturs), and moral norms (e.g., disrespectful behavior, bestiality).</p>
<p>However, most things that are violations do not make people laugh. For a violation to produce humor it also needs to be perceived as benign. That is, it needs to seem okay, safe, or acceptable. Research in HuRL has highlighted three ways that a violation can seem benign: 1) Alternative norms (e.g., one meaning of a phrase in a pun doesn’t make sense, but the other meaning does), 2) commitment to a violated norm (e.g., men find sexist jokes funnier than women do), and 3) psychological distance (e.g., “comedy is tragedy plus time”).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
