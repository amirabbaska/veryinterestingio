		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because the situation is an endlessly spiralling disaster. The Jewish people have been persecuted so much throughout history up to and including the Holocaust that they felt the only way they would ever be safe would be to create a Jewish State. They had also been forcibly expelled from numerous other nations throughout history. In 1922, the League of Nations gave control of the region to Britain, who basically allowed numerous Jews to move in so that they'd stop immigrating to Britain. Now this is all well and good, since the region was a No Man's Land.</p>
<p>..Except there were people living there. It's pretty much right out of Eddie Izzard's 'But Do You Have a Flag?'. The people we now know as Palestinians rioted about it, were denounced as violent. Militant groups sprang up, terrorist acts were done, military responses followed. </p>
<p>Further complicating matters is the fact that the people known now as Palestinians weren't united before all of this, and even today, you have competing groups claiming to be the sole legitimate government of Palestine, the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. So even if you want to negotiate, who with? There's an endless debate about legitimacy and actual regional control before you even get to the table.</p>
<p>So the discussion goes </p>
<p>&quot;Your people are antisemitic terrorists&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You stole our land and displaced us&quot;  </p>
<p>&quot;Your people and many others in the world displaced us first and wanted to kill us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That doesn't give you any right to take our home. And you keep firing missiles at us.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Because you keep launching terrorist attacks against us&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's not us, it's the other guys&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you're the government, control them.&quot;</p>
<p>And on, and on, and on, and on. The conflict's roots are ancient, and everybody's a little guilty, and everybody's got a bit of a point.
Bear in mind that this is also the my-first-foreign-policy version. The real situation is much more complex.</p>
<p>Oh, and this is before you even get started with the complexities of the religious conflict and how both groups believe God wants them to rule over the same place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because Israel is about the size of New Jersey, splitting it would make it downright tiny.  Liveable land isn't exactly plentiful as it's mostly desert.  It would also require resettling a whole lot of people.  Also, the area around Israel has a lot of cliffs and strategic value when it comes to defending the country from the many enemies that surround it.  Giving that up would allow a single person with a rocket launcher to fire at pretty much any target they wanted.  And then there's the fact that the country of Israel owns the land and doesn't want to give it up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of general platitudes, political opinions, and recaps of Israeli-Palestinian history, so I won't delve into those. Instead, the specific issues that are way harder than you probably think:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Many people simply don't <em>want</em> the two-state solution. Either because of religious reasons (&quot;god gave us the land&quot;, on both the Jewish and Muslim sides of the argument), because of nationalist entitlement, exasperation with the 20-year attempt to reach it, security considerations, or other reasons. That number was always at around half of the Palestinian and Israeli population, and it's recently becoming a majority.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jerusalem. The Palestinians want a capital in the eastern part of it, while the Israelis strongly object to dividing Jerusalem. And I don't see anyone giving that part up. Both cite political, historical and religious reasons for their insistence. Incidentally, dividing cities, let alone capitals, is generally considered an undesirable thing in international law (Berlin is a famous example). If Jerusalem would indeed be divided, it would be an interesting precedent, with very interesting (read: difficult) challenges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Palestinian Refugees. About two-thirds of all the Palestinians in the world are descended from 1948 refugees from Israel proper. The Palestinian people overwhelmingly demand that all of them would &quot;return&quot; to Israel, turning it into a Palestinian-majority state. Needless to say, there's precisely 0% that that Israelis would ever agree to that. The Palestinian leadership is more willing to compromise on this, but it's doubtful they have the mandate to do so. </p>
<p>You might've heard about the Israeli demand for the Palestinians to recognize them as a &quot;Jewish State&quot;? That's what they're talking about. The Palestinians object to that, because it would mean preemptively giving up the &quot;right of return&quot;. And that's exactly why the Israeli are demanding that. Basically, the Israelis are afraid that when the Palestinians are talking about a &quot;two state solution&quot;, they mean &quot;one pure, Jew-free Palestinian state, and one Palestinian-majority, Palestinian-ruled state&quot;. Which is no two-state solution at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Security. Basically, the Israelis already tried a withdrawal from Gaza, without even asking anything in return, and the result was a Hamas-controlled terror enclave that shot thousands of rockets at Israeli cities. If it happens in the West Bank, which is <em>far</em> closer to Israel's population center, it would absolutely paralyze Israel and its economy. There is no obvious technological or military solution to that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The settlements. While most settlements are in easy-to-annex blocks, some were intentionally put in the middle of Palestinian territory, with long roads leading to them. At least one of them, Ariel, is a relatively big town, with its own university. Combine that with the fact that Gaza and the West Bank are non-contiguous, and simply drawing a map of the Israeli-Palestinian border becomes a very non-trivial one. </p>
<p>Although, on a personal note, I think that's actually the easier part of this. Most Israelis, and even some settlers, <em>are</em> willing to give up settlements for a true peace agreement. That could not be said about the other items on this list.</p>

<li>
<p>Israel has a proportional representation voting system with very low  thresholds for getting seats. As a result, governments tend to be coalition governments reliant on hardliners for support.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Palestinian authority lacks the resources to effectively govern the occupied territories. In that power vacuum, organizations like Hamas have been able to step in and provide governance. However, this also commits more people to a hardline approach.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even beyond the political system, some Israelis settled in the Occupied territories, making it harder to trade away territory. An Israeli terrorist also assassinated Yitzhak Rabin over the Oslo process. Similarly, terrorist attacks by Palestinian groups can also derail the peace process, pushing support towards hardliners. Israelis may then clamp down on Palestinians, deepening mutual resentment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In many respects, a meaningful two-state solution is impossible. The Occupied Territories are economically reliant on interactions with Israel, and are likely to remain so. A two-state solution might also fail on other fronts (e.g. what sort of rights would gay Palestinians have). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Many of the issues involved in resolving the crisis are indivisible. While Arafat and Barak were generally willing to trade land, some land-related issues like the temple mount in Jerusalem were harder to resolve. Elsewhere, giving up land may create vulnerabilities (e.g. the Golan heights could be used to launch rockets into Israel). </p>
</li>
<li>Each side has a different vision of history, and that informs their negotiating positions. Arafat argued that just accepting the Occupied Territories was a compromise in itself, because they comprised of only 22% of historical Palestine (e.g. the British Palestinian mandate). The main sticking point in negotiation is right of return. Many Palestinians fled (or were kicked out) Israel in the 1948 war, becoming refugees. The descendants of these refugees now number 4 million, and believe they are entitled to return to Israel (and potentially to receive compensation). </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright, I live in Israel, and here's my take. Obviously, this issue is polarizing, but as far as I know the most common reason is this: Security.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone, left and right, maybe excluding the ultra-radical right, would give land, fund, supply, and support a Palestinian nation without a second thought <strong>if it can reasonably assumed that said nation won't attack us</strong>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egypt%E2%80%93Israel_Peace_Treaty" target="_blank">Israel has given huge amounts of religiously significant land for sustainable peace before</a> and all of Israel agrees that was a great decision. On the other hand, when Israel gave up land unilaterally, without a reasonable promise of peace, it turned into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip" target="_blank">the geopolitical equivalent of a waking nightmare</a>, and is widely regarded as one is Israel's greatest mistakes.</p>
<p>The standing opinion in Israel is that terrorist organizations are too well rooted, that the Palestinian population can't be trusted to do peace, and that the current Palestinian Authority is either unable or unwilling to enforce order in Palestine (this particular opinion, as far as I can gather, is shared by Palestinians as well). This opinion is only reinforced by the recent wave of violence arriving from both Israeli Arabs and Palestinians.</p>
<p>As of right now, I have to admit, the prospect of a nation populated by people educated by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aV9M3mmqOII" target="_blank">this sort of stuff</a>, led by the current PA, being a bottle rocket-launch away from my house, terrifies me to my core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
