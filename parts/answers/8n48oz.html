		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First lets clarify a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the case of Roseanne, all 9 episodes for Season 10 have already been broadcast. </p>
</li>
<li>ABC announced there won't be a season 11. </li>
</ul>
<p>TV shows are produced by production companies and broadcast by broadcasters. </p>
<p>That means the production company is responsible to develop the content (hiring cast/crew, sets, props, wardrobe, cameras, lights, etc.).</p>
<p>Then the producers license the content to broadcasters so they will have something to show to their viewers. There are two business models now for broadcasters to make money: ads and/or subscriptions. Broadcasters usually protect their licensing contracts with terms the protect them against marketing blunders that would affect their revenue model. </p>
<p>The contracts with cast/crew, suppliers, etc. are all done with the production company. </p>
<p>Roseanne is produced by The Carsey-Werner Company. They have been trying to do a spin-off or revival of Roseanne since 2008. In April 2017 it was reported they were shopping the revival to ABC and Netflix. ABC announced the deal on May 2017.</p>
<p>Filming only started on Oct 2017. </p>
<p>The show was renewed by ABS for a season 11 on March 2018. </p>
<p>ABC simply cancelled the recently announced deal. It's unlikely that any serious money has been spent on Season 11 as filming would not start at least until the fall. </p>
<p><strong>TL:DR:</strong> The production companies are the ones that take the risk. Broadcaster could be up for penalties for breach of contract but most likely a moral clause let them cancel the contract without them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what stage of production they were on. If episodes of the show were already filmed and ready to broadcast, then yes, the studio is going to lose money, because they spent money to film the show and now they can't broadcast it and get the advertising money.</p>
<p>If all the already-filmed episodes of the show had already been broadcast, then they're not gonna lose any money.</p>
<p>However, there also might be contracts to deal with. Sometimes actors and producers are signed up for multi-season contracts. And if the company abruptly cancels the show, they might have to pay those actors and producers to fulfill the contract. But some contracts have special clauses that if the actor does something fucking stupid (like Rosanne did), then it can void the contract. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studios always hedge their bets with shows. Everyone is under contracts with exit clauses. When studios sink too much in a show you get the Nickelodeon effect. Where they make fewer shows but heavily push them (ie Spongebob). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Non-American here with a question. I'm confused the freedom of speech issue. I understand the government cannot restrict speech.  But seeing this from the outside I don't understand the difference between this actress tweeting something that upset people and got her fired and the American football player that doesn't stand for the anthem and also upsets many people. In Latin America we have &quot;freedom of speech&quot; too but we know our lives can be seriously ruined if we anger the wrong people. I guess what I'm trying to ask is who are the people that can ruin your life if you piss off in the States? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>ABC is the Broadcaster. The show is actually produced by Carsey-Werner. The latter bears most of the costs.</p>
<p>In the short term, nothing much will happen. The show is between seasons so ABC wasn't currently broadcasting it (they have pulled re-runs too however). There will be a hole in their line up for next year, but they will probably slot another show in there.</p>
<p>Carsey-Werner bears most of the cost and will be the most hurt by this cancellation. They hire all the writers, production crew, camera crew, editors and the actors themselves. While filming for the new season won't have begun yet they likely were in pre-production phase, so getting the scripts ready and planning the sets, etc. Technically all these people still have jobs, however in the medium term if Carsey-Werner isn't able to sell the show to another broadcaster they will have to let everyone go. Investors in Carsey-Warner will probably lose money too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
