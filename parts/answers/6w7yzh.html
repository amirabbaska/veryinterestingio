		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can think of the two things separately.</p>
<p>You have the right idea that lower gravity makes it easier to fly; this is somewhat obvious, but to be a bit more explicit: Airplanes fly by pushing against the air.  If the air doesn't change, but gravity gets weaker, there's less force pulling you down, and so it takes less effort to fight this and fly.</p>
<p>Increased density also makes it easier to fly.  This is a bit less obvious, since while we all know what gravity feels like (by jumping) density isn't something we can easily experience.  Common kitchen materials have enough other differences that it's hard to get the effect of density just by playing around in your kitchen.  Basically, you can think of it as flying happens when you can push against the air hard enough to lift yourself up.  <em>Very</em> roughly speaking, your wing can move the same size of air when you flap it, and when the air is denser that means you're actually moving more stuff, even if it's the same size.  Moving more stuff takes more force (Newton's second law), and so denser air makes it easier to lift more.</p>
<p>So we have two things: Titan has lower gravity, which makes it easier to fly, and Titan has higher density, which makes it easier to fly.  Humans are very much not designed to be able to fly on Earth, but both of these effects add up to just enough that you could do it on Titan.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Flight is a matter of balance.  Gravity's always pulling you down, and if you want to stay up, you need to generate enough lift to balance it out.</p>
<p>Where does that lift come from?  Birds' wings are shaped so that air on top has to travel further than air on bottom to go around it (think airplane wings: flat on bottom, curved on top).  That means air on top of the wing is traveling faster than air below.  And faster air exerts less pressure.  So the air above the wing is pushing down with less force than the air below the wing is pushing up.  This difference is what keeps the flier flying.</p>
<p>In Titan's case, lower gravity means you need less lift.  Denser atmosphere means more air, meaning the difference in speeds generates more pressure difference, so more lift.  Both make it easier to fly.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer: I've never worked through the math and physics here in full detail, but this is the general picture as I understand it).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's basically the same reason you can &quot;fly&quot; in water more easily than through air. Not only does is make &quot;weigh less&quot;, but it gives you something to push off of mid flight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
