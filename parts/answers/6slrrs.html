<p>massage machines, when somebody roughens up our hair</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Basically considering these as 'touch sensations', there are two aspects, the psychological aspect and the physiological aspect.</p>
<p>Psychological factor is that being touched or touching someone else are important modes of human interaction next to language.  Studies show that the hormone oxytocin has a role in this, which is the hormone of love and attachment.  That's why we feel good when we get a handshake, hug or a shoulder massage to a congratulatory pat on the back.  Secondly, the physiological aspect, the stimulation, increased blood flow, etc.  When we get a massage, our brain receives the sensation because our skin cells send the nerve signal from skin to brain and then our body released endorphins which act like natural pain killers.  Then the body tend to be more relaxed as the stress level is reduced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unespecific question, yours. But if you mean vibration applied to muscles, (my hypothesis, from a non-english speaker) it may me confortable because any gentle movement you provoke on it, it wont do anything but help the flow of blood or lymph on the tissue, which are a help to restore the equilibrium of it after exercise/ after no healthy positions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
