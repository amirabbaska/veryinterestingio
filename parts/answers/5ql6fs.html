		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My best guess would be that its due to your eyelids causing the liquid on the surface of your eye to form a kind of [meniscus shape] (<a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/graphics/meniscus-types.gif" target="_blank">https://water.usgs.gov/edu/graphics/meniscus-types.gif</a>) over where light is entering your pupil.
This would kind of be like a concave lens, leading to the bending of light in a vertical direction around where your eyelids touch your eye.</p>
<p>edit: I'd like to point out that if you move your eyelashes out of the way using your fingers, you still get rays appearing when you squint.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lights are always rays. The shape of the aperture of your eye (eyelashes lids and obstruction included) control how the light hits your retina and how the refraction is shaped. If you look at bokeh from say mesh fabric and squint your eyes each bokeh dot will look like its &quot;squinting&quot; too.<br />
Tldr: When your squinting your eyelashes change the way light enters your eyes and make focused light seem like a starburst.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>my guess is that your eyelashes do the same</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is probably diffraction on your eyelashes. When light passes through a narrow opening, it spreads out in a direction perpendicular to the direction of the opening. (So for a vertical slit, it spreads out horizontally) When you squint, your eye lids and lashes make a bunch of little slits for the light to diffract from. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
