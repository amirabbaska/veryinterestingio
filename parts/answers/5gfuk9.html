		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said, it's a nominal measurement. It also makes it annoying building orders (I'm an Order Maker at a lumber yard). </p>
<p>Say I get an order of lumber for a construction company, they want 2x4s and 2x6s, I'll make the order <strong>52&quot;</strong> (nominal) wide. Building the stack up from 10ft to 16ft+ lumber to make it look nice. (Think like an upside down triangle)</p>
<p>So, <strong>52&quot;</strong> can be 8 2x6s + 1 2x4 across, or 13 2x4s across, of course with many variations in between. Think that would be peachy and line up perfectly row after row, right?</p>
<p>Nope. Because of nominal measurement. 2x6 is actually 1.5x5.5 and 2x4 is actually 1.5 by 3.5. So that means,</p>
<p>(5.5x8) + 3.5 = 47.5&quot;</p>
<p>3.5x13 = 45.5&quot;</p>
<p>The front of my order will be perfectly flush and look nice, but the back side will look ugly, could look like this:</p>
<p>|----------</p>
<p>|---------</p>
<p>|----------</p>
<p>|----------</p>
<p>|---------</p>
<p>|---------</p>
<p>|----------   </p>
<p>That's not even including 2x8s, 10s, 12s, LVL, 4x4 CANT strip, bridging, 2x2, 1x2, 1x4, LSL, that can be included in the lumber order as well</p>
<p>Edit: I could get an order that has, say,</p>
<p>Quantity/Feet</p>
<p>2x4 - 11/10, 52/12, 20/14, 33/16</p>
<p>2x6 - 13/10, 32/14, 25/16</p>
<p>2x8 - 3/10, 1/12, 1/16</p>
<p>2x10 - 1/14</p>
<p>2x12 - 2/10</p>
<p>It's like a giant puzzle, gotta start with the 10s first, and work my way up to the 16s. And try and finish it in a way that it's completely, or almost flat on the top (can't be just 2 2x4s on the top row for example) so we can put bundles of plywood, drywall, etc on top of it that's included in the order when it gets sent off on a truck.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is the real answer:</p>
<p>2x4 is not the stated dimension.  In the 1920's when they were changing the lumber standards they decided that although the lumber was undersized,  it still made more sense to call it a 2by4, and similarly a 1by4 etc.  When we talk about 2x4's today we are using the accepted colloquial term.</p>
<p>If you go to your lumber  yard it should be labeled as 1.5&quot;x3.5&quot; however that is too clumsy to say. </p>
<p>There are many other good answers here about shinkage, planing etc. but it would be possible to the lumber industry to produce proper 2x4's.</p>
<p>The better question is why is lumber undersized instead of full size?  They traditionally cut to full dimensions and you could get lumber either green or dried.  As kiln dried lumber became standard fare at retail stores they had to decide on a standard dry lumber size.  There was much arguing with only a few members arguing for full size retail lumber (probably because of consumer perception of what a 2x4 should be).  They settled on 1 3/4 x 3 3/4 (with tolerances allowed).  Since then it has been reduced to 1 1/2 x 3 1/2 (you can find 1 5/8 in some houses) probably for profit reasons after it was proved that the size of the member doesn't affect the strength of the wall nearly as much as the assembly and sheeting.</p>
<p>Edit:  Lumber has been reduced through several steps from 2x4 to 1.5x3.5.  Each increment has been through arguing between mills sawing different types of lumber and retailers wanting a certain product as well as the setting of freight fees (different lumbers used to be shipped with different moisture content so some mills had to pay more for shipping the same 2x4 used for framing).  It's a really complicated history all layed out <a href="http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/misc/miscpub_6409.pdf" target="_blank">here</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question has been answered, but as a carpenter I'm gonna tell you right now, don't take those dimensions for granted, they can be off by as much as 1/4&quot; in any dimension these days. And the larger the board the more likely it is to be short. A 2x12 is usually 1 1/2 x 11 1/4  and sometimes the 1 1/2 side will be short too like 1 3/8  but that's less common. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
