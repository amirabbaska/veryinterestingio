		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At one point we thought that there was just a single Vitamin B that you would get from your food source. As we later realized, it was actually several different molecules that do different things for your body, but because they often come from the same source (same type of food) there was that initial  miscategorization. </p>
<p>Some vitamins turned out not to really be vitamins, so they are eliminated Vitamin F doesnt exist for example</p>
<p>And then Vitamin D often is listed at Vitamin D2 or Vitamin D3. These are closely  related molecules that do the same thing in the body. Also, since Vitamin D can be made in body, its not technically a vitamin</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically there were A-K vitamins named chronologically, but later it was decided that F-P aren’t vitamins, and we found out that B is a big group of 20 or so of them, except some of those aren’t vitamins too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientists are generally bad at naming things. Names are required for research as it enables different scientists to discuss things. If it does not have a name you can not talk about it. As you might imagine a lot of names are just numerations. So you have vitamins being named A, B, C, D, etc. when first published in a paper. But this was before they knew what the vitamins were or why they were needed. So the thing they first classified as vitamin B turned out to be 12 different substances, and then they discovered that only 8 of those were vitamins. So this is why you have no vitamin B11 or vitamin A2 but you have vitamin B12. The rest of the vitamin naming schemes are similarly troubled. They tried keeping the naming alphabetically but you had vitamins which were debunked in later papers and renamed vitamins, etc. And this is not a unique problem to vitamins but almost all scientific naming schemes suffer from similar issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related note: the definition it a vitamin is an organic molecule (minerals are the inorganic equivalents) that are necessary for biological processes to occur, but don't themselves get consumed during those processes.</p>
<p>So when you see an ad for a really high dose B vitamin supplement that brags about &quot;converting food into energy&quot;, think of it as an ad saying &quot;A quart of motor oil helps your car turn fuel into energy, so 100 gallons would be even better!&quot; Not gonna help you, and if anything, it might hurt you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vitamins A, D, E, and K are all fat soluble. That is, they need to be absorbed alongside fat to enter the body. The various B vitamins are all various water solble compounds necessary for cellular metabolism.</p>
<p>In other words, B vitamins are just a long list of molecules integral to the function of cells, discovered over a period of time. They aren't all that different and so they are all grouped under the B heading. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
