		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diplomats are sent out to negotiate with foreign governments. When you send out someone to negotiate on your behalf you have a need to tell them stuff that the people they negotiate with aren't to know - like for instance the minimum they must get in a deal for it to be acceptable.<br />
Since every country has this need to protect the secrecy of what they say to their diplomats and what the diplomats know and do, they (mostly) agree to a trade. I won't bother your diplomats and you won't bother mine. This is the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations.
Diplomatic immunity means the sending country shields the staff of a diplomatic mission from many ordinary state powers like search and seizure of personal effects/property, arrest and prosecution for crimes. If there's evidence of wrongdoing the host country can only</p>
<ul>
<li>present that evidence to the sending country and ask that they <em>waive immunity</em> - allow the person to be prosecuted by the host country without claiming immunity.</li>
<li>declare the relevant people <em>persona non grata</em> - unwelcome in the host country. They must then leave the host country within a reasonable timeframe or they are no longer covered by the immunity of the diplomatic mission. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's fairly simple: the laws of the country you're in don't apply to you. Kill someone, skip rent payments, whatever. Your home country can choose to prosecute you or even revoke your immunity, but normal practice is to just bring a diplomat home if they've angered the host country.</p>
<p>Although various systems and informal arrangements have existed for millennia, the 1961 Vienna Convention made diplomatic immunity a treaty obligation.</p>
<p>Note that this full immunity only applies to a 'diplomatic agent' - staff of various kinds will receive differing treatment depending on the country they're in and the agreements between the two countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well first off countries have ambassadors in other countries to facilitate negotiations etc.  As a general rule you want some sort of representative there even during a war.  This will allow a conversation to start towards negotiating a peace.</p>
<p>Now on to your question.  Diplomatic immunity is there so that the ambassadors and others associated with the embassy don't have to worry about being arrested on false charges on order to gain leverage.  It is a long standing tradition that messengers are allowed to deliver there messages without being harmed otherwise how can 2 governments talk.  This has simply been expanded when ambassadors and embassies became a thing. Ambassadors can be expelled from a country but they cannot be charged. </p>
<p>These are also not absolute rules.  A government can waive diplomatic immunity.  For instance countries with simikar values may say that someone involved with the embassy can be charged.  This would be done in the interest of maintaining good relations between the 2 countries. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you kill your neighbor. In this altercation, the state will impose its power over you by forcefully arresting you, physically dragging you into a prison and judging you for your crime. This is a vertical relationship, one of hierarchy. </p>
<p>Now imagine countries are neighbors. If one kills the other, or does them harm, there is no higher entity to forcefully execute a punishment (e.g. a government with legitimacy over the use of power and a hierarchical, vertical relationship to impose its will). </p>
<p>That means that relationships between countries are horizontal, or anarchic (anarchy understood as the opposite of hierarchy). This was established by the Peace of Westphalia, in 1648, which established the nation-state as the model for sovereignty amongst the waring European principalities, dukedoms, fiefdoms, etc. </p>
<p>Since then, it has been established that all countries have sovereignty. What's more, since the Hague Conference in 1907, nation-states agreed that all countries are legally equal to one another (again, imagine the concept of your neighbors, you are all equal under the law). </p>
<p>Alright, so with all that as background, let's get to the meat of your question. For centuries, nation-states tacitly agreed that other country's diplomats could not be detained, arrested or tried in another jurisdiction, as that would violate their sovereignty. That is because diplomatic agents are considered an extension of that nation-state, placed in another country to insure friendly relations with the other government. </p>
<p>Why is this? Very simple. With time, countries realized that their diplomats could be subject to political pressure by the host country in order to extract information or carry out a certain policy. Imagine that an American diplomat in Israel is going to work one day and is stopped by the local authorities. Lo and behold, they &quot;find&quot; a ton of cocaine in the trunk. But Israel is willing to overlook this if the American diplomat does such and such things. See how easy it would be to submit them to political pressure and blackmail? This is also why diplomatic immunity extends to family members. </p>
<p>Diplomats duly accredited to another country are therefore &quot;immune&quot; to that country's jurisdiction in ALL criminal or civil matters. This immunity is irrevocable, except by written consent by the diplomat's country. So even if a diplomat went out on the street and killed 10 people and screamed that he was waving his immunity, he would not be tried in the host country, unless his country's government agreed to this. What would likely happen is that he would be declared &quot;persona non grata&quot; (unwanted person) by the host government, giving him 48 hours (minimum) to leave the country. </p>
<p>So did he get away with murder? Not exactly. The idea is, of course, that he would be tried and sentenced in his home country, which DOES have jurisdiction to punish him. </p>
<p>The details of all of this were eventually codified, after centuries of unwritten norms, in the Vienna Conventions (the first from 1961), and are signed and ratified by virtually all nations. </p>
<p>First time on ELI5, so not sure how much detail I should put in this, but I think I covered most of the dynamics. Happy to take questions!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
