<p>They mostly use planes and helicopters to get high res images, to use &quot;photogrammetry&quot; to construct the 3d models of buildings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Google used to actually model buildings by hand (or have community members submit them). But with the most recent 3D models you're seeing of whole cities, they're using a technology called photogrammetry. Basically they fly an airplane with carefully-calibrated cameras that take photos from different angles. Then a computer program figures out the 3D shape of things using parallax (basically the same thing your brain does with the two images your two eyes supply). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

You can fly around the world from outer space to a dirty Philly alleyway. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the buildings are modelled from satellite data. Google buys different satellite images from different angles of the city and uses a program to calculate the height of each building.</p>
<p>Important buildings such as monuments are manually sculpted in sketchup.</p>
<p>Some buildings have food plans in a publicly available database and Google uses this to calculate the shape of the building too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
