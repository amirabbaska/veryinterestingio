		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human body has 2 types of sweat glands.  The first type is called an eccrine sweat gland.  These are located all over the body and produce mostly watery sweat.  The other kind is called apocrine sweat glands.  Apocrine sweat glands are found in the armpits and groin areas.  Apocrine glands make sweat that has more protein and other nutrients than sweat from eccrine sweat glands.  All the proteins and nutrients from apocrine sweat are good food for bacteria.  The bacteria are responsible for the odors you smell. </p>
<p><del>Anyone who has an old, white, undershirt can see this.  Armpits turn yellow because of all the proteins and other nutrients that is in the sweat in there.</del></p>
<p>Edit:  So I guess yellow sweat stains are actually from compounds in the deodorant itself and is unrelated to the sweat.  Learn something new every day.  Thanks for pointing that out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is important and hope it doesn't get removed bc it's not a direct answer to the question...but it's important to know the difference between the two types of sweat glands we have. Others have already posted that our armpit and groin sweat glands are different than the rest on our body.</p>
<p>Anyways here's what I wanna say. For years I thought I was getting ingrown hairs on my bikini like from waxing/shaving. It was incessant and very painful. Several times I had to go to the doctor and get antibiotic shots. I stopped shaving/waxing and was STILL getting the &quot;ingrown hairs&quot; so I went to a dermatologist and was diagnosed with Hidradentitis Suppurativa. It's a condition that causes apocrine glands to clog and become infected. </p>
<p>I wanted to post this bc many women may be suffering from this condition but think they're just getting ingrown hairs or shaving bumps. There's no cure but treatment is easy and can drastically reduce the number of infections and their severity. If you think this might be you, go see a doctor because relief is possible!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's bacteria in your armpits that digests minerals in your sweat and produces volatile (smelly) compounds as a waste product.  This is deliberate - your body produces and secretes some of those chemicals on purpose, to feed those bacteria.  Those chemicals aren't present before puberty, mostly, which is why children don't smell bad, but teens smell <em>awful</em>.  Exactly why that happens, no one is entirely sure.  But it's probably something to do with attracting a mate.  The strong scent would indicate that the person has extra resources to waste on feeding unnecessary bacteria.</p>
<p>EDIT: A few people have asked why BO smells bad if it's supposed to attract a mate.  Well, it smells bad <em>now</em>, we have germ theory and hygiene.  Our fitness is demonstrated by our cleanliness now.  Technology and culture has changed faster than evolution.  Assuming that BO <em>was</em> used to attract mates, which is speculation anyway (not mine, but speculation of scientists).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though the difference between eccrine and apocrine sweat glands has been thoroughly explained, there's a little more to the &quot;why&quot; part of the question.</p>
<p>Before mammals had developed nipples and dedicated mammary glands to provide milk, some mammals just secreted milky sweat that was enriched with fats and protein from certain patches of skin, in order to feed their young.  The echidna is one of the few animals that still does this.  Though the thought of nursing your children on underarm or groin sweat is disgusting, the apocrine glands are still producing an &quot;enriched sweat&quot; that may have originally been used for that very purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey I get to put my undergrad anatomy study to work!
We actually have two types of sweat glands, eccrine and apocrine. Eccrine are found all over the body and typically have the odorless sweat you're talking about. Apocrine glands are found in the same parts of the body as hair follicles I.e. pubic areas and armpits, in which the sweat passes through the hair follicle before releasing the sweat. Apocrine glands also produce milky fluid that produces odor when bacteria come into contact with it. Incidentally these glands tend to develop body odor around the same time you grow hair in your armpits and groin, that is puberty, hence why most lessons about &quot;bodily changes&quot; during puberty include body odor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
