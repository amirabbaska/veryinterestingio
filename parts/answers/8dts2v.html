<p>If you don't brush your teeth then icky little things grow on them.  Sometimes those icky things can spread and make other parts of your body sick, including your heart.  So please always remember to brush your teeth, it's important for many reasons!  Also don't inject heroin or cocaine because you can get the same infection that way.  Have a great day kids!  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Periodontal disease leads to heavy colonization of the tissues around the teeth with dozens of species of bacteria. The strep species are the most to blame. Part of the perio disease process is the gum tissues are inflamed and bleed easily. This leads to frequent bacteremias (bacteria in the blood stream).  These bacteria can colonize different places in the cardio vascular system (valves, plaques, etc) and cause infective issues like endocarditis.  The infective issues aren't that common and happen with specific conditions, mostly.  The biggest link that's more sinister (happens slowly and won't show symptoms for a long time) is the immune response to the bacteria. Some immune responses cause collateral damage to tissues around them (in this case cardiovascular tissues) or the bacteria release toxins when they are destroyed. Both of these cause the end result of inflammation which progresses cardiovascular disease.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can get something called infective endocarditis. In simple terms, streptococcus a bacteria in the mouth can get into systemic circulation if you have poor dentition. Parts of this bacteria look the same as certain tissues in the heart. An appropriate immune response to the bacteria can lead to an inappropriate immune response against the heart, cause inflammation and damage , endocarditis. This is of particular concern if you have had valve replacement, as it is more likely you will suffer this immune reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand, the underlying issue is how chronic infection puts stress on all of your body systems, and particularly your heart. Poor dental care is a great way to end up with chronic low-grade infections. These infections contribute to inflammation throughout the body and force your body to spend more of its energy and resources on fighting and containing the infection. Few places in your body, unless you frequently have open wounds, are as susceptible to chronic infection as your mouth. Your dirty dirty mouth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
