		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a cosmic scale, the age of the entire universe is relatively young. The universe could exist for many trillions of years. With that said, it could be very possible that we are the first intelligent species in the universe, since there are so many different factors that are needed for continued evolution. So many life-ending scenarios needed to be avoided over billions of years to get us here. Could life really be that rare in the universe, or is it a natural consequence of the existence of matter and its properties? What do you think?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
