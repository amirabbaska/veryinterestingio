		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other people have pointed out, the answer is yes, but there’s something in the way you phrased the question I want to focus on. You said that gravity curves spacetime, and wondered if other forces do as well.</p>
<p>It’s much more accurate to think of matter and energy as curving spacetime, and this effect is <em>itself</em> gravity. Gravity <em>is</em> spacetime curvature. So in that sense it’s on a different footing than the other forces.</p>
<p>All of the forces are carried by fields - for example, the electric and magnetic forces are carried by the electromagnetic field - and fields have energy, so they do curve spacetime, which is to say, they gravitate. </p>
<p>EDIT: I should add this effect is absolutely tiny unless the strength of the electric or magnetic field is absolutely enormous. </p>
<p>EDIT EDIT: Probably the most famous (theoretical) example of this effect is a charged black hole. The spacetime curvature around such a black hole is different than for an uncharged one. That is to say, charged and uncharged black holes gravitate differently. This is <em>in addition to</em> the electromagnetic force that charged black holes have. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll provide two different explanations in case you find one more helpful than the other. The first one is mine, and the second one is quoted below from a Scientific American article. While mine speaks a little bit more loosely with certain definitions, it has been a useful way for me to think about some things.</p>
<p><strong>My explanation:</strong></p>
<p>One of the important things in physics to remember is that energy is equivalent across forms. By this I mean, electrical energy can be converted into mechanical energy and so forth. Joules was one of the big pioneers in this field and that's why &quot;Joules&quot; are used as a universal unit for energy. Another important thing to remember is that Einstein's special relativity paper showed that all forms of energy contribute to the mass of a body. This is often stated as the &quot;mass-energy equivalence,&quot; and people often point to the equation E = mc^2 to discuss this issue (although I would point out that the equation is actually E = γmc^2 , where γ is based on the velocity of the body; but that is a slightly different issue).  </p>
<p>As was realized by Newton, mass causes gravity, and it makes sense that this would somehow be true in general relativity as well. However, in special relativity, we already know that mass and energy are related, so logically it should be energy, not mass, that causes gravity. As we know, however, energy is just one component of a four-component four-dimensional momentum, so perhaps we should be including momentum as well. (Sidenote: this last sentence is a bit of a jump, but it relates to the &quot;γ&quot; value in Einstein's equation above, and its derivation might take us off the rails. However, if you're curious, this wikipedia article gives a good in-depth summary of the issue: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-momentum" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-momentum</a>).</p>
<p>In fact, it turns out that not only do the momentum and energy come into the equations, but also the way they are flowing or being transferred plays a role as well. The whole source is not just the energy, or even the energy and the momentum, but something nastier that should properly be called the &quot;stress-strain-energy-momentum tensor.&quot; But, because even physicists can’t get their mouths around this phrase, it is more commonly called the stress-energy tensor or &quot;energy-momentum tensor&quot; or even just the &quot;stress tensor&quot; (or sometimes, just Tμν). In Einstein's field equations for general relativity, the stress–energy tensor is the source of the gravitational field, just as mass density is the source of such a field in Newtonian gravity. While the stress-energy tensor contains many components (sixteen in all), just one of these components, the time-time component, is the actual energy density (which is proportional to the mass density).</p>
<p>This is where your question is answered. The time-time component of the stress-energy tensor accounts for the electromagnetic field having an influence on the space-time continuum, thereby causing gravitational fields under general relativity.</p>
<p>If you'd like a slightly more detailed coverage of this issue for an undergrad level understanding, this <a href="http://users.wfu.edu/ecarlson/modern/gr.pdf" target="_blank">lecture paper by Eric Carlson</a> is a very good overview in my opinion. I would also recommend his slides titled &quot;General Relativity&quot; for one of his undergrad courses (<a href="http://users.wfu.edu/ecarlson/modern/index.html" target="_blank">found at the bottom here</a>). To really get the full experience, put the slides in presentation mode and click your way through.</p>
<p><strong>Scientific American explanation:</strong></p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/do-electric-charges-and-m/" target="_blank">article in the Scientific American by Charles Torres</a> provides a better detailed answer in layman's terms than I could probably provide. I've quoted the article below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Electric charges and magnets do indeed &quot;distort space,&quot; but this happens on a couple of levels.</p>
<p>First, a word of background. According to the current best theory of gravitation, which is contained in Albert Einstein's famous general theory of relativity, a gravitational field represents a curvature of space-time, rather than a distortion of it. Anything that carries energy, momentum and stresses is a source of a gravitational field, that is, a curvature of space-time.</p>
<p>Electric charges and magnets are manifestations of certain types of matter, most particularly electrons. Since matter carries energy (via Einstein's famous relation that energy is mass times the speed of light squared), such objects will have a gravitational field and so they will distort space-time. So one way in which a charge or a magnet will distort space-time is by virtue of its matter. That answer may not sound too impressive, but there is more. . . .</p>
<p>You see, electromagnetic fields themselves carry energy (and momentum and stresses). The energy density carried by an electromagnetic field can be computed by adding the square of the electric field intensity to the square of the magnetic field intensity. As another example, a beam of light (produced from, say, a laser) consists of an electromagnetic field, and it will exert a force on charged particles. Thus the electromagnetic field carries momentum. Because an electromagnetic field contains energy, momentum, and so on, it will produce a gravitational field of its own. This gravitational field is in addition to that produced by the matter of the charge or magnet.</p>
<p>A simple example of the gravitational (or space-time curvature) effect of electric charges arises in the &quot;Reissner-Nordstrom&quot; solution to Einstein's gravitational field equations. This solution describes the gravitational field in the exterior of a spherical body with non-zero net electric charge. (The solution describing the special case in which the net electric charge is zero is the famous &quot;Schwarzschild solution&quot; to the gravitational field equations.) From the Reissner-Nordstrom solution, it is clear that the motion of test particles in the gravitational field of the spherically symmetric body depends on whether or not the body carries a charge. Just as the Schwarzschild solution can be extended to describe the famous phenomenon of a &quot;black hole,&quot; the Reissner-Nordstrom solution can be extended to describe a &quot;charged black hole.&quot; For an electrically charged black hole, the gravitational field of the hole includes a contribution due to the presence of an electric field.</p>
<p>I do not know (and I doubt) whether this aspect of gravitational theory (that electromagnetic fields produce gravitational fields) has been directly tested by experiment. The difficulty is that the gravitational field produced by a typical electromagnetic field you can produce in a laboratory is predicted to be very, very weak. A better place to look for gravitational effects due to electromagnetic fields would be in astrophysical objects carrying a significant net electric charge. Unfortunately, to my knowledge, such objects are expected to be hard to come by. So while the answer to the question is definitely &quot;yes&quot; according to theory, the experimental status of this effect appears to be somewhat open.</p>
<p>If you want to read more about some of these ideas, you might try Space, Time, and Gravity, by Robert Wald (University of Chicago Press, 1992). This book is aimed at non-specialists. For a more detailed mathematical treatment, you can consult any text on the general theory of relativity.</p>
