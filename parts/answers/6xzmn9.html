<p>Working with a studio is usually a lot more expensive than working with freelancers.  A couple of the important factors is that studios will guarantee or insure a delivery,work more professionally, and the overall process is much smoother especially when a client is involved and they're hands need to be held during the whole process.</p>
<p>Working with a freelancer comes with their own rates (usually way cheaper), but they can be flaky, work with illegal software, unprofessional and make the whole process very messy.  It's usually less kosher this way as sometimes the client or agency takes time or doesn't pay them at all for their work and the relationships in the freelancing realm is usually a bit rocky and a lot of walls are put up to avoid either party getting screwed.</p>
<p>Details about the process of CGI and why it's so expensive working in the studio as I mentioned above is because of the wages and overhead costs (equipment, licensing of software and plugins, and operational running costs).</p>
<p>A team of CGI Artists consist of people with very specific skillsets.  First we have the CG Supervisor, Art Director, and Technical Director.  These would carry the higher paying salaries of roughly $80,000 USD up to $150,000 USD, depending on your experience and the studio you're working for.</p>
<ul>
<li>CG Supervisor: Responsible for managing the team's schedule, works with budgets and quoting for jobs with the producers, involved in meetings and presentations for the production.</li>
<li>Art Director: Responsible for the quality of the team's work.  Makes sure the work is going in the right direction as per clients' and agencies' expectations.  Guides the artists with concepts, style frames, mood references, anything that will give the rest of the team the vision they need to get to the end product.</li>
<li>Technical Director: Responsible for bringing new technology to the department (scripts, plugins, etc) to lift the process and complexity of our quality to a higher degree.  They essentially concentrate on research &amp; development while assisting the team in finding solutions to problems that they the artists are facing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally you have the Artists, who generally will be involved in their own specific task in the CG workflow.  You will also have Generalists who makeup everyone's skills, but only at the least at a competent level, while specialists would be more inclined at delivering their tasks at a much higher level.  Depending on the studio and their experience, and Junior, Mid, or Senior level, these artists can make a salary of anywhere from $20,000 USD to $100,000 USD</p>
<p>Within the artists you have Leads who will usually be in charge of a certain stage in the CG Pipelines (Modelling, Animation, Shading, Compositing).  These team leads will be at the very least Senior level that possess a leadership trait and can help guide the team through the process.  Sometimes You will need a team of Modellers to create a robot, or you will need a team of rendering artists to light a few shots in sequence.  These leads will be there to micro-manage them so that everything comes together as one.</p>
<ul>
<li>Concept Artist: Responsible for drawing / painting references for mood, styleframes, concepts for characters, monsters, environments.  This can also include storyboarding which tells the story of the animation in frames drawn by hand to visualize the composition and camera movements that compliment the action of what's happening in each vignette.</li>
<li>Modeller: Responsible for bringing the concepts to life.  They would bring the 2D Concepts or references in to the 3D world and &quot;sculpt&quot; them so that we can use them as assets in the application of shots.  They can be characters, environments, assets like trees, rocks, stones.</li>
<li>Animator:  Responsible for using the storyboard and assets created by the modeller to create the shots in 3D.  This involves camera move, and character animation - which can get technical as they need to be rigged so that they are able to have all the controls needed (posing, facial expressions, etc).</li>
<li>Shading / Rendering:  Responsible for taking the shots from the animators and making them look realistic or whichever direction the project is going.  It could be cartoonish, or it could be photoreal.  They would set up the lights and make sure the materials on objects react the correct way (metallic, rubber, subsurface, translucent, etc).</li>
<li>Compositer:  They will take the sequence rendered from the rendering artist and polish the final look of the shots.  They will add or remove passes from the shots (more reflections, ambient occlusion, motion blur, depth of field), play with the warmth or coolness of the overall image, add effects, and run a final grade through them.</li>
</ul>
<p>During this whole process there will be milestones and that means there will be rounds of feedback given by the client and agencies.  This will overall slow the process down and add more buffer time to the schedule.  So paying a whole team of artists for months of work can start getting extremely expensive, while keeping up with licenses, plugins, and software packages that are now all at subscription models.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It's not just a bunch of guys drawing on a computer. There is a combination of the actual drawing and the computer processes needed to add all of the things that make the item look real. It starts with a model which is drawn by an artist and put into the computer and rendered as a 3d wireframe image - like a skeleton. The computer programmers create processes to add motion, shading, texture, transparency, translucency, lighting, camera angles and zoom, etc. It may take almost an entire day to render a very short sequence (a 10 second walk from point a to point b for example) and when it's done and you look at it, you may find out that the character doesn't appear to be on the ground or the nose is misplaced because the math wasn't quite right. So the computer programmer has to recalculate and try it again. (The Toy Story DVD has some really funny mis-renders in the special features.) So it takes a whole slew of computer programmers and artists and hours and hours to create even one little sequence.</p>
<p>Some movies still use animatronics for things like hands that need to grab actors etc. But in the long run, CGI can be cheaper and look more realistic than animatronics. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So it seems as though it is a combination of wages and the equipment used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cost of technology is always improving and using the latest is always expensive.  When toy story was created in 1995 it used a huge rack of high end servers (a render farm) to render each scene.  You could probably do the same thing nowadays on single high end workstation.  Unfortunately technology has moved on and audiences expect much better fidelity and realism, so to create a new CGI film you still need to use a render farm built of really high end server grade computers.  On top of this you have the artists time, the more the fidelity increases then the longer the artists have to model, sculpt, paint and light everything.</p>
<p>In 1996 you needed a cutting edge PC to play Quake but now you can run it on a Raspberry PI.  Destiny 2 however still requires an expensive PC to run full detail.</p>
<p>However CGI isn't always more expensive.  Look at any film that has a large crowd scene such as a battle in Game of Thrones. It is expensive to do it in CGI but it would be much more expensive to hire several thousand stunt performers and horses to do the same thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: Because high-end CGI involves such a high level of detail that it takes a <em>lot</em> of artist time to pull off, and that means spending a lot of money on wages and related overhead. </p>
<p>Say we're talking about a tree. If you go outside and take a picture of the tree, boom. Done. </p>
<p>But how long would it take someone to manually <em>copy</em> that photo, with a photo-realistic level of detail, each and every leaf, branch, and square inch of bark? A long time, that's how. Hours and hours. Days even.</p>
<p>And that's starting with a pre-existing referent for your tree. What if they had to come up with that tree from scratch? As would be the case with any CG object that doesn't actually exist? Now in addition to however long it takes to just draw the thing, you've got to take the time to <em>design</em> it. And unlike someone just drawing the tree for its own sake, <em>this</em> tree has to fit in with the director's cinematographic choices for the rest of the scene (e.g., branches need to go here and here, but not there, the light needs to come from <em>that</em> direction so shadows go over <em>there</em>, etc.), which place additional constraints on design choices. </p>
<p>Now we are talking about CG here, not completely hand-drawn animation. That means there are a lot of design, drafting, and animation tools that save an <em>enormous</em> amount of time compared to doing everything manually. But that notwithstanding, producing the level of detail required by a truly realistic animation still takes a huge amount of artist time. </p>
<p>And because artists don't work for free, that makes high-end CG really expensive. Equipment (both hardware and software) is also expensive, but those are often capital investments that can be made over time and used for multiple projects (though not always!). The <em>real</em> expense is going to come in the form of labor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason movies are so expensive
Production value(things on screen) cost money!</p>
<p>Take game of thrones -
The production costs money because you have all the actors, prosthetics and the costumes and the sets</p>
<p>The cgi costs money because you have the actors: like dragons (that literally have to be built from nothing)
So they go through a concept phase - then a modeling phase(size and shape) (then a detailing phase) then a texturing phase(color) then a lookdevelopment phase (shaders (how light reacts to the object) example is it shiny meta or rusted metal or skin or fur etc) </p>
<p>Now you have the shape of the dragon .... and we need it to move</p>
<p>So you rig it! Add in all the bones (chances are you have a rigging system in your studio so this is somewhat automated - but dragons still need wings etc - and kraken need tentacle rigs etc) -
All you digital doubles is the actors need scans(of the actors - probably photogrammetry)</p>
<p>Now the object can move but it doesn't until someone animates it (or you use motion capture (which still needs some clean up))</p>
<p>Animation is VERY slow - it's a process of moving a puppet around inside the computers so that the dragon feels heavy and angry etc.... such a unique skill set</p>
<p>Now the background!!
Start with concepts then mattepaintings then cgi sets - snow, simulations for cracking ice, fire etc
Add dothracki on horses (start from the beginning to make these) - add castles and unsullied and mountains and clouds!</p>
<p>Ok now you need lots of computers to render the damn scene and the technology is constantly changing </p>
<p>When I started I used
3ds max and vray</p>
<p>Then
Maya Houdini and mantra and vray</p>
<p>Then
Houdini and arnold</p>
<p>Now</p>
<p>Houdini and redshift</p>
<p>And the computers need to be replaced every 3 years or so because of RAM and GPU CPU etc</p>
<p>Add the fact that all of your artists have gone to school for around 4 years to learn all this so they make in average around $80,000/yr (that's a guess after being in the industry for 10 years)</p>
<p>Low end is around 30,000 to start and 150,000-200,000 when supervising </p>
<p>And you can make more on the flagship shows at major studios </p>
<p>People in the industry complain a lot but It's a good living - it becomes more of a lifestyle because you're always working on learning new things - but it's also never boring and it's a way to use your art school diploma to make a living - plus you can say &quot;I worked on that show&quot;</p>
<p>For whatever that's worth!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
