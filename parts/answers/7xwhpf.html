		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was a competitive skier and for me it was always the coach / teammates. In most downhill ski events, you get a short distance before turns or gates start where you will see skiers skating to pick up speed faster. I always thought it as a the last way someone could yell encouragement and get your adrenaline pumping.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, it was mostly the support staff (physiotherapists, trainers, team doctors) that were helping us get prepped for the race. Typically my coaches were on course watching and passing info to the start over radios and my teammates were busy prepping for their runs or waiting at the bottom. The yelling is to help you get pumped up and feel supported for your run because a ski race is a lot like a high adrenaline sprint.
