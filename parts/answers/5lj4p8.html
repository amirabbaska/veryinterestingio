		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you're misunderstanding the fundamental attribution error. It is not meant to be an explanatory framework for understanding human action and conduct. The fundamental attribution errror is a bias. It is a concept that describes the tendency among persons to attribute causes for an event to be either external (situational) or internal (dispositional) wrongly.</p>
<p>Imagine that you're part of a sports team. Your team is your in-group and you play against another team, an out-group. Now, it so happens that the other team score the first goal. According to attribution theory, the tendency on your team would be to make external or situational attributions to explain the goal. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>The other team got lucky</li>
<li>One of your players slipped</li>
<li>Your goal keeper was distracted</li>
</ul>
<p>However, when your team scores you'd have a tendency to explain that through internal attribution. &quot;We scored because we are better than them, ergo: the goal was fully deserved.&quot; It might actually have been the other way around: your team got lucky and the other team, having better players, possessed advantageous dispositions, but because of the tendency to place attributions erroneously, we cannot see that clearly. It is an important dynamic in understanding in-group/out-group behavior, not a factual description of human behavior. There should be no contradiction between Social information Processing and the fundamental attribution error.</p>
