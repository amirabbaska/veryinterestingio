		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of modern technology contains capacitors! These are like energy buckets, little batteries that fill up when you put a current through them, and discharge otherwise. 10 seconds is the time it takes most capacitors to discharge enough for the electronics they’re powering to stop working. That’s why when you turn your PC off at the wall, things like an LED on your motherboard take a few seconds to disappear. You probably could wait a different time, but 10 seconds is the shortest time you can be sure everything’s discharged.</p>
<p>30 seconds is better since most people don't realize just how long seconds are, and so if they tried waiting ten seconds they might find they actually end up waiting much less than ten seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While there are capacitors in electronics and they do hold a charge, the connection to your ISP is slightly more complex than just that.  The communications protocols used by the equipment to talk to each other have certain timeouts set and these can be changed by various ISPs.  For instance, the ISP I worked at had a 20s timeout configured between the modem and the dslam (DSL Access Module - used by the telephone company).  If you unplug your modem for a second then, depending on when the last &quot;are you alive&quot; packet was sent it may not reset the connection.  If you go 30 seconds it was guaranteed.</p>
<p>Note that this is NOT the case in many settings, but it does happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the fact that capacitors take time to discharge is true its not the real reason we wait for 30 seconds before plugging modems back in.  </p>
<p>First of all, most connectivity problems that are caused by the modem and not some other part of the network are some sort of software problems. The modern modem/router is effectively a complete computer, with an OS and and some applications running which are responsible for all the things the modem does. When an application gets stuck for whatever reason in might cause the whole thing to misbehave and you to experience connectivity problems. Restarting the router will cause the whole thing to startup again so all the applications start from scratch and nothing is stuck. When you unplug the router you're forcing it to shut down, and when you plug it back in you're booting it up again. If the capacitance of the circuits were the reason for the 30 sec delay, that would mean that if you plug it earlier, the router would still be on, as if you never unplugged it. You can try and see that this is impossible. If your connectivity problems are caused by some software error on the router, then unplugging it and plugging it immediately after would fix the problems without the need for the delay.  </p>
<p>Sometimes, the connectivity problems aren't caused by our network or our router but by our ISP. When you disconnect for more than 30 seconds from most ISPs you get a fresh network connection, with a fresh IP and all. You can check this if your router boots fast enough. Check your IP address, restart the router as fast as you can and if it connects fast enough you might have still the same IP. If you shut it down, wait and then start it back up you'll see that you have an new IP address.  </p>
<p>So the reason you wait for 30 seconds between restarts is because you never know what causes your connectivity problems, the router's software or the ISP (or something else) and it's easier to wait every time just to make sure you cover most of the common problems.  </p>
<p>P.S.: A hardware reason that you might have problems is from overheating. If for some reason your router is overheating, shutting it down and waiting would give it more time to cool off. If that happens regularly though you might need to consider another router....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some mentions of remaining electricity already. While this is true, it is not the full story when it comes to routers. The internet as you might know, is pretty much a bunch of computers with routers in between. These routers have information about one another, to make sure that data sent from one computer reaches its destination as fast as possible. Sometimes this information is not very good, and the route your data takes is inefficient. A reset might help the situation. The data is stored in these routers for some time. Waiting for 30 seconds ensures that all or most traces of your computer is removed from the network, and a better route might be established.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
