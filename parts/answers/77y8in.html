		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having children can be a protective factor, but it can also in some contexts increase suicide risk. A very large Danish study found that whereas parents were generally less likely to commit suicide than non-parents (especially parents of young children, for whom the risk was particularly low), parents who had recently lost a child were on the other hand at greatly increased risk of suicide, particularly if the deceased child had died from suicide. Parents of children who had been admitted to a psychiatric ward due to psychiatric problems were also at higher risk than non-parents. So it depends. When you adjust for other factors of interest (like income and ethnicity) parental status seems to lose a lot of its explanatory power when you look at 'the big picture'.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actual suicide in humans is probably driven more by a huge host of social and other factors and is unlikely to be able to be reduced down to the specific biological factors you mention...but while I can't tell you much about suicide I can tell you about those factors.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>on one hand, having children fulfills our biological goal so I'd imagine there would be less incentive to stick around if things came to that, but on the other hand there could be increased incentive to stick around to care for and protect the kids.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In humans, the second factor far outweighs the first. We may not see this in suicide but we do see it in lifespan trends.  This is not the case for all animals however.  Humans live a long time.  We live decades longer than other apes, even when provided with equivalent medical care.  This implies that natural selection has been pushing humans to live longer and longer...it's thought that this is not just to increase care for our own children, but also for our children's children.  But consider a hunter-gatherer human who died immediately after having children (for whatever reason).  The child would also be at higher risk of death due to losing a caretaker.  And parental care in humans lasts more than a decade. There's no fitness benefit from having a child that itself dies before it can reproduce. You can contrast this with something like a salmon, which dies immediately after reproducing and doesn't provide any direct care for its offspring after laying eggs.  </p>
<p>You also need to consider a third factor: if you keep living after you have had children you can have <em>more</em> children.  Natural selection favors individuals with more successfully raised children over those with less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
