		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This would indeed be untrue for simple quantum systems, the same initial system can indeed yield different outcomes. But dice and coins are incredibly complex quantum systems which have the funny behavior of behaving classically. A physical coin should, given the same initial conditions, <em>overwhelmingly</em> land the same way each time. In fact, some researchers at Stanford did just that by building a coin flipping robot,  </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can we really have &quot;the same initial system&quot; though?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is some technical reasons calling something the same system works, I'll try to explain it.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>at least some variables have to change, the simplest being space, time, or both</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether%27s_theorem" target="_blank">Noether's theorem</a> for this. The laws of physics are unchanging to certain symmetries. If our universe, or at least part of it, obeys a symmetry, there is a corresponding conservation law. Here's two examples,  </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Momentum is the corresponding conserved quantity when the physical laws are invariant to spatial translations.  </p>
</li>
<li>Energy is the corresponding conserved quantity when the physical laws are invariant to time translations.  </li>
</ul>
<p>In physics, the physical laws must describe all dynamics involved and if they obey these symmetries, then we know translations in time and space change nothing and we're safe to say &quot;same system.&quot; Even in situations where the symmetry is broken (if you drop an apple, its momentum is not conserved, but the apple-Earth system momentum is) we can show how big the break is and often can figure out how to make it small as possible.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the case of coins or dice, that cutoff may throw out stuff like temperature distribution, the exact positions of atoms, air currents, and many more... and yet we call it the &quot;same&quot; initial conditions</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I say same initial conditions, I mean literally the equations of motion written down and solved. There is only one solution possible because of the principle of least action. When you move to repeatability, you then have to show (numerically or painfully by hand) that the fluctuations you see will remain bounded near the same outcome such as coin trajectory. As a striking example of when outcomes are not bounded are weather patterns on Earth which are very sensitive to initial conditions, so even &quot;look-alike&quot; systems can have thousands of dramatically different outcomes.</p>
<p>But not all systems behave this way and we can even define the variance required (in an initial condition like air temperature) before the physics dynamics become unreliable if you had just assumed the average initial conditions. Check out chaos theory for more on this. Either way, we can indeed make a &quot;sameness&quot; criteria mathematically.  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>but do we really know, or even can we know, whether any of the variables we decide to cut out from our definition of sameness might or might not influence the observed outcome?  </p>
<p>can we really say the same doesn't apply to simple quantum systems which we can barely observe?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bell inequality experimentally rules out any locally hidden quantum variables. Either that variable doesn't exist (thus true randomness) or the variables are global (and propagate faster than light). Most physicists dislike the second option. There are a handful of ways out of the first option, but none of them offer a way to physically do anything about it, from your POV, it's true randomness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a great demonstration used in philosophy of science courses where a coin-flipping machine can be adjusted to deliver 100% heads (or tails). Takes a little tweaking to get it just right, but it's certainly possible. See page 2 of <a href="http://statweb.stanford.edu/~susan/papers/headswithJ.pdf" target="_blank">this</a> .pdf.</p>
<p>In that context, it is possible to standardize a random number generator so that it is repeatable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes(at least within reason), and that is why casinos require you to throw craps die and they must hit the backboard(which is curved) to count as a valid throw. People had learned how to throw die almost perfectly without being detectable. I can flip a coin of any weight at about 65-70% accuracy if I practice with that coin for a few minutes first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if quantum mechanics was not fundamentally random any deterministic &quot;hidden variables&quot; would have to be non-local, due to <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bell-theorem/" target="_blank">Bell's Theorem</a>. So the entire universe influences the evolution of each small region. So when you roll the die a second time, the universe has evolved and you don't have the same exact conditions. But these are incredibly tiny effects, swamped by thermal effects locally for example, in practice, you could probably get a machine to roll a die many thousands of times with the same side landing face up.</p>
