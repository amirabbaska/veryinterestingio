		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When air gets hot, it changes the density so you have swirling patches of hotter &amp; cooler air.</p>
<p>Air of different densities passes light differently, creating those shadows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like others have said, its because the hot/cold air mixture distorts the image by bending transmitted light. </p>
<p>Fun side fact, mirages are also caused because of this phenomenon. Except that in mirages, air gets hotter and hotter as you get closer to the ground so the incoming light from a distance straight in front of you keeps bending as it gets closer to the ground until it becomes parabolic so you get the illusion of a reflection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heat wave changes the density of its surrounding medium. Therefore refraction occurs as light passes through a medium going from 1 density into another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing is blocking the light, rather the light is just being bent off-course by higher and lower densities of air, and is landing somewhere else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
