		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have stated, some trains have a conical shape to the wheels that lets them rotate at different speeds. Others don't, and the wheels slide/slip creating a deafening screeching sound. It's especially loud when the train is travelling uphill and needs to exert a lot of force on the wheels.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Train wheels are actually conical. So, when a train turns, it slides to the larger part of the cone on the outside wheel and the smaller part on the inside wheel. That way the wheels still turn at the same rate, but their radii are different. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of light rail systems (BART, VTA, etc) don't have the conical wheels and whenever they make a turn or take a slightly curved parh the outer wheels start slipping and make a very annoying loud sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a <a href="http://i.imgur.com/skXgNKK.gif" target="_blank">gif</a> showing how.  Basically the wheels are conical and the contact point with the rails change during a turn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the conical wheel explanation, any curve they go around is very slight and some slippage/difference in travel distance is very negligible. It's not like making a full lock turn in a car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
