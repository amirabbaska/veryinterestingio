		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Ads are normally from ad networks and require the end user's browser to pull the information from that network's servers - the main website references that ad network. Adblock stops your browser from retrieving the ad, so<br> you instead see the part of the website that is normally covered by the ad, which they have put the note on. The reason they can't just put the ad there is that they wouldn't get revenue from doing so - the ad network needs to count your browser hitting the ad and doesn't trust the hosting website to count for them. If they did, adblock would need to find a different way to block ads. If adblock becomes too much of a revenue issue for ad networks, they will likely see them find a way for the host website to provide the ads directly.  </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I didn't see an answer for the <em>how</em>, so here goes:<br><br>One way websites actually test for the presence of adblock is to have a &quot;dummy&quot; file called something like <code>advertisement.js</code> that will have just a little bit of code in it, say, one variable called <code>isAdblockOff</code> set to true. Most AdBlocks will filter based on file name as well, so if there are any ad-related keywords, AdBlock will decide it's an ad. <br><br>If the dummy file gets blocked, it won't load, so when some other bit of code checks <code>isAdblockOff</code>, it comes up as false, so they display another message, like &quot;Hey, our ads aren't bad, we need them to make money, please don't block them!&quot; or whatever you see there.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>How do ad blockers know what is an ad they should block, and how to block them?<br><br>Some really cool people browse the most popular websites and manually create instructions in a special syntax that ad blockers understand. Your ad blocker likely downloads a bunch of filters, which are simply text files with thousands of these instructions, so most of the websites you visit will be ad-free.<br><br><a href="https://easylist-downloads.adblockplus.org/easylist.txt" target="_blank">This is what the most common filter looks like</a>.<br><br>These lists are regularly maintained to add instructions on how to block new types of ads and how to block ads on pages that bypass ad blockers.<br><br>Web sites do try to bypass ad blockers all the time, but someone simply makes a new instruction to block the updated ad and pushes an update to one of these filters. Your ad blocker downloads it seamlessly and if you didn't visit the website during a very specific time frame, you won't even noticed the website has tried to bypass your ad blocker.<br><br>If the website simply adds a message that says &quot;hey, you're using ad blocker, please don't :(&quot; whenever you're using it, the filter maintainers will generally not push an update to remove the message, since it's not an ad.<br><br>These filters work for things other than ads. For example, there are filters that block tracking code, social media buttons, and even filters that block annoying &quot;don't use ad block&quot; messages. The most robust ad blockers have settings so you can add the custom filters you find on the internet.<br><br>edit: Just so you can see how often these things are updated: EasyList was updated while I was writing this post. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

Since only a small percentage of people use AdBlock it's much more effective to appeal to their appreciation for your actual service than to try to cheat them into seeing ads.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Not sure if this as mentioned, but a lot of websites just have(as part of the page design) certain messages where ads would normally be.  So you would only see the graphic if you had adblock, otherwise the ad would cover it up.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Ad blockers work because the ads that you typically see are not hosted on the same server as the site you're viewing, but elsewhere. Ad blockers know most of these ad servers, and block requests to them. Generally, the site just puts empty space there and tags it with something that says &quot;put adverts here&quot;. Sometimes, you'll see those banners instead.<br><br>Adverts are more than just the image you see. There's also code that records your viewing it and maybe clicking it, so that the site owner can get paid for it. That's all hosted by the ad server. If the site owner put ads up there by hand, it's not going to earn them any money. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>For Google AdSense you can tell if someone is using AdBlock pretty easily.<br><br>If you've put the code that will show AdSense on that page, then you can write your own JavaScript that will detect any <code>ins</code> tags on the page, or even <code>iframe</code> tags but only if you know the page doesn't have iframes on it normally.<br><br>That's because when a page loads, AdSense ads use JavaScript and AJAX to call all the stuff they need from the servers at Google. An ad dynamically creates <code>ins</code> and <code>iframe</code> elements to make the ad show up. (On a tangent, that's why the HTML on a page loads quickly first, then it takes a few seconds more to load any ads.)<br><br>AdBlock stops those elements from even displaying but does not affect the original code you put on the page to load AdSense.<br><br>Then if there aren't any <code>ins</code> elements on the page the JavaScript will append a bit of text asking them to consider turning AdBlock off.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Imagine a hairdresser with a new business model. Instead of paying for the haircut, you have to watch ads on a screen behind a semi-transparent mirror in front of you during the haircut. Of course, advertisers want their ads to be shown to people who are interested in their stuff. So car ads should be shown to persons who are currently looking for a new car, makeup ads are shown to women and baby stuff is shown to young mothers, fathers and pregnant women. So the hairdresser gives the customers a card where they specify their hobbies, interests and current situation.  <br>  <br>Now there are two options.  <br>Number one, the hairdresser scans your card, and the computer shows the interests. The hairdresser now has to chose, which ads he has to show, how many of them, and report afterwards to the advertisers. He also has to delete old ads and get new ones from the advertisers and ask advertisers if they are interested in advertising on his business. This is a lot of additional work for the hairdresser. He could make mistakes and lose money or even advertisers.  <br>Number two, the card is scanned and the interests are send over the internet (anonymised) to an advertisement company. This company selects the videos, streams them to the screen at the hairdresser and counts the views. They also manage all the ads, remove old ones, get new ones and so on. So the hairdresser can concentrate on what he does best, making haircuts without having to deal with managing ads.  <br>What would an adblock be in this example? You, as a customer, have a magical device that can somehow block the video stream to the monitor in front of you. The hairdresser only concentrates on cutting your hair, so he doesn't notice. But instead of showing some error message on the screen, like 'cannot connect to stream' it shows a message like 'please don't use an adblock' instead. If he wanted to show an actual ad instead, he would have to do all of Number one again.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Web ads are just like the paper posters, the adblock measures the &quot;paper&quot; size and knows it's an ad because it's linked to a blacklisted address that the ad company uses and the size matches a template for an ad.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I've only seen answers giving reasoning for static adverts with the AdBlock message behind the original advert. How do they work when they block access to a website unless the adblock is disabled? Once you disable it the website loads fine - typically for streaming sites.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Basically, ads are from a different server than the host, who charges to have ads on their site. Imagine if the ad server was from Google but you were on Reddit, for example. What AdBlock does is identify traffic from the ad server and block it from reaching your computer.<br><br>As such, script can be added to recognize when a page doesn't load an ad, telling the user to turn it back on or else the site won't receive income. Alternatively (as used by ITV Player in the UK), the site may actually prevent content from loading if the ad server is blocked.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
