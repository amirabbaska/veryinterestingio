		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's really a case of no-one having bothered to make one until recently.</p>
<p>There are some technical hangups like having to duplicate certain wires on both sides of the connector but that's more a design nuisance than a real technical problem.</p>
<p>USB has been notorious for issues with plugging it in wrong-side up since it's earliest days but the difficulty of creating and getting everyone to agree to use a standardized connector is such that no one bothered to try to fix it.</p>
<p>Apple may not have come up with the idea of a reversible connector but they made the idea of one popular with &quot;Lightning&quot; the standard connector for the iPhone et all. Apple has the philosophy of using proprietary connectors whenever they can get away with it, so they had the upside of being able to develop lightning without needing to pass it by any standards bodies first. In other words less red tape.</p>
<p>USB-C was released partly as an answer to it, and partly to meet European law that mandates that all cellphones use the same charging connector. A law that Apple lobbied strongly against.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a long time, they designed connectors purposely asymmetric so that people COULDN'T plug them in wrong. Look at DVI or VGA or old style parallel port. (The connections are parallelograms (EDIT: Trapezoids... I didn't pass 5 year old test of &quot;shapes in holes&quot;. apparently) , not squares.)</p>
<p>It simply took people a while to figure out that &quot;hey, we can design smaller connections now and they're no need to have them be &quot;keyed&quot; like there was in the past.&quot;</p>
<p>Basically, back in the day the state of technology dictated that we needed connectors that only plug in one way. And it takes a while for something so ingrained like that to go away. Also asymmetric connectors &quot;hold on&quot; better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They had this ages ago.  The connector was round, with a pin in the middle.  This charging standard was great, but it only did charging.  The whole USB thing came up to do data and charging at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on: not that long ago, connecting peripherals and hardware to computers was a crapshoot of different connectors and wires, and everything needed to be keyed correctly in their connections to work properly.   As such, connectors were asymmetrical and differently sized to prevent damage if they were put in the wrong spot, which still happened frequently.</p>
<p>When USB came out, it set a standard for connections, and allowed flexibility where there hadn't been much before.  But, manufacturers know that if you make something idiot-proof, someone somewhere will build a better idiot, and to minimize the possibility of damage they kept them keyed a certain way.</p>
<p>Or nobody could be bothered.   One of those two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a USB connector as a digital freeway.  You have two north-bound lanes and two south-bound lanes.  If you were to &quot;disconnect&quot; the freeway and reconnect it, as long as the north-bound lanes match up with the north-bound lanes, and south-bound lanes also match with south-bound lanes, then the freeway works as expected.</p>
<p>If, after disconnecting the freeway, you flip one part of the freeway before reconnecting, north-bound lanes match up with south-bound lanes and everything becomes a mess.</p>
<p>To solve this problem, and allow all freeways to connect in any configuration, you need a special interchange.   This special interchange is an add-on expense which manufacturers decided to skip when USB first came out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
