		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes nothing.  For a popular show, when the lead actor(s) renegotiate their contracts, they may ask for an Executive Producer credit as a sign of their status, or because it gives them a small portion of the profits.  </p>
<p>Sometimes they may actually have a larger role in determining the direction of the show and the writing, or may even choose to direct an episode - see Bryan Cranston in Breaking Bad.</p>
<p>Sometimes they may have lent their name and status to helping a show get made, but have little to do with it afterwards.  See Martin Scorsese and Boardwalk Empire - he directed the pilot and was involved in developing the show, but didn't have much of a hands on role after that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Executive producers make much more money on the back end. For a TV show, giving an actor an exec producer credit boosts their earnings considerablyâ€”especially in the residuals. In Seinfeld, for example, Jason Alexander admitted that the reason he didn't continue with the series is because there was no upside for him. Whereas, as an Executive Producer, Jerry Seinfeld stood to make billions in syndication.</p>
<p>Bryan Cranston's Executive Producer credit in Breaking Bad probably increases his earnings in syndication by a factor of 10 (if not 100).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in the film industry and am an 'executive producer' on smaller productions. Simply that means I work with the client stakeholder to hire any and all staff (either directly or indirectly) for a production. I also handle budgeting and empower a director to execute the project vision, etc.</p>
<p>In professional productions, there is a consistent standard which you can read about here. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_crew" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film_crew</a></p>
<p>When things are altered beyond this 'standard set of roles' someone can handle multiple roles such as acting and putting forth the financials to make the production and may gain multiple credits in IMDB or as the credits role... </p>
<p>Summary: there are many ways to skin a cat ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
