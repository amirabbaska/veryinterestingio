		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I can vouch for the answer described <a href="http://www.sciencefocus.com/qa/are-there-rainbows-other-planets" target="_blank">here</a>. Since I see no reason to reinvent the wheel, allow me to copy that answer here with a couple of annotations and links:<br><br>___<em><br>The ingredients required to make a rainbow are sunlight and raindrops. Currently, there is no other planet known to have liquid water on its surface or in sufficient quantities in the atmosphere to make rain. However, other liquid droplets could refract sunlight and spread it out into its component colors, just as water droplets do on Earth.<br><br>On Saturn’s moon Titan, for example, the atmosphere is rich in liquid methane droplets that almost certainly form rain. Titan’s atmosphere is extremely hazy, meaning that direct sunlight is probably uncommon, but there is still a chance that methane rainbows could form. If they do exist, they would look very similar to terrestrial rainbows, but would be somewhat broader due to the different refractive index of methane compared to water.<br><br>Another similar phenomenon, [called a &quot;glory,&quot;](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glory</a></em>(optical_phenomenon)), occurs on Venus (pictured <a href="http://www.slate.com/content/dam/slate/blogs/bad_astronomy/2014/03/12/venus_glory.jpg.CROP.original-original.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>) and is caused by droplets of sulphuric acid that are present in the planet’s atmosphere.<br><br>edit: corrected the link</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>On another planet it would depend on what the droplets in the air are made of and the type of sun its orbiting. Another liquid would have a different refractive index so the the angle of the rainbow (how big it looks in the sky) would be different. The type of sun would affect the spectra (the band's of colors) in the rainbow. A red sun would make the red part of the rainbow brighter, although all of the spectrum would still probably be there</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The intensity of the colors would not necessarily be the same, if the atmosphere of this planet had a different opacity graph than ours (<a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Atmospheric_electromagnetic_opacity.svg</a>).  The intensity of each color in the rainbow could also change based on the color of the star / sun's light.<br><br>You would not observe any new colors that are not present in earth rainbows due to not being able to see outside the visible spectrum, not because those colors would not be present in the new rainbow or would be too faint (though they may indeed be faint).  Infrared and ultraviolet light is present in rainbows on earth, too, you just can't see it.<br><br>The order of the colors would not change.  It would not reverse order, outside of a double rainbow.  I think it's possible that the secondary, reversed rainbow could actually be the more prominent one, if the droplets are positioned and shaped correctly, but I'm not really prepared to defend that position.  It would be unlikely to be the common case I think.<br><br>The angle and size of the rainbow could be different, as stated in /u/drawliphant's comment.<br><br>This may be interesting to you: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow#Rainbows_on_Titan" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow#Rainbows_on_Titan</a></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>All rainbows would have the same colours in the same order. It has to do with <a href="http://www.ces.fau.edu/ces/nasa/images/Energy/VisibleLightSpectrum.jpg" target="_blank">frequencies of visible light on the <strong>electromagnetic spectrum</strong></a> which is the same for all light anywhere in the Universe.<br><br>A rainbow is caused by liquid droplets (in our case, water) 'refracting' light. <a href="http://i.stack.imgur.com/eejRR.gif" target="_blank">A prism</a> acts very similar to a liquid droplet. White light from the Sun hits the droplet and the white light is 'split' into all the different colours that make up white light. <br><br>Now, interestingly, white light is just a bit of every colour hitting your eye at the same time. Black is just the opposite - none of each colour is hitting your eye.<br><br>But back to the prism - the prism has a certain 'refractive index' which basically determines how drastically this white light will be split up. So, on earth you'd have water droplets with a certain refractive index (about 1.3) which splits it up, but on another theoretical planet with a different kind of rain, such as liquid nitrogen, it would have a different refractive index (about 1.2) which is a bit less than water. A lot more factors come into play here, such as what kind of air the droplets are surrounded by, since the air itself has its own refractive index. <br><br>So let's assume we've got both liquid water (1.3) and liquid nitrogen (1.2) falling in a vacuum (1.0). Since liquid nitrogen has a smaller refractive index, we would see the light get split up less drastically than for the water rain. This would actually result in a narrower rainbow, and the ends of the rainbow (the pots of gold!) would be closer together. But the colours would be the same.<br><br>I still like the idea of differently coloured rainbows! There's no limits to our imagination.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>To add some... <br>It's important to remember that only two things would contribute to the colors in a rainbow :<br><br><em> the spectral composition of the light <del>source</del> being refracted <br></em> the perceptual capabilities of our visual system <br><br>So, in places where the major source of light differed in some important respect from that of our sun (which is more or less white; i.e., having power evenly distributed over the visual spectrum), or <em>where the atmosphere absorbs different portions of the spectrum</em> (as /u/The_camperdave pointed out) the rainbow might appear different. However, it's important to note that there will never be much in the way of <em>new</em> colours in these rainbows, as the ones we're familiar with already span the range of electro-magnetic frequencies which are visible to us. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Rainbows form when white light changes mediums. That is, enters a transparent gas, liquid, or solid. When this happens, it causes refraction. Refraction happens because the new medium causes the light to change direction. However, the different wavelengths cannot turn as easy as others. Shorter wavelengths (violet, Blue, green) have a sharper turn, this is why we see the white light split into its parts. This is why the sky is blue, and why sunsets have those red orange yellow green pattern, because of the light entering our atmosphere. This is why a prism creates a rainbow as well, and why diamonds are so appealing. <br><br>This is physics and happens regardless of the planet you are on. That being said, a planet must have some medium for it to work. If you took a prism to another planet, you could make a rainbow. Of course, you also have to have a sun that emits white light.<br><br>So, rainbows, don't exist on all planets, but they do exist on some (most?) other planets.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>As there is no answer yet, I'll give a simple answer, but I only have 2 years undergrad physics experience.  <br><br>Rainbows in the sky are produced by rain, if we assumed rain fell on another planet, they would have exactly the same rainbow as us, and it would be impossible for the colours to be in a different order.  <br>Rainbows in the sky are produced from raindrops but could equally be produced from other transparent shapes, like a prism.  <br>White light enters a raindrop, refracts off the inside of the droplet twice before exiting the droplet again, but now that white light has split up, just like in a prism, red light will refract at a smaller angle than yellow or green or violet, and so we see the full spectrum of visible light side by side, instead of it all compact in one white beam.  <br><br>If we don't have rain on another planet there won't be any way to refract light and produce rainbows.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Rainbows are a function of white light passing through a prism (a medium that refracts light at an angle).  Water acts as a prism in the sky when light (sun) is behind you and the water (rain) is in the sky in front of you.  So any planet would have rainbows the same as we do if the above conditions are met.  Atmospheric coloration may alter what you perceive, however.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Rainbows refract a far wider range of light than what we see, we just don't see it. Otherwise, rainbows are a property of light being separated into its components by refracting through vapor. This is a purely physical interaction, which means it would happen the same(though not necessarily look identical) wherever there is sufficiently bright light and liquid vapor. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Depends on the composition of the atmosphere. If it has some kind of chemical in it that diffracts light as it passes through it like a prism, you could certainly see a rainbow. All rainbows, no matter where you find them, would be the same colors. What you are seeing is diffracted white light. When the light travels through a medium that diffracts it, some light travels more quickly and leaves at a different angle than the rest, seperating the light out into it's constituent colors. As for if aliens see rainbows the same way we do, that depends on whether their eyes evolved to see in the same wavelengths as us or not. For example, some aliens might see infared rainbows.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
