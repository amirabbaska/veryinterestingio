		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Starlight is from so far away, it's essentially a single point of light with near zero diameter. When the atmosphere refracts that light, you can notice it more, because the amount of refraction is greater than the diameter of the source.</p>
<p>Light from planets is refracted too, but since they're a lot closer the source isn't zero diameter, it's just slightly bigger. The refraction is more obscured by the diameter of the light source. </p>
<p>So, planet light is dimmer light, but coming from a larger diameter source. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>planets twinkle too.  twinkle is caused by the Earth's atmosphere being inconsistent density which causes varying refraction angles.  sometimes strong sometimes not.   any light that goes thru the atmosphere twinkles.   </p>
<p>if you were on the ISS and look at the stars, they don't twinkle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to the second half of your question has to do with the two different types of light detecting cells in our eyes.  They are called “rods” and “cones”.</p>
<p>Rods are good at detecting dim objects (stars in this case) while cones are good at detecting bright objects. It just so happens that the center area of our vision is mostly handled by the cones, while our peripheral vision is handled more by the rods.</p>
<p>So when you look a little off to the side, you’re forcing your eye to use the more light-sensitive rods. This technique is called “Averted vision.”  Most people need to look 5-20 degrees to one side or the other for the best effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stars = 1 pixel<br />
Planets = 2 or 3 pixels  </p>
<p>Earth's atmosphere continuously warps the light enough for 1 pixel to momentarily disappear. But usually not enough for 2 pixels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're looking down on two lights at the bottom of a pool. One is a tiny little LED and the other is a big fat glowing orb. Disturb the surface a <strong>tiny</strong> bit and the LED will seem to move around dramatically, but the big fat orb will seem to stay relatively still.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
