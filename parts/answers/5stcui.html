		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are talking about the gap between the fuselage and the intake this is purely an aerodynamics thing. Air flowing close to a surface is often very turbulent and messy. This is called the boundary layer.</p>
<p>For maximum performance you don't want these turbulences to get into your engine. It can stall the compressor blade and generally make things less efficient. The small gap is there to get only the laminar flow inside the engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The shape you recognize as common to all those aircraft is done entirely for stealth. Specifically, radar signature, though many factors come into play.</p>
<p>If you were designing for aerodynamics alone, you wouldn't bury the engines or have anything but a short round inlet in front of them. Engines don't want to be buried or forced to suck through a straw. That's why commercial aircraft, which care about efficiency and performance above all else, look the way they do. </p>
<p>But, since round holes are fantastic radar scattering sources, and so are fan blades...low radar observability is achieved by hiding the engine face(s) and shaping the inlet aperture so that it has particularly-shaped edges. Everything you're seeing about a modern fighter inlet is a way of achieving other objectives while (hopefully) compromising aerodynamic performance as little as possible.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a repeat of previous comments, but yeah, the general inlet shape is  to reduce the radar cross section (RCS) of the aircraft (i.e. make it stealthier). As Raymer (Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach, 4th Ed.) explains, &quot;One of the largest contributions to airframe RCS occurs any time a relatively flat surface of the aircraft is perpendicular to the incoming radar beam....Aircraft cavities such as inlet front faces and engine exhausts create a radar return perpendicular to the plane of the opening. All around the opening there will be small perpendicular bounces. When the threat radar is at a direction perpendicular to the opening, those small bounces will be 'in phase' and so will sum to a single large return. This is avoided by sweeping the plane of the opening well away from the expected directions of threat radars, as can be seen on the F-22, B-1B, F/A-18E and other designs. To further reduce this RCS contribution, the inlet lips are often treated with radar absorbers.&quot; </p>
<p>(As a side note, this is why early stealth planes, like the F-117, look so funky and angular. They are designed to avoid faces perpendicular to expected threat radar. As computing power increased in aircraft design, smoother shapes could be made that would achieve the same purpose.)</p>
<p>In another section, Raymer goes on to explain, &quot;Other huge contributors to the RCS for a conventional aircraft are the inlet and exhaust cavities. Radar energy gets into these cavities, bounces off the engine parts, and sprays back out the cavity towards the threat radar. Also, these cavities represent additional surface discontinuities [surface discontinuities are prone to accumulating and discharging radar energy]...More recent stealth designs allow the radar energy into the inlet duct but use [radar absorbing materials] to absorb it as described above [RAMs will absorb some but not all the radar energy so you want to make sure that it will bounce off several RAM-coated surfaces so the signal will be too weak to be picked up.] Also, if the radar energy is allowed inside, some provision must be made for hiding any direct view of the engine front face from the outside. This can be done by extreme snaking of the duct, or by putting curved vanes or an onion-shaped bulb in front of the engine.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The B-2 Spirit is arguably the most stealth aircraft currently flying and has a similar gap under its top air intakes. The B-2 sucks the boundary layer into this gap for two reasons. The boundary layer is over expanded and cold. And sucking it off from the wing improves aerodynamic efficiency by minimizing drag created by this turbulent air. The boundary layer is mixed with the B-2's exhaust before it is expelled, reducing infrared signature. So this gap between intake and fuselage serves, in stealth aircraft, to minimize IR signature, and improve aerodynamic efficiency by pumping the boundary layer off the fuselage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main reason for the small and wedge looking air intakes on supersonic jets is to induce a series of oblique shock-waves instead of a normal shock-wave. When the air intakes are designed this way it creates a series of oblique shock-waves that slow down the air that enters the turbines and prevents a shock-wave from damaging the turbine. Basically the air needs to be subsonic for the turbine to work and the only way to slow down the air when flying at supersonic speeds is to use shock-waves. Also, the gap in between the fuselage and the intake is to prevent turbulent boundary layer air from entering the intake. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
