<p>Slowly, exercising and eating well were blasted into the minds of the public from media giants like <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernarr_Macfadden" target="_blank">Bernarr McFadden</a> and gyms and exercise routines were built up around it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ancient Civilizations such as Greeks, Egyptians, Assyrians and others used Calisthenics to train their soldiers and later, athletes.  They based their workouts on the basic movements that every human goes through, lifting, pushing, pulling, walking, etc.  The Greeks and Romans placed importance on physical prowess.  The Greek philosophy was: sound body, sound mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
