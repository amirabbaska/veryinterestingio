		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some ghostwriters are already famous authors, and write for a paycheck. Some might be modestly successful, but an &quot;auto&quot;biography from someone famous is likely to make a lot more. </p>
<p>Also, some writers like their subjects and want to write those stories. People line up to write for Presidents and Politicians. </p>
<p>There's also less risk to your reputation, and some writers like the opportunity to take some literary risks or break the mold they are known for. </p>
<p>And, of course, others do it to get writing &quot;credits&quot; under their belt. Manuscripts from nobodies end up in the circular file. But the new book from the guy that ghostwrote the last Kardashian Sutra is going to get some curious glances. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Writing is a both a craft and an art.  There are some people who are good at the technical aspects of putting together a coherent book, but lack the creativity to make original material.  That sort of person is good at taking the jumbled memoirs of some celebrity and turning it into a well-structured story.  And because people are buy it because they are fans of the celebrity, there aren't really going to looking for high-quality literature.</p>
<p>Also, making a name as a writer is a matter of luck as much as talent.  There are plenty of mediocre authors who had connections or were in the right place at the right time, and plenty of brilliant ones who were never recognized in their lifetimes.  It is hard to dedicate your life to honing your art when you also have to work to pay the bills, so those brilliant but unrecognized authors are not going to be turning down paid work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least for songwriting, at this point in time (with so much social media, paparazzi, etc.) being successful means having the whole package. You need to have at least a decent voice, be somewhat attractive, have some sort of a personality/style/something you're known for, and just have a certain something that will attract fans. Or you at least need 3/6. Someone may be incredible at writing songs that connect with people, but if they don't have a good voice, or are incredibly bland, or ugly, or uncharismatic, they wouldn't have success as a mainstream artist.</p>
<p>And besides that, some people just don't want to make a name for themselves. There are a lot of tradeoffs to celebrity, and not everyone wants that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
