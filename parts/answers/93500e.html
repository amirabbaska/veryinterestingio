When you crease a fold, the fibers that get bunched up on the inside of the  crease force the fibers on the outside of the crease to stretch and tear. If you then crease the fold the other way, you now break the fibers on this side, leaving only a thin layer of fibers in the middle to hold the two sides together (and making it now relatively easy to tear apart). </p>
<p>Same thing if you've ever had to use a piece of bread as a hotdog bun; the bottom of the bread always breaks in half. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine breaking a branch, but on a smaller level. If the branch is fairly new (not dry), it can be hard to break. One side will splinter while the other side still holds the two halves together. If you try to bend it back together, the first (splintered) side will still be broken, so it can't ever go back to how it was before. The same thing happens with paper; on a smaller scale than you can probably see, one side of the paper rips apart a little bit while the rest of it hold both halves together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>materials have 2 regions. Plastic and Elastic. Elastic means it can snap back to its original form. Plastic is permanently changing the properties of a material. Some materials have a higher elastic region which means they can take more abuse before  causing permanent damage.</p>
<p>You can flex a piece of acrylic quite a bit before it permanently stays bent, or press your hand and squeeze an aluminum coke can and watch it snap back into its original shape. Press it too hard and now its bent, and changed forever. These materials have high elastic regions.  Bending paper will also retain its original shape, until you crease it, crossing into the plastic region. Once something enters the plastic region, it is now permanently that shape and will never return to its original form.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Looking at it from a materials Science pov, we can look at a stress strain curve like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/images/9m1uU7" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/images/9m1uU7</a></p>
<p>The straight line part is called the linear elastic region. In this region the bonds are being stretched, but when the force is removed the bonds return to normal and thus the material returns to it's original condition. The curved part is called the plastic region. In this region the bonds are actually slipping out of place. This causes the material to be permanently altered and thus it does not return to it's original state. Now, paper may be a different case because of the way it's made, but this is why materials in general crease/break when bent far enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
