		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Allergies and illness are two entirely separate things and the reason is different in each case. <br><br>The congestion in your nose/lungs during an illness is merely a side of effect of your immune system attempting to rid your body of the virus/bacteria as quickly as possible. Immune cells are flooding the area to &quot;attack&quot; the &quot;enemy&quot; and the extra mucous is a way of expelling the debris from the fight. This is the immune system functioning correctly. <br><br>Allergies, on the other hand, are a malfunction of the immune system. In this case, they've misidentified a substance as being dangerous, when it actually isn't. The severity of the reaction depends on how much your immune system overreacts. In the case of a sniffly nose, your body thinks the substance is a minor threat and attempts to keep it out/expel it with a little extra mucous. In the case of a severe allergy, resulting in asphyxiation, the body is WAY, WAY overreacting. It's basically decided that you've just eaten/breathed horrible poison which could kill you in minutes. The swelling/closure of airways is a last resort, desperate measure to keep as much of that stuff out as possible. If you can't breath, you can't breath in or eat any more &quot;poison.&quot; Yes, within a short time, you could die from lack of air, but if the substance was truly as dangerous as your body thinks, keeping the poison out until you can get away from it could also save your life. Imagine two people in a room full of very toxic gas. The person whose immune system mostly closes up their airways will breath in a lot less poison and live longer than the person whose immune system does nothing and lets them breathe normally. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

These inflammatory mediators have various effects, and one of the most significant is vasodilation (increasing the diameter of your blood vessels).

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Just a quick point: sometimes our reaction is for the benefit of the v√≠rus, not our own. Virus evolve too, and those which cause us to spread it efficiently (sneezing, dhiarrea, mucus) would prevail -- even if they kill us (the host) in the process. The virus may be triggering an over reaction, taking a healthy process beyond its healthy level, for its own reproductive success. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>You are asking two different questions here, one about actual pathogens like viruses and another about allergens, which are things that your body mistakes for pathogens. In both cases your immune systems senses a foreign presence and immunce cells, called mast cells and basophils, release a compound called histamine. Histamine makes your your capillaries (tiny blood vessels) inflate so that they can fit more white blood cells allowing them to fight infection faster and more efficiently. When lots of these inflate it causes swelling and nose blockage. Histamine also increases your sensitivity to itching, increases mucous secretion and attracts more immune cells, which then release more histamine. These immune cells cells also release other immune system signalling compounds called cytokines, which help attract more infection fighting cells and cause swelling as well.<br><br>In relation to allergens, asphyxiation is a screw up by your immune system where it becomes hypersensitive to something that is ordinarily harmless. If these cells have become hypersensitive, to bee venom for example, even the tiniest amount will cause them to release histamine and cytokines into your system. This then attracts more hypersensitive cells and causes a chain reaction where more and more histamine is released and you end up with an allergic reaction. This still won't cause asphyxiation (unless the allergen is in your windpipe) but can lead to anaphylaxis which is a life threatening overreaction by your immune system where so much histamine and cytokines are produced that you end up with a body-wide immune reaction and enough histamine to cause your throat to swell shut and your blood vessels to inflate so much that there is no blood getting to your heart. <br><br><br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I wrote something about this before:<br><br>&gt;We actually gave ourselves allergies by curing parasites.<br><br>&gt;Let me explain: back in the day, most of us had parasites ( the same way we all have a mirriad of bacteria living in symbiosis with us today ). We used a special antibody called IgE to kill them. However, once we got rid of the parasites, we no longer had that many uses for IgE. However, the body kept producing them. As the mechanism to fight parasites remained, but there was nothing to fight, the body started being hypervigilant. Whenever a speck of pollen, dandruff, bee venom, poison ivy appeared, the body would say, &quot; this shit's gonna kill us&quot;. IgE, being the body's way for fighting things too big for a white cell to eat started using that.<br><br>&gt;However, when fighting big things, you need different strategies. You want to flush it out, blast it with irritants, and try and tear it apart from the outside. This is why IgE research causes the inflamation, itching, burning etc. we see in allergic reactions. Take that to the extreme, you get what's known as anaphylactic shock. This means that your whole body is doing these things at once. The main problem is that your blood vessels get so engorged that there is not enough blood to fill all of them. This makes your blood pressure drop (I.e. shock). You can't get oxygen anywhere efficiently anymore, so you die.<br><br>&gt;This same reaction causes your airways to constrict, thus giving you the double whammy of not being able to breathe. This also prevents you from getting that sweet sweet oxygen, and you die.<br><br>&gt;We use epinephrine (i.e. epi-pens) to tell your body, &quot;bro! fight or flight!&quot; which opens up your lungs and constricts your blood vessels.<br><br>&gt;So yeah, parasites brah.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>An interesting note in case nobody has mentioned it yet:<br><br>A few years ago there was a bit of VERY interesting research which gave compelling evidence that allergic reactions to things such as pet dander or pollen are not merely mistakes on the part of your body.<br><br>In general we know these things to be harmless and so it seems weird that our body goes into overdrive to expel something it should pay no attention to. What the research found however was that these allergens are in fact doing real damage to your cells.<br><br>That damage isn't enough that you should really worry, and your body is definitely overreacting, but until this research came to light we had no proof that such allergies served any real purpose as the proteins they were responding to weren't those of a virus or bacterial parasite. Usually, your immune system responds to proteins on the grounds that they represent an infection. They serve as a secondary identifier of a damaging source. With allergies however the proteins themselves were often found to cause cellular damage and so it made sense for the body to produce mucus and trigger sneezing as a way of removing the harmful substance.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The congestion is the unintended by-product of lots of individual cells responding to the sickness at a cellular level. <br><br>In other words, each individual cell can only see the damage caused by the illness and reacts by producing mucus to protect itself. Each cell doesn't &quot;know&quot; that when most of the cells in your nose do this, you end up congested. <br><br>Normally, these cells produce a low level of mucus which is swept away by little beating hairs called cilia. However, during an illness this decongesting mechanism is overwhelmed by the extra mucus that is produced. <br><br>Just remember that your body doesn't make co-ordinated decisions in the same way that our minds appear to. Our body is made up of lots of different types of cell which all respond differently to different problems. It's just the net result of this interaction that we perceive as the &quot;body's&quot; reaction to something.  <br><br>tl;dr: Lots of individual cells &quot;selfishly&quot; protecting themselves from the bug causes lots of mucus production.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>While listening to a pathology lecture about the respiratory tract, this same question popped into my head.  It seems counter-intuitive for our body to have any evolutionary purpose of restricting the size of our airway.  However, the lecturer then pointed out that I is most likely an attempt to increase the force with which we cough, to expell inhaled particles.<br><br>In case that isn't clear, imagine trying to shoot spit balls out of a tube the size of a paper towel roll tube vs a straw.<br><br>Edit: just realized you were more specifically talking about the nasal passages.<br><br>The reason this occurs, is because the reaction to infection is similar throughout the entire body.  As others have pointed out, the body responds to infection by a process called vasodilation.  This process essentially allows for immune cells to have better access to the site of infection.  You can consider the tissues of the body like a highway, and the immune cells like the cops and other emergency vehicles.  During an infection, all those blocked of exits and entrances to the highway that have those &quot;emergency vehicles only&quot; signs on them open up and allow the cops and ambulances to cut through to the accident scene.<br><br>So as you could imagine, this process works really well if you have an infection of the skin of your arm, it would just be mildly uncomfortable, but when it occurs in the upper respiratory tract, it is much more uncomfortable.  I think the important thing to understand is that evolution didn't make an active choice to impair breathing, but the inflammatory response evolved to be a versatile and effective method to ward off infection.  Even if the sniffles are fucking annoying.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
