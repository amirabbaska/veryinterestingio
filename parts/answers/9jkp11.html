		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The physical reason animals sleep with their eyes closed is moisture. Just have a good old staring contest with someone and you will see after only a few minutes your eyes will start to dry out and the urge to blink really kicks in. Now imagine leaving them open for hours straight. As for sleeping with your eyes open, there are risks. If your eyes become too dry &quot;dry spots&quot; can form on the cornea, causing inflammation and over time could lead to a number of eye problems. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think people have pretty well covered the second question, but the short answer to OP's first question is sensory input. Sleep is easiest to achieve(especially when not overly tired) when we have limited sensory stimulation. We process a disproportionate amount of our sensory input visually, so closing our eyes is the easiest way to shut that down and let our brain start to rest. The same reason we don't want to be tickled as we fall asleep, or have a loud environment, or a room that is very hot or cold to fall asleep in. Those all stimulate your senses, which, in turn, keeps you up. If you're a (mostly) normal person, that is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
