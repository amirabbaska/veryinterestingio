		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bees release a pheromone called alarm pheromone when they sting. Other bees will orient to the scent and become aggressive. The evolutionary purpose is to coordinate the defense of the hive against predators or hostile bees.</p>
<p>After a bee stings, its stinger rips out, and the bee soon dies. (I read that the stinger is actually barbed to better injure insects with an exoskeleton, and getting pulled out by a mammal's elastic skin is just a side effect, but I'm not sure about this.) The stinger, lodged in the victims body, continues to pump venom and release alarm pheromone. </p>
<p>Africanized bees produce more pheromone and respond to it more dramatically. Thus, more bees will attack you once one has stung or prepared to sting.</p>

When bees sting they release isoamyl acetate, which smells like bananas. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/1951018b0" target="_blank">Boch, Shearer and Stone 1962</a>. When my bees get mad (one aggressive feral hive in particular), the banana smell is overwhelming. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bees do release a pheromone after dying, to trigger removal from the hive by the other bees. Researchers have found that if they apply this pheromone to live bees it triggers the same behaviour and the other bees will remove the treated bee from the hive, even though it is still alive. </p>

<p>This work is done on brood (I thought it was on adults from being told about the study), I don't know whether the same thing has been tested on adults but I thought this was relevant to share anyway!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>bees release a chemical that smells like bannanas when they are engaged with an intruder/attacker/under distress and a chemical that smells like pencil erasers when they are near death. we kept bees (120 hives) for a decade and i'm still trying to forget those smells. once in a while i will run into something that smells like that and i immediately get a fear response that i am being attacked by bees. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the bee was only trapped, but didnt sting, it might as well be the case, that a bee spotted something sweet in your apartment. Bees have a dance-like communication, which they use for sharing information about food sources with their hive.</p>
