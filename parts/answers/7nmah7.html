		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually just graduated with a degree in Kinesiology, so it's good to see it be somewhat useful. The shortest answer is yes, FT muscle cells that have been exercised will be larger than slow twitch. It's the whole idea that human muscle cells grow solely by hypertrophy (growing larger) than hyperplasia (growing in number). However most research shows that mid-high weight (roughly 75%-90% of your 1 rep max) shows the best increases in muscle size over lifting only very heavy weights. ST fibers will grow in size, but not as significantly. If you had someone lifting a 5 lb. weight 50-100 times, then the biggest physiological change will be in number of mitochondria within that cell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short:
Yes! FT or MHC II fibers are larger than ST or MHC I and MHC II are typically more prone to hypertrophy. It has been recently suggested that MHC I fibers require greater satellite cell activation for fiber growth. (Murach et al., 2018)  This has yet to be shown experimentally. </p>
<p>There are actually 6 fiber types (in humans)
MHC I, MHC I/IIa, MHC IIa, MHC IIa/IIx, MHC IIx, MHC I/IIa/IIx</p>
<p>MHC I being most &quot;ST&quot; and MHC IIx being the most &quot;FT&quot;. Fiber type is plastic and can change via training A LOT. </p>
<p>For all your fiber type related questions please check out <a href="http://www.andygalpin.com" target="_blank">http://www.andygalpin.com</a> and follow his IG. His work is awesome. </p>
<p>There is still a lot we do not know regarding muscle physiology and a some stuff we thought we knew is showing otherwise. Not even that long ago a text books said fiber type could not change. It is an exciting time for this field.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
