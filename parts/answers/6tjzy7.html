		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The energy you get from food is spent (in the form of ATP) to push sodium and potassium ions through pumps in the membrane of your nerve cells. Since the ions have an electric charge, they cause a voltage across the cell when the concentration is different between the inside and outside. When a nerve is activated, the flood gates in the cell membrane open and let the ions move back, which sends the electric current down the nerve. It then takes some time (a few milliseconds) to recharge the nerve, moving the ions back into place before it can fire again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All nerve cell membranes contain ion pumps that use ATP to move ions against their gradient (meaning pushing them from low to high). Specifically there are sodium potassium pumps that pump more sodium out than potassium in. Because the inside of the axon (the part of nerve cell that conducts impulses) contains largely negatively charged proteins there are more negatively charged ions inside the cell than out of it. When a signal needs to be passed through the nerve channels open allowing the Na+ molecules to flow down its energy gradient thus creating energy.
To see the actual numbers associated with this just look up a labeled action potential chart.
Simply put the energy comes from separating positive ions and negative ions on either side of the cell membrane. When a signal is received channels in the membrane open allowing the ions to even put on both sides thus releasing potential energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It first gets energy from the food you eat. Your cells go through something called &quot;respiration&quot;, which is a biochemical process of converting sugars into energy. These sugars can come from three outside or internal sources : protein, fats, and carbohydrates (catabolysis, ketogenesis, glycogenesis). Somewhere in this process, some of the broken down salts you eat are ionized into positively and negatively charged components.</p>
<p>The electricity is actually just a byproduct of charge exchange. Think of diffusion, or a process at which higher concentrations of substances move to lower concentration mediums at some rate. When your cells &quot;move&quot; positively charged ions from one area to another, electricity is formed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like you're five:  the neurons themselves make the electricity.  Reading the other answers, if you haven't taken a bio course yet, I'm not sure that that's clear.  Once enough of a charge is built up in the cell, it gets passed down the length of the cell like the game &quot;hot potato&quot;: it goes only in one direction, and is passed from one tiny section of the cell to the next tiny section in line.  When it hits the end of the cell, the voltage causes something to happen, release of chemicals in the brain, and muscle contraction in the heart and guts.</p>
<p>If you want to know <em>how</em> the electricity is made, the other posters talking about ATP and electrolytes are explaining that, but the short answer to what I think you're asking is that the cells themselves literally make their own electrical signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
