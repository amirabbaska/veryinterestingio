		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another explanation I have seen, not listed here, is that often shows are built around a single comedian---usually a guy.  Since, as <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/chris-pratt-only-got-well-written-roles-after-gaining-weight-a7467006.html" target="_blank">Chris Pratt noted</a>, male comedians tend to be more successful when they don't look too good, that means you get a lot of shows built around a relatively shlubby guy.  </p>
<p>But, that schlubby guy doesn't necessarily want to be paired with a schlubby lady---and the network certainly wants to add in sex appeal, appeal to female audiences, indications that the main character is in at least some ways enviable, etc...---they often end up paired with a more attractive woman. </p>
<p>I've always favored this explanation, since it accounts for why this is so common in the classic sitcom set-up, or the one's that follow it relatively closely (like the George and Jerry parts of Seinfeld), but is much, much less common in ensemble shows.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TV &amp; Movies tend to repeat patterns that work. One sitcom came up with a fat stupid guy married to an attractive, smarter wife. It was a success, and the rest copied it as much as they could, down to the character types.</p>
<p>There is also one argument that it's done because it would be un-PC to have the wife be the one to do stupid things. [EDIT: I don't personally advocate this argument, but I have read it in several places.]</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humor is built on inversion of expectations. It's been this way for thousands of years; Roman comedies had the clever slave and the hapless master. Did that mean the Romans think slaves were smarter than their masters? Of course not! It was funny because it was opposite of what the audience believed was true.</p>
<p>So the stupid husband and patient wife is an inversion of the expectation that the husband is the smart, hard-working one. Remember, even into the 80s, people still believed that women couldn't make it in the workplace.</p>
<p>There's obviously more to comedy than just a formula, but this is where the formula came from.</p>
<p>At this point, it's definitely a cliche, and the expectation has been bucked by society to the point where we're seeing competent husbands and dumb wives, too. Bob's Burgers is a prime example with Linda Belcher being the dumb one, and Bob being the competent one, but they both definitely have their redeeming features and flaws. It's not like Peter and Lois Griffin, where Peter's an incompetent boob. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find it hilarious that people think it has to do with being PC. This formula, as someone else noted, started over 60 years ago by Jackie Gleason himself. The fat stupid husband character is created by a fat comedian who is on some wish fulfillment journey of having a hot wife that puts up with his shit.
Going even further back this probably pull from the tradition of august and white-face clowns. Think David Space (white face) and Chris Farley (august). Every comedy duo has a straight-man and a goof. (Sometimes you get the edgy/depressing/weird character in there which could translate to tramp clowns.) Since the male comedians want the goofy spotlight and a hot leading lady we get this.<br />
