		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Social security (CPAM) covers 70% of all healthcare expenses that it considers ‘suitable’. </p>
<p>For example if a doctor prescribes you antibiotics, social security will pay 70% of the consultation and 70% of the antibiotics. </p>
<p>However, if your doctor prescribes you Diosmine, a medication that is not considered ´good enough’ to be refunded, the CPAM will refund 70% of the consultation but it won’t refund any percent of the medication. </p>
<p>The remaining 30% are paid by the patient. The patient can choose to buy a «  mutuelle », which is a private insurance company, that pays these remaining costs.</p>
<p>Patients with chronic diseases/illnesses are considered « ALD30 » which means the CPAM pays 100% of medical costs.</p>
<p>The government controls the price of medication and the price of mutuelles.</p>
<p>The CPAM is funded by taxes, which are more important than taxes in the USA, especially for indépendants. </p>

<p>Édit: People’s comments below are correct that I did not mention a few things:</p>
<p>A specific Mutuelle is sometimes obligatory with your job, in this case you can terminate your current mutuelle and join the one paid by your employer. Depending on the employer a certain amount is deducted from your salary. Most of the time this deal is advantageous.</p>
<p>For people who have no salary or earn very little. They can apply for CMU (couverture maladie universelle) which garantes 100% cover by the government. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lived there for 8 years, the healthcare system was a marvel to behold.  Anecdotally, here are some of the bigger differences I noticed:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>System seemed insanely well funded</em>. Well staffed, very modern facilities and treatments.  Never felt like you were lacking for anything.</li>
<li><em>Doctors that do home visits</em>. I'd call a number and a doc would show up to my front door in a small car. Think the surcharge was about $100 cash. Of course they could issue prescriptions on the spot. I had a really bad flu on a Sunday and you can probably imagine the relief of not having to make a trip to the hospital to wait for hours in the emergency room.</li>
<li><em>They take labor protections very seriously</em>.  I talked with the doctors and the nurses about it and it turns out they work very strictly controlled hours. No overtime allowed (so always home in time for dinner) and 6 weeks vacation a year... so staff stress levels seemed much lower than in NA.</li>
<li><em>Very integrated infrastructure</em>. Your &quot;carte vitale&quot;, the card that gets you access to all of the services, includes your complete medical and pharmaceutical history.  So when you're dealing with any new professional or institution, you don't need to give them your interpretation of your medical history, they have access to it immediately. This includes ambulances, and I can't help but imagine it helps saves lives.</li>
<li><em>Big focus on investing in preventative care</em>. You have the right to a full physical once every five years.. and by full I mean you go to a specialized facility that includes running on treadmills. Another example, if you're a diabetic, they will pay for you to do a weekend retreat in the mountains where you learn how to cook and live a healthier lifestyle. Amazing, and lord knows what other examples I don't know about.</li>
<li><em>Very closely followed process for expectant mothers</em>. I had a friend give birth there and the number of appointments and different types of midwives and professionals she had available was incredible. </li>
</ul>
<p>I was very impressed. For various reasons, I also tried out the systems in the UK, Italy, USA, Canada, Singapore... but nothing came close to France.  USA was pretty much my worst experience.... the delightful moment of being intercepted by the insurance lady before you see a doctor and then getting heavily over tested/prescribed, was not the way I wanted to be treated.</p>
<p>EDIT: Also, /u/Radulno reminded me of the &quot;Thermal Cures&quot;.  Basically, if your doctor determines that you're too stressed, they can prescribe a few days at a government resort that has hot mineral springs. You spend the weekend there relaxing, getting fed and frequently taking saunas or a bath, all paid for by the healthcare system.... and it even counts as work leave!  I think this service has old historical roots, but never had the chance to try it out myself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well,every month you pay tax for your healthcare and your company pays a small percentage too. Taxes are quite high in France when you have employees. Like when you pay someone 1400$ (you give back to the government 45% the last time I've checked). And on that, the employee also has taxes to pay at the end of the month+a big check to give to the tax institution at the end of the year (if he earns &quot;too much&quot;)</p>
<p>That money is also used to build public schools, roads and for your retirement etc </p>
<p>If you don't work/are unemployed everything is completely free for you. Most people also pay for a private healthcare since the public stuff doesn't cover  everything. You have access to free medication but you have a budget and the private healthcare pays for the balance . Like with the free healthcare you only get basic glasses with a plain frame. </p>
<p>Edit1: a few of you asked how we feel about it. Well, I guess we roll with it. It's frustrating when you see the difference at the end of your payslip but most of us are happy to have access to free university( we have private stuff too), free healthcare etc and to be able to retire around 60. It's far from being perfect and the government cut off their budget so hospitals are crowded, nurses work crazy hours etc. But it's still better than nothing and I'm personally happy to know that I don't need to worry too much about that stuff if I'm sick etc</p>
<p>Edit2: someone here attached an example of a French payslip

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think another reason why France healthcare is cheaper is that healthcare insurance (that people take on top of social security) are “mutuelles” and mutuelles are not supposed to make profit. All profit must be reinjected in the mutuelle and that’s how monthly costs are never too high (I used to pay €40 for a couple by month on top of taxes for social security).</p>
<p>Also, heard that US doctors have so much to pay in lawyers / insurance for liability in case they get sued that it’s a reason why everything is much more expensive. But that is to be confirmed by someone who knows better the American system.</p>
<p>To illustrate: a visit to the pediatric ER or dentist in France without any insurance nor social security is about the price of the co-pay in California... </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll try to cover the basics : the rationale behind the system, how it works and how much it costs.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale</strong> : </p>
<p>Fundamentally, accidents and diseases are considered to be random events. Your lifefstyle and personnal history matters obviously, but not so much that you can say &quot;it's YOUR responsibilty, you're on your own&quot;. And I'm not even talking about children with leukemia or car accidents, but the simple fact that &quot;lower risk factor&quot; does not mean no risk.</p>
<p>This means that healthcare is a society problem, not simply an individual problem. </p>
<p>As a society, we also decided that no one should suffer from sickness if we can prevent it, irrespective of their means. A lot of people seems to conflate it with welfare for unemployment, but these are two separate issues, and the consensus on the underlying principle of universal healtcare is basically unanimous. </p>
<p><em>This is also true in the US, I think, since you ultimately accept all desperate case in the ER, even if you bill them into bankruptcy after. No one is ready to let someone die , or make parents chose which one of their children they want to save.</em> </p>
<p><strong>How it works</strong></p>
<p>So France set up a large Fund called &quot;Sécurité Sociale&quot;, which is funded by everyone and pay most of the healthbills for everyone. (NB It's much more complex, and there's a lot of fringe cases, but it's the general principle).</p>
<p>The Social Security :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Reimburses 70% of standard healthcare</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reimburses 100% for critical / LT healthcare (In France, &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; would have been a 10 min short. So, yay for US Healthcare, I guess ?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to fix prices on medicines / etc</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the Standard Price (&quot;Tarif Conventionné&quot;) for doctors appointment. Doctors can go over it, but the Sécurité Sociale won't cover the overcharge.</p>
</li>
<li>Is funded by a tax on payrolls (initially, it covered only people with a job, but was extended later)</li>
</ul>
<p>There's always a debate on what is / is not standard healthcare, and what should be covered: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Boob Job ? No</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Boob Job post masectomy ? Yes</p>
</li>
<li>Boobjob because you are clinically depressed by your body ? Hmm Maybe ?</li>
</ul>
<p>For things that are not covered by the Sécurité Sociale ( the remaining 30% for standard care, overcharges etc), they are private &quot;mutuelles&quot; insurance companies that provide it. Almost all employers are required to provide one to their employees.</p>
<p><strong>How much it costs :</strong></p>
<p>Let's talk about doctors for one second: In France, they are not employee of the state, but independent professionals .</p>
<p>A big difference with the US is that French doctors do not have huge amount of student debt to repay. University fees are a few hundred € (quick check ~350€/year for Paris) and some might spend ~1000€ in preparatory school to pass the dreaded first year admission test. So they don't HAVE to repay it by squeezing you for all your worth.
What they COST to the state in formation is estimated to be ~11k€ per year for the first 7 years, so ~80k€ per doctor. I don't know how it compares with average medical student debt in the US.</p>
<p>In the end, the total healtcare costs are (source worldbank):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>France : 4959 $/capita (78% Public Founded)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Germany: 5411 $/capita (77% Public Founded)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UK : 3935$/capita (83% Public Founded)</p>
</li>
<li>USA: <strong>9403$/capita</strong> (48% Public Founded)</li>
</ul>
<p>So the USA spends almost twice as much on healthcare. I don't know all the reasons, but some comes to mind :</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>inefficiencies created by having multiple small healtcare providers (lower scale effect, lower bargaining power, Higher SG&amp;A and marketing costs)</p>
</li>
<li>For Profit business model in a market with a non elastic demand which creates natural monopolies. (ie, you can't bargain when you're in pain)</li>
</ul>
<p>As for the ranking of the Healthcare systems, it is obviously a controversial topic, since it depends of who is doing the ranking and what they are ranking, exactly. </p>
<p>I think the famous &quot;France #1&quot; comes from a WHO study.
They typically covered quality / ease of access / efficiency /costs , both in the average result achieved and its distribution (ie. inequality)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
