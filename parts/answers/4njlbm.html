<p>he would have to expend the same amount of energy regardless whether he was walking or occasionally pushing the skateboard with one foot  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>No. Imagine you push with one foot but there is no skateboard. Your energy from the push is quickly eaten up by friction (and you fall) if you don't quickly move the other foot to catch yourself and push with that foot to start walking.  </p>
<p>Now, with a skateboard, when you push with one foot and the other foot is on the board, you <em>roll</em> and you don't waste all of that energy to friction. A single push, perhaps expending slightly more energy than a walking step, will propell you 10-15 feet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No one's really addressed the fundamental misconception that you have with the &quot;free energy lunch intuition&quot;.</p>
<p>In general, you aren't required to do work to displace an object in space. W = Force*Distance. If there isn't a force, then there isn't any work being done. An object could travel from one end of the universe to the other without any external energy being added if it simply had some initial velocity. </p>
<p>Even if the object started from rest and required acceleration (and thus a net force), the energy spent wouldn't depend on the distance traveled.</p>
<p>Obviously, this isn't always intuitive - you need to &quot;Work&quot; in order to keep moving when walking, skating or bicycling. This is essentially due to friction (particularly in the latter two cases) which do negative work on you.</p>
<p>Now we've got that covered, the answer is: IT DEPENDS!</p>
<p>-&gt; Wind resistance increases as a square function of speed</p>
<p>-&gt; The static friction between the road and wheels of a skateboard is a constant regardless of velocity</p>
<p>-&gt; The metabolic cost of walking per unit time increases exponentially as speed increases (or &gt; linearly)</p>
<p>-&gt; The &quot;Spring&quot; (muscle contraction) that allows you to retain some of your momentum through walking conserves far less energy than a rotating wheel.</p>
<p>From this, we can conclude that walking probably requires more energy per unit time at a given speed.</p>
<p>However, if the &quot;self selected&quot; speeds of the two differ, it could be possible that a skateboarder could expend more energy - the power required to move forward against a constant wind resistence at a given velocity is proportional to to velocity cubed. If the speed of the skateboarder was sufficiently great - then they would require more energy to achieve the same displacement</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You say there is no free energy lunch and the same energy is spent regardless. Would you say that about a bicycle as well, as it is all powered by human energy? </p>
<p>And if so, consider biking 10 km vs walking it. Or 20km. Does your intuition tell you those require the same amount of energy? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Total friction loss tends to be much lower in a rolling system than any type of walking gate.  Per distance traveled you will expend less energy on roller blades, skateboards or bikes than you will walking or running.</p>
<p>This is the reason you can bike 100+ miles a day but few if any can run that far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
