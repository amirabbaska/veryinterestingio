		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are only counted as &quot;unemployed&quot; for that particular statistic while you still count as part of the labor force: This means you had a job or were actively looking for a job through the right agencies (government or private) within the past four weeks.</p>
<p>In addition to the obvious ones such as stay-at-home parents, students, caretakers and others people have already listed here, there's tons of other cases, such as people who can't or won't work for various reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You might be able to do certain jobs despite your disabilities (like say answering phones, or just limited hours) but would lose every benefit and thus end up in a far worse situation for doing so. As such while you could be part of the workforce you are not part of either statistic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may have given up, or simply not have been able to find anything yet; after 5+ weeks you're no longer unemployed for purposes of us all being told the unemployment rate's gone down on the news!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You might be under one of those nasty non-competitive clauses in certain tech sectors that prevent you from finding anything else for a few months or years.</p>
</li>
<li>You may be doing odd-jobs or small-time contract work and technically make a living, and so not count as employed but also - as it's been more than 4 weeks - no longer count as unemployed either.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot has already been covered in regards to this, but I might have something to add. </p>
<p>The participation rate of an economy (60-65% in a lot of developed countries) is those people who are either employed (involved in 1+ hours of paid work per week) or unemployed (actively seeking work), out of the working age population. </p>
<p>As others have noted, retirees, stay at home parents, etc are above the working age, but neither employed or counted in the unemployment calculation. Similarly, people who have given up looking for work as they believe they cannot find it, or people who cannot look for work due to health issues, are not counted. </p>
<p>Thus, the disparity between the two numbers is explained by the fact that unemployment is calculated as a proportion of the participation rate, while employment is calculated as a percentage of the working age population (everyone 15+). Hope this helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Better question to ask is why the labor force participation rate is historically way down and not recovering from the 2008 recession... </p>
<p>Also, why the unemployment rate naturally recovers over time regardless of the labor force participation rate....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
