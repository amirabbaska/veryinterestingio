		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most marine life won't have a problem.  Fish swim a little deeper.  They are generally keep away from surf zones, if the zone gets bigger they move out and down.  </p>
<p>In extreme winds the surface of the water turns to a froth layer a couple of metres thick, &quot;too thin to swim in and too thick to breathe&quot; according to my old oceanography lecturer.  Sea mammals can't breathe would drown.  They may be able to get to land and head inshore. </p>
<p>Things get really bad where the water meets the land.  Here an enormous amount of wave energy gets dissipated destroying all sorts of stuff.  Many thing die.</p>
<p>Sea birds can't cope with this very well.  Old Navy sailor friend told me that you know when you are in a really bad storm when an albatross lands on the deck. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on if it is sessile (attached) or mobile, and a dozen other factors. In Florida Bay, we tend to see the water literally get sucked out between the Florida Keys if the storm passes to the west. This exposes everything on the bottom and, if it’s long enough, itlll die. </p>
<p>We saw massive sponge die offs due to this [ETA: after Irma]. Hurricanes also move a ton of sentiment at times, which can scour the bottom life, or bury it, or just remain suspended and “choke out” corals and sponges and sea grasses by denying their ability to photosynthesize or suspension feed efficiently. </p>
<p>There were many reports of small fish kills due to surge pushing them up on land, again these were mostly the little critters that hide near the bottom nearshore (catfish, pin fish, sea horses, etc), not so much larger snapper or tuna or things like that. Lots of conch, sea stars, urchins, etc were washed ashore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
