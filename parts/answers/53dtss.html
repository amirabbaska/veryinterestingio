		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Long time lurker and also a fraud investigator.</p>
<p>A lot of times hackers will steal a large number of credit card numbers and sell them in lots of hundreds or thousands. The buyer of the credit card numbers will typically set up some type of account where they will charge all of the cards for small amounts, say 10 or 50 cents, and make it a recurring charge. Many people won't notice these small charges, so they will continue to be charged weekly. </p>
<p>1000 cards weekly at 50 cents is $500 a week. </p>
<p>They will then launder the funds by using them to purchase bitcoins, or moving money off shore. </p>
<p>The amount of time to investigate this type of crime and try to bring the case to prosecution is typically weeks or months. For that small amount of money most companies will just cancel the card numbers and chalk it up to a loss.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cop here. What most people mentioned is right with regards to the methods. There are tons of ways. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When police take a report of it, we do so with the knowledge that: you're most likely going to be reimbursed, the CC company will do their own investigation if they want, and it's nearly impossible to find the person if they know how to work the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This isn't a movie; we don't have the tools to get their IP address, trace a package, or essentially do anything to locate the thief unless they provided true info about their identity at some point in the process. Oh, and everybody involved has to help us. Thieves know all of this. CC fraud is an inherently deceptive crime. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CC company won't work with us &quot;beat cops&quot; without a search warrant, and even then they only provide the bare minimum information. Same for many stores in general due to the sensitive information we need to know.  Thieves know this. After you're reimbursed, the CC company essentially is now the victim, and their lack of willful cooperation means the investigation is terminated. CC company won't even do their own investigation unless it meets their guidelines. One BIG one is that it can't cost them more than the money they stand to gain from a successful investigation. I've had people tell me that could be upwards of 100k. Thieves know this too. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'll add one interesting method no one else has mentioned. A CC thief in Argentina set up a fake &quot;Quality Control&quot; company in the US and advertised it online. Eventually people like my victim respond, get &quot;hired&quot;, and are being sent packages for quality control inspection. These packages have other people's names and different people's addresses on the invoices, etc. The victims are then instructed to repackage and resend the item to various addresses. Always to a different address than the last, some to other countries. Basically what this thief did was buy CC numbers, use their &quot;employees&quot; personal info to eventually open new CCs, buy more stuff online, and send it through all of their fake employees to end up back to them in Argentina. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By that point, no cop has the means to contact numerous victims across various states in a mail fraud fueled by rampant online CC theft, let alone do the investigation that ends with an international crime, all while still taking calls about your neighbor's dog pooing on your lawn. So no. With regard to crimes like that, there's little we can do. Tomorrow they'll have changed their name, the address the packages are sent to, and the victims they use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good question though. Try to ignore some who are simply bashing cops out of bias and ignorance of the investigative process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
