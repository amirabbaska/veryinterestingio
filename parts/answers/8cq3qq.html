		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lenses work both ways, so the Dr. can use a scope to look in the infant's eyes and try lenses to bring the back of the eye into focus. It won't be perfect, but if the infant has bad enough vision that they can tell the infant needs glasses, you'll be able to make a huge improvement anyway. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you've been to the eye doctor recently, you may have actually experienced the machine they use.  They project an image onto the back of the eye, and have a camera watching it as they adjust the focus of the projector lens.  When the image is in focus, you have a reading on the required correction for the eye.</p>
<p>Note that this is not incredibly accurate, which is why your eye doctor likely does a lot of other things before writing your prescription.  But it's good enough for infants to be able to see better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autorefractor" target="_blank">Autorefraction</a> is a machine that most adults and older children use. It is quick and can be done by a tech.</p>
<p>For a younger child (like an infant) who won't sit still there is a method known as <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retinoscopy" target="_blank">Retinoscopy</a> that is more likely to be used. This method requires a optometrist or ophthalmologist with training on how to use a retinoscope.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am ophthalmologist: Retinoscopy in infants is done 'old school'. A handheld retinoscope and individual lenses of different powers. Since they are too young to tell you which lens gives and better vision, it has to be done objectively, that is, streaking a light through the handheld lenses and looking at how the image is reflected back off the retina to an endpoint. This process is sometimes called the streak retinoscopy. The pupils of these infants need to be very strongly dilated to neutralize their focusing ability. Young children have very strong accommodative or focusing ability and by doing so you put the eye in its native refractive error state. The process is not as exact as you would be able to get with an older child or adult, but it is usually good enough to get you in the ballpark which is what you need to avoid a permanent defect like amblyopia (lazy eye).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
