		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two relevant horizons for this discussion. The Cosmological Event Horizon, and the Cosmic Microwave Backgound.</p>
<p>The Cosmological Event Horizon is a distance away from us beyond which if a photon is emitted right now it will never reach us due to space expanding between it and us faster than it is traveling towards us. Space is expanding everywhere, so the amount of expansion between us and another object is determined by how far away it is. For something that is close the expansion will be unnoticable, for something far enough away, it will be larger than the speed of light. You could also imagine a Cosmic Rock Horizon where if someone is beyond that distance from you, and they throw a rock at you it will never reach you because of the expansion of space between you and the rock - this is very far away, but much much closer than the Cosmological Event Horizon.</p>
<p>The Cosmic Microwave Background is the edge of the observable/visible universe. Remember that as you observe galaxies further and further away, you are observing the universe when it was much, much younger. At some point soon after the big bang the universe switched from being an extremely hot and dense non-transparent particle-soup to mostly-empty space that allows light to travel large distances without hitting anything. The CMB is the light that was emitted by this particle soup just as the universe became transparent. It is the furthest thing away in both space and time that is possible to see. And we can see it in pretty amazing detail! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background</a></p>
<p>No object in the universe has ever redshifted out of view due to being further away than the Cosmological Event Horizon. The first thing that this will happen to is the CMB itself, followed by the galaxies nearest it. Right now the number of galaxies in the visible universe is expanding as the CMB gets further away and we watch new galaxies form (they formed billions of years ago, but the light of their formation has not yet reached us.)</p>
<p>So let us think about the oldest galaxy we have ever observed with the Hubble telescope. Is there intelligent life in that galaxy? Did they just broadcast a signal this morning trying to communicate with someone outside their galaxy? No matter how powerful a receiver we build we would never hear it, because it is beyond the Cosmological Event Horizon. Space is expanding between us and that galaxy faster than their broadcast is traveling toward us. The fact that this galaxy is outisde of the Cosmological Event Horizon has nothing to do with whether or not we can see it. but it is why the signal will never reach us.</p>
<p>Its worse than that, the signal is getting further away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't visually lose them. The light that they emit now will never reach us, but the light they emitted before will take longer and longer to reach us, so they'll just gradually get dimmer and more redshifted, but never completely disappear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We lose them <em>visually</em> long before they &quot;reach&quot; the cosmic horizon: their light gets red-shifted past the visual spectrum.  That said, i don't know the answer to your question, I'm just showing off the non-answer that i do know.</p>
<p>Edit: i wonder whether their light gets shifted to universe-scale wavelengths before reading the cosmic horizon.  If so, one reason they &quot;disappear&quot; is that they can't possibly be detected at that point because you'd need a comparably-sized antennas!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an answer that leads to losing galaxies: &quot;How many galaxies emit light today (in comoving coordinates) that we can see in the future? How does that number look tomorrow, in a week, in a year, ...?&quot;</p>
<p>The answer is something like 1 galaxy &quot;lost&quot; per day. There are about 1E12 galaxies in the observable universe, but only ~1/30 of them, or 3E10, are still in our future light cone (~13 billion light years radius today). The galaxy distances at the edge of this increase roughly (but not exactly) with the speed of light while the radius of our future light cone just expands slowly, so every day we lose the galaxies in a spherical shell with a thickness of 1 light day. <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=3E10*4+pi+(13E9\)%5E2+*+1%2F365+%2F+(4%2F3+pi+(13E9\)%5E3\" target="_blank">Putting everything together</a>) we get 0.4 galaxies per day. As this is just a rough estimate, let's say 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best way to picture the effects of expanding space-time is the raisin bread model: Before baking the dough with the raisins in you plot out the relative positions of each raisin within. Once cooked though you will witness that the dough has expanded between the raisins, more so if there is more dough between each point, but the raisins themselves have not moved much, if at all.</p>
<p>I wrote an investigation piece on Dark Energy for my 3rd year dissertation. We will loose galaxies over time along the line of sight, but not at a noticeable rate, nor at a calculable rate due to their varying distributions throughout space. Also much can change over the timescales that it takes for a galaxies light to reach us from such distances as near the limits of the observable universe.</p>
<p>TL;DR space expands like bread dough between raisins, moving stuff away from each other. We will lose sight of some objects, but not soon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
