		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While you were talking about how replication studies are not attractive scientists, wouldn't it be a good idea to require a &quot;minimum&quot; number of replicate experiments to be performed. And provide some sort incentive to replicate experiments.</p>
<p>Perhaps undergrad students? This might help them understand a paper in a better way while also providing the replication required for the paper to be presented? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Derek, </p>
<p>One big problem I face is that I have family and friends who are pretty anti-science; things like this get hailed by them as evidence of their viewpoints (climate change denial, creationism, anti-gmo, anti-vax).  </p>
<p>The flipside is that I also have a lot of family and friends who subscribe to a lot of pop-science sites and pages (I fucking love science, as an example) and buy into clickbait &quot;science&quot; headlines with <strong>zero</strong> skepticism.  </p>
<p>What can random people like myself do to encourage skepticism towards headlines that mention &quot;researchers&quot;, &quot;scientists&quot;, or &quot;recent study&quot;, without undermining the credibility of scientists, science journalists, and the scientific community as a whole?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
