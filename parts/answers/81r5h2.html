		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Penguins aren’t entirely monogamous.  Certain species are more likely to return to their same partners, but even in those cases, there will be years where they will pair up with another bird.  I’ve even seen a male bounce back and forth between 2 females and try to maintain 2 separate nests for them.  I’ve also seen 2 males continually nest together every year.  There weren’t enough mature females in the colony and they grouped up, even though they never incubated any eggs.  They were actually used to foster an abandoned egg one year and they succeeded in hatching and rearing the chick.  Later on, they went their separate ways when more females became available.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends.  </p>
<p>Monogamy is common among birds, and among these there's a lot of variation, with some birds cheat a little, some alot and some apparently not at all.  </p>
<p>Famously and somewhat ironically, the albatross basically has one mate only for life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm on my phone, so right now I'm not going to bother looking up real papers, but in reality, most &quot;monogamous&quot; animals aren't really monogamous. They regular have flings, and will change mates very quickly if their current mate dies or becomes unable to reproduce.</p>

<p>One of the few organisms to be truly monogamous is a parasitic Helminth (Schistosoma mansoni), and the reason they're truly monogamous is that the Female actually lives Inside a canal on the male, and can't really get out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For certain primates, like humans:</p>
<p>&quot;A number of hypotheses have been proposed to explain the evolution of social monogamy among mammals...but the most compelling explanation for the appearance of monogamy is male infanticide.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Male infanticide leads to social monogamy in primates&quot;
<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/110/33/13328.short" target="_blank">http://www.pnas.org/content/110/33/13328.short</a></p>
<p>Another theory:
&quot;Evolutionary transitions to social monogamy in primates are associated with reductions in home range overlap, indicating that they are associated with increased competition between females.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Evolution of social monogamy in primates is not consistently associated with male infanticide&quot;
