		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Going from a low oxygen environment to a high oxygen environment, like descending elevation, you don't feel anything solid. Its more an ease in breathing.</p>
<p>100% oxygen in your environment at high air pressure for long periods of time (24+ hours) is damaging, generally. It throws the lungs out of whack. This is why its occasional necessary use is strictly monitored. It is safe to receive it for long periods at low pressure, which is how astronauts get it.</p>
<p>EDIT: <a href="https://www.popsci.com/why-did-nasa-still-use-pure-oxygen-after-apollo-1-fire" target="_blank">This source</a> claims they used five pounds per square inch with pure oxygen. Its been pointed out that after the Apollo 1 disaster they switched to the mix the Russians use, 79-21% nitrogen-oxygen at sea level pressure. It was safer.</p>
<p>The hazard of 100% oxygen is that it makes things ignite at lower temperatures, then burn hotter and faster. The gas itself doesn't burn. It is estimated in 2014 four out of five operating room fires were due to concentrated oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I went the opposite and thought you wanted to talk about low O2 levels. Hypoxia does some cool stuff to the brain, leaving people unable to register what is going on around them and how to do simple tasks to not die. I can't find the video I originally saw it in, but the one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_MI9UiYwJA" target="_blank">here</a>  has someone in the room to rescue him. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUfF2MTnqAw" target="_blank">smarter every day</a> guy did it too with similar results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main thing you will &quot;feel&quot; in air is CO2 concentration. You can oxygen deplete until you die w/o gasping for breath(EDIT: I was corrected that this is not exactly true). Breathe into a paper bag for a minute and you'll feel like you're choking because of the CO2 you exhale.</p>
<p>O2 concentration in air is 21%. In 100% O2 anything that can burn will burn. Incredibly dangerous. See Apollo 1. </p>
<p>5 parts in 1000 (0.5%, OSHA limit) of CO2 will start to make you drowsy. 50 parts in 1000 (5%) will kill you.  </p>
<p>Open a window and get some fresh air. It really does perk you up.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two main ways the body transports oxygen: dissolved in blood plasma as a gas and bound to hemoglobin on red blood cells. By far the majority is transported bound to hemoglobin. Most average healthy persons breathing normal room air would already have 99-100% of their arterial hemoglobin bound to oxygen. Increasing the ambient oxygen levels to anything above 21% would have almost no effect on the majority of your oxygen transport but would increase the partial pressure of oxygen dissolved in your blood plasma. Generally you would not notice any immediate physical effects walking into a high oxygen environment unless your bound hemoglobin was lower than normal, such as in the case of lung disease or illness, among many other reasons. Medium to long term exposure to high oxygen environments are believed to increase your risk of cancers and inflammation.</p>
<p>In low oxygen environments (below 21% oxygen in air), you would experience breathlessness, feel anxious, and eventually could develop chest pain, lightheadedness, confusion followed by seizures, unconsciousness and  cardiac arrest depending on how deprived the environment is of oxygen. It would feel slightly different than the sensation you feel when holding your breath since that response is triggered by elevated carbon dioxide levels in blood where this response is triggered by low oxygen levels in blood due to low ambient oxygen levels.  Low blood oxygen levels are not what normally  trigger you to breathe believe it or not. For most people it is the elevated carbon dioxide in blood that triggers a breath (among other triggers). In this case your carbon dioxode levels would be normal since you are still breathing out normally (getting rid of carbon dioxide).  For this reason, low oxygen environments can very quickly incapacitate a person before they have a chance to react or remove themselves from the environment. Much much faster than if you just held your breath since the low oxygen environment will essentially diffuse oxygen out of your blood through your lungs thanks to the reversed concentration gradient.  Lastly, it's good to know that it's not just an absence of oxygen that poses a risk, more often it is a displacement of oxygen from the air due to the presence of another gas at a higher than normal concentration that can create the low oxygen environment.
Hope this covers your questions, perhaps someone with a different background can answer the explosion risk part. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Respiratory therapist here. Indeed room air has about 20.8% oxygen. If you wear a mask blowing 100% oxygen into your face, it would not &quot;feel&quot; any different. There is however oxygen toxcity, ive never seen this happen but it can cause ringing in the ears, nausea, seizures, mood changes. This is usually seen when breathing more than 50% oxygen.</p>
<p>Side note these %s are given normal air pressure, this all changes when the pressures are different.
Such as when in a plane and when it depressures.</p>
<p>Edit: Phone fat finger spelling correction from &quot;Moose changes&quot; to &quot;Mood changes&quot; ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
