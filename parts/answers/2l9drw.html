		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For what it's worth, I have some tumors on the side of my heart.  Some have actually grown off of my liver and are just resting against my heart, while others have grown around my ascending aorta, which makes all of them very hard to get at, unfortunately.  </p>
<p>I know this isn't &quot;tumors growing in the heart&quot; but I thought it might show there is some grey area with tumors.</p>
<p>Stupid terminal cancer, I don't &quot;heart&quot; it at all.</p>
<p>What? I'm in the middle of 55 hours of chemo this week and almost 7,000 hours of chemo over all, I'm allowed to make shirty jokes. </p>
<p>Edit: Shirty, shitty, whatever.  Fuck it, it's staying in!  Like I said, I'm on chemo. YES, I AM PLAYING THE CANCER CARD ON A MISSPELLING!    I do like the clothes related jokes below though...</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold! <strong>(x4!!)</strong> Not sure if it's for the tumors or for the misspelling... wait, why do I care it's GOLD!  Woohoo!  Now if I can just live long enough to enjoy it...  <strong>Wow!  4x gold I feel like one of those James Bond girls in Goldfinger!!</strong></p>
<p>ANOTHER EDIT: <a href="https://imgur.com/a/nPwnb" target="_blank">Here is an album with proof from some of my stories</a>  Yes, you can figure out who I am and where I live pretty easily, but I'm dying anyway, sooo....</p>
<p>AND YET ANOTHER ADDITION: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIYlrCDydxs" target="_blank">Here is the video of my friend coming into the chemo room dressed as the grim reaper.  I'm the dude in the &quot;fuck cancer&quot; shirt</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here.  You may not hear about them, but they sure do exist.  I saw two in one week on my stroke service, a rare one called papillary fibroelastoma where the tumor sticks to the valve of your heart and when your heart pumps, it just flicks off little pieces of itself that go to your brain and block blood flow to a specific area causing a stroke. </p>
<p>The most common heart tumor is called an atrial myxoma, which grows in one of the chambers of your heart like a little ball on a string.  If it gets big enough, it can disrupt blood flow from exiting that chamber and you die. </p>
<p>So really, they do exist. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cardiologist here. Cardiac tumors (&quot;heart cancers&quot;) do exist, but they're extremely rare. When they do occur, the majority (~75%) are benign; they are typically found incidentally during lab tests/imaging looking for other things, and they often don't cause symptoms. The remainder are malignant which, loosely speaking, means dangerous.</p>
<p>Those above are all considered &quot;primary&quot; tumors, meaning tumors/cancers that arise from the heart itself. Again, those are very rare. Much more commonly found in and around the heart are &quot;metastases&quot;, which are cancers that arise elsewhere and travel to the heart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the same reason muscle cancers are rare. The heart is mostly muscle. Muscle tissue is pretty boring - it just contracts, rarely divides (cancer is uncontrolled division), and the heart is not really exposed to carcinogens like other orgasms.</p>
<p>Edit: oh god, damn you autocorrect...</p>
<p>Edit2: thank you for the gold! My first gilding!</p>
<p>Edit 3: neurons also rarely divide, but brain tumors often arise from glial cells (e.g. glioblastoma), which are support cells that can divide. Also, I believe there are neural stem cells and some neurons that can also divide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
