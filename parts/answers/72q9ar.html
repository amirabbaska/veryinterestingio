<p>I think this is the wikipedia article you're looking for.</p>
<p>There have been plenty of tests for a variety of nuclear propulsion drives. There are essentially three types.</p>
<p>Nuclear Electric - You have a small reactor or nuclear battery and use the electricity generated from it to power some form of propulsion that relies on electricity, like ion thrusters. Unfortunately, nuclear reactors are quite heavy compared to solar panels, and ion thrusters are so slow they're not very practical for manned spaceflight. Nuclear Electric propulsion may have a future someday on a deep space probe that's too far out to rely on solar, but as far as I know nothing uses it today.</p>
<p>Nuclear Thermal - Basically, you take a nuclear reactor and pump hydrogen into it. The hydrogen heats up, you let it shoot out the back, propelling your rocket forwards. It's kind of like you just spring a leak in the reactor's cooling system. Nuclear Thermal Rockets have real promise for providing very efficient thrust, and there have been several projects in the past to experiment or develop them, including a couple that are currently ongoing. But they have problems.</p>
<p>Due to weight concerns, shielding for the reactor would have to be kept to a minimum. Most designs provide only for a shield dividing the crew from the reactor, meaning everything around the spacecraft would be bombarded with a lot of radiation. The exhaust is also radioactive. That's less of a problem if you only use it on an upper stage and rely on a normal chemical rocket to get you to space, but that's kind of putting the cart before the horse. They're also a pain to test, since you have to collect the exhaust or give cancer to your neighbors.</p>
<p>You also have the shared problem with all of these designs- even proven rocket systems fail on a fairly regular basis. If you have enough material for a reactor go up in a high altitude explosion, you're going to be raining material down on a very large area. Even if it's over the ocean, you'll contaminate the food chain. It'd potentially be worse than Chernobyl.</p>
<p>As an aside, I'd also recommend reading about project pluto. It was a nuclear jet engine on an aircraft, not a nuclear rocket on a spacecraft, but it used a pretty similar principle- it just heated intake air rather than hydrogen fuel. It would have been a nuclear bomber that could fly practically forever, and after dropping its bombs could have spent weeks flying at low altitude to kill more people with sonic booms and radioactive exhaust.</p>
<p>Nuclear Pulse - This is the fun one. Basically, nuclear pulse engines are just shooting a nuclear bomb out the back, immediately setting it off, and riding the force of the explosion. They're utterly bonkers. They should be very efficient space propulsion, but they have added political problems. For some reason, launching a huge gun loaded with a magazine of dozens of nuclear bombs into space and having it orbit over everybody's heads doesn't make other countries happy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Orion_(nuclear_propulsion</a>)</strong></p>
<p>In theory it would be a way to get enormous loads into orbits, in practice it would be a way to make a whole lot of people very angry because you were setting of nukes. irradiating your launch pad the atmosphere and risking distributing your &quot;rocket fuel&quot; across the local landscape if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Politically and environmentally this simply would not work in practice. The physics are okay though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have a plan to do it, but its not environmentally friendly enough to use on earth, and lifting nuclear bombs into space to use as fuel isnt fuel efficient. If you are more interested though look up Project Orion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there's 3 options here: 1 is the &quot;nuclear thermal engine&quot; which is basically exactly what you've said. 2 is even madder, it's called an &quot;Orion Drive&quot; and it basically consists of having a huge plate on the back of your rocket and then dropping nuclear bombs behind you which go off, pushing against the plate. And 3, perhaps the maddest of all, a nuclear gun where you're the bullet. </p>
<p>In all cases there's no insurmountable challenge but there are significant engineering ones, notably around building a spaceship strong enough. NASA got pretty close on the nuclear thermal engine, the rest are more conceptual.</p>
<p>The two bigger issues are 1) fallout and radiation and its effect on planet earth meaning 3 is ruled out and 1 and 2 are only really viable options if taken as far as orbit conventionally and 2) the fact that at the moment conventional propellants work just fine for everything we might want to do. If we get serious about moving large payloads higher than Low Earth Orbit (say if we want to visit mars) we might revisit the idea, but at the moment conventional propellants are doing all the jobs we need doing just fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We could though. Not from a nuclear explosion though, but using fissile material to heat a fuel up so that it's pressure rises and it's flung out of the motor to provide thrust. It would be more fuel efficient than a chemical rocket, but provide less thrust, making it hard to use one as a primary engine to take off, and it still uses fuel, making it have similar limits as chemical rockets. Plus if something goes wrong, and the reaction vessel is breached, such as an explosion, you just released contaminated material all through the atmosphere creating fallout over a wide area. </p>
<p>We do use nuclear materials as electric generators though which could power ION propulsion to drive a space craft, and we already use them to provide electrical power such as in the Voyager spacecraft. </p>
<p>The reason we can't explode nuclear material in a controlled way to power a rocket is the critical mass is too large for a controlled explosion. </p>
<p>A rocket motor is not exponential, but a nuclear explosion is. I don't think people really grasp the concept of what exponential means. Put simply, the more it happens, the more it will happen. In a rocket motor this isn't true and it's not exponential. The more fuel you feed the combustion chamber, the more thrust it will produce, but there is nothing in the chemical reaction used to create the thrust that would cause the reactions to keep getting bigger and faster exponentially. </p>
<p>A nuclear explosion on the other hand is a chain reaction. One atom splits, it's neutron strikes another which splits it, now 2 neutrons are flying, then 4, then 8, then 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, etc etc. In other words each time an atom of U235 falls part, it encourages other atoms of U235 to do the same. This takes place in miliseconds until the fuel is exhausted, or it blows itself apart, releasing all of that energy pretty much instantaneously. There is no way to control the speed of a nuclear explosion enough to use it as thrust. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
