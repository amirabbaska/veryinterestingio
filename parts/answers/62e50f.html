		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It seems nobody purposely got anyone sick.  Flint was looking to get out of its water contract with Detroit Water and Sewage, where they were receiving treated, clean water for many years.  Flint River was a backup water source already.  It was presumed safe to use as a backup and thus safe to use as a go forward solution until they could get something more modernized in place.  The water they got from the river had to be treated, so they built a water treatment facility.  However, old pipes, poor planning, etc.. created issues and the water ended up bad.</p>
<p>Some scary things that happened was that the EPA and government officials knew the water was bad and they didn't tell the public.  While the mayor is on TV drinking tap water to calm the fears, the EPA had already measured high levels of lead in the water and didn't do anything.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Governor overrode the local elections and put an &quot;Emergency Manager&quot; by the name of Darnell Earley in charge. Basically he took away the power of the locally-elected officials. The idea is that this &quot;Emergency Manager&quot; would be able to cut through the red tape and get stuff done in order to fix whatever emergency the Governor dreamed up in order to justify his action. </p>
<p>The problem is that bureaucracy and red tape exists for a reason. Rules get put into place because someone screwed up (or was corrupt) before. When you bypass those rules, you risk making the same mistake someone else made in the past. I'm all for efficiency, but when a business screws up, it folds and people go find jobs somewhere else.  When a government screws up, people die (or in this case get neurologically damaged for life).  This came from running the government like a business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, the reason the pipes corroded was because the water from Detroit was treated with several chemicals (as is necessary and normal), one of which was there to protect the pipes from corrosion. However, when flint switched to the river as its main source of water, they left out this very important chemical, there for causing all of the pipes to begin erroding, releasing lead from the makeup of the pipes.
This is also why even though we have switched back to Detroit water, the lead levels are still moderately high (though deemed &quot;safe&quot; now). The pipes' internal seal is now gone and they continue to release lead into the water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot of pressure to not raise water and sewer rates. Since governing bodies have to determine these rates, the pressure is political. Historically water has been free (wells) or nearly free when a large local industry was paying a huge share of the cost (Canton NC sewer comes to mind). Modern wisdom is that combined water and sewer bills are deemed &quot;affordable&quot; when below about 1.5% of median household income. But even at this rate, most utilities are falling way behind on regular maintenance let alone keeping up with treating dirtier water, or complying with stricter wastewater pollution standards. There is indeed studying of the issue, but nobody really wants to admit that the real cost of clean water is much higher than this accepted threshold. 2%? 3% 5% of your income? We don't know really, and it's very basin specific. For some idea of the magnitude of such numbers, if your household income were 50,000 a year, that'd mean your combined water and sewer bill would be over $200 a month ($208). You're knee jerk thought that this is atrocious is exactly why elected officials won't ever consider such high rates, and exactly why even a minor cost savings as seen in Flint, can end up happening, despite the consequences. Rates as a percent of income is of course already a flawed measure, since for low income areas, food and housing eat up a much higher percent of incomes right off the bat so in a place like Flint, with a shrinking customer base to boot, any increase to rates is acutely felt by those paying it, especially on the low side of that median. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They knew. They chose not to add a recommended additive that would have prevented all of this, whether do to bureaucratic error, laziness, or cheapness we don't know. </p>
<p>What I do know is they've stopped giving out water at the bus terminal, and they won't give me water at the distribution center because I can't update my address on my ID until I can get mail where I live (so, never, because my parents could then find me and start shit again) so now I have to walk 6 miles twice a day to fill pitchers at my &quot;sister's&quot; well water apartment so my cats and carer have water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
