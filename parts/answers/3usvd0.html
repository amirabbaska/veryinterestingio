		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different materials attenuate (absorb) photons of different wavelengths at different rates.  The reason is essentially twofold.</p>
<p>This laser is evidently calibrated to a wavelength beneficial for irradiating this particular material.  Attenuation in skin revolves around targeting a specific chromophore; blood attenuates best at ~450nm, eumelanin and pheomelanin (unsurprisingly) into the ultraviolet spectrum at ~200nm or lower.  These chromophores attenuate poorly at certain wavelengths too.  <a href="http://imgur.com/a/DyOks" target="_blank">Here</a> are two graphs from my PhD thesis showing this (secondary research - can provide sources if desired).  Note the log scales.</p>
<p>The second reason is that this guy is light-skinned; he has comparatively very little melanin concentration.  It's a classic problem in any laser therapy; white skin attenuates at a far, far lower rate than black - photons have a high propensity to scatter rather than absorb.  Fewer photons means less heat, which means little to no damage.  I suspect that if someone with darker skin, around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitzpatrick_scale" target="_blank">Fitzpatrick 5 or 6</a> were to try this, they'd have more predictable results and see at least a little skin damage.  As mentioned, it's a common laser therapies problem; treating melanin-rich structures, such as melanoma works better the lighter someone's skin is because of the contrast between tumour and tissue.  Treating darker skin is far more difficult because this contrast tends to be far less.</p>
<p>Source: my PhD is more or less in this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who uses industrial lasers all the time and has pointed them at foodstuffs that mimic human tissue, I can tell you the following things:</p>
<p>1) That is definitely a Q-switched laser. You can tell from the &quot;plasma&quot;. (White glow if it isn't a camera trick with the Bayer mask showing NIR as white instead of the blueish thing you normally see)
2) The pulse energy is rather low (less than 10 mJ, maybe less than 1 mJ).
3) The wavelength is going to be around 1070 nm which is weakly absorbed by water (flesh and skin). However, if the laser hits a dark spot or manages to cause the skin to carbonize through heating even for a couple of milliseconds, the nature of the video will change drastically.
4) I doubt somewhat that they are actually using a full kW of average power in that demonstration even if the laser is capable of it.
5) The man's hand is outside the focus of the beam.</p>
<p>I can also say from experience that even 20 W of ~ 1000 nm light focused to a 6 mm spot (very loose focus) is enough to cause pain after dwelling for about 2-3 seconds.</p>
<p>So in summary: the light is focused on the metal and very strongly absorbed by rust and steel and expanding gas pockets in the material assist in the ablative action. On the man's hand it is weakly absorbed and weakly focussed and scanned so quickly that the heat doesn't have time to build up.</p>
<p>Don't fuck around with lasers stronger than 5 mW without training, goggles or an enclosure. Don't fuck around with lasers stronger than 10 W ever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>12 year laser calibration technician from the semiconductor industry here: The unit used has a fixed focal length, meaning the unit must be held a certain distance from the working surface in order for the beam to be concentrated enough to burn an object. optimal focal distance = burning point, for the laser in this unit. It probably has a fixed focusing lens. Anything over or under the optimal focal distance from the laser emitter after passing through the lens is (still dangerous) but not focused enough to lase through a material. The light is there, but it's not down to a fine enough point. Kind like playing with a magnifying glass in the sun. You can see that as he brings the unit up to and away from the surface, the beam begins to lase the surface at a certain focal distance. The surface of this person's hand is not within the optimal focal distance of the laser in use. Now, if he were to have pulled back and bring the units focal point to the top surface of his hand when he scanned over his hand, he would have burned the shit out of his skin. </p>
<p>My experience with etching lasers operated within a tolerance of less than 30 micron focal distance to etch numbers onto silicon wafers used to make memory chips. Some lasers were used to etch, some used to count and measure the size of dust particles, and some used to measure the thickness of layers of materials used in making memory chips (down to less than 10 angstroms). I've worked with HeNe, Nd:YAG, Yttrium-Lithium, Argon Ion and a few other lasers over the course of my career. I loved every minute of working with these lasers, because... I'm a laser nerd and it's always what I wanted to do for a living since I was a teen. But then I stuck my pee pee in crazy and everything went to shit. now I sit at home, and peruse ELIF. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<blockquote>
<p>The rust is being removed via infrared laser ablation. It only works if the substance to be ablated absorbs enough of its light energy to be heated up/vaporized. Since the man's fingers are
essentially white they reflect nearly all of the laser light and thus so long as the fingers are moving rapidly enough through the laser light they are not burned.</p>

<p>From what I can tell you could definitely burn yourself with a 1000w laser, so I'm sure that warmed his skin up a bit, but he passed it over pretty quickly and apparently it was enough to avoid a burn. Also, to absorb the energy the material needs to be dark enough, the lighter his skin the less energy is absorbed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
