		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Professional sprinters can hold their top speed for about 10 strides. Usain Bolt achieved and maintained his top speed for 8 strides during his 9.58s record 100m run. He covered that 100m in ~40 strides, so his top speed lasted only ~20m, between ~50-70m marks.</p>
<p>Carl Lewis used to have slightly better speed endurance than Bolt, his top speed lasted 10-12 strides, and his slowing down later in the race was less than typical, so it looked like he accelerated toward the finish line relative to the others.</p>
<p>Slow twitch muscles, where endurance is built in, are required even for 100m. The opposite is true for fast twitch muscles, one needs a speed to run a marathon. There is no clear physical boundary between a sprint and endurance runs. The difference between a sprint and endurance runs is in contribution of each muscle type. Sprint events &quot;end&quot; at 400m, and endurance events &quot;begin&quot; at 1500m, 800m is a like a 50-50 combo of the two, meaning 50% of work(=power*time) comes from each muscle type.</p>
<p>You can try to &quot;sprint&quot; a mile mentally, like go a full force from the start and try to hold for as long as possible. But physically it would be something like 95% of power by the fast muscles and 5% of power by the slow muscles from the start. Then the ratio changes as the run progresses, and in the end your power ratio is something like 20% and 80%. I'm making these numbers up, but you get the point.</p>
<p>Such attempted &quot;sprint&quot; would be extremely exhausting and maybe dangerous. I don't think even animals running for their lives from a predator can pull this off. They still tactically pace themselves and conserve strength even when a certain death is right behind them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As some have mentioned, the limiting factor is <strong>energy</strong>.</p>
<p>Your body uses food to make chemicals and store them. When breaking these chemicals, energy is released. These fuels come in many types and include fat, glycogen (a storage form of glucose), and ATP. Additionally, you always have some of these chemicals floating in your blood in a ready-to-use form (glucose and free fatty acids).</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: (/u/Bearblasphemy helped me clarify this part) ATP is your fuel, and each cell only has a minimum ammount. After that, your body uses a molecule called creatine-phosphate to regenerate some ATP, but this, too, is very limited. Once they are used, you simple won't have enough energy contract in multiple muscle fibers at the same time and at a fast rate. Since those are the factors that determine the force of muscular contraction, you will feel as if you were out of strength.</p>
<p>The muscle can use some of the free glucose and some of the glycogen (stored in the muscle and in the liver), but to regenerate ATP. They are used mainly during low-intensity exercises for a prolonged period. Fat is also used in longer exercises, during rest, and between meals. All of these are used to restore your intracellular ATP, but it takes some time. They are not as fast as creatine. ATP is your main source of energy, and although all of these others can become ATP, they need some time to do it.</p>
<p>Finally, I'd just like to point out that high-intensity exercise is mainly anaerobic. You don't use much oxygen for that, but the consequence is that you accumulate lactic acid. The limit of high-intensity exercise is around 1 minute, and I don't know what would happen if you kept it going for much longer. You would probably enter in a dangerous state of acidosis.</p>
<p><strong>Tl;dr</strong> The limit of your sprinting isn't just a matter of muscle strength or willpower. Your muscle cells need a fast source of fuel and those are limited and take time to regenerate. You also acumulate lactic acid from the anaerobic metabolism, and prolonging high-intensity exercise could increase its levels to dangerous ammounts.</p>
<p><strong>Edit 2</strong>: /u/frontsquats is an expert and he showed articles which state that you reach your limit even before wasting 50% of your ATP. This is mainly due accumulation of H+ and a subsequent response from your central nervous system. /u/Chad_Worthington_3rd suggested your muscle loses the capabaility to use ATP in the rate necessary for vigorous movment, and that this would be the main mechanism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is simplified, ELI5 version:</p>
<p>Lets assume that by sprinting you mean running as fast as you can, and after your speed drops you are no longer sprinting.</p>
<p>Your muscles convert compound called ATP to energy, which in turn moves your muscles.</p>
<p>Using ATP for energy doesn't require oxygen. Creating more ATP with creatine doesn't require oxygen either. Making more ATP after you have used all your ATP and creatine requires oxygen.</p>
<p>When well rested, you have enough ATP in your muscles for 4-10 seconds (depends on the person and training) of maximum intensity work (sprinting)</p>
<p>With creatine (thereÂ´s creatine in your muscles, in the form of creatine phosphate) you can basically double this time. This also depends on training and nutrition (creatine supplements increase the amount)</p>
<p>So basically a well trained and nutritioned athlete can keep up maximum intensity work without oxygen for a about 15 seconds.</p>
<p>After this time, your body starts using oxygen and at the same time the production rate of ATP slows down and your speed also slows down.</p>
<p>So the answer is no you cant sprint a mile and yes there is a limit. With normal genes even with all the training in the world you are not able to keep your maximal speed up for more than 10-20 seconds.</p>
<p>TLDR; You can't sprint a mile and there is a limit (10-20 seconds of work).</p>
<p>Edit: Of course well trained athletes can run a mile so fast that normal people consider it sprinting. But if we consider sprinting as &quot;running as fast you possibly can&quot;, then they are actually not sprinting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. Sprints are an anaerobic exercise which is when your body goes into an oxygen/energy deficit and repairs it afterward. When you train for this you're increasing the amount of energy you can put out and your ability to recouperate post exercising. </p>
<p>Running is aerobic thus you train for it by raising your VO2 max which is your bodies ability to oxygenate the blood during the exercise. Training for distance runs is quite different.</p>
<p>These exercises and the way your body responds is quite different. That said someone starting from scratch(a couch potato) will increase their ability in both when practicing either while a trained athlete will diminish their ability in their primary exercise if they try the opposite one. You can see the difference in the type of runners physiques easily but some noteworthy differences are that distance runners need looser(more flexible) muscles and as little body weight as possible while sprinters need larger muscles that can fire and contract rapidly.</p>
<p>ELI5 TLDR- While your bodies movements are virtually identical aside from the speed, your respiratory and circulatory systems respond to the two exercises radically differently. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current world record for 1 mile is 3 minutes and 43 seconds. That's 14 seconds per 100 meters, or 56 seconds per 400m. That's a big difference compared to the sub 10 second 100m world record. </p>
<p>The reason is due to different energy systems our bodies use in running. We have a sprinting mode which uses little to no oxygen typically in 60/100m races. An endurance system that is in marathons. And a system that uses oxygen and reuses the lactic created whilst running, this is used in mile races. Athletes who train for the mile focus on making their bodies as strong as efficient as possible, but they're not sprinting. </p>
<p>For context I am a coach and a very average runner and I can sprint 100m on its own in 15 seconds, 400m in 60 seconds and a mile in 5:30. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
