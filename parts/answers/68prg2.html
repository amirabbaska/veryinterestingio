		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, B.A. in psychology here.</p>
<p>Let me ask you this: if a person with schizophrenia doesn't ever hear speech, would they still hear voices? </p>
<p>The thing about schizophrenia is that it falls under the categorization of psychosis, that is, a departure from reality. In order for someone to be classified as a schizophrenic, their separation from reality would be identified given an already established reality, namely, that people should not hear a person's voice talking when there is no such external stimulus. &quot;I can hear my own voice in my mind though,&quot; you might say. That is not the same since it is not a perception. It is not an external stimulus interpreted by your brain. In a schizophrenic or other psychotic individual who hears voices, the brain perceives the voice as if it is an external stimulus, or at least that is what we are able to determine based on individuals' descriptions of said voices. However, the individual is still aware in most cases, depending on the intensity of the psychosis, that the voice is in their head.</p>
<p>Thus, the issue can be anywhere in the brain areas related to auditory sensation, perception, and of course all other related mental networks, such as those of memory, speaking, language analysis, etc. The way our brain functions is that we perceive what is happening in the world outside our minds by complicated processes in our brain and body that TRANSLATE an external stimulus like sound into patterned signals that we can understand. </p>
<p>Something to consider - If a person DOES hear voices given they have never heard human speech, including their own, as a result of drug use or mental illness, then we can conclude that there is a very strong genetic component, something in our DNA, that &quot;remembers&quot; what human speech is. Guess what? Studies have shown that a deaf person who has never heard human speech in their life and has been diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, DOES describe hearing voices. Isn't that fascinating? Given this information, this means that the cause for hearing voices may not by a separation from reality... it may not have to do with external stimuli. Perhaps, it is something very deep in our DNA. No surprise there, schizophrenia is quite heritable. In the case of paranoid schizophrenia, 30-40% of siblings will share it. That is, your chance of having Par. Schz. are significant if your sibling has it. Amplified by the use of drugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I doubt anyone will see this reply now with all these other posts, but Hell, I'm going to post anyway.</p>
<p>To understand why hallucinations occur, you must first understand how the brain works on a fundamental level.</p>
<p>The brain is what we would call a 'feedback mechanism'. Essentially this just means that is primary function is to take in inputs (stimuli / 'the feed') from its environment (the world) and then produce an appropriate response ('feeding back' input to the world) through moving your body. Afterward the results of your movement result in new stimuli from the world. Essentially it results in a constant cycle of action and reaction. </p>
<p>There is obviously a lot more to it which I don't cover, but more relevant to this subject, the brain itself is composed of various sections which all control and perform different functions. Some process thought, some process your visual sight, some control and process memories, and some process sound. </p>
<p>All of these various sections are linked up together, too. They constantly reference each other, feeding input and output to each other. So, the brain is also composed of its own internal feedback mechanisms, with its own unique cycles.</p>
<p>Essentially, all reality as we know and experience it is controlled by all of these loops. Everything you hear, everything you see, and everything you feel is composed of these loops. This is the primary key to understanding where hallucinations come from.
Keep this in mind.</p>
<p>During an auditory hallucination, what is actually happening is that rather than the usual feedback cycles in the brain simply processing inputs, some sort of stimulus causes a loop which is referencing the exact same auditory processing functions as the ones which create 'sound' in one's mind, along with some semi-cognitive functions or memory retrieval (or likely both). Basically, it's a 'broken loop'. </p>
<p>In other words, instead of a simple stimulus travelling its normal route of pathways in the brain, it striggers a sort 'detour' route through different pathways and along the way it collects both sounds and 'ideas'. The result is someone experiencing thoughts in the form of spoken words, or other sounds, in a way that would seem 'real' in exactly the same way as any other sound would feel real. This is because it is created within exactly the same methods as everything 'real'.</p>
<p>tl;dr version:</p>
<p>Your brain creates reality through a bunch of loops and when one of these loops gets mixed up it creates a different kind of reality that seems just as real as the one you normally experience every day.</p>
<p>If anyone actually does read this and has any questions feel free to ask! I'll do my best to answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><strong>The answer is we don't know</strong>. Searching my institutions medical database says there is preliminary data indicating that strange activity in the auditory part of the brain (superior temporal gyrus) is partially responsible. That's it? </p>
<p>Yes, sounds dumb and it's certainly disappointing, but that's it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I don't know where they come from but I hear it with my ears like it's outside of me.  Usually tells me to do akward or bad things.  Good thing is I also have OCD so I can use compulsions to not act on the voices.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

No idea why. Worked with this population in hospitals. We dealt with effect not the cause.
