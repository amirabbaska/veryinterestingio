		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's actually a brilliant question! Sorry if my reply is a little scattered - I was always better at marketing and chimpanzees than I was writing. </p>
<p>Your question is really marvelous - we don't <em>know</em> exactly how much of the line between the two species is genetic, and cultural. They are <em>very</em> similar genetically, and there is some reporting of interbreeding in captivity, but the two species are <em>very</em> distinct, both in behaviour and range. They tend not to overlap in the wild, and intermingling hasn't been observed naturally, so a lot of the thories between the species haven't been tested (plus, it could be potentially unethical to test - it's hard to justify giving a child to an adult who might kill it, and we have to treat chimps with that same sort of respect for their minds, even if we clearly have differing values). </p>
<p>Chimps and bonobos <em>do</em> have some pretty major cultural differences that likely wouldn't translate well with one-another, but we don't know how much of their cultures are just genetically motivated, and how many involve the transmission of knowledge and information between generations. </p>
<p>It's <em>possible</em> that members of either species could adapt into the cultures of their peers, and vice versa - it's a touch of a misconception that Bonobos are less violent, in as much as at some point, they decided amongst themselves to resolve their upsets in more friendly ways. There's a <em>lot</em> of value in determining whether or not this is genetic or cultural, and it's possible either is true (it could be the consequence of selective pressures choosing for sex-responsive bonobos against overagressive or undersexed apes, for example, or it could well be just the way they teach one-another, or it could be both, with their culture selecting out apes who don't adapt well to their cultural values). </p>
<p>There's also been some examples of how <em>Pan</em> infants can adapt to lifestyles and cultures that aren't their own by default. It certainly wasn't seamless, but Nim Chimpsky ended up being a pretty solid television devotee who very clearly expressed his sexual attraction towards non-chimp researchers and handlers. This didn't always work out well for people who tried this sort of cultural exchange (Moe and the Davis family are an example of the worst case), but it did open the window to the idea that chimps <em>will</em> try to adapt to the cultures they're presented during their upbringing... as much as their genes will allow them to. That's something of the line in this conversation, and where I have to say &quot;I'm not sure&quot;.</p>
<p>A <em>good</em> answer is &quot;I think they could adopt between species, and that they would adapt to the cultural values of each other, with only specific instances of upsets and flare-ups occurring, but that's only a hypothesis (if a testable one)&quot;. We're still trying to find the line between behavior, genes, and culture when it comes to chimps, and the best answer for your question would come when we have clearer solutions to the culture/genetics problem.</p>
<p>It could also be reasonable to guess that <em>if</em> the child was successfully introduced (and ever successfully mated), that after successive generation</p>
<p>(Also - it's a bit of a misunderstanding that chimp troops are patriarical. They <em>are</em> lead by the will of the alpha male, but that ifluence is almost <em>always</em> moderated through the will of the alpha female (sometimes a mate, but a position that's as often a mother, or influential aunt), and where the male can choose to ignore the females, there are <em>major</em> political losses in chosing to do so - it can be the kind of decision that allows other males to play politics, and overtake the alpha completely. In a chimp troop, a male leads only as much as he has the support of the alpha female - and she's usually politically savvy). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the TV show &quot;Escape to Chimp Eden&quot; they mixed Bonobos and Chimps successfully and they integrated into one group.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wrote a senior thesis on hybridization between anubis and hamadryas baboons. It's an area of interspecific breeding that has been relatively <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:IJOP.0000043964.01085.dc" target="_blank">well researched</a>. It may provide a good analogue. </p>
<p>Hamadryas baboons are highly hierarchical, with successful males developing and defending fairly large harems, but do not have quite the same kind of male cohort alliances as chimpanzees. Male Hamadyas are <a href="https://53744bf91d44b81762e0-fbbc959d4e21c00b07dbe9c75f9c0b63.ssl.cf3.rackcdn.com/media/AE/AE1CA65A-868A-418A-85BC-CF0B3AA25C61/Presentation.Large/Male-hamadryas-baboon-in-threat-display.jpg" target="_blank">tough looking</a> characters. They signal tension and aggression by blinking and yawning to expose their large canines.
Anubis baboons display the same kinds of signaling, but troops tend not to be dominated by a single male. Males emigrate,  and older unrelated males who are not vying for a high ranking form peacable relationships with other males and femails, and can develop coalitions to displace a single highly aggressive male. That seems to mitigate overall violence in anubis troops. It's a better place to be a female!</p>
<p>What seems to be important to cultural hybridizations is the <em>direction</em> of hybridization. Male Hamadryas who immigrate into an anubis troop do not develop harems and seem to get along okay. Female anubis who join a Hamadryas troop fall right into the male dominated heirarchy. Blended groups demonstrate intermediate behaviors. I can't recall what happens to male anubis who join a hamadryas troop, but suspect that since they are not quite as large or aggressive, would tend to fall into the bottom of the heirarchy. </p>
<p>I think it can be dangerous to extrapolate directly from chimpanzee and bonobo troop behavior except to say that they are genetically interrelated enough to be very similar. Family trees are bushy, and we don't get to see the full range of troop behaviors that might have existed at one time, only the ones most likely to -er- survive! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've read that a small number of times, in the past million years or so, chimps and bonobos have undoubtedly cross bred. </p>
<p>So yes, there appears to be some light mixing of the DNA, but it appears that it was not very common or widespread across time.</p>
<p>(Or perhaps it was much more common for those 2 species to &quot;get together&quot; than we suspect but rarely resulted in viable offspring?!)</p>
<hr />
<p>I've also heard some claims of bonobo chimp hybrids in captivity... but NONE of these claims have ever been backed up with evidence, that I am aware of. </p>
<p>I've even heard some had videotape of the hybrids... but if so... then where's the film then? Something like that would be pretty huge news. </p>
<p>If anyone here knows of any such evidence I'd certainly want to take a look! (Probably a skeptical look!)</p>
<hr />
<p>As for intermixing social groups (such as introducing chimp babies to bonobos, or vice versa), as far as I know no such study has ever been done. </p>
<p>We know when intelligent creatures are raised by other intelligent creatures, there is indeed significant behavior changes, often. </p>
<p>So I would guess there would be a good chance of behavior changes... it would be interesting to see. </p>
<p>But... such an experiment would probably be a little bit unethical... as most would feel the obligation to make sure an orphaned Chimp is raised by other chimps, rather than bonobos. </p>
<p>(But if you can't find a mother-chimp to take care of a baby-chimp... then would it be such a bad thing to introduce the baby to a bonobo mother instead? Not sure...)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
