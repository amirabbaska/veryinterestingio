		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isn’t this more of a linguistics question? We say large numbers in a way in keeping with the commas (one million, three hundred and seventy three thousand, two hundred and eight = 1,373,208) but decimals as a stream of digits (three point one, four, one, five, nine, two, six, five, four = 3.141592654).
I’d be keen to hear the ultimate result from this discussion.</p>
<p>EDIT:
Fascinating discussion, especially with regards to the different locations of the comma (or other mark) depending on the language of the writer.
Apologies for my very own faux pas with the multiple uses of ‘and’ in my list of numbers (and thank you to those who have pointed this out). I wouldn’t use multiple ands in any other list until the end, I suppose the same should apply with naming a large number.</p>
<p>EDIT AGAIN:
Or maybe it wasn’t a faux pas, rule Britannia and all that.</p>
<p>FURTHER EDIT:
The discussion on the use of ‘and’ is very interesting. Personally (as is common in the UK) I use ‘and’ to break up the big numbers. As in this example it does avoid some confusion (I’ll use dollars as there are more dollar uses on Reddit than pound users). Wouldn’t “two hundred five dollars” be $1000 rather than $205?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In technical/mathematical writing, we wouldn’t usually even use the separators. Long strings of numbers would have a space in between every three digits instead, if anything, and we also generally try to avoid needing to write a number like that unless necessary. </p>
<p>In other contexts, needing more than 2-3 digits after the decimal point is rare altogether. So, a convention for separating them never really formed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd say that because after the decimal point, those numbers just represent a fraction of 1 whole number.  Commas help us determine how large a number is at a quick glance, and after the decimal point the number isn't really getting larger just infinitely closer to 1 whole number so it really wouldn't serve much of a purpose.
Also the further decimal places you move out past 1 whole number; tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc, the less important they become in most applications in general. Therefor I don't think a need to use commas in decimals was ever needed or practical. Just a guess though. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subitizing" target="_blank">subitising</a>, which allows the reader to glance at the size of the number easily. In most contexts it is not meaningful to subitise decimals as each successive digit is less and less meaningful, however sometimes spaces are used when the display of decimals is useful such as when using scientific notation.</p>
<p>Interestingly it's not restricted to just the visual representations of numbers, we also break apart large numbers in speech, and there are even perception benefits by tactile groupings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
