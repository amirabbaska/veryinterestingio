		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The particle itself was never of any particular relevance, except for potential weeding out potential grand-unified theories.  The importance of the discovery of the boson was that it confirmed that the Higgs FIELD was there, which was the important thing.  For about the last 50 years, particle physics has constructed itself upon the un-verified assumption that there must be a Higgs field.  However, you can't experimentally probe an empty field, so to prove it exists you must give it a sufficiently powerful &quot;smack&quot; to create an excitation of it (a particle).  </p>
<p>So the boson itself was pretty meaningless (after all, it was at a pretty stupid high energy). But it confirmed the existance of the Higgs field and thus provided a &quot;sanity check&quot; for 50 years of un-verified assumption.</p>
<p>Which for particle physicists was something of a bittersweet sigh of relief.  Bitter because it's written into the very mathematical fabric of the Standard Model that it must fail at SOME energy, and having the Higgs boson discovery falling nicely WITHIN the Standard Model means that they haven't seemingly learned anything new about that high energy limit. Sweet because, well, they've been out on an un-verified limb for a while and verification is nice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It also wasn't the &quot;god&quot; particle, it was the &quot;god damn&quot; particle. Physicists were having such a difficult time proving it existed, it was that god damn particle but when people started getting excited about it, it obviously couldn't be printed/discussed with that moniker so it was shortened to the god particle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The greatest significance of finding the Higgs, is that now we can stop looking for it.  Although most physicists were certain that it existed, there was always an outside chance that maybe it <em>didn't</em> exist.  That would have upended the cart, and the longer it took to find, the more nervous people got that maybe the reason we couldn't find it is because it wasn't there.  </p>
<p>This would not have been the first time something like this happened.  Michelson and Morley went looking for the aether (or rather, the speed of Earth moving through it).  Their failure to find it eventually led to Einstein's Relativity Theories that along with QM completely changed how we view the universe.  </p>
<p>So the significance is that we are not facing a revolution in science because the Higgs was missing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly (and I see this version hinted at in other comments) it was called the &quot;God&quot; particle because a scientist wrote a book (not a publication) about it called &quot;The <del>god damn</del> goddamn particle&quot; on the account of how hard it was to 'find it'. However the, American, publisher didn't want to risk offending religious people and asked for the title to be changed. It was changed to &quot;The God particle&quot;. A title that caught attention and got used in mainstream media etc.</p>
<p>edit<br />
Minor title correction<br />
<a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=-v84Bp-LNNIC&amp;pg=PA22" target="_blank">Page 22 of &quot;The God Particle&quot;</a> where at the end the author explains their reasoning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is all so far over my head. I struggle with advanced mathematics, but those of you engaged in this conversation are at least making seem more interesting. I thank you all for that. It makes me want to research some of your topics and references to gain some better understanding. I'm just going to need some Advil because the vocabulary in this thread will make my brain hurt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
