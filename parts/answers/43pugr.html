		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the only telescope we have that can do this currently (in at least near infrared wavelengths) is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHARA_array" target="_blank">CHARA interferometer</a>. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_stars_with_resolved_images" target="_blank">this list</a> of stars with resolved images and note that they've pretty much all been done with CHARA, specifically with the <a href="https://www.lsa.umich.edu/mira/news/ci.johnmonnierstillpushingthelimitsofinterferometrymon26jan2015_ci.detail" target="_blank">Michigan InfraRed Combiner (MIRC)</a> instrument.</p>
<p>It's an interferometer, so the images aren't quite as easy to create or interpret. They can do some reconstructions though and tried to make them look like normal images. Here's <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/LJ904blcZog/hqdefault.jpg" target="_blank">Altair</a>. <a href="https://www.lsa.umich.edu/UMICH/astro/Home/News/images/MIRC-Montage.jpg" target="_blank">These</a> are some of the only other images we have to date, using that MIRC instrument.</p>
<p>Those are all infrared wavelengths though. <strong>To my knowledge, the only visible wavelength resolved images of another star were done with Hubble of <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9708/mira_hst_big.jpg" target="_blank">Mira</a></strong> and in UV of <a href="http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/9804/betelgeuse_hst_big.jpg" target="_blank">Betelgeuse</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Very_Large_Telescope#Interferometry_and_the_VLTI" target="_blank">Very Large Telescope Array's Interferometer</a> can achieve an angular resolution of 0.08 milliarcseconds. I think this is about the best of any current instrument, and while it's not really used for producing images in this configuration, it gives some idea of what's possible.</p>
<p>A star's brightness is roughly proportional to its apparent angular size (assuming equal temperature and black body these would be equivalent), so the brightest stars should also appear the largest. Vega, the old definition of magnitude 0, has a radius of 2.362-2.818 solar radii and is at a distance of 25.04 light years. This gives is an angular size of 2.881 milliarcseconds (thanks WolframAlpha: <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(diameter+of+vega+%2F+distance+to+vega)+convert+to+milliarcseconds" target="_blank">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=(diameter+of+vega+%2F+distance+to+vega)+convert+to+milliarcseconds</a>)</p>
<p>Dividing Vega's apparent size by the VLT's angular resolution gives us potentially 36 useful pixels across Vega. That said, I have not found any actual images of extrasolar stars showing any kind of detail.</p>
<p>Edit: Adding info from /u/ngc2307. A number of stars appear significantly larger than Vega, not surprisingly my error is in the equal temperature assumption. I knew it was wrong, but not <em>this</em> wrong. Probably the largest is R Doradus, a red giant with an apparent size of 68 milliarcseconds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_Doradus#/media/File:R_Doradus_ESO.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a screwy interferometric image of it</a>.</p>
<p>Altair has an apparent size of 3.2 milliarcseconds, about the same as Vega. <a href="http://en.es-static.us/upl/2009/06/altair_flattened_surface_details_Monnier-300x234.png" target="_blank">Here is a picture of it</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't have any telescopes capable of imaging stars as anything more than a few pixels.
