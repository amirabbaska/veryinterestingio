<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mod creators in support - We can earn money selling mods!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mod creators against - I don't want my mods being sold. Other people are uploading my mods and selling them. Other mods use my added work without permission. I will only earn 25p in the Â£1, between my whole Mod Team. (ex. Falskaar - has 12 people). My mod has content from other creators, if a creator leaves it breaks my mod.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Consumers - Mods were free and should be free.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sensible Consumers - Theres going to be some legal issues isnt there, also where the quality control?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simplified Consumer - I'm ok with DLC and this is just DLC right?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I don't get it, at all. So here's my perspective, maybe someone can fill in the blanks if I miss something.</p>
<p>So to me, this shouldn't even be an issue. What I noticed is not all mods are paid, in fact when I have a look now the majority aren't paid.</p>
<p>Couple that with what Gabe said in the Q&amp;A thread and you have the solution to the whole thing except people downvoted his response without really thinking about it.</p>
<p>He said he (his decision making) is data driven. In other words, why don't people just vote with their wallets? Don't buy the addons, just stick to the freebies. This thing feels like the whole early access system where people complain about it a lot without ever stopping to think all they have to do is NOT buy it as early access.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day if the data says people won't buy mods, then they will stop doing it. How hard is that?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So what happened is that Valve announced paid modding for Skyrim. There are plans to support more games in the future. Many people disagree with this, or certain aspects of it.</p>
<p>Edit: For the benefit of the non gamers who have no idea what mods are:</p>
<p>Modding is the idea of a third party taking a game, and modifying its files to make it different. That can be done by actually injecting new code, or just replacing art/sound assets, or changing configuration files. The result is usually new gameplay (new maps, enemies, weapons, quests, etc), or maybe changes to the user interface, stuff like that. Until now people on PC have shared their mods on various communities for free, with mostly no paywalls in place other than the optional donation button. Now Valve, who own Steam, which is the top game distribution platform on PC, are trying to monetize it by allowing modders to charge money for their mods through Steam. A large percentage of that money would then go to Valve and the original game owner.</p>
<p>I guess I'll post my list of cons. Maybe someone can reply with some pros as well, because both sides have valid arguments</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Valve is criticized to take a huge cut (75%). In reality most of this probably goes to the developer/publisher, but regardless, the modder only takes 25% in the case of Skyrim. <a href="http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/workshoppaymentinfofaq/" target="_blank">According to the workshop FAQ</a>, you also need to earn a minimum of $100 before they actually send you the money. Edit: It seems that 30% goes to Valve, and the dev/publisher gets to decide how much they take, in this case 45%. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/33tlt0/eli5_valvesteam_mod_controversy/cqocdrn" target="_blank">Link</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people feel that mods should be free, partly because they are used to mods being free. Partly because they feel like the whole idea of PC gaming is the appeal of free mods, which sets it apart from console gaming. This makes mods be closer to microtransactions/DLC. Partly also because they have already been using certain mods and to see them behind a paywall now doesn't make much sense.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people believe that, similarly to how Steam early access/greenlight are now breeding grounds for crappy games made with minimal effort to cynically make money (and of course iOS and Android app stores), there will now be an influx of people not really passionate about modding but just seeing it as an opportunity to make money. This might oversaturate the scene with horrible mods and make the good ones harder to find.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people believe that mods are inherently an unsuitable thing to monetize because certain mods don't work with each other, and mods might stop being usable after game patches. This might cause a situation where a customer buys a mod, and it doesn't work (or it stops working after a while when refunds are no longer possible)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people simply dislike the idea of giving Valve even more control over the PC gaming market than they already do. They also feel like Valve just doesn't deserve even a small cut of this money, given that they don't <em>really</em> have much to do with the process at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people don't feel like this will work because mods are easy to pirate</p>
</li>
<li>Some people feel like this doesn't support the idea of collaborative mods, because the money always ends up in one person's pocket. However mods can also be made in collaboration with multiple people.</li>
</ul>
<p>Edit: A lot of other good points in the responses, do check them out, I won't bother putting them all here.</p>
<p>Edit 2: As people have suggested, <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2015/04/24/valves-paid-skyrim-mods-are-a-legal-ethical-and-creative-disaster/" target="_blank">here's a Forbes article on the subject</a>. It lists a lot of stuff that I didn't.</p>
<p>Edit 3: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/33uplp/mods_and_steam/" target="_blank">Gabe Newell is having a discussion on /r/gaming</a> on the subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I've read, when Valve added the payment option for mods, these things happened:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Microtransaction Hell</strong>: The Skyrim workshop was flooded with people trying to sell minor items, like swords or armor. Compare that with more sofisticated mods, like Falksaar, which is entirely free and it's practically a expansion of Skyrim (something that totally deserves to be paid, in my opinion). It may also discourage people from making bigger mods if people purchase any crap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copyright Theft is rampant</strong>: Some scummy users are grabbing free mods from Nexus and uploading them with a pricetag. If that becomes a common occurrence, modders might be discouraged from making free mods for Nexus and other sites.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Money Sharing is unfair</strong>: A modder only gets 25% of the value the users pay for the mods. The excuse from Valve and Bethesda is that they're the ones providing exposure and hosting. It's bullshit, since the mods are what add value to the games and not the other way. Ask any artist to draw you an artwork and tell them you plan to pay with exposure to see if they won't punch you in the face.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Hijacking of Publishing Rights</strong>: Valve doesn't let the modders take down a mod once it's for sale, making hard to fix things as use of unauthorized assets. Notice that when all mods were free, there wasn't any problem with mods using other mods for assets. Now there's a licensing hell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mods are too volatile to be sold</strong>: Games change from time to time, breaking mods. If a mod you got for free breaks, it's not much of a big deal. If a mod you paid for breaks and the modder refuses to fix, the user who bought it just wasted his money.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>24 hours refund is too little time</strong>: Valve offers too little time to see if a mod works before it stops you from getting a refund in case it's a piece of shit. And the money doesn't even come back to you: it goes to your Steam Wallet, so you can only spend it on Steam.</li>
</ul>
<p>So having paid mods is causing quite a lot of trouble. It's becoming bad for modders, that can't control assets when uploaded and are having their works stolen by other users, bad for users, that don't have any guarantees that their purchases will work later and have to scavenge good mods in a sea of microtransactions, and bad for the games, as the workshop was a good place to distribute them but now the best modders are going to avoid the place, or worse, convincing modders into not making the mods for fear of having them stolen. </p>
<p>It's a mess. Maybe there is a way to monetize these mods, but it's not the way Valve decided to do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Valve decided to do something that, at first glance, makes sense:  They wanted to create a way for mod authors, if they wanted to, to have a place they could sell their content easily and get some kickbacks for the time and effort they've invested into the community.</p>
<p>Valve has a history of trying to do this.  Gabe has often talked about wanting to get the users to be the ones that create and sell the content, instead of it being just the game developers.  They see this as supporting the community and encouraging it to grow.  And, on the face of it, they're not wrong and (at least I think) their intentions were good.</p>
<p>However, they went about implementing it all wrong. They neglected to communicate and get input from the community first and they failed to understand what it was about the modding community that made it popular.</p>
<p>Once you add a way to profit, you change the energy and dynamic of that community.   It goes from being supporting and sharing to competitive and exploitative.   You take a group of people who do what they do for fun and add in a whole bunch of people who do what they do for profit. And some of those people will do it at the expense of other people and the community.</p>
<p>Also, communities become inundated with people who are being deceptive for sales: Puppet accounts doing guerrilla marketing, people posting to modding subreddit about a 'great new mod' that are all just marketing hype by shills.  Now those posts have to <em>all</em> be deleted or, at the least, mistrusted which means that honest developers get lost in the spam.</p>
<p>When you start adding profit incentives into these types of communities it fundamentally changes them for the worse.   </p>
<p>So people are upset.  Not because they have to pay for mods; most people would be happy to support developers.  They're upset because monetizing the modding community is the death-knell for the way that community is.  It becomes a community you can't inherently <em>trust</em> because a percentage of the people are there just to make a buck.</p>
<p>And we all loved the modding community the way it was. The way we created it. And we don't want to see it ruined.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
