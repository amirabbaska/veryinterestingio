<p><em>Yet in satellite data prior to 2011, the region is largely free of seaweed, says Chuanmin Hu, an oceanographer at the University of South Florida in St. Petersburg and the senior author of a 2016 study that examined satellite data from 2000 to 2015. That sharpens the mystery of the sudden proliferation. “Nobody has a definite answer,” Hu says</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/nikkistl is mostly accurate, the sargassum sp. increase on our beaches is largely unknown. However the sargasso sea in the north Atlantic gyre is a naturally occurring region of free floating sargassum that is a refuge for many juvenile organisms including sea turtles (post-hatchlings will hide in the sargassum and spend the first 2-3 years of their life while they grow). The gyre shape shifts throughout the year due to temperature which can increase primary productivity in the spring effectively increasing the amount of sargassum naturally in the sea during the summer. This is coupled with runoff from the land via the gulf stream being brought to the gyre also increasing productivity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m in Caye Caulker, Belize right now. The amount of Sargassum in astonishing. You can’t get in the ocean on the east side of the island because the first 10-20 feet of water isn’t even water, it’s a wall of Sargassum. You can only swim where there’s docks that extend out passed the Sargassum, or on the west side of the island. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It didn't really bother us, but it definitely kept people out of the waves and off the beach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to further add to the points made by the other comments.</p>
<p>This might not be the most reputable response, as I saw this piece of information a long time ago. Basically higher temperature and CO2 emissions have drastically altered marine life in the last few decades, creating unprecedented growth in species like seaweed and jellyfish. </p>
<p>The rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere creates a stark concentration gradient between the atmosphere and the ocean, creating a new equilibrium with higher concentrations of CO2 in the water: I believe this increases the acidity of oceans too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
