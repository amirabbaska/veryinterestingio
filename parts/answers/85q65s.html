		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of the explanation for this would fall into how scientists (neuroscientists/neurologists in this case) don't quite know yet. It has to do with encoding memories.
There are theories and some evidence to say that we are actually capable of recalling or bringing back any memory from any time in our lives, although most of us struggle to remember what we had for breakfast last Tuesday.
Over our lifetime, or brains can't just be constantly replaying information, or else they wouldn't also be storing new information. Not that those are mutually exclusive. However, if you're off daydreaming about that time you were on a beach with pina coladas, you're not going to be as readily recalling what you're currently looking at. Then again, here too, that doesn't mean that you couldn't. In fact, you could be prompted somehow to recall this sort of visual echoic memory, even if you are daydreaming away.</p>
<p>More to the point, our brains are somehow soaking up lots of stimuli in our neurons, re-wiring, and making connections with different synapses and neurotransmitters. When they make an assocation in a certain way, it plays to us as a memory. Larger connections will play as imagines and what we think of as &quot;memories.&quot; Meanwhile, other connections - actually in specific parts of the brain studied for language comprehension - will play to us as words. Then other areas as music, smell and so on. We're able to build up a seemingly limitless capacity to make these connections. I hope that answers your first point about why we're able to store so much.</p>
<p>As for why it's tough to recall all of the words, we don't have complete control over putting the connections together. The connections can be put together, and over time you would of course recall all the words and be able to list them. But perhaps not without stimulation to make those connections come together. If you're sitting at your desk writing this list, each time you look around the room you'll think of more words. Open the door and there's 1000 more. You have more connections you can make.</p>
<p>If you're into computers, a good comparison is RAM and Disk Space. Your RAM is much smaller, and it'll integrate whatever you're actually using and working with (your connections at hand). Whereas the Disk Space has all of the things you've stored over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are names for this.</p>
<p><strong>Recognition vocabulary</strong> is the set of words that a person understands passively but may not be able to generate; the average person has a recognition vocabulary of about 5000 words, whereas Shakespeare is believed to have had about 30,000 words</p>
<p><strong>Active vocabulary</strong> is the (typically smaller) set of words they can generate on demand; I didn't look hard enough to find the numbers</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain is a search engine and needs keywords or associated memories to make recalling something easier.</p>
<p>It's the same with how you can associate a song with a certain memory from when you first heard it, or a certain flavor of gum with the material you studied while chewing it. That info may be hard or even impossible to recall on its own, but with the gum or song to act as keywords, it's way easier.</p>
