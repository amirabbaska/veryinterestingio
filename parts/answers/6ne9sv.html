		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mosquitoes release a protein that helps keep your blood from clotting. This protein causes swelling and itching. The more protein the more significant the reaction, so the longer the mosquito is attached, or the larger it is, may indirectly factor into the bite's total size. As far as how long it lasts, the more protein/bigger it is, the longer it will last. Factors such as temperature and pH could also influence how long the protein remains active in the area as well though. For example the protein denatures at warm temperatures, which is why a hot spoon placed on the site can relieve itching. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
