		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the important thing in space communications is not the size or power of the transmitter, but the sensitivity of the receiver. Once you have compensated for local issues like atmosphere, other radio sources, the rotation and revolution of the Earth, etc, then the only thing that affects the transmission is distance, and we have lots of distributed, really sensitive receivers to pick up weak signals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's actually higher quality then what you're used to seeing.  The Neil Armstrong first walk is actually a TV recording, pointed at a monitor, because they didn't have a slow scan TV adapter.  The camera feed from that was recorded, but the tape of the video coming from the lander has been lost.  Only the people in Australia saw it at full-quality, ever thing else is a copy.  Australia boosted the signal and sent it to the US.  People at NASA saw the boosted signal, and that was also recorded to make the public TV feed.  See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_missing_tapes" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_missing_tapes</a>  for details.  You can see a good photo of what the screen looked like showing the live image, and how high quality the images were.</p>
<p>If you're intrested in how they got the radio signal, it was picked up at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_Observatory" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkes_Observatory</a>.  That little brick building that the dish is resting on... is a 3 story building.  That telescope is huge.  Watch  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dish" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dish</a>  If you're interested in a dramatized version of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ul>
<li>there is very little interference in space...if light reflected from the sun can get to the earth, so can radio signals</li>
<li>being the government, they weren't restricted by licensing or the FCC, they could use the best frequency for the job</li>
<li>the orbiter boosted, focused, and directed the signal</li>
<li>giant radio antennas, not rabbit ears, were used to receive the signal</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>goo.gl/LgRY65 wasn't really a clear broadcast.</p>
<p>NASA including an erectable antenna on the Lunar Module, but that wasn't the only interesting part of the mission in regards to its live broadcast. </p>
<p>You should realize here that a lot of the technology was already in place aboard the LM in order to broadcast information back home. The mission crew at NASA needed to be able to communicate with the crew aboard the LM, they also needed telemetry, voice, and various computer diagnostics to be streamed back to Earth in order to monitor the mission. They used both UHF and VHF streams  while they tracked over a C-band beacon on the LM.</p>
<p>NASA also developed something called USB (Unified S-band) streaming which combined tracking, telemetry, ranging, command, voice, and television data into a single antenna. </p>
<p>You can read all about it on Pop Sci at <a href="http://www.popsci.com/how-nasa-broadcast-neil-armstrong-live-from-moon#page-3" target="_blank">http://www.popsci.com/how-nasa-broadcast-neil-armstrong-live-from-moon#page-3</a>, for all the specs and extra info. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
