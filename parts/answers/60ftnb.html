<p>LPT: never answer those security questions accurately.  Mother's maiden name?  Please!  Who can't find that info?</p>
<p>I always make up answers to those questions so no one else could find the info or guess the answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When I come across those, I always make the answer the last word of the question. My password is unique and secure enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because people are idiots.</p>
<p>People selecting security questions like &quot;write 'abc123'&quot; or &quot;what's my name&quot; or such would mean multiple people could have their accounts broken into, and undoing damage caused by their stupidity would by all likelihood be paid by the company, not the idiot user.</p>
<p>So you remove ways for users to be idiots and thus improve security.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To piggy back off your question. I just would like them to include non open ended questions that can vary. &quot;What was your favorite movie as a child?&quot; A year or two from now I'm not going to remember  what age I took as being a child, or what answer I put because who knows what movie I remembered then, compared to what movies I remember I watched now. I would prefer hard point questions. &quot;Your first car.&quot; or &quot;The house number to your longest stayed at childhood home.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
