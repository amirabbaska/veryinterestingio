<p>The absorbed light is turned into heat, so the objects in the room are heated up very slightly by a light source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ask yourself why a room doesn't just grown infinitely bright over time after you turn the light on?</p>
<p>Light is absorbed by everything in the room at some rate. It's also reflected at some rate as well. When you turn on the light there is an initial period  of increasing brightness as the reflected light builds up, but then it reaches a state of equilibrium (much too fast to be perceptible, except in regard to the ramp up of the brightness of the light source itself). The light will have a characteristic number of average &quot;bounces&quot; in its lifetime before it is absorbed. Let's say you have a very &quot;bright&quot; room with 90% reflectivity (roughly mirror-bright). That means 10% of light is absorbed. After 131 bounces a given photon will have only a one in a million chance of having avoided being absorbed in such an environment.</p>
<p>If you have, say, a 10m wide room, that's roughly 1310m of total distance traveled. Which a photon will travel in only 4.4 microseconds. So when you turn the lights off in a 10m wide mirror room the light will be one millionth as bright within 4 microseconds of the light going out. And 4 microseconds after that it will be one million times dimmer still, after only 12 microseconds the light will be a quintillion times dimmer than the start. In a very short amount of time even the vast number of photons produced by a light source will be completely absorbed on an instantaneous timescale for a human. A 100% efficient 100 Watt source of 2 eV red photons would produce 3e20 photons per second, which would be reduced to fewer than 1 photon in our hypothetical room in only 15 microseconds.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I corrected some math mistakes! Sorry, I was tired last night.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an extra credit assignment, my physics professor in high school once stated the popular joke that we have light backwards. Lights don't emit photons, they suck in dark - at the speed of dark. When you turn them 'off', they stop sucking in the dark, allowing light to exist. Then he challenged us to work through all of the standard equations with that theory.</p>
<p>... those of us that got all the signs placed correctly found that there really was no difference in how the math worked out (at a pre-relativity and pre-quantum level).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

He has an awesome Ted talk about a camera that takes a trillion frames a second. It actually shows how light fills up a contained space and how it dissipates. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all of the light emitted by light sources (like a lamp) is reflected by objects (like a couch), only some. </p>
<p>Dark colours are dark because they do not reflect much light whereas light colours do.</p>
<p>So as the light bounces around the room, it is absorbed into the objects of the room. Even perfect mirrors absorb a small portion of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
