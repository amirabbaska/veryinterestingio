		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, they do get STIs. In fact a lot of koala bears have chlamydia. Primates can get a disease similar to HIV in humans called SIV. It's probable that syphilis came from sheep or cattle. dolphins get genital warts, and rabbits can get syphilis. Dogs and cats both have their own strains of herpes virus. And the Tasmanian Devil has a weird STI that cause a very aggressive and strange form of face cancer, tumor thing. It prevents them from hunting and feeding.</p>
<p>But wait! There's more! The fun is not just limited to our furred friends! Birds can get chlamydia and also give it to humans and cats through bites and scratches after they are infected. Reptiles also can get STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhea. Also insects have their own weird STIs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vet pathologist here.  There is a transmissible tumor that dogs get through mating:  transmissible venereal tumor (TVT) as it’s called.  The tumor may also be transmitted to the nasal cavity from direct contact with affected mucosa.  Here’s a link for more info:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes they can.  In fact for a while there were big chlamydia problems in koala communities throughout Australia that were threatening the species.  In 2017 a vaccine was developed for them.  It is a different strain of chlamydia, but they think they can make a vaccine for humans too using similar techniques. </p>
<p>Not just mammals either.  Birds, reptiles, and insects can all get forms of VD. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Feline Aids wiped out a bunch of strays that lived around my house several years ago. Sad because one of them followed me everywhere I'd go around the neighborhood.  I was lucky though as our actual pet cat used to go out around the house and pick fights with any animals that got in the yard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As several other folks have mentioned, yes many other species get STIs. What makes humans special is that many humans have sex a lot more than other species (i.e. we mate for more than just reproduction). While this happens in other species (bonobos, many other primates, cetaceans), there is still a magnitude of difference so the likelihood and associated risks with STIs are often greater. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
