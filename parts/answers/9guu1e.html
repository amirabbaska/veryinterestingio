		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends. You can die in multiple ways from solvent abuse.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s lack of oxygen, frostbite, and cardiac arrest or failure. Most commonly is aspiration of vomit while they are unconscious and lack of oxygen.</p>
<p>It really depends on what one is inhaling, what methods they are using (using a bag is much more dangerous than just sniffing because you are limiting the flow of oxygen) and the condition they are in.</p>
<p>There are safer ways to get high than sniffing gasoline.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fastest way it can kill you is (for complicated reasons) it can cause your heart's electrical circuit to spazz out.   If that happens, your heart can't beat and you drop dead in a few seconds.   That doesn't happen to everyone, obviously, but there's really no way to know ahead of time if you're going to do this.   And doing it more often makes it more likely. </p>
<p>The second fastest way it can kill you is if it keeps you from getting good air.   You might just stop breathing,  or you might get so messed up you can't get to fresh air, or you might throw up and choke on your vomit. </p>
<p>What would stuck about this is that a lot of people get found before they are fully dead, and end up brain damaged, crippled, and hooked to machines for the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>But that's just a preview,  because long term use of these chemicals turns your brain into Swiss cheese anyway.  Users become less intelligent,  have problems remembering things, controlling their emotions, and with such basic coordination as walking.   Eventually that will kill you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
