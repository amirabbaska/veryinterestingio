		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Considering the need for human interaction (caregiver - patient) in medicine, what are your thoughts going forward?  Restrict these AI to assist medical professionals in the diagnostic process (read: allow them more patient contact time - a major hurdle most medical tech development is focused on currently) or replace much of the function of a human in healthcare?</p>
<p>If the latter, do you think that’s a viable goal, again considering the imperative for human contact in the healthcare sector?  Medicine is still in dire need of functional technology assistance (particularly in diagnoses), but how far do you feel we can take it before there is significant diminishing returns/potential backlash? Say, 20 years down the road, the requirements for an M.D are reduced to fill the existing void, because some major part of their training has now been replaced by AI.  So we get more medical professional, but they’re less trained, potentially less capable/more reliant on AI.</p>
<p>Also congratulations to you and your team, this FDA approval is no small matter!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you have any thoughts on how to make these diagnostic systems available to places that could really use them (e.g. low income countries which lack qualified diagnosticians)?  This is a problem we see in neuroimaging, where there are some very capable AI based image analysis tools, however, often the only places which can afford them are places which already have excellent clinicians.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
