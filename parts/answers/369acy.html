		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Born in China, but migrated young, so I try to empathize with both sides.</p>
<p>The Chinese are a very competitive bunch. But the bigger idea is that many are still struggling to make ends meet. With so many people competing for the same few things, we tend to care more about our own success and have less regard for a society as a whole. I wouldn't take care of others if I can't take care of myself, right?</p>
<p>Furthermore, (just my personal opinion though) perhaps education plays a part. The education system might focus less on a societal perspective. Sciences are championed over the arts there, and technical knowledge doesn't make students more conscious of society. The rural population might not even have gone through much education to begin with.</p>
<p>This is why people tend to be less considerate than those of other societies, even similar ones like Hong Kong. When people become more affluent, they naturally become more considerate of their environment and the people around them.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean China isn't making progress. People are becoming richer. I increasingly observe people giving up seats to those more needy aboard buses, and also becoming more aware of climate change. Inconsiderate individuals have become a minority. Yet it takes time for the mindset to catch up to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Furthermore, sparing less thought for society does not mean they are selfish. My Chinese relatives are the warmest and most hospitable people I've met. They might not have a good public image, but they make good friends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On one of my politics course, we had a segment on China and the same question popped up.</p>
<p>One of the readings goes like this: China's intellectuals had been destroyed during the Cultural Revolutuon of Mao. In order for communism to succeed in China, Mao had to prevent the rise of intellectuals (students, professors etc) as it was seen as the base of middle class. The middle class is the base of democracy which would destroy the government's ideology.</p>
<p>So in order to do that, Mao changed the whole educational curriculum of the system and initiated some economic plan to prevent the people from having money. Mao also had complete control and support of the military because of the recent civil war against the KMT and used that to subjugate revolts from all across China.</p>
<p>So by destroying the intellectuals which is one of the characterisitc of the middle class, Mao prevented democracy and a superb amount of uneducated individuals. That is what you see on tourists who don't know how to act etiquettely on foreign lands because of their lack education.</p>
<p>PS: I no longer remember what example the authors gave but that's the gist of their arguement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you have to remember (or let me tell you) is that less than 100 years ago, China still operated under feudalism with a dynastic emperor, and while some of the country has caught up to modern social graces i.e. Shanghai and Beijing other places have not.</p>
<p>Similarly, alot of the problems stem from alot of people being nouvea riche in the extreme (as well as getting too rich too fast after being poor/a peasant for too long)and literally having more money than they can handle leading to often ostentatious displays of wealth </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things people here are missing:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Chinese people who can afford to travel abroad are disproportionately wealthy. That means a lot of them are spoiled rotten, and used to the world revolving around them. This is changing as China's middle class grows, but you still have to remember that the people you abroad aren't average Chinese, they're Chinese with the money and free time to travel internationally. Especially in the US, that means they also had the time/money to go through the visa process.</p>
</li>
<li>Chinese tend to travel in massive groups, which means if one guy is doing something obnoxious, it's easy for people to look and say wow, Chinese tourists, when actually most of them are being respectful. All it takes is one or two dicks making a scene to make the whole group look bad. Now I'm not saying the reputation they have is wholly undeserved, and some things (like not queuing) are more universal. But when there's an obvious group and a few bad eggs it's easy for people to draw conclusions and perceive it as the entire group misbehaving rather than a few individuals. This happens less with tourists from other countries because they don't travel in massive groups like the Chinese do.</li>
