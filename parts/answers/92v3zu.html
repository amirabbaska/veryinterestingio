<p>Additionally, there's a just a natural limit to how big an animal can get, due to nourishment factors. Bigger lions would require more food for more energy and the ecology wouldn't be able to support that after a while. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most species reach a point where if they got any bigger it would actually be a bad thing - they wouldn’t be able to eat enough food to metabolize and stay alive as long as possible, so it’s actually possible to become too big in terms of evolution standards. Animals evolve to the sweet spot size and then stay there as long as their environment allows - sometimes they (in general) get smaller when smaller is better, and sometimes they get bigger when there’s more resources and bigger prey.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs, insects, and mammals all used to be much bigger when our world was different pre-ice age (and even way further back) when there was more oxygen in the air and more prey readily available to them. Since evolution now favors smaller animals, we see modern species are much smaller than ancient species. (Sometimes. Usually. It all depends on the species and their environment.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

</blockquote>
<p>This is not necessarily true. There are many factors that affect the likelyhood of an animal breeding. But to ELI5:</p>
<p>The bigger a lion gets the more food it needs to survive, so eventually lions hit a point where if they got any bigger they would starve before passing genes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they used to for a long time. The cave lion, gigantopithacus, short nose bear, the ground sloth, and terror birds all got huge. As well as insects for a time. Basically increasing competition and changing temperatures will either head off the growth of large species or as the ones above are concerned, completely destroy the species because it has “over fit” its adaptation to the past. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
