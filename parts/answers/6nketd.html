		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without going into the neurochemical side of things (because others have somewhat covered it here, and it's exceptionally dirty when it comes to alcohol - multiple neurotransmitter systems are involved and even the metabolites of alcohol probably have their own effects)... there are significant expectancy effects associated with alcohol. That is, you expect to feel certain things, and therefore you do. The best example of this is when you start drinking you feel far more intoxicated at say 0.075 BAC than at the same level after you have stopped drinking. </p>
<p>To directly answer your question, it'd be a combination of the euphoria produced by dopamine and endorphins reinforcing the behaviour of drinking, and the idea that more is going to be good. Then there's the positive social effects, relaxation of inhibition, conditioned cue responses, and lots more things telling you that it's a positive experience. This is all happening under your consciousness, so unless you kick in that prefrontal cortex and decide that anothery is a bad idea, off you go. </p>
<p>The other thing is that alcohol is generally consumed over time more slowly than many other drugs. Also unlike other drugs, most of us can describe what overdosing feels like, which I'm guessing is the basis for your question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>alcohol is a small molecule that interacts easily with many neurotransmitters compared to other drugs such as THC and cocaine.  Drinking alcohol affects the gamma-Aminobutyric acid in your body producing an effect similar to valium which induces a feeling of relaxation and drowsiness. It also messes with your endorphins which gives you the &quot;I feel no pain&quot; mentality. All drugs which you can become addicted to affect the dopamine levels in your body which gives you a euphoric feeling as well as releasing Norepinephrine into your body which acts as a stimulant as well as depressant. Your adrenal glands also release adrenaline when you drink which contributes to the stimulant effect. Basically it feels good so you want more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol is generally a depressant for your brain (&quot;a break signal&quot; for neurons).
At first it inhibits the activity of prefrontal cortex, which is where our rational thoughts and inhibitions work (as mentioned by others the alcohol does it via GABA receptors). That's why you behave recklessly when you are moderately drunk.</p>
<p>If you drink further other brain parts (older in evolutional sense and thus more stable) start to shut down and you are asleep. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a question comment is against the rules let me know and I'll delete..</p>
<p>I have a follow-up question: I don't feel the need to keep drinking more. Brown-out and black-out Alex are not really interested in drinking a ton more and just seem to want to maintain or taper off. However, I know people who when their brown out self makes an appearance they want to binge drink whatever they see and always get to the point where they need help walking. What causes this difference? It must be something subconscious or innately programmed into our brains because at brown/black-out we don't have much logic remaining.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a quick and dirty, with inaccuracies for simplicity... but this can give you a broad-stroke overview.</p>
<p>Alcohol tends to cause your thinking to &quot;get in a rut&quot;.  So if you are thinking about drinking (like, when you are drinking), alcohol tends to keep you in that rut.</p>
<p>That's why drinking and driving is so dangerous. You focus on something, like your speedometer, and forget to switch to checking the intersection for red lights or stop signs.</p>
<p>Getting a bit deeper:</p>
<p>The specific mechanism is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor_agonist#Indirect_GABA_Agonists" target="_blank">GABA receptor agonism</a>, or more colloquially, alcohol substitutes for GABA and stimulates the GABA receptors. A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GABA_receptor" target="_blank">GABA receptor</a> reduces neurotransmitter propagation.</p>
<p>How this plays out is that the main path, channel, or &quot;train of thought&quot; that you are on works just fine, but that path is less likely to spawn associated thoughts than normal.</p>
<p>So when you are normally driving, when you approach a stoplight, you glance at a light, associated speed and possibilty that you'll have to stop, check your speed, bounce back to the light, and maybe check cross traffic... just normal driving stuff.</p>
<p>But when those GABA sites are overstimulated by alcohol, your brain doesn't &quot;change tracks&quot; as easily.  You see the light, and focus on it, forgetting to check your speed or cross traffic. Alternatively, you <em>do</em> check your speed, but forget to switch back to the light.</p>
<p>So... alcohol helps you focus on what you are doing, which, right now, is drinking. </p>
