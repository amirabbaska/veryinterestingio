		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question! Scientists in the 19th century really wanted an answer. They saw two possibilities:</p>
<p>1) Light is a particle, so its speed is relative to whatever emitted it. Trouble with that is that is implies that, perhaps with clever use of vibrating mirrors, you ought to be able to slow light down and eventually fill a bucket with it. Since nothing hinted at any sort of &quot;slow light&quot; this was a hard sell.</p>
<p>2) Light is a wave. In that case, it would always move at the same speed with respect to whatever medium was transmitting it. To make this work, they imagined the universe was full of a substance called &quot;ether&quot;. Lots of work went into clever experiments to try to measure the speed of ether.</p>
<p>To see this particle/wave difference more clearly, imagine that you shoot a bullet at a target. Let's say the bullet moves at 600 mph. The sound wave from the bullet moves at 770 mph. Now I drive up in a car at 100 mph and do the same thing. The bullet now goes at 700 mph (because it adds the speed of the car) but the sound wave still goes at 770 mph (because the air isn't moving). That's relative to the ground. Relative to the <em>car</em> the bullet still moves at 600 mph but the sound wave only goes at 670 mph.</p>
<p>The question was: what would light do?</p>
<p>The answer was that both the guy on the ground <em>and</em> the guy in the car measured it as moving at exactly the same speed. <em>Not</em> what anyone expected.</p>
<p>Einstein figured out that the reason for this is that space and time twist themselves into a pretzel to make this work out. He came up with a beautiful system that preserved all the laws of physics, that did not require any special reference frame (i.e. no ether), and which guaranteed that the speed of light in a vacuum, when measured in any frame, was always the same.</p>
<p>But the result was length and time contraction. Those were easy to test by experiment, and have been observed over and over.</p>
<p>As others have said here, when two objects approach each other, their velocities don't really add in a simple way. At velocities <em>u</em> and <em>v</em> you get (<em>u</em> + <em>v</em>)/(1 + <em>uv</em>) (using velocities that are light-speed fractions). So in your example, we get (0.6 + 0.6)/(0.6^2) = 0.882. So each observes the other to be moving at 88.2% of the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>This is actually the big trick with relativity - the speed of light is the speed of light relative to <em>any</em> observer. This only works if you change the equations of time and space from the classical forms into the new relativistic forms.</p>
<p>You also need to change the equation for how you add and compare velocities - it's more complex than just adding the two numbers, and you can see the equation <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity-addition_formula#Special_relativity" target="_blank">here</a> if you're interested. It turns out that if two cars are moving towards each other at 100 km/h, their relative speed is actually <em>slightly less</em> than 200 km/s relative to each other. This effect is small at low velocities, but becomes extremely important at large velocities. If you go through the maths, you find that if two objects move towards each other at 60% of the speed of light, each one observes the other moving towards them at 88% of the speed of light - not 120%. This is again just a result of the new equations for velocity and time and space that you need to use in relativity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no such thing as an absolute reference point.  There is no such thing as &quot;this thing is absolutely still, so we can measure TRUE SPEED relative to this&quot;.  All motion is relative to other motion.  </p>
<p>Imagine two spaceships, ShipA and ShipB, in deep space, traveling towards each other.  You're on ShipZ, and you note that both of them are moving at each other at 60% of the speed of light.  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>From your perspective on ShipZ, you are still, and both ShipA and ShipB are traveling towards each other at 0.6c (60% of the speed of light). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>From the perspective of ShipA, ShipA will think they are &quot;still&quot;, you (ShipZ) are coming at them at 0.6c, and ShipB is coming at it at 0.88c.</p>
</li>
<li>From the perspective of ShipB, ShipB is &quot;still&quot;, you (ShipZ) are coming at it at 0.6c, and ShipA is coming at it at 0.88c.</li>
</ol>
<p>Nobody's perspective is more correct than any other.  An exception to this is spinning.  It does seem that &quot;not spinning&quot; is an absolute measurement since any spin produces a centripetal force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow-up since this has been bugging me: If we imagine a spaceship traveling at very high speed between two star systems, generally the way this is portrayed with regard to time is that the people on the ship have, say, a month pass, while many years pass on the planets surrounding the stars. But if everything is relative, what is there to say that the spaceship is the one that's traveling fast? Why couldn't we treat the spaceship as stationary and have years pass for the people in the spaceship while only weeks pass for the planet-dwellers? In essence, what causes this asymmetrical time dilation?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I teach this stuff to high school students.
The correct answer, as many others have said so, is, any reference point. The important question is why? It betrays common sense in the sense that if I am moving and trees are not moving, then, I will see them going backwards. How do we convince ourselves that this does indeed happen? The following is a user-friendly approximate model for understanding this. </p>
<p>So, there are three parties to this question. </p>
<ol>
<li>Relative motion - The tree seems to be moving backwards thing. </li>
<li>Inertial frames - Newton's laws are valid in all inertial frames. Inertial frames are those which are unaccelerated. </li>
<li>Maxwell's equations - The four equations linking magnetism and electricity.</li>
</ol>
<p>Light is an electromagnetic wave. It is basically two waves producing each other - the electric field at a point gives birth to the magnetic field at the next point and the magnetic field gives birth to the electric field at the next point. This whole supporting each other part comes very neatly from Maxwell's equations and Newton's laws. </p>
<p>When one tries to apply Maxwell's equations on EM Waves, one gets two results -
[math]E_0 = c B_0[\math]
[math]c = \sqrt{1/\mu_0 \epsilon_0}[/math]
(c is the speed of light)</p>
<p>It all works sensibly, and if you know high school level calculus, you can understand it pretty well online. Now, here is the heart of problem - pay attention - this derivation can be repeated in any inertial frame. The derivation says, the speed of light is equal to c in any inertial frame which directly contradicts relative motion. Thus, we have ended up with an inconsistency. Either, our notions of relative motion are wrong, or our understanding of NLM is wrong or we are missing something with Maxwell's equations. Obviously, for a layman, the most intuitive of these is relative motion and we would have been tempted to see if we have been wrong about NLM or Maxwell's equations. </p>
<p>Here comes this Einstein guy. He imagines a world where speed of light is constant in any frame and tries to understand it. This assumption is equivalent to saying, &quot;Hmmm, okay, let me assume our understanding of relative motion was wrong&quot;. So, he starts with this assumption and starts building his world consistently, much like a very good fantasy writer would do, if he is very serious about following the rules of his world. His world comes up with weird results like time dilation and length contraction and plenty of weird stuff. </p>
<p>Based on this world, we can figure out a model of relative motion called Lorentz transforms, which reduces to the common sense model of relative motion is velocities at much lesser than speed of light. So, Einstein's world acts like our own at low speeds without any fuss. </p>
<p>For years, this was just theory, most plausible but still without any proof. People tried to do experiment to measure the speed of light with a lot of elaborate apparatus and they did figure out that this assumption is correct. The most convincing argument for me is that Einstein's theory suggests a correction in GPS satellites. It is a very small error, results in milli-seconds correction over an year, but it causes the GPS predictions to go hay-wire. However, if we assume the Einstein's world, the GPS predictions are perfect - bang on target. So, we are inclined to believe that Einstein's world is the real world and not a fantasy. </p>
<p>So, in Einstein's world (which we believe to be the most correct approximation of real world), two objects moving at 0.6c towards each other don't see the other at 1.2c. Rather, it would be something like 0.9c. (How do we know this? - Relative motion is now governed by Lorentz transforms which is a property of Einstein's world)</p>
<p>Is that the truth? Honestly, I don't know but I would bet so. We can't do an experiment to verify this exact scenario, but as I said, Einstein's stuff predicts quite correctly in the experiments which we were able to do. The number of scenarios where this holds true is quite large and no other theory comes close to explaining all those experiments this elegantly. So, I hope, if we are able to do some experiment where we can verify this, we would indeed find our predictions to be accurate. In case, we don't, scientists will have a lot of work to do. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
