And the extraordinary cost. They are used as an interim measure for a person awaiting a heart transplant. There are several available that work reasonably well. As you suggest the optimal design appears to be an magnetically driven rotatory pump with minimal moving parts placed in the left side of the heart which provides a non-pulsatile flow to augment the failing heart (a ventricular assist device). More recently there has been developed Total Artificial Hearts such as <a href="http://bivacor.com" target="_blank">BiVacor</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, in 2011 Craig Lewis, 55 years old <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2096314/Meet-HEARTLESS-man-able-live-heartbeat-PULSE.html" target="_blank">recieved a continuous flow device instead of heart</a>.</p>
<p>He died a month later due to a decease, but the device was reported working properly. In fact, researches said they tested the flow device on dozens of cows before. </p>
<p>Later Jakub Halik  had lived 6 months with a flow device, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/02/jakub-halik-czech-man-lived-without-heart-artificial-heart-six-months_n_1932880.html" target="_blank">according to 2012 publication</a>. Sadly, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-19977958" target="_blank">he died too, of cancer</a>, which was the reason he could not recieve a donor heart in the first place. However, he even attented gym during this time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The science/engineering isn't there yet.</p>
<p>I'm a cardiac surgeon.  There are many types of ventricular assist devices.  They range from intracorporeal devices (implanted inside the body for destination therapy or bridge-to-transplant) and extracorporeal devices (the pump is outside the body...typically for short term use).  They also range from pulsatile (Thoratec PVAD, Syncardia total artificial heart using pneumatically driven pumps) or non-pulsatile.  Within the non-pulsatile group, the actual device moves blood forward through several mechanisms.  There are axial flow impeller systems (like a turbine...Thoratec/Abbott Heartmate II and Abiomed Impella).  There are centrifugal flow pumps (Heartmate III, Heartware, Centrimag, etc, etc).  To make things even more complicated, the newer continuous flow systems like Heartmate III or cardiopulmonary bypass circuits can do artificial pulsatility.</p>
<p>There are advantages and disadvantages to each system although the technology continues to improve.  The Achilles heels of VAD systems at this point are 1) that they all require an external power supply of some sort.  This is called a driveline in the intracorporeal VAD and keeps the patient tethered to a battery or plug. 2) they are huge pieces of foreign material and if they get infected it is potentially life-threatening. 3) long term they require anticoagulation which puts them at bleeding risk (hemorrhagic stroke, GI bleed) 4) conversely, they are prone to thrombosis due to the blood-device interface, which can lead to device failure and thromboembolic events. 5) they mess with your biology, which can cause weird things like AVMs (thought to be due to nonpulsatile flow and changes with Von Willebrand factor expression).  There is a lot of basic science and engineering behind these devices, so you could literally talk for years about these things...happy to answer any specific questions.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heck, why only two?  If I were designing the body, I'd stick a bunch of smaller ones along major blood vessels throughout the body.  Simpler, less prone to problems, and provides backup in case of failure or injury.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some other replies have focused on more mechanical issues, such as shear stress on RBCs causing lysis, and formation of clots (thrombi).</p>
<p>Another two issues:</p>
<p>Firstly, a mechanical replacement would not be able to respond to the body's signalling, including vagal innervation and hormone signalling (e.g. epinephrine). It could be designed to respond to blood inflow (venous return) and outward resistance (vasocontriction, either systemic or pulmonary), but this may be difficult to do (bioengineering is not my area, so I cannot comment further).</p>
<p>The other issue is that a continuous outflow may confuse the body's sensors for blood pressure and blood volume (i.e. the baroreceptors). I'm not entirely sure how they would respond to a non-pulsile blood flow - maybe a cardiologist or anesthesiologist could comment and clarify.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
