		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is the abstract from a great paper on this subject that i think will answer your question.</p>
<p>Questions concerning the common ancestors of all present-day humans have received considerable attention of late in both the scientific and lay communities. Princi- pally, this attention has focused on ‘Mitochondrial Eve,’ defined to be the woman who lies at the confluence of our maternal ancestry lines, and who is believed to have lived 100,000–200,000 years ago. More recent attention has been given to our common paternal ancestor, ‘Y Chromo- some Adam,’ who may have lived 35,000–89,000 years ago. However, if we consider not just our all-female and all-male lines, but our ancestors along all parental lines, it turns out that everyone on earth may share a common ancestor who is remarkably recent.
This study introduces a large-scale, detailed computer model of recent human history which suggests that the common ancestor of everyone alive today very likely lived between 2,000 and 5,000 years ago. Furthermore, the model indicates that nearly everyone living a few thou- sand years prior to that time is either the ancestor of no one or of all living humans.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of the answers I see so far seem to adequately address the question.  Obviously the answer would vary greatly between individuals depending on their ancestry.  But I think it should be viewed in terms of population genetics.  Human gene pools do vary and there are differences between African, New World, Asian and European gene pools that date back well before 10,000 years ago.  So, assuming most of the ancestors of most people came from a single one of these gene pools, then on average most people will be genetically more like those ancestors (i.e. part of the same partially isolated gene pool) than a random person on earth.  There probably has not been much actual change in gene pools do to evolution during that period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm seeing a lot of attempts to answer this question by asking whether the most recent common ancestor of all humans was more or less than 10,000 years ago. Estimates based on genetic data vary widely, but anthropological evidence suggests the first major migrations out of our species' African birthplace were between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago.</p>
<p>That's not even a very direct way to answer this, actually, but I'll try to explain the intuitive idea behind it. Who are you more related to, your grandfather or your first cousin? Well, think about all the &quot;hops&quot; your genome has been through. Half your grandfather's genome hopped into your mother (we'll assume it's your maternal grandfather), and then half of that hopped into you. Two hops. Your <em>kinship coefficient</em>, the degree of relatedness between you (technically the probability that you have both inherited the same genetic material from the same origin - in this case your grandfather himself would be the origin) is 1/4.  To get to your first cousin, you have to hop up twice to your grandparents, then hop down again twice to the cousin, so four hops. What's the kinship coefficient? Well, it's actually 1/8, not 1/16, because although there were four hops, there were two different paths (one through your grandfather and one through your grandmother, since you have them in common).</p>
<p>So basically, one way of asking how related you are to any random human in the population is to ask how many generations ago your most recent common ancestor was. This number will vary widely; if you're both German, it's probably much more recent than if one of you is Korean and the other is from a tribe of !Kung San in the Kalahari desert, in which case you might have to trace your common origins all the way back to the first African humans.</p>
<hr />
<p>That said, it should still be very possible to estimate the average genetic distance between any two living humans, given all the data we've accumulated now. It could be trickier to model the hypothetical gene pool of humanity from 10,000 years ago, and I don't remember enough coalescent theory to do it myself, but I hope some pop-gen expert comes along soon because a lot of the answers in this thread are just naive math that's obviously wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few caveats about our genes that you have to consider before taking on this question fully. Humans have greater genetic variance in general than the races have genetic variance from one another. Racial differences are actually a very small portion of our overall genetics. For instance, skin color is a combination of a handful of genes, where a more complex process like digestion has genes numbering in the hundreds. However, of course races do have differing probabilities of having certain genes. Dairy consumption is a good example- among humans that are not northern European, lifelong lactase production to digest dairy is rare at about 2-5% of the population, but among northern Europeans it is highly common being more like 70-80% of the population. Although the entire human race circulates the genes for dairy digestion, that it is so common in northern Europeans is a racial difference. As you can see, the racial difference is not a gene that no one else has, it is merely commonality of a gene the other races have rarely. Every racial difference is this way.</p>
<p>Also, large population groups maintain most of their genes, recirculating them, reducing evolutionary movement. Humans have had populations large enough to breed out almost all mutation for a very long time (if I remember correctly, the last time humans were nearly extinct was because of a volcano 80,000 years ago or so- it was at that time that the races &quot;split,&quot; before then there was a more gradual change in traits as you changed location, instead of a few major obviously differentiated groups). Adaptations like the lighter skin and dairy digestion of northern Europeans, where calcium deficiency drove the change by killing off the group members with darker skin and inability to digest dairy, take up to 20,000 years. Although changes in gene commonality occur through selective pressure, mutations are rarely passed on more than a couple generations. As well, if there is no selective pressure creating a change in gene commonality, the population will maintain the same ratios its ancestors had. So, although decreased melamine and increased lactase production were selected for in northern Europeans, most other genes are practically identical in variance to African's. With a few genes, known to be racial differences, you can predict race by genetics extremely precisely, however if you choose random genes you can't tell just about anything.</p>
<p>But, it's important to remember that just because half of your genes come from each parent, doesn't mean that some of their genes didn't match in the first place. As an obvious proof, racial differences are practically always passed on, because both parents share those genes, and thus there is realistically zero chance of the child not inheriting those traits. Your parent's preexisting genetic similarity means that you are slightly more than a half copy of each to the degree that they were slightly already copies of each-other (due to common ancestry). By this mechanism, a village of several thousand people with little immigration or emigration (as most of humankind has existed for most of the last 10,000 years) will simply pass around the genes it already had, changing in relation to each other very little no matter how much time passes (so long as environmental factors remain ineffective- go farming!?). </p>
<p>Now to answer the question: the population of a little village like that in Norway would look very similar genetically to itself over thousands of years. However, that's comparing a population to a population. It will keep the same ratios of genes circulating, but individuals within the population will have random incidences of those genes, which like I noted earlier are far more numerous than racial marker genes, variance shared rather evenly across all humanity. Still, though, like the parents passing on their shared ancestry, because each has some identical genes, the little village will have kept that ancestral gene sequence for thousands of years, as northern Europe has kept the gene sequences for pale skin and milk-drinking for thousands of years. If you were Norwegian, comparing yourself to a 10,000 year old ancestor and a man from modern Zimbabwe, the odds are the longest gene sequences you'd have in common with either would be those &quot;racial&quot; differences. The rest of your genes would be a random, more generically human, scramble.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
