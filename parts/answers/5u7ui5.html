		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While dBB works well with nonrelativistic mechanics, it is very challenging to make it compatible with special relativity (you break locality and need a preferred reference frame, for example), and it gets even worse if you want to combine it with quantum field theory, where things like particle numbers don't have to be well-defined any more. And you don't gain anything. &quot;Shut up and calculate&quot; is the easiest practical approach if you want to work with it. While the Copenhagen interpretation is not directly &quot;shut up and calculate&quot;, it is closer to that.</p>
<p>There is also the historic argument. Copenhagen came first and made it into the textbooks. If all interpretations would have started at the same time, and with today's knowledge about decoherence, I would expect Many-Worlds to be much more popular.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't worry about the ontology of QM... it's a mess, and there is no hard reason why one is better than the others. Ultimately that's the philosophy end of things, and won't help you with anything related to how QM <em>actually works</em>. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't worry about what is accepted first. I would suggest you really dig deep into the reasoning behind Bohmian mechanics, many worlds, collapse models, Qbism and whatnot, try to understand why things are done the way they are done in the different approaches and what all that means practically and philosophically. After that you could try to see why some of these ideas haven't worked (yet) in different settings and what that failure implies.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: I'm a Bohmian myself, working on foundations of physics. I have a personal opinion on those things but my advice is intended to be a neutral one - honestly, it never hurts to investigate things first for yourself before you listen to the opinions of others.</p>
<p>If you're looking for stuff on Bohmian mechanics (which you called pilot wave), I'll be glad to link you to some papers or books.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To clarify, Schrodinger's cat is not a paradox. It's a thought experiment by Schrodinger to show the absurdity of the Copenhagen interpretation, but it has already been resolved by the phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_decoherence" target="_blank">quantum decoherence</a>, in which the environment interacts with your quantum system, thus collapsing the wavefunction and destroying the quantum properties. That's why it's very difficult to see any quantum behavior at macroscopic scales, and why quantum mechanics may seem very unintuitive.</p>
<p>I'm not an expert in the different interpretations, but there have been some discussions in /r/physics on this topic <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/5qddfu/why_dont_more_physicists_subscribe_to_pilot_wave/" target="_blank">1</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/5qddfu/why_dont_more_physicists_subscribe_to_pilot_wave/" target="_blank">2</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Physics/comments/3gbft1/quantum_physicists_why_copenhagen_instead_of_bohm/" target="_blank">3</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
