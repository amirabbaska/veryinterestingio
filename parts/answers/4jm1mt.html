For example my iphone 5 still has the factory anti-fingerprint coating which was probably only microns thin to start with. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other people have said, what you might be noticing is the films and coatings slightly degrading over time. Manufacturers usually add anti glare, anti smudge, or anti reflective coatings on top of the screens to reduce... Well glare, fingerprint smudge, and reflection.</p>
<p>These coatings are generally much softer than the potassium hardened glass that most phone and tablet manufacturers use nowadays, you may have heard of gorilla glass which is an example of potassium hardened glass. And because of the composition of the coatings they can deteriorate over time. (Although if tested and applied properly they shouldnt noticeably degrade within the normal lifespan of a phone)</p>
<p>Source: I am an Intern for a company the makes smartphones, tablets, and laptops. And part of my job is to test bew coatings and see if they can hold up and meet our standards.</p>
<p>I also do some other materials testing for smartphones and laptops at my job so feel free to AMAA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference in hardness between your finger and the extra hard glass used in phone screens is so massive I would not be surprised if after a year of use it did not get thinner at all not even macroscopically. But the amount that your finger wore off might surprise you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wild thing about smartphone glass is that it is flexible. It's delivered to the manufacturers on rolls, and they unroll it when they make the smartphone glass overlay. It can be purchased in thicknesses down to 30 microns, though they typically do a thicker layer for extra resistance to scratching and abrasion. The surface coatings usually protect the glass from most abrasion, though it probably does thin ever so slightly over the lifespan of the device (unless you spill hydrofluoric acid on it, of course).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
