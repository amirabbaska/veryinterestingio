<p>People typically have a Hollywood understanding of hallucinations and don't realize how common they are. E.g. how many times have you felt your phone vibrate in your pocket, but when you checked it nothing was there?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Demodex is a parasite that is found on humans, and is called mange on dogs. A compromised immune system can cause an infestation, but usually our immune system is strong enough to kill them off before they become a problem. I think this may be a reason for those phantom bugs you feel. My dog had non contagious mange and he almost died before I was able to turn it around for him. He came from an unknown background, and even though I did DNA, I have no clue where all his health issue came from. He is almost full GS and has 17 % Great Dane- he is a handsome boy! Anyway that is how I learned about demodex.
