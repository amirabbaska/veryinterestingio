		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans are 99% the same genetically. That 1% makes us different. The addition of a chromosome is a huge change in genetic code. </p>
<p>DNA produces cells proteins etc. Think of it like a blueprint, now with down syndrome they have an additional chapter of things to make that weren't supposed to be there. All these additional proteins cause bloating etc etc. They are literally more filled so the really slight differences (in genetic terms) sort of get washed out. Remember our brains are designed to be able to tell people apart by minute differences as is required in a social species. Can you tell two chimps apart? They are 98% the same as humans. They can tell each other apart but you are not trained to. </p>
<p>If humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes and now they have 23.5 like in downs, at the far end you are only 98% the same. Which is a far cry from the 1% we are tuned to be able to tell apart. The reality is not that extreme, but it sort of gives you a feeling of why they look the &quot;same&quot;. Basically you are not able to tell the difference, but that doesn't mean they are the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The extra gene causes the proteins created to be shaped differently than regular. As a result, Downs can cause a handful of other similar features, problems with palette, joints, heart, so on that all are impacted by the change in the proteins' shapes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thereâ€™s lots of genes on chromosome 21 that all effect different things. If you have an extra copy, those lots of genes take their effect on various parts of your body, including your facial features (at least to a certain extent, of course some of those features are still what any kid would inherit from mom &amp; Dad). But those specific effects from genes on chromosome 21 are the same in kids with DS and are not typically seen in people without that extra copy.  As I think someone else mentioned also, all humans look extremely alike anyway. We have super similar genetic makeups of course. Our brains are just really good and specialized in the area of identifying individuals because we have to to survive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
