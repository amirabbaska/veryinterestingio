		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cl- is a chloride anion. It has a negative charge because it has one extra electron in its valence shell (it would've gained this by forming an ionic bind, a bond where one atom gives up an electron entirely, typically a metal). </p>
<p>Water is a polar molecule so ionically bonded compounds such as NaCl can disassociate into there constituent cations and anions (Na+ and Cl- respectively in this example)  </p>
<p>So if two chloride ions approached they would repel each other because they are both negatively charged. In the exact same way that the negative ends of two magnets would repel each other.</p>
<p>However if two elemental atoms of Chlorine were to collide they would both seek to fill there valence shell by each sharing one electron amongst both of them forming a covalent bond and thus a Cl2 molecule.</p>
<p>If you're thinking about studying Chemistry I couldnt recommend it enough. Science is totally dope</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially your question is, when I put Cl- in water, why is there no oxidation reduction producing Cl2 gas?
The reaction would be:</p>
<p>2Cl- + H2O -&gt; Cl2 + 2OH- + H2
(Does not work without input of energy)</p>
<p>The answer as to why this would not work has to do with reduction potentials. Think of reduction potentials as a measure of a compounds ability to be reduced relative to other compounds on the scale.
Chlorine gas (Cl2) has a much higher reduction potential than water. +1.36 Cl2 and -0.83 H2O. </p>
<p>So if Cl- anion were to oxidize giving up its excess electrons to form Cl2 gas, the Cl2 would then reduce by snatching back up the electrons much much faster than the water possibly could, reproducing the original Cl- anion and affording no change in the system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>What stops the Cl- from becoming Cl2?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chloride (Cl-) and Chlorine (Cl or Cl2) are pretty different even though they sound very similar. Chloride (Cl-) has that negative symbol because it &quot;stole&quot; an electron from a weaker element. (Most likely Sodium (Na) aka Sodium Cloride, NaCl). Once Cl- has stolen that electron, its &quot;happy/fulfilled&quot; and will no longer react with other chemicals (there's exceptions of course)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does my total chlorine test kit not pick up the chloride</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once again Cl- and Cl2 are pretty different. Cl- is pretty unreactive and basically just table salt. Cl2 however is different and more dangerous. Its much more reactive and is deadly in gas form. So this reactivity is probably what is tested for. (I'm not actually sure on how water treatment works)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What would have to change in order to make the Cl- form covalent bonds and become Cl2?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going from Cl- to Cl2 just doesn't happen. Its a very &quot;expensive&quot; reaction in terms of energy required. In Chemistry once you have become unreactive and stable, you don't really leave that state. Now Going from Cl2 to 2 Cl- is possible. You simply have to introduce an environment where there are plenty of weaker elements. But due to how &quot;strong&quot; (reactive) Chlorine is its a very dangerous reaction and is not really safe in a large outdoor scale.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What are some good sources of information on water chemistry?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When looking up water chemistry, focus on ionic bonds, covalent bonds, electronegativity trends, the octet rule, polarity on covalent molecules and also look up electrolysis after you've understood everything else mentioned. (its a bit more advanced). You will find all of this in any Basic Chemistry textbook. You don't need to limit your search on &quot;Water&quot; Chemistry. Just understand the above and you will know everything you need to make your own conclusions </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The octet rule states most elements &quot;want&quot; 8 valence electrons in their outer (bonding) shell. This makes them most stable. In the case of chlorine, you can see it is towards the far right of the periodic table. Each new row of the table begins with 1 valence electron and continues across. Because of chlorines position in its row, you can see that it has 7 valence electrons in a neutral state (and when it is in Cl2). This means it really really wants that last electron to fill its outer shell, due to the octet rule. Thus, it is usually Cl-. This is especially the case in solution, because water is great at dissolving, making it practically impossible for 2 Cl- to be oxidized to make Cl2 without some sort of catalyst. To learn more try looking up these terms:</p>
<p>Electronegativity
Orbitals
Shells
Electron shielding
Ionization energy
Periodic trends</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
