		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tissue viscoelasticity. The extensible elements in your musculoskeletal system have taken on a certain 'set' after prolonged immobilization. That's why normal sleep is best in a large bed to permit frequent involuntary re-posturing during sleep. Like the flat spot that forms in a tire while the auto is parked. A bit of bump remains but soon disappears with flexing and heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also called &quot;acute torticollis, or wry neck;&quot; basically what's happening as you sleep, your muscles adapt to a new position, whether shortened or lengthened, or even exposed to the cold for long periods over night. When you wake up, as the muscles and joints try to move into there normal resting position, they are aggravated simply the coming out of the previous state. Normally this resolves on its own within 1-3 days. Heat, or rubs may help relieve pain and symptoms, in addition to gentle stretching, and simply keeping it moving. Long term, you may want to look at correcting muscle imbalances, and postural corrections.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of answers here, with at least four plausible pathophysiological explanations and as many treatments. No one has ever demonstrated strongly that any of these pathologies actually have a causal role in a 'wry neck'. It's likely that each case is caused by a mix of the proposed pathologies, but it's also possible that they're all wrong. Furthermore, the best known treatment is time: usually a wry neck gets better despite, not because of any treatment.</p>
<p>I'm surprised at the number of people confidently repeating the 'cause of wry neck', with so little substantiating evidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
