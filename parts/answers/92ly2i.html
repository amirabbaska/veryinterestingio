		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One element of this is that the brain emits &quot;sleep spindles&quot;(&quot;a brief 11â€“15 Hz oscillation&quot;) which cover over noises which might disrupt sleep. So a person who is sensitive to noises, probably produces less &quot;spindles&quot;.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taking melatonin before bedtime improves over all sleep quality. This study looked at subjective change in sleep quality when people started taking melatonin and also measured sleep fragmentation to assess the effect of melatonin. Fragmented sleep is an indicator of how much of a light sleeper you are. Because melatonin reduced fragmentation, it probably made people sleep more &quot;deeply&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add that this study was conducted on breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Obviously this is an extremely physically/mentally stressed out population which increases the relevance of results to the average stressed and overworked adult employee.</p>

<p>Edit 2: I also realized I didn't answer the question.  As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/olafminesaw" target="_blank">olafminesaw</a> said, sleep spindles are a vital factor to falling and staying asleep. A recent study found a strong genetic component for sleep spindle traits and EEG patterns during sleep which explains why some people may be lighter sleepers. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15930" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15930" target="_blank">https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms15930</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
