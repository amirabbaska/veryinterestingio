		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Yellowstone super volcano is the world's largest caldera. The last eruption tossed 1,000 cubic kilometers of debris into the air.</p>
<p>Over its life time, the Kilauea volcano has tossed less than 100 cubic meters of debris into the air in its largest of explosions.</p>
<p>The Yellowstone volcano is put in the highest category of volcanoes, ranked by their explosive potential. Only 40 such explosions are known to have occurred on Earth in the past 132 million years.</p>
<p>Explosions like the most intense of those from the Kilauea volcano happen on average every 18 months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The volcano system in Hawaii is constantly able to relieve its pressure.  Also, the stuff that is in those volcanoes matter.  Explosive violent volcanoes have a lot of gases, and the magma is very thick .  Hawaii's has thin basalt and not much in the way of gas under pressure(or at least explosive gas.  The Sulfur dioxide is toxic, but not explosive)</p>
<p>It's also smaller than Yellowstone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Volcanoes have an explosivity rating called the Volcanoes Explosivity Index or VEI. It ranks volcanoes on a scale of 0-8 for explosive power. Kilauea is a 0 on the index and Yellowstone is an 8.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you're filling water balloons.</p>
<p>One of them has a hole that lets out the water about as fast as you are filling it. You could stand there all day and be fine. That's how Kilauea erupts.</p>
<p>The other one is huge. It is also intact. Eventually, it will burst and soak you. That would be a Yellowstone eruption.</p>
<p>Obligatory edit:
Thanks /u/arcmokuro for my first gilding. I didn't expect the classic water balloon analogy to blow up like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Size and scale. The Yellowstone Caldera is what's known as a &quot;supervolcano.&quot; They have the potential to radically alter the Earth with just one violent, explosive eruption. The volcano is Hawaii isn't explosive. In fact, Kilauea has had a constant flow of magma and has since 1983.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
