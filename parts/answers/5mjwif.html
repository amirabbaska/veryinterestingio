		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, whenever the nucleus of an atom releases any other particle or energy, it's said to be radioactive. Why does this happen? Because the nucleus is unstable and in order to become stable, it has to reach a lower energy state, which it does by releasing the said particles and energy. You generally see radioactivity in heavy atoms because they're pretty unstable due to the relative weakness (weak in the sense that they do not work as well as they do in lighter nuclei, they're still mathematically the same amount) of the nuclear forces in it. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like there exists the periodic table, which is based on proton number and the way electron shells are filled, so too is there a &quot;nuclear periodic table&quot;.</p>
<p>Although it is the number of protons in the nucleus that determine the element, the number of neutrons in the nucleus determines the isotopes possible. </p>
<p>To clarify, hopefully you've heard of carbon ¹⁴ and carbon dating? If not, my explanation may not be general enough. Carbon is defined by having 6 protons. However it can have 6, 7, or 8 neutrons (possibly more, possibly not; you can't keep adding neutrons infinitely).</p>
<p>Those are isotopes of carbon. They are chemically the same (basically) but have different atomic weights (protons + neutrons). In addition, adding those extra neutrons can cause nuclear instability. Not every isotope is radioactive. </p>
<p>There's a reason why carbon ¹² is the most common carbon atom. 6 protons and 6 neutrons is the most stable configuration for a 6 proton nucleus. Plus, when radioactive atoms decay, they almost always (always?) change into a different atom. That's because the decay occurs via the degradation of a neutron into a proton + another particle and/or energy (photon).</p>
<p>To take an extreme example, there are elements natural and artificially made (either in a lab or in extreme astronomic cases) whose nuclei are so unstable they last on the order of milli or nano or pico seconds. They naturally release a lot of radioactive energy because the atoms decay spontaneously almost simultaneously. </p>
<p>If you study a chart of nuclear stabilities (the combination of protons and neutrons that are way more stable than other combinations) you start to notice certain &quot;sweet spots&quot;. Certain combinations of P's and N's are way more stable than others. Then the abundances of elements and their radioactive siblings starts to become more apparent. </p>
<p>It's harder to get a real stable nuclear configuration to accept another neutron (or proton, but that's even harder because of its positive charge) simply because the nucleus would be going from a low energy/stable state to a higher one. </p>
<p>Google nuclear number and stability of nuclei and see if that information helps you understand better. </p>
<p>Hopefully my explanation wasn't too scattered (pun intended) and clumsy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, any particle physics reaction that <em>can</em> happen has some probability of happening. The more &quot;extra&quot; energy in the resulting reaction the higher the probability of it happening, so it'll happen with a faster rate.</p>
<p>The reason familiar particles like electrons and protons are stable is because they are &quot;locked in&quot; to their current state due to some conserved quantity, such as electric charge, etc. There is no lighter stable particle than the electron that is charged so the electron is stable because it's stuck with that charge. A heavier cousin to the electron is the muon. It can shed its conserved properties into other, lighter particles easily, it can transfer its &quot;muon-ness&quot; (which is conserved) to a muon-neutrino that weighs almost nothing, it can transfer its charge to an electron, and it can avoid breaking &quot;electron-ness&quot; conservation by creating an anti-electron-neutrino. That handful of particles shares all the same conserved quantities as the muon, but with a fraction of the rest-mass, so a muon decaying into those particles would leave a lot of excess energy. For that reason the probability of that reaction is high, and the rate is high, muons only have a lifetime of microseconds.</p>
<p>Similarly, protons are stable because of baryon number conservation and charge conservation. However, free neutrons are not stable because the collection of proton + electron + anti-electron-neutrino has less total mass (energy) than the neutron. Inside of a nucleus protons and neutrons exist in energy levels so a proton or neutron can only decay into the other if there's also enough energy left to raise the resulting particle into a free energy level. Which is why even though free neutrons are not stable some nuclei can be. For example, in Deuterium the neutron can't decay into a proton because the lowest energy state for a proton is already occupied and there's not enough extra mass/energy available (between the mass of the Deuteron and the total mass of the resulting particles from a hypothetical decay of the neutron to a proton) to push the new proton into the next available energy level.</p>
<p>However, in different nuclei there can be enough extra mass/energy available to allow for some sort of reaction. Such as a proton turning into a neutron (emitting an electron / beta particle); a neutron turning into a proton (emitting a positron); ejecting a part of the nucleus such as a proton, neutron, or alpha particle; a re-arrangement into a lower energy configuration without emitting any particles but leaving excess energy which is radiated as gamma rays; or the nucleus splitting into pieces (fissioning), sometimes releasing additional protons or neutrons in the process. If any of these reactions due to a nucleus having a viable decay path emits some particle or photon which has enough energy to ionize an atom then it is called ionizing radiation. It's this radiation which is capable of breaking atomic bonds inside the human body, which if it happens in sufficient quantity can disrupt some of our delicate and intricate cellular machinery on a wide enough scale to cause bodily harm, even death.</p>
<p>Different types of radiation (beta, alpha, gamma, protons, neutrons, positrons, etc.) release particles with different amounts of energy, which affects the relative &quot;strength&quot; of the isotopic decays as a radiation source. However, an even more important factor is decay rate, which is tied to half-life. Half-life is just a different way to express a proportional, continuous decay rate. The more there is of something the more of it will decay, but proportionally the same relative amount will decay over a given period, it's just more convenient to use time units related to half-life because it makes mental math easier. You could, for example, talk about the interest rate on a mortgage in terms of &quot;doubling time&quot; instead of APR. Anyway, the shorter the half-life of an isotope the faster its rate of decay, meaning also that the intensity of radiation emitted from a given sample will be higher. That's why you can hold a sample of natural Uranium (half-life of billions of years) in your bare hand without particularly worrying about it whereas if you did the same thing with Cobalt-60 (half-life of about 5 years) you are going to have a bad time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two main forces at play in a nucleus: electromagnetism and the (residual) strong nuclear force. The strong force is stronger than EM, but it has a short interaction length. EM however, has an infinite range. So for light nuclei, all nucleons (protons and neutrons) are close enough for the strong force to bind them. But in larger nuclei, the EM force (which causes same charge protons to repel each other) overpowers the strong force between protons that are not near one another. Therefore, the nucleus would attain a lower energy state by splitting and it does just that. Decay! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
