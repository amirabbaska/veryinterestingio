		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Superfluidity is a phenomena from the intersection of quantum physics and statistical mechanics that only occurs when you get a system cold enough so that the wavefunctions of the particles are all trying to be in the ground state {this means all the He particles become indistinguishable...yes it is weird}.  This is usually really hard to do with actual matter because most stuff tends to form solids way before you get cold enough for this to occur.  But Helium never freezes at room pressure due to its extremely weak Van der Waal's bonding so that's why it works for this and other materials don't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's super cool, the finest explanation is by Richard Feynman in Vol III of his lecture series, he helped discover this phenomona so had great enthusiasm for it.</p>
<p>It's really beautiful and worth reading in it's entiriety. The short answer is that when two states are indistinguishable, imagine two black spheres, identical, and I swap them over while you're not looking; could you ever tell? Quantum mechanics says that at the exact moment you can't tell, for instance there's no little fingerprints on one sphere, or bits of dust, and so on, in our example, then the universe changes the rules.</p>
<p>If you can't tell the identity of the particles, the two states interfere with one another, and this happens at a low temperature for Helium. When cold, two He atoms are indistinguishable, there is no physical way to define their identity. For whatever reason this makes them behave in a new way, and they are very, very likely to follow one another, in simple terms.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So far the real answer has been missed.  Yes helium remains liquid down to close to absolute zero, when the quantum effects become prominent.  But there's another factor.  The helium-4 nucleus has zero spin, which makes it a boson, a name for particles with spin 0, 1 (like photons), or 2.  Bosons can all occupy the same energy state.  On the other hand, fermions with spin that is an odd multiple of 1/2, like the electron and the proton, cannot exist in the same state together.  In effect, superfluid helium is like a single particle.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now if you extract the rare helium-3 isotope, spin 1/2, from regular helium, it doesn't form a superfluid until you get to temperatures a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero, while helium-4 does it at about 2 degrees above.  Helium-3 has to form pairs of nuclei to get to a boson-like state.</p>
