		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The movie was shot on photographic negative film, which can have a very high resolution if scanned correctly.  If it was special low-light film then the film will be more grainy and the quality will be lower, but most of the shots will have been done on high quality fine-grain film.  The film has been specially stored for the past 40 years.  They will take the actual film that passed through the cameras, then bathe them in special restorative chemicals.</p>
<p>For the shots with special effects, they will use the visual effects print that was made, which is not quite as high quality as the original negative, but good enough for a 4K scan.</p>
<p>These chemicals will wash and clean the film.  It will also help seal up any cracks in the film emulsion (where the picture is) to help when the film is scanned.  Think about how if you spill egg-white on your kitchen counter and leave it, it tends to go crackly.  If you wet it again, the cracks disappear.  Same kind of thing.</p>
<p>The film will go through a special wet scanner that allows the film to stay wet whilst it is being scanned.  This will keep the image very clean and get rid of any dust and means that the scan will be very &quot;clean&quot;.</p>
<p>The scanner will scan at 4K, which is 4096 pixels wide.  Similar to your scanner at home, but a bit more sophisticated and of course dealing with thousands of frames from the movie.</p>
<p>Once the scan is complete, an automated process will check each frame for problems, using the frames before and after as a reference.  If it detects hair or dust etc, on a single frame, it will autocorrect and remove the hair/dust.  If it detects any problems that it can't handle, the computer program will tell the human operator, who will fix it manually with something similar to photoshop, but for movies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Film doesn't have a fixed resolution like video does. Meaning you can scan it at as high a resolution as you want. You won't get a gain in quality past a certain point, but you won't really get a loss in it either. You're not adding information, just interpreting what's already there. Sort of like using a telescope to get a better look at something. </p>
<p>In terms of a digital equivalent, the maximum ideal resolution of 35mm movie stock is around 8K, or 33 megapixels (based on the best info I found). Of course, as an analogue (well, actually photo-chemical) source its actual resolution depends on a variety of factors: quality of the stock, ISO value used (the lower the number, the better), age and how well it was cared for, and the camera equipment used to shoot the footage.</p>
<p>Most movies and pre-2000's television shows were shot on 35mm film. Which is why we can get a 4K print of Star Wars, or high quality 1080p versions of 50 year old TV shows like Star Trek and Twilight Zone.</p>
<p>Video, both analogue and digital, on the other hand has a fixed resolution, measured by either &quot;lines&quot; or pixels. You can make videos larger, but in order to do so, you have to add data that doesn't otherwise exist. Computers do this by making a best guess. They do an okay job but it's not perfect, and it will never look as good as footage natively shoot at a higher resolution. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>old movies are shot using film, ie 35mm film.  and 35mm film has say the equivalent of 20 mega pixels.  1080p is only about 2 mega pixels.  so they just need to transfer the film to a digital format and then remaster it (aka do some image post processing to make it look more modern).  </p>
<p>considering that you can use 35mm film and get high quality 13 foot by 19 foot posters.  is it that surprising that they can get it on 4k?  which is a mere 8 mega pixel?  </p>
<p>have you ever used a scanner and scanned an image at various DPI?  you'll see the image increases in pixels the higher DPI you go, but you don't lose quality unless you go too high (unless you have a super high end scanner head)  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said the original source (35mm film) has even more detail that current 4k digital. So there is no up scaling. Once digital moves beyond about 8k then it will start outpacing 35mm film. By the time you clean and treat the film and use software to remove other defects you may have something better than release prints of the time that where a few generations away from the camera negative. </p>
<p>This is one of the reasons that TV shows like MASH still look great (shot on film) but a show like The Wonder Years (shot on 80's video technology) looks like shit.</p>
<p>Lawrence Of Arabia was semi recently restored with an 8k scan and 4k workflow. I saw it in the theater and it looked just as good as any current film even without recourse to digital effects in production. Lawrence was shot in what is the gold standard of film quality 70mm.</p>
<p>I've seen 70mm and 4k showings of 2001: A Space Odyssey and 70mm still looks better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Films were usually shot on 35mm film.</p>
<p>This produces a digital scan at around an 8k resolution.</p>
<p>High quality source material means you can get a high quality digital reproduction.</p>
<p>VHS/phone quality is low to start with, theres no way to improve it.</p>
<p>Source: Currently working on a major motion picture involved in VFX and the film is shooting in 65mm, with 35mm plates scanned to digital</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
