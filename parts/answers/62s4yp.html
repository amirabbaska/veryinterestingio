		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optometry student here. Your eyes have several stages of accommodation including tonic and proximal accommodation. </p>
<p>When your eyes have nothing to focus on they will relax to tonic accommodation which is the point where muscles rest with minimal nervous innervation.</p>
<p>If you suddenly hit a wall, your eyes will accommodate to the proximal distance of that wall based on previous life experience.</p>
<p>Edit: Accommodation is where the lens in your eye (imagine a magnifying glass) changes power to help bring a near image into focus.</p>
<p>Edit2: A few of you are curious about relaxing your eyes and accommodation to relieve eye strain. You can use the 20/20/20 rule: every 20 minutes stare at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. </p>
<p>Edit3: Accommodation is fully relaxed at 20 feet (6 meters) which is why you're tested at this distance when at the optometrist's office. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I travelled to Belize in 2006 and we explored a few different caves. Our tour guide told us that the few life forms down there were blind due to no light and their eyes having nothing to focus on. At one point while we were deep in the cave with absolutely no natural light, the tour guide had us all turn off our headlamps. Literally could see nothing at all, not even my hand 2 inches away from my face. After about a minute of pure darkness, I started to feel dizzy and felt like I was spinning. I couldn't tell which way was up or down anymore.</p>
<p>So, long story short, in true pitch black darkness, you can't see a damn thing (at least for the first 2 minutes)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once went to a blind museum where you experience simulated daily activities in pure darkness led by a blind guide. It was under a couple hours long, but by the end my eyes were hurting and achy. I had to keep them shut to relieve it. It felt like they were trying to focus on something but couldn't and it exhausted them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way I learned it at neuro class, anything beyond 50 feet is &quot;infinity focus&quot; or the same focus for your eyes - hence offices have Windows so you can look out and let your eyes relax </p>
<p>When it's dark or eyes are closed, the focus is that same 50 feet to infinity range focus</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
