		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think using the technical definition of &quot;physical&quot; would mean the answer <em>must</em> be yes. All cognitive phenomena are the result of <em>something</em> in the brain--chemical, structural, whatever, but it can't exist if it's not physically explainable.</p>
<p>I realize you may have meant more like &quot;are the differences macroscopically visible,&quot; but worth all saying all the same. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes there are differences, but the way that they differ and the scale at which they do are so vastly minuscule that we can't even begin to change or shape those differences to our benefit.</p>
<p>Just as an example, we can treat certain brain disorders which we know stem from a deficiency or surplus of a specific neurotransmitter. Things like ADD or Parkinson's can be controlled with medication but primarily because we understand the disorders enough to have a working antagonist for them.</p>
<p>Things like knowledge and cognitive function are multifaceted and cannot be affected by simply introducing a serotonin blocker, it requires a cocktail of medication that we have not discovered yet. This is mostly because we still have not discovered what &quot;causes&quot; people to be smarter than others.</p>
<p>In considering the future, I can foresee a certain blend of &quot;mentally stimulating&quot; medication that can maybe facilitate learning and knowledge gaining to an extent by reducing noise and brain power to at least focus better at learning, but it would still require an active component from the learner to gain the knowledge themselves.</p>
<p>If you want to talk centuries into the future, then maybe one day we really will be able to download information to the brain, but that's still a topic for sci-fi books for now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We are just at the beginning of this exploration. </p>
<p>There have been some findings like [correlation between observable brain structure and political orientation] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092984/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3092984/</a>).</p>
<p>There is an ongoing study about cognitive decline with age. I have read about it in paper format but I am sure references are available on the internet. One thing was notable at the time of the publication is that they saw signs of aging in older brains regardless of the cognitive performance of the owner of the brain. That is they failed to find the source of the difference. But it should be a matter of time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Einstein's brain has been dissected. It apparently is no bigger than average but has significantly more astrocytes. </p>
<p>Now if you're like me and have no clue what an astrocyte is, you look on Wikipedia, you realize how utterly complex they are (what little is known about them) and you realize that the answer to the OPs question is likely, no. :-(</p>
<p>(The good news is that you can increase your astrocytes by continuing to learn new things. And by a good diet, exercise, and love.)</p>
