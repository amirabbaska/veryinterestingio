		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally speaking, depression is associated with low levels of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin in certain parts of the brain. Having a balance of each is essential to “normal” functioning. Antidepressants such as SSRIs handle the serotonin, MAOIs prevent the breakdown of dopamine, and tricyclic antidepressants help balance both serotonin and norepinephrine.</p>
<p>Think of dopamine as the brain’s motivation and reward-seeking neurotransmitter. We need it to put effort into life goals and to also feel rewarded from achieving goals and positive feedback from the environment. Too little dopamine=little/no motivation and pleasure seeking.</p>
<p>Norepinephrine can be loosely thought of as adrenaline. We need it for attention, awareness, and responding. Similar to those with ADHD, people with depression may also have low levels of norepinephrine, and experience similar problems with attention and concentration. “Pseudodementia,” for example, refers to the attention and memory impairments caused by depression that would otherwise seem like dementia.</p>
<p>Serotonin does a lot of different things, but in terms of depression, serotonin is responsible for balancing mood, appetite, sex drive, sociability, sleep, etc. Depressed people with low serotonin levels usually have problems with eating too much/little, sleeping too much/little, not wanting to even get out of bed most days.</p>
<p>In terms of brain structure changes, depression can cause our hippocampus to wither and shrink. This part of our brain is vital for learning and converting short term memory to long term memory. Fortunately, we are able to “exercise” our hippocampus’ back to health (i.e. solving puzzles, spatial awareness activities). This is a big part of why depression includes a lot of problems with thinking speed, concentrating, and recalling memories.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It appears that there is a lack of neurogenesis -- new neurons being born.  That's stimulated by increased serotonin.  This explains why it takes days for these drugs to work, instead of the hours that it takes most other drugs to work: it takes a while for the new cells to be born and find their way / grow axons in the hippocampus.  It may be that people with fewer neural stem cells or more muck in their brains that prevents axons from growing to the right place are more prone to depression.  </p>
<p>What increases neurogenesis in that brain region besides SSRIs?  Exercise. (At least in rodents) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a grossly simplified example: imagine your brain is just a neuron that fires if you’re awake and another neuron connected to that one that prompts you to get out of bed. Dopamine/serotonin are the substances that carry the message from your “awake” neuron to your “get up” neuron. The “awake” neuron shoots dopamine/serotonin at the “get up” neuron and then takes the dopamine/serotonin back again afterwards.</p>
<p>Depression is caused by these neurons not having enough dopamine/serotonin or reabsorbing it too quickly to carry the signal from your “awake” neuron to your “get up” neuron meaning you stay in bed all day even though you’re awake (remember this is just a rough simplification). The most common type of antidepressant is called a “selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor” or SSRI. It basically stops your “awake” neuron from stealing back it’s serotonin before it’s finished sending it’s signal, making you more likely to get up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The way the brain works is by sending chemical messengers called neurotransmitters between each brain cell or neuron. One of those messengers is called serotonin, and regulates several things in your body like mood, sleep, and appetite. </p>
<p>Depression happens when the brain isn't getting enough serotonin. The most common antidepressants are SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) which essentially stop serotonin from being reabsorbed by the brain, therefore allowing there to be more of it working.</p>
<p>Of course it's more complicated than that, but that is the general science behind it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
