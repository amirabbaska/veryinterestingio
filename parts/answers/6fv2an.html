		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former game dev here,</p>
<p>It's not impossible, there's just no profit in it for the amount of work involved. The studio would be selling to a tiny niche who would want such a thing, and they can't possibly charge enough to turn a profit at a price the market will tolerate.</p>
<p>On the technical side, game code for a console is incredibly specific to that console. What you suggest would require a near complete rewrite from scratch of these games, and recreation of all art assets - which would require a full scale dev team to port to a modern platform. That, and not only would the code have to be ported, but redesigned to work with modern graphics on this other, modern platform. And then you would of course require full scale play testing to find and fix bugs and ensure the game experience is faithful to the original.</p>
<p>It costs ~$10m to make a low end AAA title, and these ports will cost at least as much, likely ~$20m per title. And if you're going to improve the video quality, it's inadequate to go with an incremental improvement, you might as well go all the way, so the effort required would be demanding, escalating the price. Anything less than what is expected for an exalted title on a modern platform would be a complete market flop. And again, this is for a niche market. Buyers don't buy the same experience again, unless you're Nintendo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not impossible, it's just incredibly expensive and time consuming. Besides the fact that re-doing the textures takes a lot of effort, you also have to re-create all of the models. The original models were made up of very few polygons- much of the reason modern games look more natural is that they have more precise definitions of the characters, with more articulated joints (like fingers that move independently) and all of that takes a ton of time to create and animate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;HD Remasters&quot; are a lot more complicated than just increasing the polygon count and texture resolution.</p>
<p>9/10 times, they just re-create the game from scratch. And unless the game is super popular and will guarantee tons of sales, the dev won't do it because it won't make enough money.</p>
<p>That's why only super popular games like the Crash series are getting HD remakes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Making an old game look better is a lot more than just swapping in HD textures. Take a look at <a href="http://legendsrevealed.com/entertainment/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/tombraider.jpg" target="_blank">this screen cap from the original Tomb Raider</a>. There's not enough resolution in the world to make that look better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's cost prohibitive to do so.</p>
<p>Especially for the old consoles, games weren't as much optimized as they were puzzled together with proprietary api's and even development languages to work uniquely on that specific hardware. Often the hardware itself was very specific and unique for that console which required even more coding gymnastics to suit the code specifically to take advantage of that specific hardware.</p>
<p>The sourcecode is often not something easily converted to the currently used x86 instructrion set or hardware models, without a near 100% rework.</p>
<p>Besides that, textures in old games aren't as simple as you'd imagine. Most of them are so low resolution or sometimes just colors with some wizardry applied to them to look a specific way, that you'd also have to remake all these textures to look similar to the original but more usable in tuned up graphics.</p>
<p>And then there's the problem of sourcecode often no longer existing for quite a few games. Or sourcecode existing for an earlier stage of the game after which they started hacking the code in low level assembly for optimization and debugging.</p>
<p>It comes down to that they'd have to redevelop every part of a game from scratch. Which is time better spent actually creating a game that is new.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
