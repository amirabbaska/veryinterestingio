		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons. The salt in the ocean lowers the temperature needed to make it freeze. Currents stop the ice from bonding, and if Ice did freeze, it is less dense and floats. But the main reason is the pressure, especially in deep water. To freeze, water needs to expand. Deep in the ocean, the pressure from the water stops it from being able to expand. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ocean salt water can freeze, but the salinity levels very through out the current. Deadly  Brinicles or “frost fingers” where surface freezes then sloughs to the bottom in a chain, and continues freezing downward as it reaches the bottom surface, can kill some sea life unaware and sensitive to temperature changes.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not sure I can ELI5 but there are 2 main reasons. </p>
<p>First is that high pressure decreases the temperature water freezes at. Meaning it takes much colder temperatures at higher pressures.</p>
<p>Second deals with density. Ice is less dense than water which is why it floats. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a material water is most dense at 4 degrees Celsius, and expands in both thermal directions. Thermal increase phase shifts water from liquid to a gas at 100 degrees Celsius, and thermal decrease phase shifts water to a solid at 0 degrees Celsius. As a solid, water’s material expansion fixes at ~9% volume displacement.</p>
<p>One result of this is that solid state h2o floats in liquid state h2o.</p>
<p>Water has a bunch of really unusual properties, very cool material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other comments have touched on this, but your question itself is actually flawed. </p>
<p>Deep in the ocean is not below freezing, because the freezing point is different. Higher pressure means lower freezing point.</p>
<p>Salinity also affects this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
