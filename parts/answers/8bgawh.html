		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's most likely from a muscle spasm near your inner ear, specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_tympani_muscle" target="_blank">tensor tympani</a>. This is the same muscle responsible for the roaring some people get when they yawn. Problems in that area of the ear/jaw can also cause tinnitus. </p>
<p>It's not a well studied phenomenon, because it doesn't last long and isn't harmful. But you can read about it [more here] (<a href="https://www.tinnitusformula.com/library/sudden-brief-tinnitus/" target="_blank">https://www.tinnitusformula.com/library/sudden-brief-tinnitus/</a>).</p>
<p>EDIT:
And we're locked down. Since there were some unanswered questions related to the tensor tympani and tinnitus (with tinnitus being very unlike the roaring most people experience with tensor tympani action), please see <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10753317" target="_blank">this paper</a>. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
