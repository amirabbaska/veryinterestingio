		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, this question will only garner speculative answers as no one knows. Animals usually have mating seasons so that when the offspring's born it will have an abundant supply of nourishment (either directly or indirectly, e.g feeding off the milk the mother sustains through feeding). For example, elk and deer have their mating season during the autumn months and give birth around spring time when plants begin to grow. This leads to good foraging opportunities for the mother to nourish her young as well as there still being enough plants for the calf to start feeding on during weaning.</p>
<p>It has been theorized that humans don't require this sort of &quot;offspring timing&quot; to coincide with food availability because we <strong>always</strong> have food available. However, most infants are born in the summer months. If this is some remnant of a mating season to give birth around the wet season in Africa, I'm skeptical of, but who knows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two answers I've heard that seem worthwhile. The first is that at some time during the evolution of humans, reproduction-based sexual interaction was &quot;co-opted&quot; for a more sophisticated level of bonding between individuals. Sex becomes a kind of language of connection and a supplemental form of communication/reaffirmation.</p>
<p>A second idea I've heard (which is not at all mutually exclusive with the first) is that because female-dispersal was more typical during most of human evolution, creating instant sexual bonds was a useful tool for a young woman to have when entering a new community. Instead of waiting a month or several months, and potentially having to deal with male aggression and an uncertain position within a community hierarchy, a woman could potentially enter into sexual relationship with a man in the group, cementing her place socially, and pre-empting the stress of dealing with the (potentially aggressive) interest of multiple men.</p>
<p>Sloth-edit: Totally forgot to mention what u/mmm3says wrote about &quot;timing of conception is vague&quot;. I think that's another important piece of the puzzle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chimps, Gorillas,  and Baboons (I want to say all primates) don't have &quot;mating seasons&quot; either - the female goes into estrus periodically all year. Bonobo chimps are even like us - constantly in a state of being physically receptive to potential sexual activity, regardless if conception is likely on any given day of the cycle. </p>
<p>Goodall noted that high-ranked males would &quot;sequester&quot; the high-ranked females to get exclusive reproductive rights. </p>
<p>Goodall also noted that all males of a Troop would (nominally, generally) help protect the young from predators, generally ALL mature males had mated with all mature females, and were ALL potential fathers. </p>
<p>Further reading about Bonobo chimps suggests sex is a social bonding experience.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Monkeys are social animals who like sex &amp; power hierarchies &amp; many primatologists/anthropologists seek to gain insight of our own sexuality through these genetic relatives. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human breeding and sexuality are atypical as far as animal species go.  There must be evolutionary benefits to this that have outweighed those a seasonal breeding season (which in addition to timing and weather has impact on predation)
A couple of benefits to this behavior:</p>
<p>1) Humans, unlike most animals, have sex for pleasure without respect for season. (I'm though I heard females orgasming is rare or even unique to us, and makes sense as far as it encourages mating behaviors)   Men just don't stop by for some action for some month once a year.  This  has huge social and societal impact.
Closer and longer lasting intimate relationships with males and females.  A man would be less likely to stay with one woman and participate in childrearing if mating was a seasonal thing.  This allows females both a wider selection of mating partners</p>
<p>2) Because human estrus is not obvious, timing of conception is vague.  This creates opportunity for more ambiguity as far as who fathered a particular child.  This allows females both a wider selection of mating partners, and knowing her body better, to arrange conception with mate of her choice.  This uncertainty gives a woman the potential to secure child-rearing resources from a man who is not the child's biological father.  This give a man the potential to father a child and have some other guy raise it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We didn't evolve to have a mating season is the best answer when asked &quot;why?&quot; about anything that didn't happen in evolution. It just means there was no reason or pressure for us to need to keep mating to a short time period. It could be something to do with our long life spans, the incredible time and energy that goes into your children, or how long it takes from conception to birth being a long time compared to many animals.</p>
<p>It could be said that being able to reproduce at anytime is advantageous to reproduction, which means the better question is why other animals have mating seasons at all, and that will change depending on the animal I suppose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
