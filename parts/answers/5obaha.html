		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like any radiation worker, they apply ALARA. That means that you should take steps to make your radiation exposure &quot;As Low As Reasonably Achievable&quot;. The ways to do this are the maximize distance from the source, minimize time near it, and use shielding when possible.</p>
<p>If you pay close attention when passing through security, you'll see that they rotate between positions throughout the day. So the people operating the x-ray machines rotate around to other positions as well.</p>
<p>You may also notice that some employees are wearing badge dosimeters. These are little badges that you wear on your body. Over time they will accumulate on average the same exposure density to radiation that your body does. Every few months you send them in for testing to see if you had an abnormally high exposure within that time.</p>
<p>I don't know much about the manufacture of their machines (I'd guess it's not something they want the public to know much about), but it's not hard to add some shielding to strongly attenuate x-rays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is worth noting here (unless I'm mistaken), the thing you walk through doesn't use radiation in any form. It is an induction loop that detects the presence of metal, like the thing in the ground at traffic lights.</p>
<p>Only your luggage goes under penetrative radiation imagery, which is enclosed in the machine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
