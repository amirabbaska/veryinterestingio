		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To everyone who is saying &quot;nobody is against oil pipelines, they just don't want them in (this location)&quot;, that's just not true.  Many people are against oil pipelines as a whole because they pose significant environmental and health risks.</p>
<p>Since 2010, over 3,300 incidents of crude oil and liquefied natural gas leaks or ruptures have occurred on U.S. pipelines. These incidents have killed 80 people, injured 389 more, and cost $2.8 billion in damages. They also released toxic, polluting chemicals in local soil, waterways, and air (Center for Effective Government).  Let's take the Keystone XL Pipeline for example. It's predicted to result in about 91 major spills over 50 years, contaminating over 450 miles of water and violating the Safe Drinking Water Act.</p>
<p>It's also forcing people to give up their property rights to huge, multinational corporations.  They don't have to agree to this.  Under eminent domain laws, the government just has to deem the land necessary for the development of the country, and it's theirs.  They also tend to ignore Native American land rights and seize their land for eminent domain even though it's technically illegal.  These people are either relocated or have an environmental and health risk placed in their backyard.  It doesn't matter who's backyard it is- this kind of risk doesn't belong in ANYONE's backyard.  Sometimes, it even goes through the only source of water in a large area.</p>
<p>And really, we have every reason to be suspicious of any infastructure that is promoting the increased usage of fossil fuels.  We should be turning away from that now and building wind turbines, solar panels, and other renewable sources of energy.  It's not sustainable in the long term to rely on crude oil.</p>
<p>Most of the oil isn't even for us.  We're exporting it to China and Venezuela, furthering the importance of oil and fossil fuels as the most significant factor in the global economy.  Modern wars aren't fought over freedom, they're fought over oil. Why would we want to further that problem?</p>
<p>Edit: Venezuela and China comment is referring to the specific type of oil contained in some of these pipelines- light sweet crude oil.   Not just oil in general. Looking for more sources on that though. And thanks for the gold!!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pipeline inspector here (I make sure the Pipeline is constructed within compliance standards)</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You are creating an easement for an oil company on your land which can negatively affect value in the long term.  However,  you are compensated over $20 per foot typically and may also be given a recurring trespass fee. Still,  the ppl who benefit most are the ones with the actual well pad on their property where they also own mineral rights.  These are the individuals who get a percentage of the oil profits.... not the people with a pipeline running through their property.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The risk of a leak is extremely remote bUT is still there.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is always going to be maintenence and service vehicles or planes monitoring the pipeline which may dissuade someone who values their privacy and isolation.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Aesthetically,  there will be evidence of a pipeline. The construction area is reclaimated  but for instance in a heavily wooded area there will be a large grass covered path where the pipeline is. Plus there will be pipeline markers above ground showing. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some people are against fossil fuels and want to demonstrate that. </p>
</li>
<li>The pipe will be there pretty much forever. When a pipeline is finally abandoned it is usually capped and left in place.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are not really against the pipeline in itself. Because, hey, we need them. We need oil. (Well, so far we do. I <em>know</em> that we both want and have to change that, but that is beside the point right now)</p>
<p>Since we need oil, we need to transport oil. Transporting oil in a pipeline makes a lot more sense than transporting oil in a tanker and combusting oil to make that tanker move to it's destination, right? Especially since the pipeline is a lot faster, once it's in place.</p>
<p>What they are against is the placement of the pipeline. It is, in honestly, a really ugly piece of structure that will for the foreseeable future cut your property in half if you happen to get your land prospected for it.</p>
<p>People who get one as a neighbor tend to see their property values go down and have to get accustomed to the maintenance traffic at odd hours.</p>
<p>Most people, as a general rule, are against having something ugly running through their garden that makes the property value go down the drain.</p>
<p>It's not strange, really. If you loose money, you get upset. If you get the scenic view from your living room window ruined, you get upset.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that you happen to belong to an indian tribe, and you  get a pipeline prospected straight through an ancient burial ground. Then it's not just about scenery any more. It's about your heritage. Your traditions. Your rights. Your land. Your everything.</p>
<p>Prospecting a pipeline means that you will get a lot of people against you. Thats totally a part of the equation when you begin. You don't pick someone with a meek personality and a complete inability to stand ground for that job. You pick someone who goes along with the instructions he is given no matter what. And then you hope that it works.</p>
<p>The problem is that if you don't have a clue what you are doing (as it would appear when you approach a indigenous tribe without really knowing how their legal options are different to other peoples) you end up upsetting not only people who feel that they could have cringed out more compensation for their property value decrease but also people who have a legal right to say &quot;no&quot; and firmly stand by that answer.</p>
<p>The simple truth is that as long as a pipeline is properly maintained and in good condition it will be a lot more environment friendly to have the pipeline than to transport the oil with other means. But that doesn't help one bit with the fact that it will be ugly. Really ugly. And it will upset people living nearby it for other than esthetic reasons too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One day I was out cycling on an old rails-to-trail in central Illinois. I was passing a farm and I started to smell aromatics. My first thought was perhaps I was approaching a large patch of flowers. The further I rode, the more I smelled it. Then it hit me: hydrocarbons. As a chemist, I know that smell. It was intense. I stopped to investigate and there it was: a section of pipeline jutting over a small creek bed, a few meters away from the trail. Then I noticed the signs saying underground pipeline stretching far into the distance. I was smelling oil from that pipeline. It seemed that whatever company owned the pipeline had been using the bike trail as an access trail as well. </p>
<p>There were no signs about whose pipeline it was and searching the internet provided nobody to directly contact about the issue. I sent an email to the state environmental agency but never heard back from them. I wouldn't want this in my backyard. The money wouldn't be worth the risk to my health or the environment. Even a tiny, constant exposure to hydrocarbons can affect your health greatly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everybody will have their own differences as to why they are against or support oil pipelines. For me it comes down to economics. Oil pipelines are great in the short term but the global trend is towards alternative power/fuel sources. meaning it is a bad investment in the long run.</p>
<p>1) We already have a vast network of oil pipelines, sure it might not be the most efficient rout for the oil across North America but the profit can be made by oil companies off of virtually any source of oil already.</p>
<p>2) Despite the profits, the environmental clean up costs are astronomical. </p>
<p>3) emerging energy sources (solar and wind) are becoming cheaper by the year. the only reason they are not already taking over the market in many areas is because oil lobbyists keep pushing for higher taxes on the products which pushes them beyond what is economically beneficial.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
