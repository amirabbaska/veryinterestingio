		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of answers here that <em>answer</em> the question but not to a satisfying level of detail so I'll take a swing.</p>
<p>The main reason is because honey is almost completely sugar. That high sugar concentration dehydrates any cells that try to take up residence through osmosis. (Osmosis being like a gravitational pull toward balance.) If there's water inside of a cell that falls into the honey, the honey will pull water out of the cell until the proportion of water to sugar inside the cell is equal to the proportion outside the cell.</p>
<p>Since the honey had such a high sugar content, a single cell just doesn't have enough water in it to make a dent in that so the honey ends up pulling nearly all the water out of the cell, killing it in the process.</p>
<p>There are some things that can survive without any water; botulism spores have already been brought up and are a great example of why we pasteurise honey, despite how well it kills bacteria on its own.</p>
<p>There are other properties that play lesser roles like a chemical secreted by the bees called defensin-1 which works as an antibiotic but these other properties pale in comparison to the mighty osmotic pressure.</p>
<p>What this means, though, is that, yes, honey has antimicrobial properties but the main one (osmosis) goes away the moment you dilute it because the balance mentioned earlier is much easier to reach if the overall solution has a lower percentage of sugar.</p>
<p>In turn, that means that honey does not pass it's abilities on to you by drinking it since you dilute it with your saliva and stomach acid. In other words, if someone tells you it will help fight off a cold because of its antimicrobial properties, they don't know what they're talking about.</p>
<p>It will, however, make your throat feel better temporarily but that's another ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey can expire if it has too much water in it, which it can pull from the air if it is stored improperly. Bees will actually cap the honey comb when the moisture of the honey gets too high (around 16-17%) so it cannot absorb any more water. Moisture above 18% can <del>cause</del> allow the honey to ferment, which would effectively spoil the honey. When honey is processed by a beekeeper, it is typically done in a humidity controlled environment to avoid over hydration. </p>
<p>Honey, if stored properly (dry and airtight), can last thousands of years because of its sugar content and natural antibacterial properties. It will often crystallize when stored for a long time, but this does not mean the honey is bad. Simply warm it and it will turn back to honey. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of these top answers are pretty much wrong. Not really so much to do with the sugar, but not too far off. I wrote a paper about this, so I will tell you about honey and more at an age above 5.</p>
<p>When bees gather pollen from flowers, they add an enzyme called invertase to break it down into two sugars: glucose and fructose. When the bee returns to the hive and regurgitates the nectar into the honeycomb it adds one more enzyme called glucose oxidase.  This creates trace amounts hydrogen peroxide in the honey. Yes, the same hydrogen peroxide that your mother poured on your scrapes and cuts, and the same one that keeps everything it touches clean and sanitary. The bee then flaps its wings over the honey until all the water has left. The lack of water and the existence of hydrogen peroxide makes it a rough place for any bacteria to live. </p>
<p>Civilizations as far back as the ancient Sumerians know that honey helps treat wounds. It prevents bacteria and moisture from entering while at the same time, sucks moisture out of the wound. A visit to Boca's Gumbo Limbo Nature Preserve  shows how in their sea turtle rehabilitation, honey treatments are frequently and effectively placed over cracks and other exposed injuries to protect damaged sea turtles from developing infections.</p>
<p>Eating local honey also can help immunize against local allergies. As an informal study from Xavier University in New Orleans found, bees gather small amounts of pollen that could normally trigger allergies.2  But eating that honey introduces tiny amounts into you, and allows your immune system to build up tolerance to common allergens.
The positive aspects of honey continue. The National Journal of Biological Sciences research suggest that honey may be a great tool in the management of diabetes. Honey raises your blood sugar much less, and requires much less insulin to break down then the sugar found in most foods. Using it as a substitute could not only help combat diabetes mellitus at early stages, but also due to its anti-lipidemic effect,  can fight against obesity.</p>
<p>Like any good thing, honey can also have its drawback. While anyone old enough to read this can enjoy the full fledged benefits of the golden nectar, it is not recommended for infants.  Toxicologist Charles Santerre recommend waiting until the baby is 12 months old before you introduce honey into the diet.  Honey can rarely contain a bacteria called Clostridium botulinum which could affect an infant's immature digestive tract and cause infant botulism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honey never expires because the water that is present in the honey is molecular and/or chemically bounded (trapped). Water becomes bonded through their strong electrical attraction (polarity), this can happen through water-ion and water-dipole interactions. This is important to know because Many microorganism, such as the types of bacteria and yeast which are associated with food spoilage, require moisture (water) to grow and reproduce. </p>
<p>You have probably bounded water yourself. When you throw salt on the sidewalk, the salt intercuts with the water trapping the molecules and preventing them from expanding (freezing) therefore lowering their freezing point and preventing snow from building up. But as we know it will eventually freeze. </p>
<p>Back to honey- </p>
<p>All foods have what is called a water activity (Aw)., with 1.0 being the maximum possible.
To show an example:
Fresh meat has a water activity of 0.985, while potato chips/crisps have a water activity of 0.08.  </p>
<p>The bacteria associated with food spoilage require a minimum of 0.90 to survive, grow and reproduce. Yeast require a minimum of 0.80 and 0.70 for mold.
There are exceptions of course which I can name if you guys are interested. </p>
<p>At low water activities, microorganisms die because water inside the cell diffuses out in an effort to balance the osmotic pressure. So basically the cells dehydrate and die because the water leaves theirs cell. </p>
<p>This is why honey never expires, it has a very low water activity, preventing it from supporting the growth of micro organisms that would cause it to spoil. </p>
