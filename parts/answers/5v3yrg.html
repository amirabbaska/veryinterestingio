		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tendon from the wrist lies partially below the tendon for the middle finger. The middle finger position restricts the movement of the ring finger. If the middle finger is curled up (tendon fully stretched), the ring finger can't move. If you leave your hand flat on the table and lift repeatedly the ring finger, you'll see the tendon of the middle finger moving upwards too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have several muscles which act on your fingers. The thumb is digit 1 and the pinky is digit 5. You have 2 muscles which flex digits 2-5 as a group, and 1 muscle which extends digits 2-5 as a group. This means the actions of the index, middle, ring and pinky fingers are all linked. </p>
<p>Some digits have extra special muscles.  The thumb has its own flexors, extensors and abductors/abductors  (for side to side movement). This means it can act independently.
The pinky has its own flexors, extensors and abductors. So it too, can move independently.
The index finger has its own extensor, but not flexor, so it can sort of move on its own.</p>
<p>Digits 3 and 4 have no extra muscles besides the common flexors and extensors. This means their movements are ALWAYS linked, and the position of one affects the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Extra, super-short, functional analysis.</p>
<p>Thumb :: manipulation and control of grasped objects.</p>
<p>Index and Middle Fingers :: Strength of grasp.</p>
<p>Ring and Pinky Fingers :: Stability of grasp, particularly with respect to wrist and arm attitude.</p>
<p>Different evolutionary purposes has lead to different shapes and muscle layouts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
