		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I disagree with a lot of the posts here.</p>
<p>It's not because someone did a bad job.  It's because that's how the content producers wanted the audio to be.  You are supposed to turn up the volume and 'experience' the movie or show how they intended.</p>
<p>Think of how crazy loud the bass is at a movie theatre.  That's what they like.  </p>
<p>I hate it too, because most of the time that's not how I enjoy listening to my tv, but it's not an accident.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m super bummed out by a lot of these responses. I make a living working on sound for films, and while I’m mostly a Dialogue Editor and Foley artist, I have mixed and study under/work with the best guy in my state. Yes, we mix for theaters, and in surround, but that’s because the mix will translate to other devices and stereo a lot easier (in theory, although admittedly it’s...tricky to say the least). We were both trained to mix dialogue FIRST, and base everything else around that. Louds can be loud, and softs can be soft, but what’s being spoken is the most important thing (even whispering). Not everyone follows this rule, and it sucks. As far as blaming the Mixer, especially on anything that was released in theaters first (so anything out of Hollywood), trust me: you absolutely do not get to that level without being a master of your craft. Those people definitely know what they’re doing. But it’s not 100% up to the Mixer. It’s not his/her Film, it’s the Directors. And even big-name Directors are usually at the mercy of the studio paying for the film. I’ve heard of several mixers who had to do things they were absolutely not proud of, but that’s because the person writing the paycheck wanted it differently or thought they knew better. Also, there is, and probably will never be, a universal lossless audio codec, and most of the lossy codecs nowadays tragically alter the mix of a film. Even playing back on an expensive 7.1 home theater system won’t be the original mix, let alone headphones from a phone. We just haven’t figured out how to truly translate from the original mix to smaller and smaller devices. There are many reasons for this all-too-common complaint, and as a professional, please believe there are those of us actively trying to make a difference.
TL;DR - Please don’t blame the Mixer. We’re doing our best, and there are a ton of factors that go into this complaint, and yes, we are wildly aware that there is a problem. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Motion picture audio engineer here. The short version is that every device is tuned differently and you can’t possibly mix for all of them.  See, the mix that we do on a stage is meant for theatrical release. This mix meets certain standards for audio levels and dynamic range set by standards bodies like SMPTE, AMPAS, etc. A slightly different mix is done for distribution, but again meeting certain standards. For TV we may do a big 5.1 mix and a “near field” mix for smaller TVs. Both of these mixes conform to a certain standard. The problem is that these standards are based on a certain listening environment.  If you have a home theatre that is capable of reproducing 20Hz-20KHz then you may hear a nice even mix. But listen to the same thing on your shitty iPhone speakers that can’t reproduce any low end, and its going to sound much more hollow. That iPhone may have piercing highs and muffled mids too because the absence of certain frequencies can really highlight others. This applies equally to you whether you’re on a mobile device or your TVs built-in speakers</p>
<p>There’s also the fact that an audio mix is meant to be heard stationary, from a constant position. Sound level is logarithmic, so moving that iPhone closer and further from you is going to have a significant effect on the quality of sound you hear in that mix. Couple that with acoustics in the room that can significantly affect frequencies and you start to see hw our modern viewing habits are an auditory nightmare. Frankly, it’s a testament to some of these standards that things actually sounds as good as they do across all kinds of different devices.</p>
<p>EDIT: so people are now asking about a couple of other things. Let me clarify standards and talk about dynamic range. First, standards don’t mean that explosions are only X decibels louder than dialogue. How all that stuff is in proportion to each other is called a mix. That part is all artistic license in the part of the mixer. What we do is calibrate the mix rooms daily to ensure that everything is being mixed to the same consistent baseline. This ensures that from one scene to the next there is consistency. There are walls other things to consider, like broadcast TV has different standards because there are/were bandwidth limitations in the signals so certain things might need to be compressed differently. And for those that are talking about the commercials being louder than the program, there is legislation governing this (granted, like most legislation its written by people that don’t know what they’re talking about so it sucks).</p>
<p>Dynamic range (go google it) is the idea that some sounds are soft and some are loud. There is a range of volumes in real life and the goal of the mixer is to reproduce that closely enough that it sounds convincing. That range in a movie or show is a little more compressed that real life, but you need to keep some spread to convince our brains and not distract the viewer. We could reproduce the entire mix with a range of only 20dB, but that would suck. What most people don’t realize is that sound is subconsciously perceived as good, bad, realistic, fake, etc. A good mix with realistic sounds is something that most people will not notice, but a bad mix will be instantly noticeable and distracting. </p>
<p>So why don’t they mix it for computer speakers and iPhones even if it’s intended for Netflix? Because audiophiles like me will still pull it up on my roku with 5.1 sound to watch it properly. Frankly, they do it so people like me will give them academy awards and they can charge more for the next film they work on.</p>
<p>If the whisper to explosion ratio is really bug in you that much then a) get your ears checked, or b) get a compressor for your viewing system to compress the dynamic range and make everything the same level.  But don’t complain when it sounds bad in a different way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's complicated. NAB has a guide regarding the technicalities of this but, in short, it all comes down to cubic feet of room space. When you mix in a bigger space you have to push more cubic feet of air and the nature of dynamics changes. A lot of films and tv shows are mixed on dub stages that have a cubic air space that's much bigger than a typical home residence. This explains why the dialogue is so low and things get so loud. When you move from a big space to a small space the dynamics are exaggerated. Low volume content becomes too low and loud content gets too loud. Dialogue becomes too dynamic. The reverse is also true. I remember a doc I mixed in a smallish room and it was run at a theatre and it was much more dynamic. They complained it wasn't loud enough in the big room even though they sat in the small room and said it sounded fine. So, mixes in smaller spaces don't translate well to bigger space and mixes that happen in bigger spaces don't translate well to smaller spaces. I actually warned them about this and they didn't listen to me (ironically) when I said the mix wouldn't translate to a larger space. I don't think they wanted to spend the money on renting out a big theatre just for their little doc.   </p>
<p>I end by saying this: I think there needs to be a technology that allows you to adjust a mix based upon the cubic feet in your space. Basically, it's a smart mix. The stage the show / film is mixed on enters in their cubic feet and optimal listening position and it compares that with your home setup and adjusts for optimal listening. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
