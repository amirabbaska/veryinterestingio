		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is yes - </p>
<p>There are a few different &quot;alternative&quot; sleep cycles out there. One is the Uberman cycle, where instead of taking a long 8 hour nap, you take 20 minute naps every 4 hours for a total of 2 hours per 24 hours.</p>
<p>The idea is to get your body trained to reach REM sleep quickly, as that is when your body rests and repairs itself. In a standard sleep schedule, it may take your body a few hours to reach REM.</p>
<p>There haven't been really any side effects reported, although data is limited. I did this for about 6 months and I felt great and well rested. The amount of time I had everyday was incredible.
The only thing is that school and work tend to fit around a normal sleep schedule, so it makes it difficult.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it's the most famous polyphasic sleep style, the Ãœberman was suggested by a woman in a forum who claimed to have done that during her university times. For really looking into it you should start with something easier like the Everyman or a simple biphasic schedule.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
