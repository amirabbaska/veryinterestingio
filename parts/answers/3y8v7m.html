<p>The term &quot;little green men&quot; has existed for nearly a thousand years for other supernatural creatures such as gremlins and goblins, but started to be applied to aliens after reports of alien and UFO sightings started to increase especially in the 1940s and beyond (edit: sorry, I initially put &quot;abduction reports&quot; which was misleading; the first proper report of abductions was the 1966 Hill case mentioned below). It was probably intended to be derogatory, likening UFO encounters to long-disbelieved encounters with fairies and monsters. One big contributor was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelly-Hopkinsville_encounter" target="_blank">an incident in Kentucky in 1955</a> which really cemented the idea.</p>
<p>Greys have a very specific origin: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betty_and_Barney_Hill_abduction" target="_blank">One reported alien encounter in 1966</a> which just became the commonplace appearance for alleged abductees to report. </p>
<p>I know we're supposed to be objective and unbiased in toplevel replies, but it's basically a case of people claiming/pretending to see what they think people want to hear because making up something really weird and outlandish wouldn't be as believable as saying &quot;oh yeah I saw the same thing as other people in this area have seen.&quot;</p>
<p>Edti 1: Guys, if you want to discuss the idea that aliens are real, please post sources. If you're going to make claims about reports from indigenous tribes that never saw a sci-fi book cover or from a century before &quot;greys&quot; were cool etc, then post links to them, otherwise you're just adding to the layers of hearsay and claims nobody has any reason to believe.</p>
<p>Important edit 2: Check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/3y8v7m/eli5_why_are_aliens_generally_portrayedimagined/cybs19c" target="_blank">this awesome Carl Sagan quote</a> posted by /u/HitByARoadRoller that explains some of the evolution of alien depictions in western culture.</p>
<p>If I get unlazy and work remains quiet later on, I'll probably add something about other popular, commonly-repeated depictions such as &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_aliens" target="_blank">nordics</a>&quot; and David Icke's beloved &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reptilians" target="_blank">reptilians</a>&quot;. Have some wiki links in the meantime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is off-topic, but still sort of related.</p>
<p>Ever wondered why the ghosts in Japanese horror movies are portrayed as wearing long white dresses and having pale skin and long, black hair covering their face? This appearance has become really widespread and it's been used outside Japanese horror imagery too.</p>
<p>But where has this portrayal originated from? One would think that maybe from some eyewitness reports or ancient lore, but no. The appearance was developed in the Japanese kabuki theatre. The number of actors involved in a play was limited, so every actor had to play several roles; this necessitated them to switch from role to another swiftly, and make their characters clearly distinct from each other for the convenience of the audience. Putting on a long black wig, a white burial kimono and blue face paint was a handy combination of appearing as a ghost on the stage. </p>
<p>Even though OP's question is about aliens, not ghosts, I still think the kabuki explanation is pertinent here. It is interesting how cultural conventions can influence &quot;real life&quot;; a great number of alleged ghost sightings, or perhaps more like ghost <em>experiences</em>, lack the element of visual encounter altogether. Ghost encounters are usually described as sensations of an unnerving presence, or an unexplained sound. Depictions of ghosts in art and on film are not really based on anything but artistic licence, because extremely few people have ever claimed to having actually seen a ghost. Artistic interpretations tend to fill up this visual blind spot, and alleged eyewitnesses buy into this fabricated visualization of what they think they've experienced because they believe the appearance of ghosts is based on people's reports; this way they perpetuate the cycle of third party interpretations becoming &quot;real&quot;, when there's no basis these interpretations. This applies, I believe, to aliens and all sorts of supernatural beings as well.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm ignoring &quot;little green men&quot; in favor of the &quot;gray&quot; archetype - oversized head, small or no nose, overly large eyes, skeletal frame, often naked.</p>
<p>The large head and eyes bring to mind a child. But this is contrasted with the grey, dead skin and skeletal body. Together it creates an image of timelessness, both eternally young and eternally aged.
With a large head and large eyes it seems to symbolize a being with great wisdom and perception. An entity that has evolved beyond time, representing some cosmic truth. It appears to be physically frail and helpless, but somehow has a great power to inspire experiences of fear, paralysis, and abduction. The neutrality of the grey color and the physical frailty differentiate it from a god or demon archetype. It doesn't possess the quality of absolute good or absolute evil, but rather a neutral, seemingly technical interest in humanity. </p>
<p>This is based on a google search for &quot;grey symbolism&quot; and some ad-lib associations. I have an interest in CG Jung so I'm imagining the documented appearance of the Grey Alien symbol as a communication from the collective unconscious to individuals who are particularly receptive to it, in the sense that unacknowledged issues in their personal lives are relevant enough to be viewed as playing out a certain archetypical pattern represented as such.</p>
<p>The overall Grey Aliens story is usually abduction (if we're confined to eyewitness accounts and not popular fiction). A person is immobilized and transported to a ship, inhabited by grey aliens. The aliens either strike up a conversation which conveys cosmically significant information beyond the grasp of language, or alternately rudely examine the subject like doctors in a surgery. After some period the person finds themself in their home, sometimes having lost hours or days of time, or finding no time at all passed.
Associations:
1.The feeling of helplessness
2.Being forced to go someplace you don't want to
3.Being imprisoned
4.Imprisoned on a vehicle that is taking you into the unknown
5.Interacting with a consciousness that is not like your own
6.The superiority of this alien consciousness over your human consciousness
7a.Being examined, or monitored by some superior entity
7b.Receiving messages from a superior entity
8.Having an experience outside linear time</p>
<p>My associations bring to mind a person who was raised in a religious tradition, who is  unconsciously questioning their faith in coming to terms with death/dying and what comes next, but is unable to deal with those thoughts consciously and is therefore repressing them by doubling down on the idea of God and Heaven in the afterlife. Helplessness and abduction in an extraterrestrial vessel mirror our soul's incarnation in a physical body and it's inevitable voyage towards death. The Grey Aliens represent a counterpoint to the God/Devil image, questioning the religious dichotomy between Good and Evil with their neutrality, watching and observing humanity but more with a sense of curiosity than a sense of absolute judgement. </p>
<p>I don't know how far fetched this sounds to Joe Reddit. I guess what I'm saying is that Christians who's understanding of death is in conflict with their faith, and who turn away from resolving or even acknowledging this conflict (because it would be too painful) might become so psychologically perturbed that the mind has no choice but to play out the conflict in visionary experience. This visionary experience is similar between different people because they have the same religious associations, the same color and form associations with youth, aging, time, death, and so on.  </p>
<p>The Greys are an un-God/Devil, neither good nor evil, not judging or condemning, but still eternal and transcendental. Instead of the cosmic One, they are the cosmic many. The UFO realm is an un-Heaven/Hell, a higher plane of existence outside life and death, but not a judgement or sentence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best explanation I've heard is that early (and flawed) views of evolution (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georges_Vacher_de_Lapouge" target="_blank">Georges Vacher de Lapouge</a>) influenced expectations about the appearance of aliens. These early views held that humans have &quot;progressed&quot; through evolution to have lighter skin and less body hair. Extrapolating this trend millions of years into the future (the time span required to develop interstellar space travel) would mean that more advanced species would eventually evolve to have grey skin, large eyes, and no body hair--the classic Area 51 alien.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of reasons varying from false encounters to purposely sound ridiculous (which of course caught on), to sleep paralysis, to hallucinogens. Since there is such a large stereotype of what we think aliens look like now, people tend to think of greys as what all aliens look like. </p>
<p>Then you have super alien enthusiasts (I love aliens, but these people are above and beyond) who say aliens have some to them in their sleep, they gave birth to aliens, etc. And that's how they know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
