		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, from the view point of the person watching, time slows down and space stretches. This is THE fundamental take away from Einstein's (famous) theory of special relativity. The speed of light cannot change, so therefore everythng else (time, space) does. Einstein was a smart dude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>remember there is <em>no such thing as absolute speed</em> - <em>except for the speed of light</em></p>
<p>things only move at some speed <em>relative to an imaginary reference point in space</em></p>
<p>for example, how fast are you moving <em>right now</em>?</p>
<p>you're sitting in an office chair, so your speed is 0, right?  only relative to the ground</p>
<p>the ground is actually spinning about the Earth's axis, so that's your actual speed, right?  only relative to the axis</p>
<p>the entire Earth is flying around the Sun, so that's your true speed, right?  only relative to the Sun</p>
<p>the Sun is circling the galactic core at tremendous speeds (dragging the Earth and you with it) so finally we've found your true speed?  only relative to the galactic core</p>
<p>the entire galaxy is hurtling through space, dragging with it the Sun, which is dragging the Earth, which is dragging you, so there is our true speed?  only relative to other galaxies nearby</p>
<p>our local cluster of galaxies is moving together through space.  but only relative to some other cluster of galaxies.</p>
<p>there is no &quot;center&quot; to the universe, there is no fixed reference point anywhere, so if I fly <em>away</em> from the galaxy at some tremendous speed, then the galaxy <em>seems</em> to be moving faster.  but if I move <em>within</em> the galaxy at the same speed, then that galaxy <em>seems</em> to be stationary.</p>
<p>we can define the &quot;center&quot; of the universe as any arbitrary point, and all the math still works out the same.  if we want, we can make our galactic core the &quot;center&quot; of the universe, and then all the other galaxies are flying away from us.  or we can make our Earth the &quot;center&quot;, or any other galaxy - it doesn't matter.</p>
<p>if we calculate the speed our galaxy is moving relative to the closest galaxy, then we are moving at x km/s.  but if we calculate the speed of our galaxy relative to a galaxy 4 billion light years away, then our speed is x + y km/s.  which speed is our &quot;true&quot; speed?  both.  neither.</p>
<p>when you understand the idea that <em>all ideas of speed</em> are <em>relative</em> and, in a real way, <em>imaginary</em> and that <em>everything is moving</em> and <em>nothing is moving</em> all at the same time, then it will start to make sense to you why the &quot;speed&quot; of the object emitting a photon has no effect on the speed of the photon itself.  you might say that object is moving at 1,000 km/h, another person might say 1,000km/s, and another might say it is stationary.  the object has no true, absolute, speed.  </p>
<p>in a way, you can think of photons <em>as the only things in the universe that actually have a true speed</em>!  from a photon's &quot;perspective&quot; <em>everything is moving at the</em> <strong>same</strong> <em>speed</em>, which is <em>not moving at all</em>!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually the core question that prompted Einstein to come up with Relativity.</p>
<p>Previous to Einstein, Maxwell's laws had already established that the maximum speed of light is always constant.  But of course that immediately prompts the question:  how can it remain constant if the emitter is also moving?</p>
<p>Speed is defined as distance (space) divided by time.  If the speed is held constant, that means something <em>else</em> must change for the emitter as it moves.  In this case, Einstein realized that both space and time must change instead.</p>
<p>As the emitter gets faster and faster, its sense of time slows down.  Its length in the direction of movement also shortens.  This allows the speed of the emitted light to remain constant from its frame of reference.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is no they wouldn't.</p>
<p>The long answer is a bit more complicated. Basically one of the implications of Einstein's relativity is that light is moving at the speed of light, relative to everything, all the time. Trying to explain why that is the case is like trying to explain why gravity exists, some things are just rules that exist in the universe.</p>
<p>The reason this is even able to happen is because of time dilation. Which is a science term for saying the faster something is traveling relative to you, the slower it's clock appears to be ticking.</p>
<p>There's actually quite a lot to unpack from that last sentence, I'll try to explain some important points.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The only speeds that matter in the universe are relative speeds, so the speed of one object compared to another. There is no universal reference point, or grid that you can use to measure an absolute speed relative to empty space.</p>
</li>
<li>Time dilation doesn't make sense in respect to your everyday experiences of Earth. Why should time move slower if you are going faster? At the end of the day the fact that light is always moving at the speed relative to everything means it has to exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the equation for velocity is: velocity=distance/time</p>
<p>The equations we came up for time dilation are a result of the fact that light needs to be moving at the same velocity, relative to objects that are moving at different velocities. The only way that can happen is if distances between you and everything else change as you move faster, or if time does.</p>
<p>Obviously distances don't larger between you and something as it moves faster, so the rate at which time flows must.</p>
<p>Working on the assumption that light moving at the same speed all the time is just a fundamental fact of the universe, we can do a little visualization of why time dilation works (and why it's only really noticeable at high speeds/relativistic speeds/&gt;~60% speed of light).</p>
<p>Imagine there is a spaceship with a photon of light bouncing between two mirrors placed on the floor and ceiling of a spaceship. You are standing on earth, when the spaceship isn't moving (relative to earth) there is no time dilation (not entirely true because gravity, but we can ignore that here). At that point from the perspective of you and someone of the ship, the light is moving up and down, the exact same movement for both observers. When the ship is moving however, this changes.</p>
<p>To the person on the ship, the photon is still traveling straight up and down. But to you, it is moving in a zigzagging pattern through space. This is because it is both bouncing up and down, and in a ship that is moving forward. Because the speed of light has to be constant, something has to change here, since the photon is traveling a longer distance in the same amount of time. The distance it is traveling won't shrink to compensate (the ship doesn't get smaller, well not really anyway), so instead time has to pass more slowly from where you are observing the ship in order for the speed of light to be constant. </p>
<p>For example, if the ship was moving at half the speed of light, the photon would be bouncing at 45Â° angles from your perspective, and time would be moving at 87% of its normal speed relative to you in order to compensate.</p>
<p>An interesting thing to note here is that you are moving more slowly relative to the people on this ship too. Which sounds like it shouldn't be able to happen, but the difference in time is made up when the ship decelerates back down to your speed. This is getting into general relativity though, which is beyond me, I have only learned special relativity so far, which in relativity for objects that aren't accelerating (or decelerating). General relativity covers acceleration and its effect on time.</p>
<p>TLDR: Relativity is weird, and light is always moving at the speed of light</p>
<p>And as a side note, I hate you for being on the front page, I love talking about physics, but I spent way too much time typing this</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
