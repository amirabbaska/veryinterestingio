		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sound travels 5x faster in water.</p>
<p>Above-ground noises are significantly attenuated when they cross the air-water barrier. So every sound originating above water is muted.  Underwater sources aren't affected by this.</p>
<p>However, making noise underwater requires more energy per dB, because water is 1000x as dense.   You need to vibrate 1000x the mass, which is <del>30dB</del> <em>60dB</em> (darn convention changes) of attenuation.  Our ears also judge sound logarithmically, where each 10dB sounds about 2x as loud.  So equal sound sources at equal distances underwater sound about <del>32x</del> <em>64x</em> as quiet.</p>
<p>Additionally, you'll kind of feel muffled, not just from the drop in volume, but because the sound doesn't seem to come from any direction.   Our brains are very well trained to find the direction of a sound source by the difference in time of arrival between our ears. That tells us left, right, or center, and the shape of our ears and face blocking sound from certain directions helps us judge forward/backward and up/down by subtle differences in volume.</p>
<p>Sound traveling 5x as fast makes the time delay only 1/5 as long. And since the volume is already significantly attenuated, we have trouble judging forward/backward from the small difference in volume caused by the shape of our ears. So everything sounds like it's coming from right in front of us, or on top of us.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Sound under water is ~60x quieter, and it's really hard to tell where it's coming from. Hence the claustrophobic, near-deaf feeling you get like you're walking past one of those anti-echo fabric boards in an auditorium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Got a little background in underwater noise as I was a submarine Sonar Technician for 9 years.</p>
<p>First off my opinion is that it is a lot louder underwater than it is above, at least in oceans. Ships, Shrimp( they sound like popcorn popping, or mouse clicking), and dolphins are extremely noisy.</p>
<p>I am assuming your question is more to the point of why does it seem quieter when my head is below water that above. Like when you are at a  lake, pool,or even in the ocean.  Well first off your ears are designed to work out of the water.  They may work okay'ish underwater, but not to the same degree.  When your head is underwater, your inner ear typically maintain the little amount of air within them, as getting water to your middle ear can cause issues.  Anyone who  had tubes in their ears already know this. </p>
<p>So in order for you to hear anything underwater, sound has to transfer to air first.  When sound goes from one medium to another(water to air in this example) it loses energy depending on what the difference in density one is from the other(and it doesn't get much more different from air to water).  A good example of how sound loses energy when going through mediums would be ear buds.  A physical object that is much higher density prevents the vibrations from reaching the air drum because sound doesn't transition well from Air to solid objects. When your head is underwater its the same thing, but the densities are reversed, the sound never reaches your eardrum as most of it bounces off the air bubble retained in your ear.</p>
<p>Now if you got yourself an underwater microphone, you will notice a completely different amount of noise underwater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easier to imagine by putting your ear against, say, a table. If you then lightly (very lightly, as it gets quite loud) tap on the table, you will hear it incredibly clearly. Now, if you then block your other ear, so your only hearing is from the table, and then somebody speaks, you won't hear it very well, because even though the table is conducting the sound much, much better than the air, the air doesn't transfer the sound to the table.</p>
<p>When underwater, it's like a really, really big table. You can hear any sound that originates from inside the water or from a collision with the water, but, like with the table, sound from the air won't transfer. </p>
<p>So while water does conduct sound incredibly well, you still need something to introduce the sound into the water.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm assuming you're saying it's quiet in a pool, or possibly a lake.  If you ever go swimming/diving/etc in the ocean, you'll find it's quite loud, especially in areas with coral.  There, you can hear fish crunching away at it constantly, like pop rocks always by your ears.  That sound travels very well, so it's all-encompassing.  If you hear a whale or dolphin, even if it's fairly far away, you can usually hear the sound.  However, directionality of the source of the sound is nearly impossible to tell when underwater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sound propagates quite well underwater, what doesn't work well are human ears. Sound waves struggle to propagate between differing mediums, in this case from the water to the air in our ears.</p>
<p>In fact, very little of what you hear underwater is from sound waves entering your ear canal. The human body is mostly water, and as such an underwater sound wave passes quite nicely into our flesh. This results in the sound wave resonating through our bones themselves. Much of the sound you hear is bone conduction!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
