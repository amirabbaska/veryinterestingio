		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because trains do a lot of idling as well. Turbines are ungodly inefficient at low speed (power)</p>
<p>There are several examples of turbine locomotives though. The opitomy of which were Union Pacific's General Electric turbine locomotives (GTEl's). Flooring 8500hp (and by some accounts capable of up to 10k.)</p>
<p>The main disadvantages comes in their size, and the massive amount of fuel.</p>
<p>The GTELs used a 3 unit consist for each motive into. By today's standards it would be underpowered (8500 vs 13k in flagship locomotives), they also used more fuel. The reason that UP's GTELs were economic for the time was that bunker C fuel had no other use (This was a time before advanced refining techniques) and it was first cheap.</p>
<p>They are/were also exceptionally loud.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gas turbine engines are not as efficient as reciprocating diesel engines when operating over a wide range of power conditions, as locomotive applications require.</p>
<p>It might be possible to have a gas turbine that could match big diesels at its ideal power setting, but you lose that immediately when you ask for more (and especially less) power. Even so you'd probably need an additional heat recovery stage (steam turbines) to match a modern diesel in efficiency, and cost, bulk, and complexity would skyrocket. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a pilot who worked briefly for a railroad I asked the exact same question and came to the following answer:</p>
<p>Gas Turbine Pros</p>
<ol>
<li>Exceptionally high power to weight ratio</li>
<li>Efficient at high RPM</li>
</ol>
<p>Gas Turbine Cons</p>
<ol>
<li>High-Veryhigh RPM useful operating range  </li>
<li>Significant fuel/air burn rate</li>
<li>Complex maintenance </li>
<li>Fragile, expensive parts</li>
<li>Power delay (5-10 seconds)</li>
</ol>
<p>Gas Turbine Pros in trains</p>
<ol>
<li>NA</li>
<li>Makes sense on road trains</li>
</ol>
<p>Gas Turbine Cons on trains</p>
<ol>
<li>As the general public, we only really see road trains in transit, going long distances from yard to yard. The reality is a significant amount of time is spent idling, or going back and forth short distances at low power shuffling cars in a yard and or pickup/dropoff at industries. Turbines are impractical on these engines, but it could still work as a separated road train engine class. </li>
<li>In order for turbines to burn as much fuel as they do, they have to compress a lot of air and suck it in. Trains operate at very low speeds, and thus do not have the luxury of having air forced down their air intake at 500 mph like planes do. They would have to have even greater compression mechanics engineered in. But this is ultimately an engineering problem so lets move on. </li>
<li>IMO This is the real killer here. Turbines are significantly more complex than diesel engines. Mechanics need to have a practical understanding of what is literally rocket science. Don't want a mechanic specialty dick measuring contest, just pointing out that this is a complex topic that will require significant retraining of maintenance employees. Additionally, these are road trains, so they move, and could break down in any yard or even en-route. Thus, mechanics would have to be retrained system-wide. And if they do break down, there are a lot more things that could have gone wrong, and may require complex repairs increasing the negative impact of mechanical failures. Also due to the complexity, there are more parts this increases the total required on hand parts (system wide again) in order to keep trains properly maintained. These parts btw, are made of special materials with special designs/equipment in limited quantities, with no alternatives to purchasing from the manufacturer... aka expensive and a possible bottleneck.</li>
<li>The maintenance issue is compounded by the fragility of the engines. fragile blades spinning at 30,000 rpm do not like solid objects of any kind. Planes don't have this problem, except on runways, which are often swept for debris, but trains are at ground level 24/7. Go under a tunnel and have your extra powerful air compressor suck a loose brick off the ceiling and that train is gonna have a bad time. Even little pebbles can be a problem, hell the U.S. military aircraft have had problems with sand screwing up turbines in the middle east. Long story short, this is another complex engineering problem, but any failure here could be catastrophic, shutting down engines in the field. Increasing that risk is not desirable. </li>
<li>last, and certainly least, is the power delay. Trains are accelerating or decelerating thousands of tons. A few second delay is completely negligible. </li>
</ol>
<p>So basically, <strong>TLDR while they seem like an efficiency no brainier, turbines are only power efficient on some trains, while the company gets screwed by extra engineering issues (air compression and filtration), limited operational use (long distance road trains only), and essentially doubling the already significant engine maintenance labor and materials cost.</strong> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine engineer here.</p>
<p>The turbines in power plants are steam powered with the steam being generated by different mediums(coal, gas, nuclear)</p>
<p>Gas turbines are horrible on gas. They are very mechanically efficent. But a marine gas turbine can burn over 5 cubic meters of fuel an hour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turbines exhibit mechanical efficiency over only a very narrow range of RPM. Outside of this range, efficiency drops dramatically as does power output. Turbine engines are also ungodly inefficient at very low RPM, and are thus terrible at idling.</p>
<p>Diesel engines have a wider range of efficient RPM which provides much more flexibility in terms of power output. Furthermore, diesel engines idle very, very well.</p>
<p>Turbine engines are most ideal in two scenarios:</p>
<p>1.) When power output is more or less constant, or fluctuates very little during operation. This occurs in power plants</p>
<p>2.) When conserving weight. Turbine engines have a much higher power-to-weight ratio than diesel engines, which is why turbine engines are used on aircraft (aircraft power requirements are more or less constant during cruising as well). On freight trains the weight of the engine is insignificant compared to the total mass of the train, so switching to a turbine would be meaningless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
