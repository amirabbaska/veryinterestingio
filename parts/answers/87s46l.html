		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A slightly different approach to the other answers which sum up to &quot;We compare against modern CGI&quot;</p>
<p>The increase in quality for CGI has to do with the level of detail you pay attention to.  At first, CGI was clearly using hard angles where it should be using soft curves.</p>
<p>So, when someone finally got soft curves right, it was &quot;So realistic!&quot;  But now the thing which made CGI obvious was the colors and shadows.</p>
<p>Someone got colors and shadows right, and CGI was &quot;So realistic!&quot; But now the thing which made CGI obvious was the use of bulk motion where individual motion should occur (like clumps of hair instead of strands).</p>
<p>Then we had issues of being TOO perfect.</p>
<p>Issues of no superfluous motion (random breeze, background people, facial ticks).</p>
<p>Not sure what precisely the latest issues are, and likely have some of the listed issues out of order.  But it boils down to the people who work on CGI technology addressing the issues they are aware of as the most glaring, and then consumers of the media noticing new problems and focusing on those as the method of determining what is real and what is not.</p>
<p>So, when you look at older CGI, you bring with you a host of expectations, but that CGI wasn't even aware of needing to satisfy half of your needs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the factors for me was HD. I remember thinking Star Wars had the best special effects when watching it on VHS, and then blu-ray came out and, oh boy, those miniature models actually look like miniature models now. The same thing is happening with 4K where itâ€™s making CGI look more fake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The baseline of comparison isn't reality, it's other CGI.</p>
<p>When CGI first came out, it was obviously CGI, but it still wow'd people because you had this fantastic amazing stuff happening on screen.</p>
<p>As the push to make CGI &quot;realistic&quot; increased, new CGI was always compared to existing CGI.</p>
<p>Stuff &quot;looked real&quot; at the time because that was the best there was at the time <em>compared to other, less real, CGI</em>. Now it looks fake because we have better CGI today and that's what we compare it against.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>same way kids were super excited when action figures could bend their arms. or when High Definition was 720 pixels.. it's a comparison to what was available. nobody thought those effects &quot;looked real&quot; but they looked better than anything they had seen at that time so they were excited and praised the special effects.. i.e. a movie review of &quot;E.T.&quot; when it first came out could have &quot;best special effects I've ever seen!&quot; but that doesn't imply they ever thought it was realistic at all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>well a lot of it is to do with expectation - we just expect better now. Like my son is 2 and we've not let him have any sweets or cakes yet, so he thinks bananas are the ultimate in taste sensation.</p>
<p>The other thing is when something is a thing you've never seen before you're so taken with the newness that you don't notice it doesn't look quite right. Your imagination fills in the gaps. That's why kids loved the old Dr Who's - they'd <em>never seen anything like it</em></p>
<p>I would argue a little with your premise though - on the whole, bad effects have <em>always</em> been bad effects. The rubber Arnie head in the Terminator <em>always</em> looked like a rubber Arnie head, and the Scorpion King always looked like, er I dunno what it was meant to be. But the good effects knew their limits and pushed them</p>
<p>(there's another level too - The stop-motion skeletons in Jason and the Argonauts <em>always</em> looked liked stop-motion skeletons but nobody cared because OMFG HE IS FIGHTING SKELETONS)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
