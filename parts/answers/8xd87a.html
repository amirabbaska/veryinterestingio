		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dental and Vision products are even less &quot;insurance&quot; than typical health insurance is (in the sense that insurance is designed to cover you only in the event of some sort of unintentional loss, while health insurance is only partly this way, and dental/vision are not at all this way).  </p>
<p>Dental and Vision &quot;insurance&quot; is about getting a good price on preventative care, like tooth cleaning, exams (eye and dental), and glasses/contacts. Vision insurance, in particular, generally doesnt even cover any catastrophic eye injury anyway (probably covered by your health insurance though.) Its more like a subscription &quot;Service club&quot; where you get a discount on a few goods/services by being a yearly member.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because medical insurance was originally a product provided by hospitals, to cover the high cost of medical care provided at hospitals. Since dentists and most optometrists weren't part of the hospital system, they weren't covered by the hospital's insurance programs either.  </p>
<p>Once medical insurance took off as part of an employer benefit (which was a different historical accident), employers created programs to allow to provide/subsidize dental and vision insurance to their employees as a benefit, too.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least for vision, it's a specialized policy that not everyone needs so it makes sense to split it out.  Unless you already have vision issues, it's almost guaranteed to be cheaper for the patient to pay for regular bi-yearly eye exams out of pocket than paying two years of a monthly premium + copay + deductible.  Hell, I <em>have</em> glasses and its still cheaper for me to decline the company vision plan.  </p>
<p>It's really only worth it if you have totally horrid eyesight that needs a new prescription every year, you have some sort of chronic or degenerative long term eye issue, you're a high risk for one, or you're bundling a plan together for your whole family (and more than one of you has shit eyesight).</p>
<p>Cutting out the vision component gives them more wiggle room with pricing/coverage on the rest of the health plan, and it's simple enough to tack on a vision plan for someone who actually wants it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite its outsize impact on how millions of people pay for and interact with different kinds of doctors and dentists, its mostly like that because of the quirks of how insurance in the US evolved to what it is today.  </p>
<p>In the 1950s employers started offering insurance to attract talented employees.  That insurance covered pretty much everything.</p>
<p>Later on, companies that couldn't afford insurance for everything offered lower cost insurance that stripped out dental and vision.</p>
<p>The reason they stripped dental and vision that way is because dental and medical and eyeglass providers (no contacts back in the day) were and are more distinct professions than you might expect.  The reason they are so distinct is tied up in the history of medicine and dentistry in the 19th century.</p>
<p>That's it.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
