		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all: water</p>
<p>You loose water while breathing (the air you breathe out is always more humid)</p>
<p>You also sweat. The amount of sweat is different for each individual, but it can easily be a hundred mililiters or more per night. </p>
<p>last but not least. You breathe in O2 and breath out CO2. The C from the CO2 actually comes from sugars, proteins or fat that your body turns into energy to run itself. The excess C that is no longer needed in the body is removed by breathing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Veritasium did a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL2e0rWvjKI" target="_blank">video on this</a>. In short, part is sweat, and part is loss of carbon, a product of metabolism. You breathe in O₂ (oxygen) and breathe out CO₂ (carbon dioxide). That's where that goes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovQaSvNbWuI&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video</a> to answer your question!</p>
<p>Summed up incase you don't want to watch the video:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>we sweat each night which accounts for up to roughly 150g</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>we breath out a lot of C02 which accounts for about 100g if we breath in and out on average 7680 times.</p>
</li>
<li>We don't eat/drink therefor no calorie intake</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you enjoyed the dad joke at the end of the video.</p>
<p>Have a good day!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The weight went into the air. </p>
<p>You lose mass through dehydration (breath, sweat, etc), and the production of CO2 when you breath. </p>
<p>There is also a fluctuation of weight due to the positioning of the sun and moon, as well as where on the scale you stand. but these are very minor changes to your wight and most of what you are noticing is weight lost due to breathing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lL2e0rWvjKI" target="_blank">Veritasium</a> did a video on this. You lose weight in water, lost through urine excretion with less intake, sweat and water lost through respiration. </p>
<p>Then there's metabolism that converts sugar and O2 into CO2. So you're converting solid into gas, which gets expelled through expiration. Atmospheric air consists of 78.9% nitrogen, 20.95% oxygen, 0.93% argon and 0.04% carbon dioxide. Exhaled air consists of 78.04% nitrogen, ~16% oxygen, and 4% carbon dioxide. </p>
<p>So the weight of ambient air is (0.789 x 14.0067 + 0.2095 x 15.9994 +  0.0092 x 39.948 + 0.0004 x 44.01) grams / 22.4 liters. This comes to 0.655 grams per liter. The average tidal volume of one breath is around 500mL, so each breath of inhaled air weighs 0.328 grams.</p>
<p>The weight of exhaled air (now with more CO2) is (0.7804 x 14.0067 + 0.16 x 15.9994 + 0.0092 x 39.948 + 0.04 x 44.01) grams / 22.4 liters. This comes to 0.717 grams per liter and a weight of 0.359 grams per breath.</p>
<p>So you lose 0.328 - 0.359 = 0.031 grams per breath due to gas exchange and metabolism. The average breathing rate is between 12 - 20, so let's say 16 RPM. You sleep on average about 8 hours a night. So you're losing 8 x 60 x 16 x 0.031 = 238.1 grams simply through the difference in inhaled vs. exhaled air. That's about 0.52 pounds. So this isn't the entirety of weight lost, but it contributes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
