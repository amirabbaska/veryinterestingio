		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Women's mental health issues are taken far more seriously then men's. In addition, starting very young girls and boys are socialized differently. Girls are taught to try to get help as much as possible. Boys are taught to deal with stuff on their own and &quot;boys don't cry&quot;. So when it comes down to getting help for mental issues, men are more likely to just try to deal with it on their own (this is true for physical health issues too but that's beside the point). </p>
<p>Another thing you have to understand is the difference in severity of suicide attempts. A lot of people try to counter this by pointing out the fact that women attempt suicide more often, and that it's just the differing methods used by the genders that account for why men are more likely to be successful in their attempt (taking a bunch of pills or slitting your wrist in a bathtub is much less likely to kill you then shooting yourself in the head). But you have to understand that these differences aren't coincidental.</p>
<p>Before one commits suicide, they have a long path of depression first. A suicide attempt where one is actually trying to kill themselves means that person is farther down the path than someone who is just trying to get attention (taking a bunch of pills and then texting a bunch of your friends good bye). I'm not trying to make light of that sort of thing though, those people are still in serious need of help and they should have their problems taken completely seriously. I'm just saying that there is a difference between taking too many pills and jumping off a building. And I think I think this relates back to how women are more likely to try to get help. As one is going down the path towards suicide, women will be more likely to try to use these methods to get help when it starts to get bad where as men will just try to tough it out. Men will keep trucking until it gets so bad that they reach the point where they are no longer looking for help or trying to get better, thats when one will try a more successful suicide method.</p>
<p>At least that's how I see it. There's probably a lot of other factors as well but I feel like these are the main ones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The suicide attempt rate for women tends slightly higher than the rate for men, however females tend to attempt using less effective methods such as drug overdosing. </p>
<p>On the other hand, men tend to use more lethal techniques such as firearms, hanging, and carbon monoxide.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its complicated and I'm going to get into &quot;man secrets&quot; that may sound controversial but let me - yes a man who has experience with the suicide of 2 friends both suffering from this within the last 48 hours - try, because I'm trying to sort it out myself.</p>
<p>In the past men have traditionally - for right or wrong is out of scope - been told they had a role in society that was pretty rigid and included strict obligations and responsibilities that they HAD to do or risk failing in their male genders main tribal/societal role.</p>
<p>These roles (and some common phrases enforcing them in modern culture) are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provide for the family: &quot;bring home the bacon&quot;, &quot;pay the bills&quot;, &quot;hunt for dinner, breakfast, and lunch&quot;</li>
<li>Be strong emotionally and physically: &quot;Men don't cry.&quot;, &quot;Do you even lift?&quot;, &quot;Don't be a p*ssy.&quot;,&quot;don't be weak&quot;</li>
<li>Build an empire: &quot;A mans home is his castle&quot;, &quot;Get off my lawn&quot;, &quot;My roof, my rules&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>As culture expands and the economy puts more and more pressure on males to fulfill these gender specific obligations, many of them fail at it due to economic issues or just lack of the correct education (The education system is out of scope, but its failing a lot of people unfairly because it has different goals than the people going into it) as more and more families lack the role models to give them the tools that used to be passed on through family.  So these guys do what they can in spite of all of this, they try, They get a job, any job, but end up getting a job that doesn't pay the bills or allow them to buy a house and build that empire, or the degree they are in debt for doesn't let them get that job that lets them pay off the debt, etc. This leads to men simply feeling like they have failed in a way that means that something must be wrong with THEM. After all they did what they think is the right thing, they went to school ,got the degree, or whatever, thinking that was the one true way to do it.. and it didn't work out. They couldn't build that empire, they couldn't provide, So they blame themselves, they feel worthless.</p>
<p>Now under these same &quot;man rules&quot; talking to people about fears/worries is &quot;not allowed&quot; because the impression is that doing so would be a form of emotional or even physical weakness.  So guys don't talk about these things. Its taboo. So we either drink, work it out somehow, or kill ourselves like the guys funeral I am at now did.</p>
<p>And if we men choose to kill ourselves, one thing you have to understand is that the rules above for being a man STILL APPLY, if fact it could be said that as a man if you were going to kill yourself, these rules apply EVEN MORE due to societal pressure because its about how you die.. member the phrase &quot;Go out like a man&quot;? Its not just a phrase, its a reminder to men that our obligation to &quot;be a man&quot; and follow the rules doesn't end with our choice to kill ourselves.</p>
<p>And no man wants to be the guy who failed. At ANYTHING.  But to be the guy who failed to kill themselves correctly, to be the guy that broke the top three rules of manhood and ended up living after such an attempt, that's a really shameful emotion that every man I know would hate because it would effectively say &quot;you are so worthless, you couldn't even kill yourself correctly&quot; and by doing that they feel like they fail at the three points above so they do everything they can to get it right. Everything.</p>
<p>Worst case:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failed to kill self so now all life insurance etc gets pulled and thus, &quot;Failed to provide for family.&quot; gets broken.</li>
<li>People could say you didn't deal with the physical pain of killing yourself so did it incorrectly and failed at it and thus would be failing at &quot;be strong physically&quot; above. Men worry about getting made fun of in this way even if it sounds irrational, because they worry about their kids or kids of the family having that &quot;shame&quot;.</li>
<li>Failed due to lack of resources (Not a big enough empire, per above). As a result these attempts are often more successful because more planning and thought goes into them.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you look at suicide statistics you will find that men like to use guns more to kill themselves. The rules above are why. No pain, no messing up easily, and if done right it can look like an accident so the family is taken care of. This is not me saying guns are bad (I like guns), but they are effective at suicide when put to your head.</p>
<p>tldr; I'm at a funeral and the guy killed himself because it was his only way to not fail as a man according to our popular culture and societal rules that decree a man must build his empire, be strong, and provide, or he is a failure. Women traditionally have not had this role/requirement forced on them so they have less to fail at.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
