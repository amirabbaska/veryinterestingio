<li>
<p>What specifically differentiates genomic data vs typical data? More specifically, is genomic data not ergodic?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What similarities does reference based compression share with Slepian-Wolf (or Wyner-Ziv) coding? </p>
</li>
<li>Since there has been a large push towards machine learning, could you elaborate on the role you foresee information theory playing in the future machine learning?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>But what about all the SNPs, duplications, etc in intronic regions? Exons are well conserved and probably conducive to reference-based compression, however, introns in my view seem not, yet they play a big role in transcriptional control and are not nearly annotated as well as the exons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
