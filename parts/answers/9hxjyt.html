		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our stomach doesnâ€™t know the food is bad. Instead, the cause of the food spoilage is bacteria. When the bacteria contact the environment in the stomach the organisms break open and spill their cellular contents into the stomach. Those contents act as an irritant to the GI system, leading to nausea and contractions of the stomach and esophagus that lead to vomiting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We have a ridiculous amount of bacteria and sensors in our gut. Amazingly of the 100 trillion odd bacteria in our gut, our bodies can detect rogue bacteria pretty precisely. This triggers the orders to clear house.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm no expert, by any means. I've just been reading the book The Mind-Gut Connection. Fascinating stuff - do recommend. The gut is an extremely complicated thing and is much more integral with our other organs than we possible imagined a few decades ago. </p>
<p>Interesting fact: the bacteria in our gut (changed the above to gut instead of stomach, apparently the majority of the bacteria is in our large intestine. Also changed 300 to 100) has evolved with us over time and has learned to communicate with us through signaling molecules which communicate with the nervous system in our bodies, basically the same way drugs do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are unaware that our gastrointestinal tract is filled with neurons that act as what's known as our &quot;second brain.&quot; It can send chemical signals to the brain within a short period of time. A recent study (I don't know the source, it was on Reddit recently) suggested that it can also send nerve impulses through the Vagus nerve directly to the brain within milliseconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most foodborne diseases take at least 24 hours to produce an effective dose, unless it is fucking rancid, which if you eat, is clearly a net gain for the gene pool.</p>
<p>What normally happens is that you eat some contaminated food, but there is not enough pathogen to hurt you.  However the stomach is a wonderful place for something like salmonella to multiply and so it will.  It will continue to do so until it reaches an effective dose.  That's when the confusion of whether you should put your head or your arse over the toilet first.</p>
<p>If you take care of how you store your food, make sure you cook it thoroughly and eat it right away, the chances of contracting something reduces immensely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
