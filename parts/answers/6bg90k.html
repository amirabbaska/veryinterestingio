		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be better described as creaking rather than cracking. When a door creaks, the hinges aren't cracking, there's just resistance that builds up until friction can no longer stop the hinge from moving. The same applies to the beams in your house as some parts of the wood heat &amp; expand faster than others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends what you mean by hearing it crack. If you mean randomly with no movement, it's the heating and cooling causing expansion of the wood, which ends up pressing against another piece of wood that's tight until it &quot;pops&quot; slightly and juts to another position. Think how earthquakes happen on super small scale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming your house is relatively new, the timbers in your house are drying out and shrinking, but they shrink inconsistently and, yes, are actually forming new cracks. This is called checking. When these new cracks form, they can actually sound like gunshots. And timber frame builders expect this checking; it's nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Timbers dry fairly slowly, at a rate of about one inch of thickness per year, so a 10&quot; by 10&quot; timber will completely dry in about 5 years. If your house is older in years than half the thickness in inches of its biggest timber, this is probably not what you're hearing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you hear it on a regular basis, it could possibly be your piping. When piping is ran through beams/studs and not insulated they produce creaking noises. The really loud noises come from heating water lines and steam lines. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
