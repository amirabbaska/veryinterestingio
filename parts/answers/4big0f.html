<p>As a starting point, I can recommend <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1n6bo0/at_what_point_in_the_evolution_of_organisms_did/ccg0nvw" target="_blank">this incredibly thorough response</a> that /u/whatthefat provided a few years back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I already posted about this in another science thread about sleep... but the answer is similar: </p>
<p>The first thing is that &quot;sleep&quot; is a relatively subjective definition. For humans (and other relatively large organisms), we define sleep by behavioural states (e.g. laying down, less responsive to environmental stimuli etc). But we can often measure brain waves to quantify these changes.   </p>
<p>For other organisms, like the fruitfly, we have to use slightly different criteria. So for them, we measure response to being disturbed, and you find a circadian difference in responses. <a href="http://www.cscb.northwestern.edu/jcpdfs/hendricks00.pdf" target="_blank">It's referred as &quot;sleep-like state&quot; since, we can't know if it's sleep</a>. But it looks like it could be sleep.  </p>
<p>And since there has been circadian rhythms found in even single celled organisms, it's possible to for them to have 'sleep-like' states.   </p>
<p>The other thing about sleep, is that it isn't simply a state of &quot;rest&quot; (as some like to think of it). In large mammals it's actually a time for many process to occur.  So the real question is to time based events occur at any levels? And, as I stated earlier, even single celled organism have been shown to display this circadian rhythm.   And so it's <em>not</em>^2 hard to determine why timing things with respect to the earth's rotation would be a very useful function.   </p>
<p>As for the &quot;when&quot; I don't know what the answer is^1, and I've never heard anyone really clarify it (since fossil evidence can't easily show us circadian rhythm stuff).   </p>
<hr />
<p>^1 Although I obviously don't know everything (duh!), I do have extensive experience in both sleep &amp; circadian rhythm<br />
^2 Edit: missed this initially (i.e added 'not')</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>DISCLAIMER: I'm about to recommend a book that, though absolutely relevant to your question, I had no part in writing - I do not stand to profit whatsoever from this work. Also, the arguments made in this book, though well-researched and lucid, are not necessarily representative the <em>entire</em> sleep research community. Your question is the topic of ongoing research.</strong></p>
<p>I would recommend you read <a href="http://www.amazon.ca/The-Universal-Pastime-Sleep-Explained-ebook/dp/B00NT9O60O" target="_blank">this book</a> written by a University of Toronto sleep scientist. The book addresses this exact question, speaks to many of the points alluded to in /u/whatthefat's older response linked here, and is specifically written for lay audiences. </p>
<p>The TLDR of the author's argument is this: although there are many biological processes that may occur primarily or exclusively in sleep, this fact alone does not mean that sleep evolved <em>specifically</em> to fulfill any one of these processes. The difficult thing is dissecting which processes sleep <em>originally</em> evolved to perform, and which processes took advantage of the sleep state to occur. An explanation for sleep must apply universally to all organisms that sleep, regardless of the quality and quantity of sleep they have. The author examines some of the prevailing theories of sleep (including the energy conservation hypothesis alluded to in another comment), but provides reasons for why they are insufficient to describe <em>all</em> sleep across the animal kingdom. Instead, he makes the argument that the sleep functions to serve wakefulness; it is an opportunity for brains to adapt and adjust based on previous waking experiences to make the organism better-suited for subsequent waking experiences.</p>
<p>An interesting read that references a great number of major sleep research papers that you may find interesting to look at as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lower order organisms (e.g. planaria) will move more quickly in light than dark. They do not have eyes but can sense light in a very basic way. A reasonable theory is that moving quicker in lighter environments keeps them exposed less often.</p>
<p>It is not hard to see a gradual re-inforcing of this type of behaviour until sleep cycle would develop.</p>
<p>Another example would be torpor where (for example reptiles) will enter a torpid state as the temperature drops. Again it is not sleep but kinda sorta getting there. </p>
<p>I suspect that as you search for the most primitive form of sleep you will get into an argument about what is included in &quot;sleep&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
