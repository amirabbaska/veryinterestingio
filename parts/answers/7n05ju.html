The cilia in your windpipe are always doing a wave, so to speak, that pushes stuff up and out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As people have pointed out there is mucus to trap dust and whatnot and little waving hairs to push said mucus up to be swallowed/coughed up (the charmingly titled mucocilliary escalator). Of note those hairs die off if you're a smoker (so badness stays in you lungs) and grow back and work again once you stop, hence why a newly quit smoker may get one hell of a cough as they are clearing out a lot of built up debris.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What about in the sinus area how does it work. I use a saline rinse daily because I work in high dust environment. Any suggestions or tips. Yes I wear a dusk mask or respirator but only when I'm in direct contact with dust or product. still so much lingering in the air that it gets u of ur not wearing it 24/7.
What I work with is zinc and boric acid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
