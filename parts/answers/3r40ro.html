		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quite a bit of tardigrade survival comes not from any sort of resistance to temperature or pressure changes, i.e., no internal mechanism to defend against them, but through severe dehydration of the organism. There is very little water left in the cells of the creature, so there is almost no pressure gradient due to the semipermeable membranes of the cell.</p>
<p>It's not that difficult to resist the vacuum of space for a virtually solid object, especially, as alanmagid pointed out, an object that is coated in a nonpermeable substance like a dehydrated water bear.</p>
<p>This dehydration of the organism is also how tardigrades are able to survive extremes in temperature. The stasis that they go into is their main survival method, and when put under environmental pressures without first going into stasis, the creature has much less resiliency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Such organisms are called piezophilic. While tardigrade is not a true extremophile, it likely has similar evolutionary changes as piezophiles to withstand extreme conditions. Proteins in one of these organisms are found to contain fewer Proline and Glycine amino acid residues, which contribute to breaking and destabilization in alpha helices (secondary protein structure). The number of large, bulky amino acid residues such as tryptophan and tyrosine also decreases and there are more small amino acids, which allows better packing and increased stability.  Thermophiles (organisms that live in extremely high temperatures) are found to have a greater abundance of salt bridges, which stabilizes thermophilic enzymes. the high temperatures compensate the loss in entropy provided by salt bridges in mesophiles. <a href="http://www.horizonpress.com/jmmb/v/v1/v1n1/14.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.horizonpress.com/jmmb/v/v1/v1n1/14.pdf</a> <a href="http://www.hindawi.com/journals/archaea/2013/373275/" target="_blank">http://www.hindawi.com/journals/archaea/2013/373275/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What pressures do you have in mind? There are no pressure gradients with a hollow space. There internal surfaces become coated with a trehalose glass whose hydoxyl groups (-OH) subsitute for water in stabilizing proteins. Trehalose is a sugar. It is used to stabilize lyophilized protein medicines for reconstitution by addition of aqueous buffer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
