		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there are a few ways this question can be answered. The short answer is &quot;no&quot; but the long answer is &quot;not exactly.&quot;</p>
<p>Chloroplasts are plant organelles that can undergo dramatic changes as they develop from proplastids. When developed in the dark, proplastids develop into amyloplasts: chloroplast derivatives that stockpile starches in huge quantities. These amyloplasts are abundant in starchy roots known as <em>tubers</em> (think potatoes) which are (in simple terms) swollen roots that store energy. This is roughly analogous to fat reserves on an animal.</p>
<p>Very well-fertilized and watered plants have more succulent tissues than plants grown under more limited conditions. In gardens and fields, this can result in plants that are more susceptible to pathogens, as their tissue is rich in nutrients and water. This is roughly analogous to the propensity of the obese to suffer from health complications.</p>
<p>TL:DR: plants will not get &quot;fat&quot; but there are some aspects of plant physiology that could be considered similar to obesity/fat storage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can definitely overwater some of the columnar cacti and cause them to get too &quot;fat&quot; and split. Most cactus species will just rot and die if they get overwatered, but some will try to store it, get too fat, and split between the ribs. I've seen saguaro and Mexican fencepost do it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check out the &quot;desert rose&quot; growing on socotra island. Fattest plant I know (via starch storage, not oils)</p>
<p>Anyway, yeah, plants can store energy molecules like humans do (fats/oils) or via starches, which humans do not do to the same extent, except for glycogen storage in the liver (please prove me wrong if there are other examples of starch/sugar storage in humans). </p>
<p>I am aware of many plants that store extra starch--it seems to be the default energy storage mechanism. But considering that oil content can vary drastically between species, it seems oils can be used as energy storage (to extreme degrees) as well. Does anybody have any more information on examples of extreme oil storage that is not related to seed germination by fire (exploding plants)? The example I can think of is the coconut, a plant where the seed contains a huge amount of fat with which it can survive enormous time periods drifting at sea. Actually--most seeds contain a huge amount of oil by percentage weight. Specifically, are there any examples of extreme fat storage by plants that are NOT exclusive to the seed? Or even more, are there examples of plants wherein fat content varies in a large way between individuals of the same population?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can only reach a maximum genetic potential under ideal conditions. They cannot &quot;get fat&quot; but they can in essence &quot;be skinny.&quot; For instance, without nitrogen, they will be stunted and weak. Without phosphorus, they will not flower or fruit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
