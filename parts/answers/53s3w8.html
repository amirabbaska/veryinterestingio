		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't like how these responses are phrased, so let me take a stab at it:</p>
<p>Much in the same way that crawling, is different than walking, is different than jogging, is different than running, there are actually different types of sleep.  We call these sleep stages 1, 2, 3, and REM.  And, just like you can't go instantly from crawling to a full sprint, you must go through each sleep stage in order. </p>
<p>Now, REM sleep is very important and your body really needs to get there to have a successful sleep cycle, so As long as you don't wake up before your body can finish REM sleep, your doing well.  And if you are wondering, this usually takes between 90-110 minutes.  So if our sleep cycle is so short, why don't we wake up after 110 minutes?  Well, that's because one cycle usually isn't enough for our body to get everything done, so once it finishes one cycle, it starts over.  </p>
<p>Now, because this is part of being human, it is different for all people, all ages, and dependent on how tired you are, how sleep deprived you are, drugs, hormones, etc. But, as a general rule, adults spend about 20 minutes in REM sleep per cycle, and you aren't sleeping enough until you get about 1.5-2 hours of REM a night.  And if you do the math, that leads to the recommendation of about 8 hours of sleep a night.</p>
<hr />
<p>So, to answer your question:</p>
<p>Since you must first go through stages 1, 2, and 3 before you get to REM, unless you break up your sleep exactly between cycles, you probably won't get enough REM sleep.  But assuming you monitored your brain and had an alarm triggered excatly between stages, it still probably wouldn't be enough.  Why?</p>
<p>Because sleep is more complicated than that.  </p>
<p>The longer you sleep, the longer you spend in deep sleep and REM sleep.  So, your first sleep cycle of the night will actually spend longer in stage 1 and 2, and less in stage 3 and REM than your fourth cycle of the night.  So, if you wake up in the middle of your sleep, you probably aren't getting an average of 20 minutes REM per cycle.  </p>
<p>But that's not always the case.</p>
<p>If your body really needs REM sleep, you will spend less time in stages 1 and two and more in deep sleep and REM.  Though, as far as I know, this is not really healthy since all stages are important to mental health.  If you have ever had one of those mentally exhausting days where you immediately go to sleep, and are pretty much able to sleep through WW3, that's probably when your body has decided to hurry up to deep sleep (stage 3) and REM.  </p>
<p>But that's still not a full answer.</p>
<p>So 3 is pushing it, but is a 2 cycle sleep (biphasic sleep) good enough then?  Probably.  Funny enough, sleep is evolved to work with our environment, and our environment has changed much faster than we have evolved.  Namely, we now live in comfortable safe boxes where there is no worry that jaguars are going to eat us at night.  It is thought that our defense to this was to have short deep sleep cycles, so noises can wake us up, and to fully wake up for a while in the middle of the night.  Waking up in the night allowed humans to do whatever was necessary (sex, fire, scouting, night hunting, etc).  And really, this was the norm up for people until the 1900s.  People have written about using this time for sex and writing, because it was cooler outside, and because other people were asleep. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biphasic_and_polyphasic_sleep#Historical_norm" target="_blank">wiki link</a></p>
<p>TL;DR - 2 sleeps is probably fine, and there is active research to see if that may be better for our bodies.  But, as far as we know, long uninterrupted sleep is what you should be giving your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think anyone has given you a real answer to your question, so here it goes: We all need sleep, some more than others (this is typically broken down by age). If you fell asleep for one minute 60 separate times, your body wouldn't gain the same value as if you slept for a straight hour. This happens because there are different physiological responses to the chemicals released by your body and brain when you sleep for a certain amount of time. </p>
<p>There are four levels of sleep depending upon the length and quality. Deep sleep, which almost always happens if you sleep for 2+ hours is what enables a full REM cycle, and is healthiest for you with more of &quot;long-term benefits&quot;. The other standard is D2, which can occur as early as 20 minutes. This is why the power nap is effective. While you do not get a full REM cycle, your body and brain feel rejuvenated after D2 sleep.</p>
<p>To directly answer your question, the most effective way to sleep is to maximize REM cycles. If you break your sleep into shorter segments, the chances of completing REM cycles is smaller, but still possible. In this case power naps can get you through the day, but you may not be as healthy long term as someone consistently getting deep sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coming from the country of the &quot;siesta&quot; (Spain), first, let me say that no, almost no one takes a siesta or nap at midday, it is just another clich√©. But we do suffer of a split shift, a legacy from the post civil war Spain, so most people are able to go home for 2-3 hours at lunch time.</p>
<p>There are studies every now and then about how long should a nap or siesta be, and according to some held by la NASA and for exemple this one here: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886915003943" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886915003943</a>
The perfect siesta should be around 5-25 minutes, no more. My husband works a split shift 8-13 and 15-19 and never sleeps more than 15 minutes because otherwise he feels drowsy and even more tired.</p>
<p>But I guess it depends on each individual.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the old topics on the Askahistorian threads was about bi-modal sleep patterns in people of the 18th century. Apparently, before electric lighting, people would go to bed at nightfall, wake four hours later, stay awake for two hours doing various nighttime activities, then sleep four more hours. A few studies show some people doing this naturally, when external stimuli are removed. I don't think such a large gap in the middle would be the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
