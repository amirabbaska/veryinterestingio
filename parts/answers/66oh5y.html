		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Will you be focusing exclusively on the professional side of Einstein's life and his scientific acconplishments, or reaching out wider to educate people about his personal and political life? Most school kids can at least connect the name Einstein to relatovity and e=mc^2, as reductuonist as that is of his lifetime of breakthroughs, but far fewer people know some of the extremely interesting stories from the other side of his life. From marshalling the scientific community to support the Manhattan project despite his deep reservations about war, to penning <a href="https://monthlyreview.org/2009/05/01/why-socialism/" target="_blank">a brilliant defense of Socialism</a>, to declining the offer to be the first president of Israel due to his pacifism and devotion to human rights, Einstein lived a complete life in every sense of the word. He has been one of my biggest heroes since Inwas a kid, and knowing these stories made it much easier to remember that a human being accomplished these scientific feats, not the kind of genius demigod that our pop-cultural image of Einstein traditionally conjures</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just read the Walter Isaacson biography of Einstein. I had no clue that he left his wife and essentially abandoned his young kids to marry his own cousin. Then, he openly cheated on and embarrassed his second wife for the remainder of his life. </p>
<p>I see parallels with John Lennon in that Einstein is a celebrated public figure, whose personal life has been a bit whitewashed. One of his kids ended up in a mental institution, partly because of his world famous father completely ignoring him. </p>
<p>I'm in my 40's and through traditional news blurbs on Einstein never knew any of this. Why is it that this part of his character is forgotten? Should he be completely celebrated as a hero without acknowledging him as a whole? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
