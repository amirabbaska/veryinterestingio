		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need to output a lot of energy, more than you might realize, compared to walking a similar speed on flat ground.</p>
<p>When walking, it takes energy to get your body moving. But the only thing holding you back afterwards is inefficiency in moving your own bones/muscles. Think of how easy it is to get a bike moving on a flat surface, then glide without pedaling very much. Or how efficient trains are, which can maintain momentum instead of needing to start/stop wastefully. </p>
<p>Each stair you climb requires enough energy to move your body mass that distance <em>directly against the force of gravity</em>. There is no equivalent force <em>directly</em> opposing your movement while walking/jogging on a flat surface. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Stairs are a deceptive amount of work, especially if are a larger person.  You are lifting your entire body weight 8-10 feet upwards, using just one leg at a time.  That will usually put you into the anaerobic range, so even if you can run a mile, stairs still ming leave you a little out of breath.</p>
<p>There is also a psychological aspect.  When you work out, you expect to breath hard and sweat.  But when you are just walking around, you don't expect to tire like that, so it is more noticeable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said about stairs being a considerable amount of work... They're also a pretty specific and unique form of physical activity. Your body adapts quite specifically to the exercise you make it do. This is known as the SAID principle (Specific Adaptation to Imposed Demands), or more simply, 'specificity'.</p>
<p>It's the same reason that champion swimmers are not necessarily great runners and vice versa, and even why great sprinters tend not to be great long distance runners.</p>
<p>Your body gets good at the things you make it do. Start taking the stairs regularly and you'll find them less challenging over time.</p>
<p>If you already take the stairs regularly, then it's probably something else :D</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I gave up stairclimbing in one building because the ventilation was so poor, and a few (seriously fit) colleagues had done the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
