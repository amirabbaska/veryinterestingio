		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple ways to interpret probabilities. The way you're probably most familiar with is to consider them <em>relative frequencies</em>.</p>
<p>That means that if you have a fair coin (p = 1/2), you can say that in the limit as the number of flips goes to infinity, the fraction of results which give heads approaches 1/2.</p>
<p>But there is a sense in which probabilities represent your degree of <em>knowledge</em> or <em>belief</em> about the outcome of some experiment.</p>
<p>If I flip a coin and catch it in my hand so that nobody can see the result, there is a definite answer to the question &quot;Is the coin showing heads or tails?&quot;. In other words, it's either definitely showing heads or definitely showing tails.</p>
<p>But nobody knows which yet. The best anybody can possibly say (assuming a fair coin and nobody is cheating) is that there's a 50% chance that heads is showing and a 50% chance that tails is showing.</p>
<p>This represents a <em>lack of knowledge</em> on our part. So the answer <em>is</em> predetermined, but nobody knows it yet. So we still ascribe a probability of 1/2 for either case, because that's the best we can do given our current knowledge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Terminology/phrasing problem: There's a 50/50 chance of you <strong>guessing the ending of the GIF</strong>, which is different than the odds of the coin in the GIF ending up heads or tails. You could also flip a coin in a dark room and once it hits the floor, call it and turn the lights on. Same thing: The coin's &quot;decision&quot; has been made, but you still have to guess what that decision <strong>was</strong> (as opposed to what it <strong>will be</strong> as in a traditional coin flip scenario)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but with one caveat. The probability of the coin landing heads will depend on the distribution of gifs where the coin lands heads (which might not be 50-50). </p>
<p>Since we do not know the result of the flip ahead of time, then to us it is random - with probability given by the distribution of gifs where the coin lands heads. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In that case, it is YOU who are &quot;flipping&quot; , not the coin.</p>
<p>The answer is already determined, but you don't  know it.</p>
<p>(Assuming you have a perfect RNG brain) there is a 50% chance you will select the correct answer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
