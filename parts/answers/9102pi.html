		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm under the impression this is related to the amygdala. In your brain, the amygdala is related to most emotional processing. I'm pretty sure what happens is that there is a unique mapping between certain emotions processed in the amygdala and the parts of the brain related to physical and auditory expression. </p>
<p>To me, it seems that this mapping serves mostly the purpose of communication between  humans. This is biologically sensible since even before knowing a full verbal or symbolic language for expression, humans as babies have to find ways to express their feelings and necessities so that their parents can take care of them. This would be impossible without some form of connection between emotional and physical expression that doesn't have a linguistic barrier. I guess these traits remain useful into adulthood because spoken and written language are only capable of communicating so much information. Additionally, keep in mind that many of our primate ancestors had no language at all with vocal and physical variations of bodily expression being the only way to communicate with one another.</p>
<p>If you're asking why particular sounds are associated with particular emotions, that's difficult to answer. However, it's likely that we pick higher pitched sounds to express something involving happiness and excitation because it corresponds to the energy of the emotion and lower frequency sounds to evoke sadness and melancholy for the opposite reasons. Then, the loudness of the sound might be used to express the intensity of that particular emotion. This would be a sensible form of communicating emotions since each would (ideally) uniquely map to an emotion and it has a parallel to the actual physics of sound since higher frequency corresponds to more energy and amplitude (loudness) of sound corresponds to its intensity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hmm.  One thing I've noticed about the autistic persons I know is that often, the mood in their voices is flatter than in non-autistic persons. Not flat--just flatter. The more subtle moods can be much harder to detect.  Of course, less subtle moods like frustration can be pretty clear, especially when they're younger and less verbal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paul Ekman did a lot of research on faces during emotions. Some of the work goes into more than just the facial composition, but it centers on that. In essence, there are a few universal expressions, like joy and disgust, that look the same no matter what culture you're from. Highly recommend reading his books, but you can start with wiki: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ekman?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Ekman?wprov=sfla1</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the same way we learn to talk and pronounce words, we also learn the pitches and tones to talk with. The different pitches are a result of pronunciation. </p>
<p>For example, saying “She stole my money,” in a soft tone, it becomes a statement but if you say it in a more angry or aggressive way, it becomes an accusation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
