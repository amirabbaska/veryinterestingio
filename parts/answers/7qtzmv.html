		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately, we still don't know why blood types are genetically preserved. What we do know is that they extend well into the past (<a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/109/45/18493" target="_blank">http://www.pnas.org/content/109/45/18493</a>) perhaps even 10s of millions of years. There hasn't been any identified evolutionary advantage of any of the ABO blood types.</p>
<p>There is, however, a blood type called Duffy which seems to be protective against malaria. There are also tons of other blood types that are only discussed in medical/scientific spheres. Again, these cause issues sometimes with pregnancy or transfusions but don't have any identified advantage. It is possible (and this is pure speculation) that ABO and other provide some protection against an unidentified infectious agent (whether it still exists and we haven't identified which agent or it existed at one point in our prior evolution).</p>
<p>Edit: People are rightly pointing out that there doesn't have to be a &quot;purpose&quot; to evolution. This could just be a random mutation that ended up preserved. That's absolutely true; it's just nice if we can explain genetic variation by some conferred advantage, but like I explained none has been found for ABO. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While this doesn't answer your question, it is important to understand that evolution does not have a purpose.  Mutations do not happen because they can be beneficial.  Random mutations happen in individuals, then over time if the mutation is beneficial and propagated via offspring, the lineage with that trait may be more fit than individuals without that trait and slowly become more predominant.  A more accurate question would be &quot;Why did organisms evolve different blood types?&quot;  I'm not trying to be pedantic for the sake of pedantry, but I think maybe this will help you understand other's answers a little more clearly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is likely an inherent advantage of genetic variability (called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Queen_hypothesis" target="_blank">Red Queen Hypothesis</a>.)</p>
<p>If all humans had the same cell antigens (the &quot;flags&quot; that let the immune system differentiate between &quot;self&quot; and &quot;not-self&quot;), then a disease or parasite that managed to evolve human cell antigens would be able to fully bypass the immune system and kill us all.</p>
<p>But by all of us having different antigens (of which ABO and RhD antigens, the blood type markers, are some), a disease can't evolve a single &quot;disguise&quot; that works against everybody.  Thus, we're protected against that parasite strategy, not by the particular antigens we use, but by the mere fact that they're variable from person to person.  The very characteristics that let a parasite hide from one person's immune system give it away to others.</p>
<p>As for different ethnicities having different prevalence of types, in some cases it's due to environmental causes (e.g. antigens that convey malaria resistance are more common in peoples who lived in places where malaria was endemic), but in other cases it's likely due to genetic inertia -- i.e. ethnic groups tended to mate assortatively to each other (people mate with people who live near them, and until recently groups of humans weren't that mobile), so once a trait becomes dominant in a population it stays that way until some selection effect moves it.  Since blood type is pretty much neutral (which blood type you have has basically no effect on your survival chances), there's not much in the way of selection effects that can move it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is strong evidence that ABO blood groups influence health, especially with regard to cardiovascular health. Multiple studies have shown that blood group O <a href="https://doi.org/10.3109/10408363.2012.708647" target="_blank">have reduced risk of heart attack and stroke</a>. Moreover, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1155/2013/782941" target="_blank">ABO is the largest factor influencing the levels of a clotting protein called von Willebrand Factor (VWF), with group O individuals having VWF on the low end of the normal range</a>. This is beneficial in terms of heart attack and stroke risk, but when combined with other factors that predispose one to bleeding (such as a defective VWF gene or deficiencies in other clotting factors or platelet function) can be detrimental to health. </p>
<p>The ABO gene itself shows evidence of selection, and group O is most commonly caused by a single base pair deletion in exon 6 (261 delG), but other variants resulting in group O do exist, and their persistence in the population suggests some evolutionary advantage. The same can probably be said about group A vs B, but it's much less clear what that advantage might be. O vs non-O benefits have more data. On a side note, there are altered or weak versions of A that resemble O more than conventional group A in terms of VWF levels and cardiovascular risk. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution has no purpose; it is a word used to describe the collection of mutations that most of the time play out badly for an organism, and sometimes play out well enough to remain over time. Giraffes didn't grow long necks to reach the tall trees' leaves; only those that grew long necks could reach them and survive. Assuming purpose means you've got it backwards. </p>
<p>This doesn't answer your question, but I feel it is important for you to know that your question implies a false premise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
