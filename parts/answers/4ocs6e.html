		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My face is mildly fucked up from a cancer battle. I've lost my teeth, some bone in my mandible, and the right side of my face and neck is asymmetrical. I also have a scar that runs from behind my ear, down my neck, and onto my chest. The hair on my right side is thinner and grows less due to radiation. Overall I'm not like 'ogre' bad but you can immediately tell something bad happened to me.</p>
<p>First off, please don't waste a moment with pity or sorrow. I fought stg4 cancer and I'm glad to be here. I'll take what I can get, the alternatives are much worse. </p>
<p>Reactions to me are interesting. Children, especially young ones, are pretty open about it. Either they are actively repulsed or very interested. I get a lot of kids going &quot;What happened to you?&quot; while the parent looks horrified at their kid's faux pas lol. I just tell them I got sick in my neck but I'm better now. That does it for them and they lose interest. </p>
<p>Adults are another matter. It happens a LOT that people will see me and I notice a brief second of microexpression. They make a &quot;eww&quot; face but it's over very fast (hence the username). I'm convinced most have no idea they did it. Once societal conditioning kicks in they don't stare though it does happen that people will ask me about it. I get a lot of dismissal faces too. I think those people assume I'm a meth addict or something like that. Generally I try to dress nicely and it stops most of that. </p>
<p>Anyway my takeaway is that face is almost everything. It's the primary signal to convey health from person to person and if something is 'off' in someone's face then the reaction is very primal and requires intelligence to override. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a sign of genetic health and societal standing.</p>
<p>First there's symmetry. A general sign of health is a relatively symmetric face, with two eyes that sort of look like each other, a straight nose, and so on. Yes there absolutely are exceptions - we are also attracted to the novelty of someone with different coloured eyes, and Harrison Ford's crooked schnozz kind of adds to his roguish tough-guy charm. But in general, symmetric faces mean a greater chance of cute kids, which means a better breeding partner.</p>
<p>Then there's smoothness of skin, not too much or not too little hair that's in the right places, lack of redness in the eyes, even white teeth, cleanliness which means you're not just back from shoveling fertilizer, and so on. All of these things have been conditioned by what society thinks is attractive both from an appearance perspective and from a financial support-your-kids perspective, on top of our genetic basis for attraction. And that's why people with these features show up on Vogue and Maxim and GQ and so on.</p>
<p>Why the face? We wear clothes that usually cover our bodies, and we face people when we talk to them. This makes the face the most obvious and concentrated set of signals that might help assess attractiveness, and so it's there that we quite often assess someone as attractive or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the ELI5 is that the face is a quick 'summary' of a person's overall health. From the face you can tell a person's age, sex, and general health, confidence and current emotional state. </p>
<p>Studies also show that face of men and women who are very stressed are deemed less attractive than men and women who are less stressed. Being stressed releases stress hormones(cortisol), which over time shape the face differently. They did a study where they took a neutral male face and modified it to look like how he would if he had higher cortisol levels and women deemed it less attractive. Having high cortisol is associated with higher body fat%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human brain is exceptionally good at recognizing human faces, but not so good at being able to find distinct differences between two sets of legs, for example. One example for the face recognition is that you sometimes can envision a face on the front of a car, or a chair might have screws that make it look like a face too, but we don't often notice that inanimate objects look like knees or elbows.</p>
<p>Because we are so attuned to what a face looks like, we can also very quickly tell the differences between two faces, even if they are very small details. This makes it very apparent when some detail isn't how we prefer. With bodies however, the general shape of what we might find attractive will suffice, because we wouldn't really notice if it was slightly different somehow anyways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
