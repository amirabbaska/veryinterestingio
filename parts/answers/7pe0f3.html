<p>Long answer: Research is ongoing, and currently it appears it may be related to blood vessel constriction/dilation in the brain, but it could also be neurological. People who suffer from ocular migraines have an increased risk of stroke, so the blood vessel thing may be related in those cases; but that doesn't necessarily mean it's the same for all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current understanding is that there is an issue with blood vessels in the skull/face dilating in close proximity to nerves. These expanding blood vessels basically compress the nerve bundles and the mechanical stimulation causes them to fire/send electrical signals.  The nerve bundles can contain not only nerves that transmit pain signals but also other sensory nerves so when the nerve bundles are compressed you get a whole host of signals being transmitted. This leads to many different sensations being perceived by the brain and is why it results in the pain, visual disturbances etc etc... </p>
<p>The most recent developments in drug research for migraine treatment is focussing on something called CGRP (from memory standing for calcitonin gene receptor protein). This molecule is released by nerves in response to chemicals and physical damage and plays a role in neural inflammation and nerve repair.  So we may soon learn that the above explanation of the mechanism is way off and overly simplified like our understanding of most things in the body.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, one thing to definitely note is that the movements of stomach and intestines grind to a halt. This is a large reason why after the pain kicks in(they can still have effect if taken during auras) , pain killers don't work for most patients. Also, this is the reason people can feel nauseous, some patients report relief after vomiting and migraine treatments often involve prokinetic drugs. There are hypothesis that maybe migraines themselves have to do with gastrointestinal system due to this. Overall tho, not a lot we do know about them</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The protein - called calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) - causes blood vessels intertwined with nerve endings in the head to swell up.</p>
<p>But that is only a part of what we still don’t understand is happening to the body during migraines. As a sufferer with aura, I wish we knew. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR; magic --&gt; inflammation of brain's membrane envelope --&gt; cascade of events involving nerves --&gt; migraine.
Like others have said, no one knows exactly what happens during migraines. There is increasing evidence that it is not just blood vessels dilating/constricting (it doesn't always happen when there are migraines, and inducing dilation/constriction doesn't induce migraines). However, inflammation of the brain's membrane envelope does seem to be a likely cause (it occurs when migraines occur, and inducing inflammation induces migraines). This inflammation triggers a cascade of events that results in the migraine pain (thats why treating migraines earlier vs later, like taking NSAIDs, reduces the time length and pain severity of symptoms-- disrupt the beginning so the cascade of events doesn't take off). What causes the initial inflammation is not well understood. One theory about what causes initial inflammation: people who have migraine with aura (symptoms like nausea or flashing lights that precede migraines) experience something called Cortical Spreading Depression which is where the brain neurons experience abnormal energy spikes and drops that spreads across the brain over 30 minutes. It is thought that when these energy spikes/drops happen to the neurons, the neurons release chemicals that cause the inflammation that sets off the cascade leading to migraines. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
