<p>How did you record spatial information in such a challenging environment?</p>
<p>What was the sediment like? Most of the time you hear about south Africa its all about fossils in breccia. However, rising star seemed like the fossils were just loose in dirt, was that true?</p>
<p>What's the plan for dating?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that one of the leading hypotheses is that the remains were found in a burial chamber. If it isn't a burial chamber, why does the team think the remains are there? Is it possible that the individuals wandered into the cave over thousands of years and simply got lost - thus, eventually dying in the cave? The documentary that I watched shows how impossibly dark the cave is. It seems like it would be easy to get stuck in there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's ~18cm for the non-Imperial-fluent out there.</p>
<p>Which leads me to two questions:
1) how on Earth did you fit in there?  It doesn't look like I could fit my <em>leg</em> into a space that narrow, let alone my whole body (I measured).  Did you have to wear special clothing or other gear to minimize the additional width it would add your body and squeeze in there without damaging it?  Any other practical/technical aspects to making it work?</p>
<p>2) I haven't read the paper yet, but how did those hominids fit in there?  Did they crawl in there alive and die, or is this a case of bodies being washed in subsequently by water or mudflows?  I heard on the news that some of the remains were partially articulated, which sounds like they might have been a challenge to get into the space too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I live right in that location and know how rough that area can be.
