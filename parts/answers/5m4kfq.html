		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electrostatic field of a charge <em>has</em> or <em>carries</em> a certain amount of energy and information. It does not need a <em>constant input</em> of energy or information from the charge. It does not &quot;emanate&quot; or &quot;flow&quot; outwards from the charge.</p>
<p>It's like a dress, not a waterfall. You don't need to constantly produce fabric to have a dress on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rantonels explained the most important aspect of the answer, that fields are like a fabric and exist without need for constant input. However since you asked specifically about photons I'll try to explain a little bit about why the picture of a charged particle emitting photons is a bit misleading in this situation. </p>
<p>Photons are the &quot;force carrier&quot; particles of the electromagnetic force. However in that role the photons involved are virtual photons which means they only exist temporarily during the interaction of two charged particles. And in a sense these virtual particles should not be thought of as being a real physical picture of what is happening. They are really representations of terms in a large sum. The important thing is that this representation only makes sense in the context of the interaction of two or more charged particles. So in a situation with a single particle there is no sense in which virtual photons are being emitted.</p>
<p>Reading back over that answer I imagine that you will not be satisfied with this explanation. The question of &quot;Yes but how does the photon KNOW the context its in??&quot; still seems reasonable. Without diving into the math the best way I can summarize it is that the force carrying photons are only involved in situations where we assume from the start that there are multiple charged particles involved. They shouldnt be considered to be generating the field but as being generated by the field of interacting charges.</p>
<p>(Yes there are contributions to the self energy where a single particle emits and reabsorbs virtual photons by itself but I can think of absolutely no way to describe this that isnt extremely confusing)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the discussion: First I thought, hey, he's right, how is that possible. But I think your reasoning mixes electromagnetic fields with electromagnetic waves? Electromagnetic waves are in some way equivalent to photons flying around and indeed, energy is transported in this case.</p>
<p>But I think for electromagnetic fields you are only allowed to imagine virtual photons as is mentioned in other answers. And they don't inherently carry energy. &quot;Virtual&quot; is a heavy word here and one has to take this seriously. Maybe it's even better to not think of virtual particles and just think of the fabric metaphor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Charged particles <em>do</em> emit photons when accelerated though, right? Wouldn't that lead to a constant emission of photons from the interactions of an electron and a proton in a hydrogen atom?</p>
<p>I know something's missing there, but I'm not sure what it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
