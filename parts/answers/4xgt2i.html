		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that they can't, it's that most species naturally tend not to due to selective pressure against it. So that's the big issue with your question. No species &quot;can't&quot; be inbred.</p>
<p>1) Why do you assume that all inbred mice are healthy? Many strains have well-described health issues. In some cases, this is the desired result.</p>
<p>2) Inbreeding is problem primarily when you have recessive disorders caused by rare alleles. If the family you inbreed has &quot;lucky&quot; genetics, there may be no significant problems.</p>
<p>3) Any species can be inbred. The genetic risks of inbreeding are mainly due to a lack of diversity. As a species, it's not good to have little variation. &quot;Bad genes&quot; get sorted out through natural selection. Inbreeding doesn't tend to work out in nature a lot of times because there is a selective pressure against the recessive disease alleles that often accumulate. Add in an artificial selective pressure, like breeding mice in a lab (and keeping them alive and forcing them to breed, dammit!), and you can force inbreeding to work so long as the genetic variations you're enriching for don't include anything leading to sterility or death before reproductive age.</p>
<p>4) There are tons of inbred human populations all over the world. They might have increased risk of certain types of diseases, but they're not going to disappear tomorrow and for the most case you wouldn't identify them as exceptionally unhealthy people on initial inspection. There are also other pretty heavily inbred species, like Cheetahs or many breeds of dogs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientist who works with mice. While we typically do inbreed our mice in order to maintain certain gene lines that our useful to our research, we usually 'back cross' them to the a commercially acquired mouse that has the same background from a colony in order to keep things normal. Others in the thread have pointed out that there's a lack of recessives in their gene pool but I would say that the lack of observable consequences from inbreeding tend to come from our inability to observe those differences. Problems with inbreeding in people are intuitively noticeable by others but seeing problems with mice using canonical metrics is unlikely or easily balanced out by using a large cohort of animals. If a mouse line develops a deficit in working memory, for example, you won't notice unless that's specifically what you're testing for. TL/dr, it's easy to maintain the phenotypes you want but hard to notice unwanted consequences that are subtle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a mouse breeder, but something to keep in mind. In-breeding is only bad because they increase the risk of deleterious mutations with regards to fitness. Basically, a lot of mutations need both chromosomes to contain a copy of a mutated gene to have an effect ( this is what we call a recessive trait). If your family has a history of certain mutation, inbreeding increases the likelihood that both your mom and dad has this mutated gene as opposed to only one parent, which in this case could then be &quot;compensated&quot; by the presence of a normal gene from an unrelated family member. This is the main basis for the inbreeding problem, though it is obviously more complicated than that.</p>
<p>However, Lab mice are not your average double first cousins getting married. They have been carefully selected over hundreds of generations and those genes that would cause congenital effect were &quot;bred out&quot; of the population by the sheer fact that those carrying both copies of a bad gene probably won't even be born, let alone survive to adulthood and breed. </p>
<p>The major difference of course is, in a normal population we are actually concerned with death of children, health of the population and the suffering of the family. In lab mice, we can have Machiavellian ruthlessness with regards to just persisting through the deleterious effects of these mutations and then have both an inbred line in which most (not all) of the recessive lethal genes inherent to the line have long since bred out (a process known as purifying selection)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most animals have recessive genes that are damaging if you get two copies of the same one. However, if an animal is already inbred for many generations (like such a mouse) all the recessive genes have already been taken out of the gene pool ahead of time. Essentially, lab mice have been &quot;bred&quot; to be &quot;inbred&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a little late to the party, but I work in basically THE place that does inbred lab mice. It's a misconception to posit that move are somehow more receptive to inbreeding than other organisms. Like any other creature, inbreeding results in lack of genetic diversity and recessive traits that, when combined, cause problematic phenotypes (ie, genetic diseases). The thing is, we can breed a huge number of mice over these generations, and we only actually need 1 complete complement of genes that don't cause major disease. Once we achieve that genetic makeup on a breeding pair of mice, you have your inbred strain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
