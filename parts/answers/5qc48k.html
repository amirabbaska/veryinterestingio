		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The wall served two main purposes: stopping raids and providing warning of attacks. It wasn't really meant to hold back a large invading army.</p>
<p>It was pretty easy for nomads to raid Chinese farming villages in the north with just a few men. The wall was someone effective in deterring that because it's hard to destroy a wall with a very small force and it only takes a couple people on a wall to fight you off.</p>
<p>When it came to large invasions, the wall's main purpose was to provide warning and maybe slow invaders. In fact, the wall has signal towers all along it so that a warning could be sent to wherever it needed to go. The wall was too big to man with a large, permanent force that could repel an invading army, but an invading army would still either have to spend time getting through the wall or around the wall. While they were doing that, the warning signal would be making its way to the capital and/or army.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The original wall wasn't built to keep the Mongolians out - they wouldn't be united until 1200AD by Ghengis Khan. It was built mainly around 200BC to keep the XiongNu out. The XiongNu were Asiatic Huns and consisted of small tribes of nomadic peoples. Not too much is known about them because they didn't leave much archaeological evidence and it was very early in China's history, so Chinese historical accounts weren't too reliable.</p>
<p>The Great Wall is actually relatively close to Beijing - about 100km away (the part designed to protect Beijing and vicinity). From the Great Wall, you can see the skyscrapers of Beijing on an unpolluted day, and you could probably see signal fires on the Great Wall before modern light pollution and tall buildings got in the way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been to the Wall and the story they give is that the smoke signals from the towers were the best defense, as mentioned earlier.  Interestingly many locals will tell you that it was also built to deter evil spirits coming in from Mongolia as spirits naturally move upwards and so building a wall across the mountain tops would help to block that bad energy from entering China. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My totally uninformed opinion is that the Mongolians were know to be horse riding invaders.  Horses would be difficult to get over the wall, so it would work pretty well at repelling them in large numbers.  A ladder could get individuals over it, but if you're used to fighting on a horse you'll be at a disadvantage without your horse... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
