<p>It's a biological response to purge toxins from your stomach, if something smells rotten, it probably is rotten and should not have been eaten.</p>
<p>now we don't eat such things, but hundreds of thousands of years ago when the response evolved we might have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smell is our primal indication if something is fit to be eaten or contains too many toxins which would cause us harm prior to consumption. Vomiting is a reflex response to food that the body feels will cause us harm following consumption. The sense and reflex exist for the same purpose. A smell is an aerosol of the source (the smell of pizza is a very small part of the pizza floating through the air) and when it enters the body through the nose the same reflex reaction occurs as if it is in the stomach.</p>
<p>TLDR: The body will reject smells the same way it would reject food that is eaten.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, most things that smell that bad would be very bad to eat. The gag reflex stops us from eating things that could make us sick. Not sure about the exact mechanism</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
