		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Australia has a problem.  The ways that they generate electricity are fairly constant from moment to moment, but the demand for electricity is not. </p>
<p>While they have lots of resources and abilities to generate electricity, demands are far too spiky.  Meaning, during the hottest times of the day everyone is turning on their AC.  That uses up LOTS of electricity.  Most of South Austrians generation is done through wind power and that's a fairly constant generation, even overnight.  </p>
<p>So while on average demand is meeting supply, there's a problem of timing. Basically, there's lots of electricity at night time, when no one wants it and not enough at noon when everyone needs it.  This causes blackouts, and that's bad.</p>
<p>The solution here is to store the electricity for use later.  Generate it all day and store it in batteries so that they can draw down during the hot times. That is a battery farm.</p>
<p>It's really just a very large amount of batteries all in one place. Tesla recently has been building the world's largest battery factory (called the Gigafactory).  Batteries, funny enough, are one of the things in this world that we basically can't make enough of.  Batteries are in VERY high demand for everything from laptops, and cell phones, to electric cars.  </p>
<p>So using them for something like this battery factory was previously kind of a nonoption.  It simply took so many that it would be too expensive.  So electric utilities would look at other solutions like importing electricity from other districts or turning to non-renewable sources that can be easily turned on and off (like a coal plant).</p>
<p>Tesla's very large factory has recently started pumping out batteries and that is what's allowing Tesla to do things like sell battery storage products to the home consumer market (the Tesla power wall), sell inexpensive electric cars (like the Model 3) and do battery farm projects like this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

When you're using fossil fuels to generate power you can just crank up your generator (give it more fuel) to meet demand, but you can't do that with renewable energy. For example, if it's a really hot day and everyone turns on their AC you need more power, but if you're using wind turbines you can't just turn up the wind to meet the demand. With batteries, you can store energy when you're making more power than you need and use it when you're not making enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electricity isn't used consistently through the day. Everyone's at work through the middle of the day so there's not much electricity need in the suburbs, but high demand downtown. In the afternoon and evening everyone comes home and does their laundry, turns on their video game consoles and starts cooking dinner, whereas all the offices and factories cool down for the night. Power demand is weird and keeps moving around.</p>
<p>Electric generators would like to keep generating a constant amount of power, but the demand is always changing and complex systems are needed to make sure they're balanced. At night there's very little demand, so what do they do with the generators?</p>
<p>With coal plants and nuclear plants, generators are actually connected to enormous and <a href="http://s1.reutersmedia.net/resources/r/?m=02&amp;d=20110418&amp;t=2&amp;i=391605599&amp;w=780&amp;fh=&amp;fw=&amp;ll=&amp;pl=&amp;sq=&amp;r=img-2011-04-19T020936Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_India-564166-1" target="_blank">extremely heavy turbines</a> that work by steam pressure. They keep spinning because there's a lot of momentum, and just let the generator spin while disconnected. This is a way of storing extra power generated as <em>kinetic energy</em>.</p>
<p>It's a problem for Solar Panels and Wind Turbines that they can generate power at whatever time is convenient, but they have no or few heavy parts to use for storing extra power as kinetic energy. So in order to store the extra power generated, we have to build giant batteries.</p>
<p>Battery Farms are like much more efficient ways of connecting a whole bunch of car batteries to each other in a warehouse-like building. The batteries are better than the ones you'd find in your car, but the principle is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept of a battery farm is that you set up a building, or several filled with the relatively new &quot;house batteries&quot; that Tesla has created or their equivalent/better. What this does is it allows you to store power produced at off-peak hours that can be used to supplement the grid at peak hours. This also makes variable power production like wind or solar more viable for primary power production as you can store power from the day for nigh or cloudy days, or can store power from windy days for calm ones. </p>
<p>Building these is also a way to help increase the distance you can transmit power as you can put them at the drop off points and store up a larger charge for the next leg of transmission. This would not be extremely efficient, but it is better than not being able to transmit the long distance at all and could theoretically mean that you need fewer power plants. This means you could in theory build a lot of solar plants in say a desert and supply people far away from said desert. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's Analogous to water supply. We have enough water in a reservoir but getting it to you when you need it from the reservoir is difficult because you would need to turn a pump on and off depending on when people need it. To solve this instead of turning on and off the pumps we store the water high in the air. The energy to get it to you is ready there so the ability to get water to you is independent from demand fluctuations. </p>
<p>Same thing here. They have the energy but getting it to you when you need it is difficult due to timing and demand fluctuations. So they are trying to store energy in batteries as potential so it can be used whenever.</p>
<p>Electricity is more difficult that water, because the batteries are more expensive, and you lose energy when  you convert electrical to potential.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
