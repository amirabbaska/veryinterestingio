		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Food is fairly cheap to produce and the markup is pretty huge depending on the food. A bag of chips that costs 50 cents to make will sell for 2 bucks. That's a sweet margin. And it gives room for discount stores to cut prices and have sales, etc. </p>
<p>Additionally the price of food often fluctuates. The 2 dollar price is a good average that covers increases and decreases in potato costs if there's a bumper crop or famine. There is a theory for example that McDonald's times the return of the McRib with the ebb and flow of pork futures on the commodities market.</p>
<p>Video game consoles have much thinner margins. And the margins are consistent. Aluminum, plastic, and Lithium don't have bumper crops. Microsoft actually sold the first XBox at a loss because they had a longer term strategy of getting into the console market and putting an XBox in your living room as a sort of entertainment hub. Sony is the same way. Their goal isn't for you to buy their console, their goal is to get you to buy into their system. Sony has a stake in BluRay licensing which is why the PS3 was so gung ho on introducing BR discs.</p>
<p>Because these consoles use cutting edge tech, the process required to make them is slow and laborious and specialized. Over time it gets easier and faster and more automated which is why price drops occur later on.</p>
<p>Nintendo is not in the same game, they want their consoles to make profit. So that's why their consoles are cheaper and that's why their tech is a generation behind, because it's easier to make older tech.</p>
<p>In any case, the costs of making a PS4 don't fluctuate the way that potato chips do, and even then, there's not much room for sales.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my experience working retail electronics, most major game manufacturers have full on contracts with the distributors keeping their products at market prices.</p>
<p>Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft all had reps who would physically visit the store (Sony and Microsoft were rare but Nintendo was in the store almost weekly) to make sure products are being properly displayed, properly priced, fully stocked, and otherwise up to their standards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who has worked at a grocery store and an electronics store in the past, I'll take a crack at an answer. Prices for food are set by the actual seller of the product, in other words the grocery store itself. If you notice commercials for these products never list a price, just that you should totally buy their awesome product at your local grocery store.</p>
<p>Food products are purchased by grocery stores in varying quantities at varying prices. One grocery store may purchase 3 pallets of a specific cereal brand and as a result pay a certain price per unit, where another grocery store may actually buy in bulk and purchase a full truck, 26 pallets of just that one cereal brand for a discount and then use their own distribution center to deliver the goods to each of their locations. From that point, market value is different based on each neighborhood. A richer neighborhood is likely willing to pay a higher price, so the store will set a higher price where a poorer neighborhood is obviously not going to, and so the price will be lower. Competing stores are also taken into consideration and weekly price changes are made in order to try to be only a few cents lower on the product where they can still make a profit.</p>
<p>For video games consoles specifically this is entirely different. The console manufacturer sets the price of the console. You'll notice that advertisements for consoles always list the price. This is the advertised price they want the console to be regardless of which distributor you buy it from. Additionally, no distributor makes any profit off selling the console. Even the manufacturer (sony, microsoft, nintendo) usually does not make a profit on the console. In the above example about groceries, a store may buy cereal at $3 dollars a box, and sell it at $3.25 a box, but when it comes to consoles, The store buy's it at $399 and sells it at $399. Stores make zero profit off sales of consoles. Instead, they make quite a bit of profit off peripherals and the actual games. This is why you can sometimes find a deal on a specific game title at one store over another because it went on sale faster, or why there are so many competing 3rd party peripherals sitting right next to the first party peripherals. They make the store a profit and they want you to consider purchasing them. However, what good is purchasing peripherals if you don't have a console? This is why they agree to sell at the exact price they purchase them.</p>
<p>Anyway, that's long winded and I don't usually answer ELI5's but I thought &quot;hey I know this. why not give it a shot?&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apart from the other answers, it also has to do with the buyers: people check different prices before buyers ne a console, but won't go to three different stores to buy peanut butter, jam and bread each for the lowest price. </p>
<p>So the stores can afford to vary in food prices, but not console prices. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
