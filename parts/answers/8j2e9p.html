		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spinning fan blades are in contact with the air more than stationary fan blades. More contact with the air = more opportunity to collect dust. The dust doesn’t fall off the blade from spinning like you would think. Dust is inherently electrically charged too I believe, so that might have something to do with it not sliding off the fan blades when spinning initially. Friction creates a static charge between the dust and the fan blades as they spin, building up more and more dust. Moisture. Van see Waal’s forces too. </p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>: <em>I</em> <em>see</em> my error: Van der Waals*
<strong>Edit</strong>: u/ultrab1ue added: Blasius boundary layer, which says the speed of the fluid (air) closest to the surface (fan blade) doesn't move with respect to the surface. (The dust on the hood of your car also doesn't get blown off despite driving 90mph.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All these replies about static are good but a lot of the reason is that the top of the fan blade experiences drop in air pressure. This low pressure zone forces the dust onto the blade. The greatest pressure difference is right behind the leading edge, this is where you'll find the most dust. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>dust particles in the air stick to the blades when they collide with the blades. moisture in the air helps this along. then once dust is stuck, more dust sticker easier because dust tends to like to stick to other dust easier than to the smooth surface of the blade</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dust is slightly electrically charged, the fans are in constant contact with moving air which builds up static electricity due to frictional forces between the blades and air. The dust is then attracted to the fan! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
