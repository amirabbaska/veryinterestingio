<p>from the article: Who put the bomp in the bomp bah bomp bah bomp? Who put the -stan in Afghanistan? I don’t know about the former, but we can thank the Proto-Indo-Europeans for the latter. These folks spoke the Proto-Indo-European language (PIE), a prehistoric Eurasian language that linguists have reconstructed.</p>
<p>The PIE root, st?-, or “stand,” found its way into many words in the language’s various descendants. The Russian -stan means “settlement,” and other Slavic languages use it to mean “apartment” or “state.” In English, the root was borrowed to make “stand,” “state,” “stay” and other words. The ancient Indo-Iranian peoples -- descendants of Proto-Indo-Europeans who moved east and south from the Eurasian steppe - used it to mean “place” or “place of.” It’s this meaning that’s used for the names of the modern -stan countries, which got it through linguistic descent (Urdu and Pashto, the respective official languages of Pakistan and Afghanistan, both descend from the Indo-Iranian language), or by adopting it (the former Soviet -stan countries have historically been mostly ethnically Turkic and speak languages from the Turkic family).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Pakistan is a bit of an odd one out because there isn't a people called the &quot;Paks.&quot; Pakistan is an acronym for <strong>P</strong>unjab, <strong>A</strong>fghania, <strong>K</strong>ashmir, <strong>S</strong>indh, and Balochi<strong>stan</strong>, which are the regions that make up Pakistan. &quot;Pak&quot; also happens to be Pashto for &quot;pure,&quot; so it works out nicely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Stan&quot; means land. It is related to the Latin word &quot;state&quot;, the German word for city, &quot;Stadt&quot; and the English suffix -stead, found in words like &quot;homestead&quot; and &quot;farmstead&quot; and in place names like &quot;Hampstead&quot; and &quot;Stansted&quot;. </p>
<p>The word &quot;stan&quot; can be traced back to the same original root word as the European &quot;state/stadt/stead&quot; varieties, because all these words derive from the same ancient theorised language, Proto Indo-European.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bonus fun tidbit:</p>
<p>China is actually called Zhong Guo, meaning middle kingdom or middle country. Nobody really knows where the word China comes from and there is no Chinese word for &quot;China&quot;, rather the nation is called Zhonghua which has been changed to mean Chinese Nation in modern times. </p>
<p>In Chinese, most names of other countries end in Guo. So America is Meiguo, Germany is Deguo, England is Yingguo. Other countries have Mandarin phonetic pronunciations, like Italy being Yi da li. Then there are countries that were named in Chinese or have a common base language, and have actual Chinese names, like Japan being Riben or Wo, Korea being Hanguo, and Vietnam being Yuenan.</p>
<p>So where did the word China come from? Nobody knows. There's a lot of guesses, but no one knows for sure why a dozen different kingdoms, states, and ethnic groups that had individual named were all called China. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
