		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You forget the bad things, basically. Time erases small imperfections and leaves only ideas, things that you can romanticize and over value. I don't have any scientific links for you, but it is well documented in literature:</p>
<p>&quot;Things always seem fairer when we look back at them, and it is out of that inaccessible tower of the past that Longing leans and beckons.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Something that's worth understanding is people will always find ways to be miserable.  Imagine if you were really rich but had no friends and felt empty in life.  Then you lost everything and you're living on the streets.  You will look back on your days of being rich and think &quot;how was I so miserable, I'd give up a limb to have those problems again&quot;.  You never really have perspective on things until they're gone.</p>
<p>It's also easy to look back on the past because typically the problems you've faced are ones you've dealt with.  Like not being able to talk to members of the opposite sex in highschool, or not being able to manage your time well in college.  It's easy to forget how hard it was to learn to do the things you're good at now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was actually just looking through pictures of me and my girlfriend on her old camera from 2009. At the time I felt so isolated and depressed, and constantly had thoughts about how much I hated myself, and yet looking back at those moments I noticed that I looked really good, and was doing interesting things. </p>
<p>Sometimes with hindsight we can gain perspective on an event. Maybe you cried all day at a fair because you dropped your ice-cream cone as a kid, but looking back you realize that the day was also very magical and fun. Maybe you had acne in High School and obsessed about it at the time, but looking back you realize that you were surrounded by friends and were learning new things every day. </p>
<p>There are things that I look back on and am glad that they are not happening now: like the time I had a psychotic episode. It was stressful and painful and not very fun. Nostalgia can only go so far, but at least getting older and wiser helps with putting negative events into context, and can also make minor annoyances not seem as bad. </p>
<p>Overall I would say that memories seem better when you can appreciate the good things about an event, particularly because people can often get swayed by little negative things that won't matter in a year, or even a month.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With my first child, I found out in the last few hours that she was breech, and the doctors orders were that I couldn't have any meds because it would jeopardize my baby's birth. (This was in the 1970's). It hurt like hell, screwed up my plumbing from there forward, and I wouldn't change a thing. I also kind of had a rocky marriage, but we wound up having 3 amazing children together, so I'm glad I stayed with him. It's funny, I was tired after Thanksgiving yesterday, and I got home and took a nap. I dreamed that I caught him being unfaithful to me, but he died 12 years ago. I'm grateful for what I have, but after 12 years I still love him and get pissed at him. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Valuable moments are like oxygen. When you have a sufficient supply of them around, you don't even think about a desire for them.</p>
<p>When you have a shortage of emotional moments, then you really cherish the emotional moments you have had before.</p>
<p>So it's supply-and-demand equation, just like oxygen or water, which you never think about when you have it presently, but yearn for when you lack it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
