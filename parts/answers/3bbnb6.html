		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like the difference between a beach ball and a balloon, both the same size when filled with air. You deflate the balloon and it fits in your pocket, but the beach ball will still be big.</p>
<p>It's about elasticity and how much spongy erectile tissue there is, which varies across people. The spongy tissue has lots of space to fill with blood and expand/contract in size, and the higher the ratio of this tissue to other types, the more you're a grower rather than a show-er.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bio major here- So for all men, the inner portion of the penis is made up of hollow spaces that resemble sponges. For guy A, his sponges, when flaccid, are compact. Thus his penis is only 2 inches. Guy B has not so compact sponges, leading to his 6 inch flaccid guy. Now, both penises are soft, because the sponges are not pressurized. So when an erection occurs, blood flows in and pressurizes these spaces. For A, this both extends and hardens his penis as his spaces expand to their full size. For B, this only hardens his penis, as the spaces are already at size. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an anatomist but the entire organ is a vascular sponge. It's basically a hydraulic sponge which begins soft and low pressure, then the pressure builds up until it has nowhere else to go, and at that point it's inflated and the pressure provides a tension which makes it stiff. </p>
<p>Now some sponges are short and round and when they pressurize the sponge gets longer and thicker, and other sponges are long and thin, and when they pressurize they only get thicker. </p>
<p>One of the factors is going to be the internal structure. There are structures inside that do not stretch very much, and help provide support, like a fibrous collagen latticework. Those structures, along with the urethra do not really change size or length, and that is why most pills, exercises, and other get big quick schemes fail. When there is no pressure, these structures are under less tension and may shorten the length of the organ somewhat. This will also depend a bit on temperature. </p>
<p>Since the whole operation runs on blood, and blood carries heat, and hot blood cools when exposed to a high surface area outside of the core of the body, both the penis and testes have a built in kind of temperature control. The warmer the person is and the warmer the air, the more they want to be away from that body heat to maintain their temperature. The cooler the outside air and the cooler the person, the more they want to contract and be closer to the body in order to maintain that temperature. </p>
<p>When someone is short or long when relaxed, will vary quite a bit because of temperature. Anybody who's ever tried to write their name in the snow has probably run into this problem. Vaso constriction can rob you of your ahem, manhood. </p>
<p>Now this fibrous material can be damaged. This ranges from light damage like what a suction pump might cause, burst blood vessels, swelling outside of normal blood flow, and this can swell making a temporary difference in size, but also making it tender or painful. Then there are total structure failures with discoloration, extensive swelling, and sometimes priapism (an erection that doesn't go away). Medical attention is usually required in situations like that. Remember, it's a delicate latticework of collagen and blood vessels so it can be very dangerous to be injured there. </p>
<p>If you're worried about what other guys are packing just remember these fun facts. </p>
<p>Human beings have the largest size relative to the rest of their body size in nature. There isn't really a genetic reason for this as even if it were much smaller it would still do the job. It's believed that because humans place importance on this, and because we walk upright, kind of letting everyone see what we have (when we didn't have clothes), people preferentially chose to reproduce with larger males and over time we ended up the kings of the animal kingdom from the belt down. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, women are more put off by lack of confidence, than they are by a males size. However, since self conscious men may feel inadequate they may be less confident. It's a self fulfilling prophecy. You think you are lacking something, you feel inadequate about it, and you act less confident. If on the other hand a person says 'welp, this is what nature gave me' and they don't worry too much about it, they may be more confident, and therefor more attractive. </p>
<p>To put it another way, stop thinking about other guys dicks and while you're at it stop worrying about your own. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I dont know if someone already answered this question so Ill do it anyway. It wont be a ELI5 though ...</p>
<p>There are two different types of penises. Blood penis and flesh penis. Please look up &quot;Allens rule&quot; now. Its similar here. Its important to have much mass in relation to the bodys surface when you live in a cold area. That way you can save energy because you dont lose that much heat. But when this moment arrives where you have to make a woman happy, you need a site which is big enough. As a result your penis has less flesh but more elasticity that means it can hold up more blood.</p>
<p>Penises of men in warm areas work the opposite way. In warm areas you have to lose heat as fast as possible. Thats why the penis has more flesh, so that it has more volume than surface. And yeah, it is a reason why Africans usually have a bigger penis than Europeans.</p>

<p>Please excuse my bad english. I just realized that I got many downvotes in previous comments because of failed grammar and word choice. If I said something wrong,  please feel free to correct me.
