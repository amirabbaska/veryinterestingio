		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't stretch as far back as other examples here, but the site of Homer's Troy has been identified with some confidence. The settlement dates back to around 3000BC but it's believed the setting for Homer's story was around 1300BC. </p>
<p>The site was discovered by Heinrich Schliemann in the 1860s-70s. One cache of treasure which he found was named 'Priam's Treasure' and he even photographed his wife wearing the 'Jewels of Helen' - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priam%27s_Treasure#/media/File:Sophia_schliemann_treasure.jpg" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priam%27s_Treasure#/media/File:Sophia_schliemann_treasure.jpg</a>.</p>
<p>It's thought this treasure actually dates quite a bit further back than Homer's tale.</p>
<p>For me the idea of discovering clues from the tales of Homer and classical historians and piecing them together to find to true site of Troy is very cool. Gotta try that some day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For North America there is a section of a book titled Skull Wars by David Hurst Thomas. He talks about a 7,400 year old oral story that survived to the 1800s when an American soldier wrote it down. I'll lift the passage which starts on page 249.</p>
<p><em>Chief Lalek begins the Klamath story like this: &quot;A long time ago, so long that you cannot count it the white man ran wild in the woods and my people lived in rock-built houses. In that time, long ago, before the stars fell, the spirits of the earth and the sky, the spirits of the sea and the mountains, often came and talked with my people...&quot; Lalek then described the spirits living inside Mount Mazama and its sister mountain, Mount Shasta. The two massive peaks had openings that led to a lower world through which the spirits could pass. The Chief of the Below-World loved a Klamath chief's daughter, Loha, and demanded that she marry him. When this amorous overture was rebuked, the result did not sit well with the spirit, who threatened total destruction of the people as revenge. &quot;Raging and thundering,&quot; the story went, &quot;he rushed up through the opening and stood on top of his mountain,&quot; terrorizing the people below.</em></p>
<p><em>At this point, the spirit of Mount Shasta intervened as a cloud appeared over the peak of Shasta, and the two mountains engaged in a horrible combat: &quot;Red-hot rocks as large as hills hurled through the skies. Burning ashes fell like rain. The chief of the Below-World (Mazama) spewed fire from its mouth. Like an ocean of flame it devoured the forests on the mountains and in the valleys. On and on the Curse of Fire swept until it reached the homes of the people. Fleeing in terror before it, the people found refuge in the waters of Klamath Lake.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>The Klamaths then decided that someone should be sacrificed to calm the chaos. Two medicine men climbed Mount Mazama and jumped into the caldera: &quot;Once more the mountains shook. This time the Chief of the Below-World was driven into his home and the top of the mountain fell upon him. When the morning sun arose, the high mountain was gone... for many years, rain fell in torrents and filled the great hole that was made when the mountain fell...&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Chief Lalek ended his story this way: &quot;Now you understand why my people never visit the lake. Down through the ages we have this story. From father to son has come the warning, &quot;look not upon the place... for it means death or everlasting sorrow.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>Deloria emphasizes the parallels between the pre-1865 Klamath account-recorded decades before the first scientist explored Crater Lake-and the modern geological explanation, which dates only to the 1920s. In both, Mount Mazama was destroyed in a catastrophic explosion, characterized by superheated avalanches, a massive cloud of volcanic dust, the dramatic collapse of the peak into the belly of the mountain, and the formation of a new deepwater lake atop the truncated mountain.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
