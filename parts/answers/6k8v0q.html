		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because neurologically, being asleep and being unconscious are two different things.</p>
<p>When you're sleeping, you're not unconscious, you're in a <em>different state of consciousness</em>. You're still responsive and somewhat aware of your surroundings. It's why a loud noise or being shaken can wake you up, or how sounds around you can make their way into your dreams. While you may not be aware of it, while you're asleep you're still processing sensory input.</p>
<p>When you're anesthetized for surgery, you're not in an altered state of consciousness, you're fully unconscious. Your brain isn't processing sensory input or recording memories.</p>
<p>Essentially, when you're asleep, you just remember the time you spent asleep differently. When you're unconscious, you don't remember the time at all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The reason it &quot;feels&quot; different is because anesthesia is like inducing a coma, manually. Your body is unconscious, therefore not creating memories or thinking at all. </p>
<p>Sleep is more like your body resting/repairing or kind-of finalizing your entire day.  </p>
<p>Again, not a professional, but just what I've heard/read.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
