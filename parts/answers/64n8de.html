		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some really nice &quot;textbook&quot; examples by which gravity affects waves in an atmosphere... </p>
<p>Acoustic (sound) waves at very low frequencies behave differently in an atmosphere with gravity. As the frequency get very low, their wavelengths become too long relative to the scales at which density decreases with altitude, and they thus approach a &quot;cut-off&quot; frequency (corresponding to ~4 minute period in Earth's atmosphere below ~100 km altitude). This is a direct consequence of gravity and the resulting exponential decrease of density with altitude that occurs in an atmosphere. </p>
<p>Disturbances to the atmosphere at lower frequencies than the acoustic cut-off frequency will tend to result in &quot;buoyant&quot; fluid motion instead of compressions (in particular, at frequencies below the &quot;Brunt-Väisälä&quot; frequency - which is a natural frequency at which oscillations in the fluid occur due to the disturbances of the balance between buoyancy and gravity). At these very, very low frequencies (&gt;5 minute periods at most altitudes &lt;100 km), atmospheric &quot;internal gravity waves&quot; form as a direct result of the interplay between buoyant and gravitational forces. These are analogous to oceanic internal waves, within the fluid; note that the ocean waves we are more familiar with are those at the surface, aka &quot;surface gravity waves&quot;. </p>
<p>So, yes, many classical waves are a direct result of the force of gravity upon a fluid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That would depend on the effect gravity is having on the medium. As far as I am aware a sound wave will only travel relative to the medium, so if gravity is moving the medium, it will move the sound waves with it.</p>
<p>The net movement of the air around you is not up or down; the force of gravity is balanced by atmospheric pressure. So in that sense the medium is stationary and the sound of your voice will not fall over distance, it will only decrease in volume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I hijack a seat on this plane and ask a very remotely related question? </p>
<p>If there is no air-resistant in the vacuum of space, would it an arrow travel at the same speed as a cube if launched with the same amount of force?</p>
<p>Thank you, I'll fall off this plane now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
