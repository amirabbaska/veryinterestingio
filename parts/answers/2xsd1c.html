		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Braille user here, lets see how much I can answer without being too techincal.</p>
<p>Basically, /u/SamMcgeesAshes/ they tried it once. it was cost-prohibitative to translate books (the blind school Braille himself went to had only three books done that way) and it took too long to read, because each letter had to be traced.</p>
<p>Braille, as we know it now, is a 6-dot (2x3) system, however a 9-dot (3x3) was proposed by some General whose name I forgot who wanted to communicate with his soldiers in the dark, but 9 dots are hard to read with just one finger. The basic principle of Braille is that every character should be read with one touch, which also rules out the &quot;actual letter&quot; approach even with modern laser-cutting, 3D-printing technology, because to be legible to fast touch (when you're reading Braille, it is already slower than sighted people, speed matters) the letter itself would have to be twice the size of a Braille cell, and then you'd need to pan over it with your fingers.</p>
<p>(explanation: b and p, 6 and 9, a &amp; e, u &amp; n, sometimes v &amp; y; they blend together if written too small.)</p>
<p>Also, 6 dots are a lot eaiser to produce by hand. Back before Braille &quot;typewriters&quot; were around, people used a special frame and stylus to hand-poke dots in paper (I tried it, it takes long!) Carving out lettters...too much time.</p>
<p>TL;DR: They tried it, it didn't work -- dots are more effecient to produce and to read.</p>
<p>Hope that helps, but do tell me if I skpped anything!</p>
<p>ADDENDUM: I also thought it prudent to mention that Braille pretty-much thrives on contractions; we have contractions from the ridiculous like shorthand for 'ea' and 'be', to things like 'able' (though that's phased out recently). 'also' is abbreviated &quot;al', and 'understand' can be done shorted to the shorthand for &quot;under&quot; + &quot;st&quot; + &quot;and&quot;. </p>
<p>However, Braille is fairly awful for all other things, and we can't use things like a11y as the syntax is too hard.
At least its &quot;something&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That was the old system, before braille. </p>
<p>Braille was specifically designed because the old system was near impossible to read for blind people. The similarities between letters like G Q O C were a massive annoyance, and placed a limit on how fast you could actually read. </p>
<p>In contrast, the easily distinguished individual dots were a huge improvement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Braille used an already existing method of &quot;blind communication&quot;, which was used during times of war to silently pass messages around. For example soldiers being held capture in a dark room. They would use paper to &quot;imprint&quot; codes into the paper and pass it to their comrades. That way they were able to communicate in the dark.</p>
<p>Sauce: &quot;The Code&quot; (its a book about the origin of computers and how other forms of codes, other than program codes, have already existed years before... just like the Braille code or the Morse code)</p>
<p>Oh btw. contrary to what most people think: Braille was not born blind, he got blind through an accident while playing with rusty tools from his dad.</p>
<p>Also here is the wikipedia to the &quot;night writing&quot; code that was used in the military: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_writing" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_writing</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blind person here. When a letter is &quot;bumped out&quot; on a page, you need to trace your finger around the letter in order to determine what it is.</p>
<p>Braille is designed to be felt, and each character can be read in a swipe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Braille has contractions. These are combinations of letters like &quot;er&quot; and &quot;ion&quot;. These make reading much faster, and obviously aren't present in visually-read alphabets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because most of them would feel the same. In my Neuroanatomy class we were shown this <a href="http://imgur.com/duJXtFc" target="_blank">diagramm.</a>Â´</p>
<p>A test person was asked to feel a bumped out letter size 1cm x 1cm and guess which letter it was. Stuff like B and D or Q and O feel almost the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
