		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turn it off, you will use less power. Thermodynamics tells us that heat loss is proportional to temperature difference, so if you let your house warm up the heat from outside enters more slowly. Essentially the product of time and temperature difference is your cooling energy.</p>
<p>There is a minor subtlety with maintenance and life cycle, your AC unit may not be designed for continuous duty, so long cool down cycles could be hard on it. Not sure if that is the case in your unit, seems like a bad way to design anything but it could be.</p>
<p>Edit: one non-thermodynamic factor is humidity and mold, which will be different at a constant temperature vs a cycling temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turning it off would be more energy efficient. The reason why this is, is that running your A/C at a cooler temp doesn't necessarily use &quot;more power&quot;. As an example, suppose you have an 1100w microwave. That microwave will on average, always use 1100w no matter if you're cooking for 10 seconds or 5 minutes. If you cook for 1 hour, you will have used 1.1 kWh. If you multiply that by 24 you will have the kilowatt per day, supposing you ran it for 24 hours. Multiply that by 1/4th of the year, 91 days, and you'd have used ~2049kWh of round the clock microwaving (Many home owners use between 3,000kWh and 20,000kWh when yearly home electrical use is totaled). The same concept applies to your A/C (can usually use 500w to &gt;2000w (2kWh)). So, your A/C will just run longer because your thermostat will be trying to keep your house at that temp. Depending on the placement of your thermostat, it may be in an abnormally warmer part of your house and just be unable to detect the temperature properly. Meanwhile, all the bed rooms may be a comfortable or colder temp.</p>
<p>Not to sell a product, but getting something like a smart thermostat would probably help a lot. They are a step up from a normal thermostat in that you can control some of them via your phone. You could leave the house at your usual time, A/C off, and then if you remember, can turn it on via phone before you're expected to come home so that your house will be chilled a little bit when you get there. Some of them have really robust means of scheduling them but anytime you don't have to run your A/C, you'd be more efficient than just running it all the time at a consistent temperature. You would save more money by turning it off when possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you're paying a lot for A/C it may be a good idea to look into reducing your electrical bill by replacing it with a solar bill or see if there are more efficient AC* units.</p>
<p>Final Edit: Clarity.      </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For what you describe, assuming an apartment or small home, it is more efficient and safe on the equipment to turn it off through the day.  Be sure you close the blinds or curtains to help keep it from warming too much during the day. Buy a programmable thermostat so it can cool your home only when you are there, and only down to the temperatures you need. Good devices ($50 range) can calculate how early to start cooling when you return home and run for multiple cooling cycles so it can minimize both cost and wear on the equipment.  </p>
<p>(No need for the very expensive learning-style devices unless you are truly incompetent at following on-screen instructions, although they seem to make neat toys for people who have money for them. Programming when you're up and about isn't hard. )</p>
<p>For an outdoor temperature of 85F -- which really is not very hot outside -- there is only a small temperature drop needed. Blocking light through windows and double-checking the insulation and weather seals will be your biggest help both for efficiency and cost. Assuming you closed the blinds and curtains during the day the weather you describe your home is unlikely to hit high temperatures, likely never hitting the same 85F you see outdoors. You're probably only going to cool the home 5F or so.  </p>
<p>In the general case it is a more complex answer, and it depends on the type of equipment, the difference between indoor temperature ranges and the outdoor temperature. It depends on the volume of air, a 30000 cubic foot larger home is quite different from an 7000 cubic foot apartment. It depends on how ducts are situated, if they are whole-home or zoned. </p>
<p>There are some newer systems designed to run more continuously with slower fan speeds, and there are higher capacity HVAC systems for bigger volumes and large homes, but neither sound like your setup.  Also zoned systems can require less power, but they're uncommon.  Most homes are set up for whole-home cooling, so if the room opens up to the main area the duct vents and doors should remain open to prevent frosty-cold vents with hot rooms, or inconsistent temps between rooms.</p>
<p>Most AC units work well at cooling for a block of time but not continuous duty. Running for extended times has hazards like the lines freezing up which can lead to expensive repairs, but that mostly happens for bigger temperature drops or high volumes of air to be cooled, or when there is a small temperature differential with the outside air.  Efficient systems will run for five or ten minutes, long enough to get the refrigerant flowing in a strong pattern through the various systems to deliver cold air to the blower, and the blower will take that very cold air and blow it powerfully through the entire home. Then they'll shut off before the systems start to overheat or before any of the lines approach freezing temperatures. </p>
<p>But really, most of the mid-grade or better programmable systems have all the brains to work this stuff out. You can tell it you're out for the day, and return at 6:00 PM, and it will sort everything out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything in your home is at a certain temperature. When you turn off your AC, not just the air warms and gains humidity, but also all of your building materials, finishes, and furniture.  In order to recool your home, the heat energy and humidity has to be removed from all of this mass as well as the air. </p>
<p>If you live in a wood framed structure, temperature and humidity are going to shrink and swell the skeleton of the building. This causes problems with Sheetrock, door swelling and not shutting correctly, window frames may even move and slightly break seals. This ruins the efficiency of the structure. Your HVAC system is just one part of the entire dwelling. It prevents nail pops, creaking floors, mold or mildew, and improves air quality. Turning the AC up a few degrees while you are away is not detrimental, but off will have a negative effect on all of the other systems in the structure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually depends on the type of system and the time frames involved.</p>
<p>For example, constant speed compressors use the same energy (roughly) whenever they are on.  So the energy savings is roughly a straight-line extrapolation over the time spent away from home.</p>
<p>The savings are even better if the refrigeration system uses a hot-gas-bypass to match load--this essentially false-loads a system when at part load instead of turning it off and on again to match load.  It's more comfortable, and easier on the compressor (which hates to be cycled on and off) but uses WAY more energy since any time the compressor is active, it uses full power, even if it is only putting out partial cooling.  You basically increase the hours on of your system with this type of control, so your power usage ramps up.</p>
<p>With a variable speed compressor (often found in the newer ductless split systems), however, the energy used is roughly proportional to the <strong>cube</strong> of the speed.  So, in other words, at part load, there is a very significant decrease in energy usage.  With these types of systems, it is possible that leaving the unit running to maintain temperature instead of turning it off when away, and then forcing it to run at full speed on your return home to pull the house down to temperature again will actually save energy. </p>
<p>Again, this all depends on how long you're away.  If you are away for a long time, obviously there are savings no matter what type of system you use.  No system runs more efficiently than one that is off.  But with variable speed systems, the interval at which it makes sense to turn down the thermostat is much longer than with a constant speed system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
