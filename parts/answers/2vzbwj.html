		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Celestial velocities may be huge, but at least for orbits in the galaxy they top out at hundreds of kilometers per second. Since the speed of light is about 300,000 km/s, the stars' velocities relative to us introduce only a very very very miniscule change in the passage of time. </p>
<p>The amount of time dilation is proportional to the Lorentz factor, 1/sqrt(1-v^(2)/c^(2)). Even for an object traveling at 10% of the speed of light relative to us, this means that the time dilation we see for that object is only about a 0.5% change.</p>
<p>To clarify: in any object's own reference frame, time passes at a normal rate. It's just that when objects are moving at high speeds relative to each other, e.g. trains moving past each other, a passenger in one train will look at the clock on the other train and see it ticking slower than the clock on her own train, and vice versa. This goes both ways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I have to wonder why it it would matter. If I were standing on another planet in another galaxy with a different rate of time, wouldn't I experience it in the environment? Wouldn't I be subject to the same laws and it would feel like normal time? The only way it could make a difference would be if you were to travel there AND BACK... or you know... faceTime home. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a case in which the general relativistic time dilation becomes interesting in a practical sense that we might actually care about relatively(ha!) soon.</p>
<p>If we set up a permanent colony on Mars, their clocks will run slightly faster than ours.</p>
<p>If we want to keep Earth Time and Mars Time synced to the same &quot;Unix Time&quot;, then our colony there will have to periodically add &quot;leap <del>anti-</del>seconds&quot;. I did the math on this once, and I seem to recall this would be needed every 10 to 100 years or so.</p>
<p><del>In practice, this would probably just be a case of Mars <strong>not</strong> adding a leap second on some of the occasions where the Earth time-keeping agencies do add them.</del></p>
<p>Actually, that's backwards. Mars would need <em>additional</em> leap seconds to cover up their &quot;fast clocks&quot; and let Earth &quot;catch up.&quot; But I think the &quot;every 10 to 100 years&quot; part is correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
