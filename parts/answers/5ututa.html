		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really. A lot what you're tasting is actually the changing in flavor of the oils as they pick of contaminants, and the loss of the strongest and most aromatic flavor notes which are composed of very volatile molecules. In short, coffee just doesn't last long, even as a bean. Once you brew it, the clock is really ticking. </p>
<p>Ice coffee is then solution, because the cold mutes the bitter notes and you end up with something closer to a milder version of the original. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Coffee tastes different when it's been sitting out for a while because compounds in it become oxidized from exposure to the air and because the high temperature (for hot coffee anyway) accelerates chemical reactions which ultimately affect the flavor. There are other factors that affect staling of coffee but the big ones are oxidation and temperature. These chemical reactions can't (realistically) be reversed so you wont ever get the freshness back, and by reheating old coffee you'll only increase the rate of chemical reactions which lead to it being stale in the first place. If you kept brewed coffee somewhere with no oxygen and at a low temperature then you could reheat it later and it would probably taste fresh. Once you pour coffee into a mug and it's exposed to the air and ambient temperature then it's just a matter of time before it becomes stale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We make coffee with a chemex Pyrex maker along with the suggested filters. The thicker paper filters out more of the compounds that make the coffee bitter. I reheat it all the time and it tastes nearly as good as fresh brewed. I really recommend this method of brewing. I like that it's all glass -- no plastic to leach plasticizers... and the coffee is so good. Not as easy as an auto drip system... but worth it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We used to brew our coffee, then turn off the heater, letting the temperature drop to room temperature.  It stayed fresh tasting to the end of the pot. For food safety, we started refrigerating our brew, microwaving to drinking temp.... no waste.</p>
<p>We now cold-brew for even better tasting coffee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
