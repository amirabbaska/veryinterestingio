		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbonated water loses the mixed CO2 in direct relationship with the amount of surface area the liquid has at any given point in time. Fountain drinks have the benefit of having been immediately carbonated by the fountain (since that's what a fountain does - carbonates water and mixes with syrup to produce a drink), and at most fountains the amount of injected CO2 is pretty high to make up for the fact that a ton of it is lost on impact (i.e. the drink from the fountain hitting the bottom of the cup). </p>
<p>Most canned/bottled drinks aren't carbonated as much because carbonation increases the pressure inside the container, and if you add too much carbonation the can or bottle will explode when you shake it (worse than it does normally).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The inside of a fountain cup is smooth due to being coated in wax, and you usually add ice to it to keep it cool, keeping the CO2 in solution longer.</p>
<p>Glasses usually have some leftover minerals from the water you used to wash them unless you use a dishwasher and rinse agent, this gives the CO2 a way to fall out of solution, solo cups have a lot of ridges which also give the CO2 a way to fall out of solution.</p>
<p>Also, unless you refridgerate your soda it's warmer so the CO2 comes out of solution faster.</p>
<p>Finally, when I worked at Wendy's in high school we were told to tilt the cup when pouring soda, it loses less fizz that way.  You can keep your soda fizzier, longer, at home by doing the same thing.</p>
<p>So tips for keeping your canned beverages more fizzy:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Keep it cold</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a smooth glass that was washed in a dishwasher with rinse agent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tilt the glass when pouring it out.</p>
</li>
<li>Keep it cold</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sidenote on how to keep a bottle of coke fizzy:  </p>
<p>The best was to keep a bottle fizzy is to use a siphon head instead of the normal cap after the first use. Because air can be compressed, if you shake the bottle the CO2 comes out but only as many as it can, if the bottle is filled with coke (which cannot be compressed) then there is much less air to compress. Each time you open the bottle this compressed air/co2 mix gets released, and replaced by regular non compressed air. Later even if you put the cap on, CO2 would be &quot;leaking&quot; from the coke, compressing the air again, but this time there is less coke, and more air to compress. If you'd use a syphon, each time you get some coke out from the bottle only the volume of the coke would get replaced by air and only that amount would need to get compressed again. It'd still lose carbonation but much less.  </p>
<p>^(Also first time I tried to solve this was by compressing the bottle and putting back the cap like that. Because then it would have much less air. But then the CO2 had the entire volume of the bottle to itself to fill because the bottle just got it's shape back from the pressure inside the bottle. It was a stupid idea.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
