		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These effects underlie the specific chemical reactions that take place in your neural cells. There are specific processes with enzyme catalyzation, for example, that rely on quantum effects. </p>
<p>However, if you are asking about &quot;larger scale&quot; quantum phenomena, especially with respect to consciousness, etc., that is currently unknown, and there are various ideas floating around about those possibilities. </p>
<p>That being said, a really interesting example of quantum phenomena underlying a <em>very</em> important feature of biology and ecology on our planet is photosynthesis, which cannot occur without some specific &quot;quantum phenomena&quot;. I'm hazy on the details as this came out a few years ago, but it has to do with how photon energy is captured and transmitted through part of the molecular chain that allows for the absorption (and subsequent conversion into chemical energy) of sunlight. This process underlies the majority of the energy storage and accumulation in our entire ecological system and food chain...! I'll try and find a source but I'm on my phone. </p>
<p>Edit: here's a quick link, but there are better sources with more details of course.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other have noted, such effects are important for regulating the dynamics of proteins that regulate neuron function (like ion channels). Because it takes thousands of proteins to affect cellular activity, these effects average out. So it is very unlikely that quantum effects directly influence thoughts/actions - like the kooky ideas of 'quantum consciousness' that crop up every few years.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think what OP basically wants to know is if macroscopic neural behavior is freed from being completely deterministic by quantum effects. Every neuron has some threshold where it will either fire or not. If there is sufficient quantum noise and a neuron is close enough to that threshold, it may be impossible to predict if/when it will fire. If this happens often enough in the brain, since that neuron will fire off to maybe 10,000 other neurons, this could possibly make the large scale activity of the brain non-deterministic to some degree. It depends on how often, if ever, some kind of quantum randomness determines if a neuron fires or not when it is close to that threshold.</p>
<p>I would assume that if you were able to connect a neuron to a computer that controls its inputs and reads its output, and given random inputs it's able to guess it's output to a high enough degree of accuracy you could prove that quantum effects have no significant large scale effect on brain activity.</p>
<p>I think the answer is basically, no one knows for sure yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone asked this question during a Neil Degrasse Tyson talk. He responded that basically -- people often like to add the word &quot;quantum&quot; to things they wish were spiritual. It's an attempt to reintroduce hocus-pocus into the measurable universe. But that no, quantum effects have nothing more to do with a person being consciousness than they do with a rock being a rock. Both exhibit equal amounts of quantum effects at the subatomic scale. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a quantum hypothesis for sense of smell that has some support from the neuroscience community. By no means is it the dominant view. </p>
<p>Here's a quick comparison between the quantum and non-quantum hypotheses. </p>
<p>We smell things like farts when little shit particles enter our nostril and interact with our smell receptors. The dominant view is that this interaction is best understood at the molecular level with a lock-and-key type mechanism. Our smell receptors are little lock-shaped molecules floating on cell membrane (our smell cell's membrane) and the shit particles look like little keys that only fit into certain locks (smell receptors) if they have the right shape. So we smell a fart when the shit particle unlocks the fart smell reaction.</p>
<p>That's the non-quantum, molecular view of how we smell. The quantum view is that it's not a lock and key mechanism that depends on the molecular shape. It's sensing infrared molecular vibrations through quantum tunneling. This is a distinctly quantum mechanism that can't be explain by the lock and key mechanism. </p>
<p>You can put the two explanations to the test with the following experiment. Offer people two versions of the same shit particle and see if they can distinguish between them. The particles have the same shape, but differ in the atomic isotopes used to construct them. The different isotopes would confer different vibrational frequencies to the shit particle without changing its shape. </p>
<p>There is evidence that animals can tell the difference between isotopes, but the studies have their flaws. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
