		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top answers are kinda missing the point, in my opinion.  The state that you describe is a meditative, daydream state.  All of your attention is fully absorbed in your imaginative thoughts.  You are so deeply meditating in these thoughts that you stop processing your visual and auditory surroundings, to a degree.  Often you'll come out of the meditation to realize you're staring vacantly at nothing in particular, as your attention shifts back to your surroundings.  </p>
<p>I always have felt these meditative moments feel awesome.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually wrote a psychophysiology paper on this in undergrad.</p>
<p>It's called &quot;flow state&quot;. It happens when you &quot;space out&quot;, when you're driving somewhere familiar without consciously thinking about it until you're at your destination, or if you're an actor and go on stage for a scene and come off stage with barely any memory of consciously remembering lines. It has to do with your mind and body's recall and how much conscious thought your need to devote to either movement or decision making. </p>
<p>During flow state, your heart rate lowers, your blood pressure goes down, and your serotonin production is boosted. Even though it's a mental experience, it's quite good for your overall health. </p>
<p>Edit: grammar. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Boredom might spark creativity because a restless mind hungers for stimulation. Maybe traversing an expanse of tedium creates a sort of cognitive forward motion. “Boredom becomes a seeking state,” says Texas A&amp;M University psychologist Heather Lench. “What you’re doing now is not satisfying. So you’re seeking, you’re engaged.” A bored mind moves into a “daydreaming” state, says Sandi Mann, the psychologist at the University of Central Lancashire who ran the experiment with the cups. Parents will tell you that kids with “nothing to do” will eventually invent some weird, fun game to play—with a cardboard box, a light switch, whatever. Philosophers have intuited this for centuries; Kierkegaard described boredom as a prequel to creation: “The gods were bored; therefore they created human beings.”&gt; </p>

<p>tdlr: you're bored and your mind is wandering for something,a task, an interest to do or think about. It becomes creative in filling the nothingness or boredom you're facing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised none of the top comments mention the DMN. Default Mode Network is an attempts at explaining this daydream <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC140943/" target="_blank">state</a>. Basically your brain can be compared to going into a sleep mode of sorts. It is believed that this mode is also correlated to mental illnesses like <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0091102" target="_blank">depression</a>,  and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22578721" target="_blank">schizophrenia</a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25075275" target="_blank">anxiety</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a good ELI5 analogy is to compare it to a computer running a complex process and becoming unresponsive: so much resource has been allocated to processing whatever the task is that it has to reduce the performance / response of less important tasks - such as graphics processing - and the screen will freeze up. That's similar to what's happening when you space out and daydream: your brain is so busy working through whatever it is you're thinking about that it moves resource away from processing live vision and allocates it to the task in hand, so you may not notice what you're actually looking at. You might get snapped out of it because something moves in your line of sight or someone calls your name, and your brain switches you back to reality to check it out as that has now become more important. </p>
<p>As an aside, I agree with the other comments that this is a super awesome trait to have, if a little annoying / weird for people around you. I'm a highly visual learner so spend a large amount of time daydreaming while I construct problems in my head, which usually means I know more or less exactly how to solve them afterwards without having to do much physical trial and error. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
