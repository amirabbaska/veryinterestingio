		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insulins fucked it up.</p>
<p>Your body needs glucose for energy. Everything you eat is broken down into glucose.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Foods like &quot;sugary&quot; foods, starch or very simple carbohydrates like rice, bread, pasta, etc, are digested very fast and thus, broken down and turned into glucose very fast.</p>
</li>
<li>Now, when you eat lots of those foods, lots of glucose goes into your blood very fast.</li>
</ol>
<p>And your pancrea produce little guys (hormones) called insulins who push that glucose into your cells.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When lots of glucose goes into your blood very fast, your organ pancrea freaks out and is like &quot;OMFG! Too much glucose in the blood. Too much glucose wandering around in the blood = poison!! Guys!!, Insulins!!, go go go!!! Go push them into the muscle cells and fat cells to properly store them.&quot; and then Pancrea produce lots of fucking insulins. May be even too much insulins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those lots of little fuckers called insulines push all the glucose from your blood into the cells.</p>
</li>
<li>Then, very low level of glucose in your blood. So, your body thinks &quot;Hey, my blood needs glucose. I need sugar(glucose). Feed me.&quot;</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably too late to the answer party. But you're probably not actually hungry. The insulin answers are sort of right, but your body is very, very good at controlling glucose levels unless you're diabetic. It will have some fairly large swings after binge eating but by morning it should be mostly stabilized and your body has stored a lot of the calories (and used some of them). You're probably dehydrated. A lot of people can't differentiate properly between feelings of hunger and feelings of thirst (a lot of the time anyway). Combine not drinking for however many hours you were asleep, digestion itself requires energy and water. On top of that, glucose being forced into cells pulls water with them because now there's more stuff inside the cells and they want to keep the concentration of that stuff about the same as before. So try having a glass of water in the morning after binge eating, give it 30 minutes and you should feel mostly better.</p>
<p>Edit: binge eating, not binge drinking. Though both apply sort of</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We tend to think of hunger as an indicator that our stomach is empty but this is not how hunger works. Hunger is controlled by hormones and there is a psychological component. Whether you eat a lot or a little before bed, your body will have digested it all within 8 hours.  </p>
<p>The first hunger hormone is ghrelin which comes in waves. If you eat 3 meals a day every day, you will get 3 waves of ghrelin around those meal times. If you skip a meal you do not continue to get hungrier, but the hunger will go away (even though your stomach is still empty). If you fast for a few days, hunger can go away altogether. </p>
<p>In your scenario, I think it is more about triggering a larger surge in ghrelin than it has to do with insulin. </p>
<p>The body is good at regulating blood sugar and crashes are not as common as people make them out to be (this is a serious medical condition). Plus if you ate lots of carbs that means your glycogen stores are full and instead of blood sugar going low the body would just tap into these stores.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you've eaten.</p>
<p>When you eat a meal at bedtime, particularly one rich in sugars and other simple carbohydrates, you generate an insulin surge from your pancreas. Upon retiring, this insulin begins pushing glucose into your cells, a process that continues as you sleep. During the night, a continual drop in your blood glucose stimulates the release of counter-regulatory hormones, leading to stimulation of your appetite centers. Unless you get up in the middle of the night to satisfy your appetite, you will be hungry upon arising in the morning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What is happening blood sugar levels rebound from being way too high, temporarily putting you in a 'starving' state with regards to blood sugar. This is called <a href="http://www.diabetes.co.uk/reactive-hypoglycemia.html" target="_blank">reactive hypoglycemia</a>. Basically you are throwing your body's hormones way out of line. The large amount of insulin your body has to produce to deal with the amount of food you ate can lead to <a href="https://www.endocrineweb.com/conditions/type-2-diabetes/type-2-diabetes-causes" target="_blank">type 2 diabetes</a>, where your body becomes less responsive to insulin and you have to poke yourself with needles for pretty much the rest of your life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
