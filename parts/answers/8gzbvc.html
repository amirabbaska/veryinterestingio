This is worked out between the two sides, with a judge making final decisions, before the trial. </p>
<p>Asking/answering questions, <em>not</em> answering questions, or going through the process of arguing about which questions can be answered and to what extent, could all reveal info that was agreed shouldnâ€™t enter the courtroom. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>The trend of jurors asking questions while a trial is going on is becoming more popular in courtrooms across the country. There are some states that now require it by law, including Arizona, Colorado, and Indiana.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article identifies some pros and cons of the idea. There seems to be some merit in allowing it, but some identified risks as well. Implementing it seems like it depends on having a very controlled and informed process under the oversight of the judge and with input from lawyers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the most frustrating parts about testifying, knowing if counsel would just ask the right question that I had knowledge that could change a trial.  But you're only allowed to answer questions asked, you can't lead into potentially relevant information if it doesn't directly answer the question asked by either the prosecution or defense.</p>
<p>I had a murder trial and they spent so much time on what the difference between the prosecution using Pacific time and the defense arguing that it happened UTC-8 (as shown in my report) that neither asked what time the suspect took a picture (with gps tagging turned on) that placed him at the murder scene.  </p>
<p>And for anyone who doesn't know Pacific Standard Time is the exact same thing as UTC-8 which is also the same as GMT-8.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
