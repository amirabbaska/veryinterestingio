		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes! We used to have a herd of horses and three of them were siblings. Now one of the scariest things to a horse is a tarp, naturally we hung one up in a tree near their food, so they would get used to it. One little chestnut figured out that the others were terrified of the tarp, so he yanked it of the tree and chased his brothers and sisters with it for his amusement. Now I don’t have a super scientific answer, but tell me that isn’t a prank.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lots of animals play hide and seek for fun. That is, they hide the truth of their presence and jokingly, or mockingly, attack another (a sort of prank ambushing of another). And they enjoy being hunted or found as well which shows they enjoy being prank attacked too. So yeah, their pranks lack the cleverness that we normally attribute to pranks but they do prank and enjoy it. I guess pranks can only be just clever enough to trick the victim at first but not so clever that the victim can't figure it out (if the victim can't figure out it's a prank then the prank kind of fails as the victim won't play along, and they might even become violent.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a fundamental thing about animal cognition called <em>theory of mind</em>.  The fundamental thing is that animals don't have it, and humans over ~3.5 yrs do.  Theory of mind is your recognition that other people also have minds, and the contents of other peoples' minds is different from yours.</p>
<p>So, a 2-year-old cannot lie to you.  Nor can a dog.  People frequently anthropromorphize and maintain that their dog &quot;acted all guilty after we came home to trash everywhere&quot;, etc.  This is wrong - the dog doesn't think &quot;oh no, my owners will be mad at me&quot;.  He does, however, think &quot;the present circumstances (yummy trash meal all over, people coming home) has previously preceeded something bad for me&quot; - that is, he may be classically conditioned with relation to having trash all around.  But to be clear, he's not imagining what you must think, and he is not &quot;guilty&quot;.</p>
<p>With the young humans, the experiment goes like this:  They have the kid and mommy sit in a room and meet the nice experimenter, and then mommy leaves the room and the experimenter and the child hide something in the room.  Before mommy comes back, the experimenter asks, &quot;Where will mommy look for the ball?&quot;  The kids below about 3.5 yrs will just immediately point at wherever it is, because they can't differentiate between the contents of their mind and that of anyone else's mind - &quot;if I know something, mommy must know it, too&quot;.  They just can't intentionally deceive you.</p>
<p>Well, this issue is relevant to pranks.  To prank someone means to fool them in some way - presumably if they were aware of the prank in advance, they would avoid it, so some degree of deception is involved.  That means an animal won't be able to put together the concept of the prank, and so isn't &quot;pranking&quot; anyone, because they're not attempting to deceive you.  They might do things that impact you, and some people might anthropromorphize that and call it a &quot;prank&quot;, but it's not a prank in the sense of an adult human pranking another human.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
