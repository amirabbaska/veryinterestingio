		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes there is mucus in the sinuses that drains to the bed-side cavity.  When it fills up our body gives us a signal to flip over and let it drain to the other cavity. This is not always obvious like a runny nose but more internal to your system.</p>
<p>Sometimes what feels comfortable for a bit puts unwanted pressure on ligaments or muscles after a while and our body tells us to roll over before we become stiff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The true reason is that you blood vessels cannot stay open and flowing correctly if there is pressure over them. So you must roll at least once every two hours to avoid a pressure ulcer in the areas in contact with the bed. This is a standard hospital procedure. Our body does it way earlier while sleeping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Out of consideration for clinical sleeping disorders, most of the time your body is responding to a process called 'homeostasis' where your body wants to maintain balance. This can take form as a response to several preemptive symptoms like: muscle relief due to spasming, cramping, temperature regulation, and other contributing factors (including stress, medication and diet).</p>
<p>Also, your circadian rhythm, or the cycle in which your body operates to maintain homeostasis, may be off due to different situations. Some situations can include heavy / lack of exercise, postponing your normal sleep time, or experiencing light (artificial or solar) at too close of a time point of your planned deep sleep time. </p>
<p>Your circadian rhythm greatly impacts a lot of hormones, chemicals, metabolic and neurological processes in your body, so it's understandable how if you get out of a routine, you may have trouble sleeping, comfortably.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
