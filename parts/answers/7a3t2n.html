		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contact lenses have a set diameter and radius of curvature.</p>
<p>The doctor measures your cornea and matches the values as closely to that of the measurements of the contact lens.</p>
<p>imagine putting a  small plate on top of a basketball.</p>
<p>now imagine putting a putting a large bowl on the basketball instead.</p>
<p>notice how the diameter and radius of the placed object affects how it will fit and remain on the sphere.</p>
<p>this is how a contact lens stays on the cornea.  it is of just the right diameter and radius as to work with the contours of your cornea and your eyelids to stay in position.  it moves with your eye.  too loose, it falls out, to light, you can't blink comfortably.</p>
<p>it's not chemistry, it's geometry</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your eyeball isn't a sphere.  It's very round with a bump where your cornea is.   The contact lens is formed to sort of that shape.    Some brands fit better than others due to variations in each person's eyeball shape.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contact lenses are designed to fit the contour of the cornea. The human cornea curvature varies, so contact lenses come in different parameters i.e. base curve and diameter to properly fit on the eye. This is why one brand can feel comfortable and another not, due to varying parameters and material. Doctors measure the corneal curvature to determine which base curve will best fit your cornea. </p>
<p>In some circumstances soft contacts need to be custom made if the corneal diameter or curvature is outside normal range. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything mentioned so far is correct but no one has said anything about the tiny weights that are actually in the contact lenses that allow the contact to maintain its positioning (i.e., so that it doesn't turn). This is called prism ballast. </p>
