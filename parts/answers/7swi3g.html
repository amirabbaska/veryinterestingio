		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It all has to do with how tape moves past the tape head.  Play is an arrow to the right because that's the direction the tape moves in order to play.  Fast forward uses two arrows because the tape is moving faster.  Reverse and rewind are similar, but in the opposite direction.  Stop is a square because the tape isn't moving and is pulled away from the tape head.  Pause is reminiscent of the capstan pins that hold the tape against the tape head.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
