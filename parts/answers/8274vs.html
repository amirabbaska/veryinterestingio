		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The person is unconscious not asleep. Asleep is a pattern in neurons firing rate, direction and cycle in specific regions off the brain, like the ascending reticular system.
Anesthesia uses 3 bases, unconscious, analgesia and muscle paralysis. For gas anesthesia, we actually don’t know how it works in molecular levels. In total venous anesthesia we do know. For this kind of anesthesia the most common drugs are Propofol for
Unconsciousness and it works on chlorine channels in neurons making them hard to fire upon a stimulus, like auditory or visual stimulation. For analgesia we use remifentanil working on opioid receptors to make the neurons hard to fire on noxious, pain, stimulus. And for muscle relaxation we use rocuronium that blocks the sinapses between neurons and muscles connecting in the receptors in the muscle end on the sinapses </p>
<p>The gas anesthesia with sevoflurane we really don’t know how the gas block the pain, give unconsciousness and some muscle relaxation. Several theories speculate that it modify the neurons in some way that make it hard to fire on stimulus. There are a beautiful example destroying this theory on YouTube when scientists uses gases to numb a plant that contract its leaves on touch. Since plants don’t have neurons, how it works remains a big mystery</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its difficult to ELi5 this. Anesthesia literally means &quot; free of sensation&quot;. The primary motivation for using anesthetica is not to render you unconscious but rather to block your pain pathways. For eg, Ketamine is an anesthetic popularly known to cause dissociative anesthesia, in which you can be conscious but wouldn't feel any pain sensation. However that's just one. Some act through opoid receptors, some act through Na+ channels. Then there are different agents that act differently depending on their route of administration( for eg, local or spinal or ivra).There are a subclass of muscle relaxants which themselves are broadly grouped into 2 as per their action on nerve endings as Depolarizing or Non Depolarizing. NDMR competitively act on Nm receptors and block their action by inhibiting Ach. </p>
<p>Thus, TLDR, we still have no clue how it all comes together and depending on route/site/chemical nature, mechanism varies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some weird answers about us not knowing how anesthesia works here...</p>
<p>ELI5: Brain is like an electrical lightbulb. Anesthesia is like a lightbulb dimmer. Turn up the anesthesia, lightbulb goes dimmer and dimmer until you can't see anything.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to get the light a little dim, sometimes you want lights out. Anesthesia can give that for you. The dimmer the light, the more things people like surgeons can do without you being aware of it.</p>
<p>Beyond ELI5: brain is literally like a complex electrical circuit, but using ionic depolarizations to turn the circuit on and off. The circuit exists on a cellular level, so there's a whole lot of them in series and parallel, turning each other on and off. Got lots of finer, more complex detail, but the fundamental biochemistry is simple and well defined.</p>
<p>Most anesthetics blocks the ionic depolarization via various mechanism. If you block enough depolarization, the circuit essentially stops, and no more electrical impulse go through. No sensation, no memory, no awareness is possible. You can also partially block the circuit; to cause hypnosis or partial analgesia, but not complete anesthesia/coma. All depends on how much anesthetics is used, and what kind.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of anaesthetic agents. They are often used in combination to maximise efficiency and minimise side effects. </p>
<p>Local anaesthetics (like the ones used when you get a dental filling) are sodium channel blockers. They change the membrane potential of your nerves preventing them from firing. In this way, they prevent the pain signal from being sent to the brain. So effectively, the pain doesn't happen.</p>
<p>I assume from the way the question is worded, you are particularly interested in general anaesthetics--that is when they &quot;knock you out&quot; for things such as major surgery. In answer to the second part of your question, I'm pretty sure it counts as unconsciousness because of the lack of ability to respond to stimuli. If you're asleep and someone tries to amputate your leg, you will definitely wake up. </p>
<p>The goal of a general anaesthetic protocol is to block pain, memory, movement, and cause unconsciousness. You technically have to be conscious to perceive pain, but if you're unconscious when something painful happens, your body will still have biochemical reactions that wouldn't occur if you blocked the nerves as well as induced unconsciousness.</p>
<p>Some drugs, like ketamine, produce what is known as a dissociative anaesthesia.  It interacts with NMDA receptors in the brain and interferes with incoming signals. It can put patients in a trance-like state with an absence of pain (hence why people use it recreationally.) It doesn't cause loss of consciousness though so can never be used alone to induce general anaesthesia.</p>
<p>Inhalational anaesthetics such as sevoflurane or desflurane are not precisely understood. They act on receptors in the brain such as GABA and NMDA as well as working on the level of the spinal cord. They are hypnotics and cause amnesia and as far as I know, they result in complete unconsciousness, unlike ketamine. </p>
<p>There are lots of different anaesthetics and they all have their pros and cons. Basically, it all goes back to the general goals I listed earlier and tricking the body into not signalling the brain of what's happening.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm still only a student so corrections on any potential mistakes are welcome!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say your brain is an office building. Sleep is part of the normal daily routine. There are still people in the building. There are security guards on duty (loud noises or pain will wake you up). There are night shift employees hard at work filling the day's paperwork (dreams are thought to help consolidate the day's memories for long term storage). And so on. The building definitely has LESS activity, but it is certainly active.</p>
<p>Anesthesia is more like there was a blizzard and nobody could even get to work in the building. Nobody is there. The usual downtime activities are not being done.</p>
<p>This is because the general anesthetic drugs inhibit all kinds of brain activity, including inhibiting the brain circuits that would normally be active while you sleep. When you sleep, certain specific brain areas are inhibited. In anesthesia, everything is inhibited.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
