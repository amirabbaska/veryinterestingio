Each one allows the species of snake to play to the strengths of its body characteristics. Remember that snakes still have tons of muscles and are very flexible, they use all those muscles and flexibility to coordinate their body and move gracefully through their habitat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay. Here’s the real ELI5. There are some very odd (and very wrong) answers on here so far. </p>
<p>You’ve got three main movement types. The WRIGGLERS, the THROWERS, and the CRAWLERS.</p>
<p>The WRIGGLERS kinda just wriggle. The classic serpentine movements that make the snake look like a sine wave. The snake gets pushed forward by the force exerted on its local static environment by its very muscly body.</p>
<p>The THROWERS keep a part or parts of their body fixed on the ground and thrown or push the rest of their body forward, this part then becomes the ‘static’ part and the previously fixed part is pushed/thrown forward. The sidewinder is a cool example of this and leave characteristic J-shaped marks in the sand.</p>
<p>The CRAWLERS move in an almost straight line. Waves of muscular contraction moving down their body push them directly forward.</p>
<p>And then of course you have the odd ones out like the sea snakes and flying snakes that swim and glide respectively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their bodies contract and it pulls them along. Like a centipede without the legs, it moves so smoothly that it’s hard to really see.</p>
<p>Then there’s a snakes like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crotalus_cerastes" target="_blank">sidewinder </a> that have their own fun way of doing it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snakes have over 300 pairs of ribs.  They can use them kinda like internal legs.</p>
<p>They also use their muscles to push off the ground.  The sidewinder someone else mentioned is an extreme example of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It chooses which parts of its body to push with (or even grip with) and which to lift clear of the ground the flexibility of the system means that it is the equivalent of having multiple legs all along the body which can be selected at will.</p>
<p>After all your tongue can move around your mouth with extreme flexibility and push on all sides of the mouth yet it doesn't have any limbs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
