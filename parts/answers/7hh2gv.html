		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Brain tissue itself has no pain receptors. But as other commenters have said, your brain isn't just brain tissue. In addition to the meninges covering the brain, which does have pain receptors, there are also blood vessels, which are theorized to be interlinked to migraines and other types of headaches. In addition, the way we perceive pain means that the 'location' of the pain may not be the source of it, so while a headache might feel like it's extremely deep in your brain, that doesn't reflect the actual location of the pain receptors that are being triggered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone more knowledgeable then me will probably give a better answer, but while the brain tissues itself has no pain receptors, the meninges, which are the membranes that enclose the brain, do. I think other structures like blood vessels may also have pain receptors associated with them. Some headaches also originate from muscle problems in the neck or are related to eyes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgical tech here. The brain has no pain receptor but the meninges do. When they hurt, your head hurts. And since pain can radiate to areas where nothing is happening, it makes sense that you could feel it in the brain when the brain covering is hurting. The above response is correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a little side bit of info on pain looking at it from the muscles of the neck. This goes a little beyond migraines and into headaches, but they may be related, since migraines are sometimes a symptom of a neck injury.</p>
<p>There's something called referred pain. A constricted muscle somewhere in the body can register as pain somewhere else in the body.</p>
<p>Tight muscles in the neck can cause pain sensations all around the head, behind the eyes, in the jaw, wherever. It can go beyond aching and make you nauseated or give you vertigo. When I see people with cluster headaches smacking their own head it makes me wonder if they're instinctively doing a form of tapotement to alleviate their pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is thought that migraines are caused by several triggers (less sleep, hormonal variations, food etc) and once they are about to begin, the person experiences an aura (change in how things smell and halos around lights). </p>
<p>There have been several preclinical theories about the pathology of migraines— most of them involving release of inflammatory compounds  that cause pain by neurogenic inflammation around the meninges and nerves innervated by trigeminal ganglion (this is most likely what causes the pain in the face, around the eye orbits).  While the brain itself does not have nociceptors (pain receptors), the cerebral vessels around the brain and meninges do have nociceptors.</p>
<p>That being said, it has been shown to a significant extent that- the release of a peptide called Calcitonin Gene Related Peptide (CGRP) by trigeminovascular afferents has been implicated with the neurogenic vasodilation of meningeal vessels. The medications currently available (like triptans) decrease the elevated CGRP and that’s why they are recommended to be taken as soon as a person experiences the aura of onset of migraine. It is a one time treatment for that episode of migraine but not a preventive treatment. Regardless, elevated levels of CGRP in plasma are almost always seen during migraines. </p>
<p>There is also extensive research being done on CGRP receptor antagonists (drugs that would block the CGRP receptors so CGRP can’t bind to its target and activate pain and inflammatory pathways). </p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
