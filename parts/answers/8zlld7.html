		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds which are isolated during development will still sing, and some of the elements will be similar to fully-formed species-specific song. But the non-isolated birds' songs will be more complex and have crucial elements which the isolates lack. How exactly a bird learns to sing is still under study, as it's a bit hard to study these neural processes while they happen.</p>
<p>As for different songs within the same species, &quot;dialects&quot; are a matter of controversy. It does seem like at least ecological differences can influence song development and may lead to species growing farther apart (Slabbekoorn &amp; Smith, 2002).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As my academic advisor always says, &quot;There's no such thing as a typical songbird&quot;. Birds learn to sing in a variety of ways. Generally 'calls' (which are distinct from 'songs') seem to be innate, and not susceptible to social experience or degraded by isolation. Songs, however, are learned for song-learning species (oscine passerines), and do not develop normally in social isolation, just as young human children will never develop linguistically past the 'babbling' phase without exposure to language. Some birds, such as sparrows, learn via eavesdropping on adults, which sing to defend their territory. Other, non-territorial birds, like zebra finches, require a live, interactive adult tutor to learn song, and are unable to learn properly via passive listening, just like humans. If they are exposed to a live tutor of the wrong species, like a Bengalese finch, they will learn Bengalese finch song instead!</p>
<p>But what about the case you've described where birds are raised without exposure to their own species? Brown-headed Cowbirds are brood parasites, which means that they, like cuckoo birds, lay their eggs in the nests of other species and allow them to raise their offspring for them. This means young cowbirds are never exposed to the song of their own species, as they never encounter adult male cowbirds, and only males sing. And yet they develop normal cowbird-typical song - how is this possible? It turns out that young cowbirds seek out non-singing adult female cowbirds. They then sing their immature 'babbling' song to them. The females respond selectively to attractive song elements with a rapid wing motion which indicates arousal. This is reinforcing to the young cowbirds (&quot;she liked that! If I sing more like that, she might mate with me!&quot;) which gradually shapes their song towards mature cowbird song without them ever actually hearing a song. Female cowbirds from the northern US prefer certain song types, while females from the south prefer different song types. Males from the north will develop southern-type songs if exposed to southern females.

<p>Edit: I'm so glad people find this interesting! I'm very happy to answer any questions. I've worked on cognition/problem solving in crows, vocal learning in songbirds (currently zebra finches), and spent a few years on vocal learning in African Grey Parrots in the lab of Irene Pepperberg (of Alex the Parrot fame), which have a very different learning system from songbirds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
