		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I ran a simulation using java for 100,000 trials each. The average time for both people moving is half that of only one person moving. Here is a histogram of the data: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/5mYnGiT.png" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/5mYnGiT.png</a></p>
<p>Details of the simulation:</p>
<p>People are assumed to be on a 100x100 grid. If they are on the same spot, they can find each other. At t=0, they are placed on a random location in the grid. Each time step, anyone that's moving will randomly move north, south, east, or west. They can't move out of the 100x100 grid, so if they pick a direction not allowed, they'll pick again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are moving then there are more collisions (e.g. brownian motion) with others. If the people (or objects) are truly moving randomly then if both people are moving there is a greater chance of collision than if only one is moving. </p>
<p>Source: I am using the analogy of enzymatic efficiency: there is greater successful (desired) collision when both molecules are in motion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT TL;DR It depends on how the park is designed. If you stand still in a spot that's unlikely to be visited, like some offshoot of the park, it will take longer than if you walked around, but if you stand in the middle of a * - shaped park, it's better than walking around.</p>
<p>If we model this as a (lazy) random walk on a graph, expected time for you two to find each other in the situation where both of you are walking is known as the <em>meeting time</em>. In the case where only one of you is walking, this is the <em>hitting time</em>. Let <em>M</em> denote the meeting time in the worst starting position, and <em>H</em> the worst hitting time. We want to compare H and M.</p>
<p>It turns out that the inequality</p>
<p>M &lt; K H</p>
<p>holds for some constant K (and apparently it's possible that K is as small as 1/2). <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Papers/me38.pdf" target="_blank">Details and a complete answer here</a>. The inequality appears as Proposition 1. It thus seems that the answer (as of that paper) is unknown for general graphs (i.e. general layouts of the amusement park), and depends on whether this K can be brought down to less than 1 or not.</p>
<p>IMO the other answers so far don't model the situation as well. Amusement parks are not generally arranged as grids, and they're not translationally invariant (so looking at the other person's movement as an origin shift is inaccurate), and I suspect that whether M&gt;H or M&lt;H depends on the underlying graph, i.e. the way the theme park is laid out.</p>
<p>EDIT: In fact, I think I do have an example of a graph where M&gt;H and another where M&lt;H for specific starting positions. The first is a star graph, with one person standing in the middle, and the second is a large clique with one extra vertex connected to the clique by one edge, where one person starts at the extra vertex. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/GemOfEvan and others have given a monte-carlo solution with the tally converging to half the time if both are moving as opposed to one standing still. However the reason it is half the time can be easily understood using a transformation of reference frame. If the seeker changes from not moving to moving at a velocity v, then in his instantaneous rest frame this looks like the person he is seeking changes his velocity from v to 2v. From this point of view, it is clear that the person he is searching for will inevitably cross his path twice as soon if he is moving twice as fast. This can be worked out cleanly using only Galilean transformations for those that want to see an actual mathematical proof and is left as an exercise to the reader.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Side note:  in real life, you always move.</p>
<p>First, for whatever reason, you can't know that they aren't standing still themselves sometimes- random motion doesn't have to mean continuous motion.  They could be on a ferris wheel with a near stationary position relative to the park size.</p>
<p>Second, given the geography of the place, you can always optimize your search- he's moving randomly, you're not.  Orbit the center of the place, check the extrema on occasion, etc.</p>
<p>Thirdly, standing stock still in an amusement park for up to infinity hours is just depressing.  Take a walk, get an ice cream.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
