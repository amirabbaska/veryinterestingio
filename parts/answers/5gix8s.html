		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not defecation. Besides food, feces contains bilirubin which is made from destroyed red blood cells. You need to be able to excrete bilirubin, otherwise you'd get hepatitis and jaundice. The urine excretes like 5% of the bilirubin (which makes your urine dark btw), but it's incapable of handling all the bilirubin.</p>
<p>With urination, your electrolytes will be out of whack and you'll likely die. This is what happens in renal artery obstruction</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, no. </p>
<p>But you can go on a &quot;low residue&quot; diet that minimizes fecal waste. Astronauts tend to be on a low residue diet to minimize the need to handle solid waste in space. (As others have said, you can't eliminate it completely, but you can decrease the volume.)</p>
<p>It's dangerous to try to decrease urination. Some of that comes from the fact that to decrease output, you would need to decrease input to the point of dehydration, and partly because you would end up with electrolyte imbalance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the secretions mentioned,  the GI tract is always shedding dead epithelial cells (lining cells) , which have a high rate of turnover because they take a lot of abuse (that's one reason why chemo makes GI tract feel so bad; rapidly dividing cells are affected the most)  Also bacteria-  According to the Encyclopedia Brittanica, beneficial bacteria count for 30% of wastes volume.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember learning in a human physiology class that the way that the kidney works to filter the blood, by balancing salt concentrations and porosity of membranes, means that there is a minimum amount of urine that is produced by a functioning kidney. Trying to get rid of that would probably lead to issues with filtering which would lead to issues with living</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been fasting studies of up to 382 days duration in humans (for weight loss purposes). Even in persons not having eaten for hundreds of days, some amount of feces is produced, from shedding of surface cells in the intestines, albeit at a much, much slower rate (once every 2-3 months)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
