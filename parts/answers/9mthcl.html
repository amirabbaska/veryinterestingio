<p>We haven't identified any combination of particles that form a proton when combined, and have a lower total rest mass than a proton when separate.  So we have no reason to believe you can get energy from splitting a proton.</p>
<p>For splitting particles and nuclei, you can only get energy from &quot;splitting&quot; when the rest mass energy of the products is less than the rest mass energy of the initial particle or nucleus.  The difference between the two is what you get as energy release.  For instance, the sum of the rest mass of a proton plus a neutron is a little more than rest mass of a deuterium (proton+neutron bound together) so splitting a deuterium into a proton and neutron takes energy instead of releasing energy.   Two separate deuteriums have a total rest mass a little higher than a helium-4, etc.  That trend continues (roughly) until you happen to hit iron-56 (26 protons and 30 neutrons), where it starts to be the other way around for complicated reasons.  So, you can release energy by splitting a uranium into two lighter atoms because the sum of the mass of the two lighter atoms is less than the mass of the starting uranium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No; we cannot <strong>split</strong> a proton, to create energy.</p>
<p>Protons are bound by the strong force, and with the binding comes a potential energy. In fact we see that energy manifest in the mass of a proton - the total mass of individual constituent quarks is less than that of the proton. In case you hadn't heard this before, protons are made up of 3 quarks (2 up and 1 down). So if you could split a proton then that energy (as extra mass for example) would be released.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_confinement" target="_blank">Quark (colour) confinement</a>, however, says that essentially we can never see or have isolated quarks. In other words quarks HAVE to stick together and form a baryon - mesons and hadrons. For a start, the strong force being very strong and attractive at very short ranges - this is due to the term +kr (and note the r dependence not 1/r) in the strong force potential, where r is the radius/separation and k is called the <em>string tension.</em> So qualitatively you might start seeing why it's hard; it's in fact impossible.</p>
<p>In a hadron - say a proton - the quarks are bound together by <em>gluon tubes</em> , which is essentially just a bunch of gluons travelling back and forth between the quarks. The gluons (and quarks) have non-zero colour charge (e.g. red-anti-blue or green-anti-red, where something like red-anti-red is neutral colour). But because gluons have colour, as you separate the two quarks, the gluon tubes get stretched and start to narrow. This happens more and more until enough energy is released that the tubes snap and immediately form a quark-anti-quark pair, with each particle of the pair instantly being attracted to and bound to the original pair of two quarks. This is so that the net color charge is zero - the strong force really loves to keep things colorless.</p>
<p>Thus if we could split a proton, there would be a lot of energy released, but it is impossible.</p>
<p>EDIT: Let me clarify: splitting protons <strong>into constituent quarks</strong> is impossible. Proton decays and interactions occur, where protons will turn into other subatomic particles e.g. the proton decay into neutron, electron, anti-neutrino.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
