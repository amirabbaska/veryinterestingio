		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 2015 the USGS predicted that we have over 365 years of lithium left at current production rates, and that doesn't take into account recycling. It's also with noting that there are a number of emerging battery techs that will replace lithium ion given time. </p>

<p>The mining and production stats start a little ways down</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>And Li is recyclable, not consumable. So that society might reach an equilibrium level, when little more needs to be mined.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have a reference since I heard it on NPR, but in a discussion of battery tech, the guest voiced amazement that more research wasn't being done on an aluminum battery. They have higher potential energy density than lithium, and aluminum is a tenth of the price. </p>
<p>There are obviously problems to overcome, or we would already be using them, but they look promising.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
