		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mistake that led to Flint's toxic water was a water purification error that corrupted the actual <em>pipes</em> the water flows through. So the water itself can be perfectly clean, and on the way to your house, the pipes will leech toxic amounts of lead into it.</p>
<p>In order for Flint to repair its water problem, it has to replace all of the pipes in the city. This is really expensive and Flint doesn't have the money to do it. Most cities wouldn't have the money to do it, as they only budget for a certain percentage of pipes to be replaced and serviced every year.</p>
<p>The replacement cost has been estimated to be $60M and the project, to be fully completed, to take 15 years. There are about 29,000 pipes that need to be completed. They are focusing on the most at-risk homes first and several hundred have been completed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily an answer to this question but I wanted to chime in.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Flint Town. Mom worked downtown at UM Flint and I went there for a few years.</p>
<p>As far back as the 90s she would say that everyone in her office, at Water Street Pavillon, knew they were pulling water from the river. They stopped drinking it and making coffee with it. Several of the restaurants in the pavilion did too. The ones who didn't you could tell. Their pop/soda tasted like shit.</p>
<p>Whenever I would drink from a fountain on campus (we're talking back in like 01-03) it tasted absolutely god awful and had a yellow tint to it. Kind of tasted like dry wall.</p>
<p>I said all of that to say this - this wasn't a new problem.</p>
<p>It fit into a media cycle because the story was so bombastic and the state government made the choice to switch the city as a whole to that water only a few years ago. However, several places in Flint have been on that water since I was a kid.</p>
<p>We have always known that river was disgusting. No one ever wanted to get in it. We didn't really have any river-related activities in Flint that many people participated in. No one fished in it. No one swam in it.</p>
<p>As a matter of face, I remember when I was a kid and they drained a 1/4 mile portion of it. They pulled out several old cars, guns, knives, safe's, and other contraband. I think they even found human remains if I'm not mistaken.</p>
<p>Point being it's not like everything was fine in Flint and then BOOM all of the sudden the water is toxic. The river has always been shit and more and more businesses and municipalities have been getting their water from it to save money for years.</p>
<p>There should have been a clean up effort for the river LONG before this happened, and I mean 30-40 years ago. This river has been toxic and a danger since the first factory started draining their sludge into it a hundred years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can't fix a city's entire water supply infrastructure over night.  The system is underground, so even the parts that can be dug up are under streets and people's yards.  Then there's the parts that run under buildings and such....</p>
<p>Not to mention, it's been winter up there.  The ground is frozen in winter, which adds that much more labor to the whole process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
