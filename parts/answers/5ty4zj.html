		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually worked in TV before computers. We would make the titles with press-on letters (I forget the brand name) and shoot them with a camera. The title camera would be combined with the live camera in a device called a &quot;luma key&quot; that would switch the live camera off and the title camera on everywhere that the lettering appears, based on the brightness. This was with monochrome cameras. With color cameras there was a device called a &quot;chroma key&quot; that would switch based on hue, usually tuned to blue. The same device was used for example to put graphics behind the weather man. You had to be careful the talent didn't wear any blue clothing.</p>
<p>EDIT: found a web page that shows a switcher with built-in luma key, and explains how it works: <a href="http://www.danalee.ca/ttt/switching_and_video_effects.htm" target="_blank">Switchers</a>. Scroll down to &quot;Keys - Internal, External, Matte.&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT 2: I remembered what the letters were called; Tactype. You can buy a sheet of it here: <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/VINTAGE-TACTYPE-Lettering-12-x-8-Sheet-Dry-Transfer-5514-Futura-Medium-/272114690476" target="_blank">VINTAGE TACTYPE Lettering 12 x 8 Sheet Dry Transfer 5514 Futura Medium</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Movies have had titles since the 1880s/90s. Lots of methods. Shoot bright titles on a black background with one TV camera. Combine that feed with a feed from another camera and you've got titles over, which you can fade up &amp; down, zoom in and out, roll, whatever. Before computers were used in TV there were devices like Chyrons which substituted for the bright letters on black background and the second camera and gave producers a lot more variety and flexibility.</p>
<p>But the basics: 2 feeds and one can be a computer or just a piece of paper. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first live television graphics(commonly called 'supers' or superimposement at the time) were created at a national political convention(iirc Republican National Convention) in the late 60's. They were trying to figure out a way to announce the speakers without having an announcer say the name of every speaker that came up. The director and technical director were at lunch at a diner that had a black menu with white letters. They came up with the idea of using a luminance key to overlay the names. They bought the menu and all of the letters off the diner for less than $100 and that's how the first 'supers' were done before computer graphics. Other ways discussed in other posts were used but as far as I know that was the first. </p>
<p>Source: Technical Director for 18 years. </p>
<p>EDIT: [Mr. Hewitt swept into the early medium of TV with a series of bold editorial and technical ideas. He was a leading champion of location shooting to cover spectacular breaking stories. He introduced cue cards that forced anchors to look directly into the camera, only after his experiment with Braille went nowhere.</p>
<p>At the 1952 national political conventions in Chicago, he created a way of superimposing people's names under their images on camera. The idea came to him at a diner that had a menu board with rearrangeable letters.</p>
<p>When the waitress came to take his order, he replied, &quot;I'll have the board.&quot; It cost him $45.](<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/8/19/pm-hewitt19.html" target="_blank">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/8/19/pm-hewitt19.html</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would have long scrolls of black paper on which they would mount words made of white letters. They would have two cameras, one focused on the scroll and another focused on the scene in the studio, and they would electronically combine the two images. This technique was used into the 1970's. Source: I once knew an artist who was employed to make these long scrolls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heynony is correct for more recent live TV titles, but older TV and movies, they used optical titles. These are titles that are combined with the base footage as part of the printing of the film, basically think of cel animation, where the negative is exposed by light passing though multiple layers of film. The title layer or layers can be hand drawn cels, just like in animation, or photographed text. And of course many complex combinations of these ideas to achieve complex effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
