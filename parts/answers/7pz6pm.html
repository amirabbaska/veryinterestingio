		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moles are still skin cells. So imagine you have an area of skin, and some part of it is “mole” cells and some is regular cells. Both parts are sluffing (losing skin cells) at similar rates, and then replacing those cells at similar rates. So the shape and structure of moles might change overtime, but on average they don’t change much because they are “in sync” with the growth/loss of the cells around them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three main layers of skin:
1-Epidermis (outermost layer)
2-Dermis
3-Hypodermis
The epidermis contains no blood vessels, and is nourished by diffusion from the dermis.The outermost layer of the epidermis consists of 25 to 30 layers of dead cells, which sheds.</p>
<p>The dermis is the layer of skin beneath the epidermis that consists of connective tissue and cushions the body from stress and strain. The dermis is tightly connected to the epidermis by a basement membrane. It contains the hair follicles, sweat glands, sebaceous glands, apocrine glands, lymphatic vessels and blood vessels.This layer does not have the property of shedding off. Birthmarks are present in this layer as birthmarks are caused by overgrowth of blood vessels, melanocytes, smooth muscle, fat, fibroblasts, or keratinocytes.
Therefore, birthmark don't go away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
