		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the old days, there were vacuum tube amps, also known as “valves.” At its simplest, an electrical valve has three wires, think of them as electricity in, electricity out, and the valve. If the valve wire has no power coming in, then it’s closed. At some voltage, the valve will be all the way open. At values in between, the valve will be partway open. So, say you have a valve that’s fully open at 1 volt, and you run 100 volts through the high voltage side. If you feed in one volt, you’ll get 100 volts out, if you feed in half a volt, you’ll get 50 volts. Then hook a speaker up to the high voltage output, and feed audio into the control pin, and you’ll have amplified audio. You can then control the overall volume by changing how much voltage goes into the high voltage side. Today, it works the same way, but with transistors instead of tubes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sound which is converted into electricity drives the speakers. More electric power in the loudspeakers moves the speaker membranes more, so they push more air, for louder sound.
(Loudspeakers have coils through which electricity flows. And they have magnets. And these both attract, or push. The stronger the electricity (aka sound flowing through the speaker coil), the more does the magnet push or pull the speaker membrane with the coil. (More power = stronger magnetic field = loudspeaker moves more and pushes more air)</p>
<p>If you turn down the volume, there is less electricity going to the speaker, the speaker moves less, for softer sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's what is known in electrical engineering as an allpass filter. Think of an audio signal as being represented by a bunch of numbers. They can be zero, positive, or negative. Zero represents total silence, and when a number is positive or negative, the farther away from zero it is, the louder it is. Don't bother right now with the difference between positive and negative. An allpass filter just multiplies every number in the signal by a certain amount, called the gain. So everything gets multiplied  farther away from zero when you make it louder or closer when you make it softee. When you turn the volume knob, you're telling the radio to adjust that gain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turning the volume knob up is kind of  like opening a water faucet.  Turning the volume down is like closing a water faucet.  </p>
<p>You can pick anywhere between all the way closed and all the way open, depending on how much water (volume) you want to come out.</p>
