<p>as age increases, high tones are supposed to be lost; lower tones are supposed to be lost.</p>
<p>The way you describe this... it almost seems as if you took a hiatus from audio for a few years and recently decided to go back to your passion... only to find your *memory* of the notes don't match the present.</p>
<p>Check what octave the notes are playing in; perhaps you are mentally shifting the octave? I know that some notes sound similar in a different octave, at least to me... I got ear issues, too tho. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>But having perfect pitch in itself is surely a result of training your brain to recognise notes, some people are able to do this better than others. It is certainly influenced by the music that you listen to.
