		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Am cook for a restaurant: Ingredients are all fresh and of the highest quality around, but that doesnt mean we dont add extra fat for it to taste good. Heavy cream is subbed for milk, anything i can put sour cream into i will, always a little generous with the salt. My job is to make you a great meal, if you were going healthy you wouldnt order the 4 cheese mac and cheese with bacon on top. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In restaurants they don't care about calories. They want their food to taste good, so more people come. </p>
