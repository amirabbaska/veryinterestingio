		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assign ips, both public and private for a hosting company.  Im also responsible for switch configuration and firewall provisioning.  </p>
<p>Postal service is the best analogy here.  Your house address is how people send letters to you.    Each up address can be broken down into street and house number but for this example let's just says it's your whole address.  </p>
<p>Routers/firewalls are like post offices, they may not have anyone there who knows where 12345 easy lane is, but it knows where the post office in Simple, TX is, so it sends it there. </p>
<p>In the mean time while it passes through some of these routers/firewalls the traffic gets monitored and logged. </p>
<p>Apartments are more like dynamic ips, it's a temporary address assigned to a large group of dwellings.  This is most of us who have home internet connections.  The apt complex knows who has what address, and when questioned they know who had apt 987 in June of 2008.  </p>
<p>This is why TOR network was created, and this is also the importance of VPNs.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An IP address is actually an address. It's a number that uniquely identifies anything that connects directly to the internet.</p>
<p>As for tracing online activities - it becomes a little bit more hairy. Say you are at campus and connect through the same router as all the other students. Then the router is the only thing with a global IP address. Everyone else connecting through that router will identify as the same IP (it's called NAT if you want to read further)</p>
<p>Your home connection may or may not be a fixed IP. There is a limited number of IP addresses so most ISP's use dynamic IP's. This means that your IP of today may be your neighbors tomorrow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Say you want to send a request to a web server, you put the website name into your browser, say wee.reddit.com, and the browser ascends the request to the web server, except how does it get there? </p>
<p>Computers and routers don't send data to host names, they need something that's easier for computers to understand. Every computer and router connected to the internet has a numeric address, the IP address. There's a process that converts names like www.reddit.com to addresses and your computer does that and sends the request to the address. </p>
<p>Now, to get the response back your computer needs to have an address. I'm going to gloss over some details you can google if you're interested (rfc1918, nat, dhcp) but your computer gets an IP address from your ISP automatically and when you send a request to a server that request includes your address so the server knows where to send the reply. </p>
<p>Now, your address uniquely identifies your computer on the internet, so if someone does something on the internet the server they talked to has a record of what IP address made the request. From that people know which ISP issues that address to a user and then they can ask the ISP which customer had that address. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you ever been in a group with two people that have the same first name? Someone might say &quot;Hey John&quot; or whatever name, and both look up and wonder if you mean them or the other John. Usually this problem is solved by adding more information that only applies to one of them, like their last name, or simply calling them by their last name to begin with. </p>
<p>Computers have this problem when they try to talk to each other too, especially now that we've connected thousands of them together on the Internet. This problem is solved by giving each computer that connects to the Internet a number that only they have, an IP address. </p>
<p>Since the Internet got way bigger than anyone had thought of back when they chose the numbers used for IP addresses, they divided them into public and private IP addresses. The private ones can't connect to the Internet, so they don't need to be unique. Each home or business has at least one router, which is a special type of computer with both a private IP address and a public IP address, the latter being assigned to it by their Internet service provider, like Comcast or CenturyLink. Computers and game consoles and tablets and stuff use their private IP addresses to talk to the router on its private IP address, which then uses its public IP address to talk to other computers on the Internet. </p>
<p>So people on the Internet can sometimes see the public IP address and can look up what Internet service provider it is from, and find the city and state it's in. Unless the customer posts it somewhere, only your Internet service provider knows the actual address of the house or business behind an IP address. A government or a hacker may be able to get that information from the Internet service provider, but is usually very difficult and rarely happens. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like a phone number. Pretend your internet service is the same as phone service. Each customer has their own phone number, but they can also have more than one phone in their home which all use this number.</p>
<p>Websites are just computers with their own phone numbers: Reddit, Google, Facebook, all have their own numbers. When you want to visit a website, your computer uses a service akin to the YellowPages to find the phone number for that service. This is called DNS.</p>
<p>So your computer looks up the records for whichever site you're visiting and connects to that service and you can now talk to each other. The internet providers around the world all have the physical infrastructure in place to route all traffic from everyone in the world.</p>
<p>You can be traced the same way as you can by your phone number. If you prank call someone, your number will show up on their caller ID. Someone only has to look up your number (IP) to find out who your provider is, call your provider, and request your account holder information.</p>
<p>When you connect to a website or service, they can see your IP address in their logs. There are ways around this, called proxies. These are just middle-men which route your connections. It would be like calling a mobile phone and having the call forwarded through that, so that the receiver would see <em>that</em> phone's number and not yours.</p>
<p>This analogy is not perfect but it's ELI5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
