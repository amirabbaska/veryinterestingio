		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I posted this in response to the top comment as their explanation was incorrect but just making a separate post to provide an answer to your question. </p>
<p>Your vocal cords, which sit at the top of your airway, are quite sensitive. In dry drowning, water hits the vocal cords which causes spasm - otherwise known as laryngospasm. In basic terms, the vocal cords snap shut in a protective reflex which seals off the airway and lungs. In reality, the victim suffocates rather than drowns - no water enters the lungs. </p>
<p>Many people here are describing secondary drowning, which is an inflammatory condition caused by water entering the lungs and causing irritation. Fluid build up occurs within the inflammatory response causing pulmonary oedema, or fluid filled lungs. </p>
<p>To confuse things however, laryngospasm can also cause pulmonary oedema. Our breathing works via negative pressure - when we open our rib cage, that stretches the lungs open and creates a small vacuum causing air to rush in. This is how we breathe - we don't 'suck' air in per se, we create a negative pressure environment with the muscles in our rib cage and diaphragm and air rushes in to equalise pressure between our lungs and the external environment. </p>
<p>When laryngospasm occurs, the victim may still be using all of those muscles to try to breathe but their airway is sealed shut. So, they are creating a negative pressure environment in their lungs, but with no way for air to get in to equalise the pressure. The victim then ends up drawing fluid from their tissues into their lungs instead, resulting in pulmonary oedema, or fluid filled lungs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well there's dry drowning and secondary drowning. They're a bit different. Dry drowning is when your face is submerged in water and your vocal cords slam shut preventing water getting into your lungs but also oxygen. Your body burns through what oxygen it has, your brain eventuallyâ€‹ gets starved of oxygen and you die without ever getting water in your lungs.
Secondary drowning is when you get water in your lungs, enough to wash away the healthy surfactant fluid lubricating your lungs making it much harder to breath. The water also causes damage to the lung tissue causing swelling and inflammation of the lung membranes involved in getting oxygen from the air into your blood stream. So despite you breathing air and oxygen into your lungs, the membrane of your lung is now swollen and too thick for the oxygen to cross to your blood stream. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>They call it dry drowning because it doesn't appear usually for hours or days after the actual incident that introduced water into the lungs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>YUS I CAN ANSWER THIS! We beach lifeguards call it parking lot drowning as our slang (secondary drowning is the correct term I believe), because people often feel the onset of the symptoms when they are in the parking lot leaving the beach to go home. </p>
<p>Inhaling water is really bad, and when you do your body can over react, like it does when you're stung by a bee. Ocean water is the worst because of the bacteria and crap in it. When your lungs figure out there is water and gunk in them they respond through a couple of ways, for secondary drowning it's called edema, pulmonary edema or wet lung, and it is your body trying to flush out your lungs with mucus and other bodily fluids. There is also inflammation sometimes. </p>
<p>This is similar to the overreaction your body has to a bee sting if you're allergic because the poison (or in this case fluid in lungs) won't kill you, but your body flips out and kills itself. </p>
<p>Treatment is just giving the patient oxygen. Key thing is figuring out whether or not patient inhaled water, a stethoscope can hear gurgling or wheezing in the lungs sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
