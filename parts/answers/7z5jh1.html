		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The spin of an electron is always 1/2, you can never change that. However you can change its projection along some axis. If the Hamiltonian is dependent on some component of the spin vector, then the energy depends on the orientation of the spin of the particle. An example would be an electron in a magnetic field, where the magnetic dipole moment of the electron wants to align with the external magnetic field. You’ll have a splitting of each possible energy energy into a doublet.</p>
<p>I’m not sure what you mean about electrons leaving the nucleus, and magnetic fields pointing in any direction. Can you describe specifically what situation you’re imagining?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
