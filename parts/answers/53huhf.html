		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The aging product itself is an asset that can be used to get a secured loan from a bank.</p>
<p>For example, there are Italian banks that take aging cheese wheels in exchange for a low interest loan.  They care for the aging cheese to keep it fresh and valuable until the debtor pays off the loan.  The cheese has significant value , so if the loan is defaulted on, the bank simply sells the cheese.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly by selling un-aged product as well.</p>
<p>So the first year I sell 90% of what I make right away to recover my operating costs and lay up the remainder to age.</p>
<p>Then the next year I might sell 80% of the new stock, and 10 percent of the first year production.</p>
<p>Then the next year I might sell 70% or 60% of the new, and various percentages of the older stock.</p>
<p>Basically, this is why most real distillers (as opposed to people who just buy and relabel) have an entire product line.</p>
<p>As the business grows the numbers are adjusted.</p>
<p>In the ideal your best aged stuff is a little rare and so hard to get... and so commands a high price and so top earnings.</p>
<p>This is particularly correct for a winery where the different wines have different aging profiles including many kinds of wine that do not age at all. (Crisp white wine turns to bitter ass very quickly if aged, for example.)</p>
<p>Look up &quot;young versus aged wine&quot; in your favorite search engine.</p>
<p>Basically you start with a young product and as you bank reputation you start to bank aged product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I manage a winery, so here's my personal experience regarding the wine industry: </p>
<p>Vines yield a usable crop usually in the third year, and we age our wines for two to three years before bottling, after which we bottle age for a few more months (sometimes years) before release. </p>
<p>There are a few ways people deal with this:
1) There is a saying in the wine industry. To make a small fortune, start with a large fortune. Many people/companies start a new venture while maintaining other successful ventures. So they have other income, or start with enough in savings to account for no income for the first 6 years (in this example), about 10 with no profit. </p>
<p>2) Sell other people's product as your own. I assume there are equivalents in other industries but in the wine industry you can a) Buy grapes, so you can get started making wine while your own vines are establishing themselves. b) Buy bulk grape juice that you can ferment/age/bottle yourself c) Buy bulk wine that you can blend/age/bottle d) Buy bottled wine that you can put your own label on. So you can jump in at almost any point in the process so that you can get started selling and establishing a brand. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
