		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short version: the microscope is a beam of electrons that are focused very 'tightly' together with a very specific and exact energy. When that beam hits something (hopefully whatever you want to take a picture of) those electron bounce back in one of 2 ways, either as back scattered electrons or secondary electrons i.e. reflected back from the sample by being flung around the atom's nucleus OR by exciting and electron in the sample so it &quot;jumps out&quot;. The microscope collects those electrons and uses the energy of them to make a picture.</p>
<p>Source: I work for FEI as a research physicist. I don't do a lot with the actual electrons hitting the sample, but I do a ton with the signal collected afterwards. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electron microscopy is pretty diverse. Probably the most common EM images you would see are colorised (artificially) Scanning Electron Microscope Images (SEMs). If you Google SEM images you'll see everything from bug eyes to metal layers to colourful EBSD images.
Transmission Electron Microscopes work by aligning a beam of electrons through a thin (&lt;200nm) sample and detecting the signal on the other side. Scanning TEM is a mixture of TEM and SEM but can reach much higher magnifications and resolution than SEM.</p>
<p>SEM and TEM are the two main electron microscopes. There are also Helium Ion Microscopes, Focused Ion Beams (used often for sample preparation), and so many more particle microscopes/spectrometers like SIMS, x-ray beam lines etc. </p>
<p>SEMs have a moderate magification and work by producing electrons which are just focused to a point and scanned (hence the name) across the sample and the signal produced from the interaction I'd detected above the (relatively) thick sample. The size of the focused point (aka probe), among other factors, determines the resolution limit of the image.  There are numerous detectors fitted to SEMs for collecting the different signals coming from the interaction of the scanning electron probe with the sample. These signals include Secondary electrons, backscattered electrons, Auger electrons, x-rays and many more.</p>
<p>TEM and STEM (let's take them together) are different in that the electron beam (parallel in TEM, converged to a probe in STEM) are transmitted through the sample. Depending on the coherance, focus plane, aberrations, probe size (STEM), and many other factors you can achieve atomic resolution imaging with both methods at various source voltages and currents. The source is where the electrons are produced.
The TEM isn't just for atomic resolution however, you can do high resolution diffraction, xray analysis, energy filtered imaging, electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), angularly resolved EELS and more. You can do some of these at atomic resolution while imaging. For example people have used EELS and xray analysis (known as EDX) to discern individual elements one by one.</p>
<p>Pretty cool subject, if you've any questions ask away. I definitely know a tiny amount compared to others but I can help!
Edit: I am doing a PhD in STEM and EELS</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on to what's been said, in TEM electron optics (i.e. magnetic lenses) are used to form a plane wave of electrons that hit the sample, and the electron beam actually behaves crazy similar to a light wave both in terms of focus/stigmation and other alignment artefacts, and as such can be used to produce really cool/useful diffraction patterns. You can basically think of TEM like shining a light (electron beam) through a movie film cell (thin sample) forming an image on a screen (CCD camera).</p>
<p>There is also increasingly popular scanning TEM (STEM) where the beam is focused to a point and scanned on the sample (Think light focused with a magnifying glass), and an image is formed by measuring the number of electrons scattered into single a detector around the beam at each beam position. Electrons scattering at different angles give different types of contrast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of electron microscopes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Transmission Electron Microscopes: These work with the very thin samples (~100 nm) as a beam of electrons need to pass through them. When the electron enters the sample, depending on what material it experiences, it can be deflected from it's axis and/or lose energy and be blocked. Electrons travel to a scintillating plate (or camera sensor now) and depending on the number of electrons we get contrast. Heavier atoms cause greater deflection and show up darker (due to fewer electrons coming from that part of the sample). Thickness changes in samples also lead to variation in contrast, as thicker samples leads to electrons passing through more material and being blocked or deflected more. Finally, electrons can also be used for diffraction (much like x-ray diffraction) and this also leads to contrast in the sample, as in a polycrystalline samples. </p>
</li>
<li>Scanning Electron Microscope: Samples here can be much thicker as electrons don't need to pass through the sample. As the electron hits the sample, it leads to formation of secondary electrons which escape from the surface of the sample and hit the detector and give contrast. Additionally, the electron from the incident beam can be deflected back out of the sample (close to 180 degree turn) and this is also captured by the detector. Such an electron is called back-scatter electron. But sets of electrons have different energies and hence can be differentiated and detected separately if needed. Secondary electrons give more information from the surface. Back scatter electrons give more information from the inside of the sample. The energy and number of electrons depends on the material that is being studied. For Scanning Electrons Microscopes, the incident electron beam scans the sample surface, much like in old CRT televisions there was a rapid scan that generated the image. Hence, by scanning, the signal for each pixel is generated. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what was said below, for SEM an the image is basically an xy intensity plot. At teach point, the beam stops for a fraction of a second. and a count of the scattered electrons is measured whatever detector. For secondary electrons, the image contrast is determined by the angle of the surface hit, and where the detector is within the chamber. The &quot;light&quot; looks like it comes from the detector because whatever is facing towards or more directly in line with the detector will have larger signal.
For TEM its like projecting light through something and then looking at the image of whatever is blocked that is projected below, except with electrons and a bit more complications.
