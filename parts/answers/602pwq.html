		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There could be many reasons for content not being available in a specific region. A few examples:</p>
<ol>
<li>The content owner wants you to get the content in another way (popular for sporting events where the content provider will do a local blackout to increase game attendance numbers)</li>
<li>Monopoly; a conflicting provider has signed an exclusive deal with your area that bars them from allowing other vendors</li>
<li>The business environment is such that the content provider is refusing to do business in that area for a number of reasons.</li>
<li>The content distributor doesn't have the rights to distribute this content in that region. (Ex. Netflix goes to Disney and wants to purchase the exclusive rights to distribute Disney content throughout Europe. Amazon comes along and goes to Disney and Disney says no can do about Europe, you're still free to distribute in other areas but Netflix owns distribution rights in Europe)</li>
</ol>
<p>I'm sure there are others. Also number 4 is probably most likely for where you know they have the content but just don't show in your region.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what's already been said, there are sometimes legal or regulatory reasons. For example, where movies are concerned, censors in Europe tend to be more tolerant of sex but less tolerant of violence than their North American counterparts. Some European countries have trouble with games that glorify or make light of the Third Reich.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Game costs $60.<br />
For countries A that's ok and affordable<br />
For countries B that's very expensive and a few days worth of work<br />
The game would have to cost like $20 in countries B to make it as affordable<br />
The region lock is the only thing stopping countries A from buying the game from countries B for 1/3th the price (online, delivery).<br />
Selling your product in huge amounts in countries B for pretty cheap while not selling much in countries A for regular price is bad for business.   </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of what's already been said, region lock also goes back to a time when media was released at vastly different times depending on location. Now, most things get a near-simultaneous release worldwide, but pre-2000, Europe might have to wait up to a year to get a movie made in the US.</p>
<p>Original region lock was usually physical, like SNES cartridges being different shapes so they wouldn't fit in foreign consoles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I didn't see any answers that were satisfying to me. </p>
<p>Region locks on film and TV come from funding of movies and regional requirements.</p>
<p>An independent movie distributor has a very limited area they can serve. It takes real local knowledge to know how well a movie will do, to have the local marketing connections, etc. </p>
<p>These independent movie distributors buy only the region they actually know. So a small distributor might buy movies for only the Benelux region (actually exists, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg). Now if NetFlix or anyone else wants that movie in Benelux, it has to be licensed from that small distributor.</p>
<p>With over 300 regions around the world, you would imagine this is complex, you would be correct.</p>
<p>Movies are made this way because movies are expensive to make, and each region is only a small portion of the overall value for the movie.</p>
<p>This has lead to other complications. Certain regions, like India, have a long process to have a movie approved for distribution. By separating India out from the rest of the world that delay only affects India. Other regions have language requirements. The US actually has accessibility requirements that every movie have English subtitles.</p>
<p>All these local rules make it very hard to release a movie worldwide. Just look at the backlash even Disney experienced because Beauty and the Beast has a &quot;gay moment&quot; that is not allowed in Malaysia.</p>
<p>We are seeing normalization of the rules. The EU has been debating for a couple years now forcing all of the EU to be one region for distribution. This change is a subject of heavy debate within the film and television industry. If you imagine those debates are complex, once again you would be correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
