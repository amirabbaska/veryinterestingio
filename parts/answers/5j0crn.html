I've lived in Europe too, and haven't noticed any difference between there and US. Do you mean the ~8 inches of space between the floor and bottom of door/walls? Or the cracks where the seams of the door and wall panels meet?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Large tolerances (causing gaps) are cheap. If it's a tight fit it several hinges have to happen:</p>
<p>-The doors need to be made out of high quality material. A material that does not shrink and swell with temperature. If the door shrinks or grows with temp/humidity, it may not close, making it useless.</p>
<p>-The hinges need to be very strong, if the hinges become loose and there is only 1/8&quot; (or say, 1-2mm) gap the door may not close, making it useless.</p>
<p>-The machines that cut and mold the door needs to be more expensive and precise. If you have the doors nearly touching, the manufacturing process has no margin for error.</p>
<p>-Higher quality install. Some minimum wage employee can be off by quite a bit while installing the door if there is a full inch gap. With the geometry of a door, if you are off my a mm at the top you may be off by 4mm at the bottom. A large gap makes this OK.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ventalation: same reason the door does not go to the floor.</p>
</li>
<li>distance to gap. The gap seems large because you are really close to it when sitting, you can see super clearly when looking out it. Your face is likely only a foot or two away from the gap. You can see an entire standing person on the other side. However, someone who is 4 feet away from the door will only be able to see a sliver of you on the other side. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One, it makes the whole place easier to clean. You can hose down the floors in one go and there are not so many joins between the walls and the floors for gunk to build up. In fact, many American toilets connect at the wall and not the floor so it's easy to clean underneath.</p>
<p>Two, it's so that people can see what you're doing in there. It discourages drug taking or people having sex in the cubicles because it's obvious what's going on. Also if someone passes out on the toilet it's easier for people to notice -- in a fully obscured stall someone could lie in there for a long time. It may also just discourage people for sitting in there for longer than necessary.</p>
<p>Lastly, it's cheaper and easier. Divisions like that can be deployed in any room regardless of the flatness of the floor, or the height of the room, etc. Building divisions that actually fit floor to ceiling might require custom cutting and fitting, that might happen in a big building with dozens of identical toilets but for the odd public toilet cheap and easy is the way people will go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every one here is wrong, no one works in construction evidently.</p>
<p>The reason for the gaps are that the walls are premade and the gapping ensures rapid installation in any construction (including poorly square and plumb) and also allows for poor maintenance with continued function, ie door and frames etc come out of alignment and square yet door will still close and lock etc.  This allows the units to be made, installed and maintained CHEAPER and FASTER.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From America. Been to Europe. I think we have more gaps in the States. Specifically between the walls of the stall. Most likely because we use cheaper mass produced stall units that can be tossed together quickly. We also typically have a larger gap between the floor and the bottom of the stall. I think this is so people don't feel private enough to have sex in the bathroom, or jack off, or shoot up some IV drugs, since someone might see them. Although I'm positive that this does the stop anyone... I've been in a truck stop bathroom in Oklahoma at 2 am... No one gives a shit if you can see them......</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
