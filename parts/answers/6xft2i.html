		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a company decides to price their AAA game at $70 while all other games are at $60, they will get a huge wave of negative publicity. The higher price sticks out from all the other games. Other gamers will complain that the company is trying to set a new standard for pricing. No company wants to risk this backlash.</p>
<p>Instead, companies have embraced new methods of earning money. $60 today is worth much less than $60 two decades ago and games are getting more expensive to develop. For example, games were still priced at mostly $60 in 1996: <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/old-toys-r-us-catalog-2012-12" target="_blank">http://www.businessinsider.com/old-toys-r-us-catalog-2012-12</a> . $60 in 1996 is worth $92 in 2017 based on the CPI inflation calculator.</p>
<p>Rather than risking bad press, companies are now releasing base game at $60 with higher priced options for Deluxe or Collector's Editions. DownLoadable Content (DLC) is now standard with an option for a Season Pass which raises the overall price of the game during its lifetime. Lastly, games now have microtransations where you either directly buy digital items or pay to have a chance to get items (essentially digital gambling). This makes buying into the game a &quot;service&quot; in order for people to continue spending.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Game price point used to be $50 a game</p>
<p>Consoles used to sell at a price point where the average console would lose money when sold. (Remember this is back when technology was way more expensive) The expectancy was that they would make up that loss on games sold. The first 3 games a console owner bought would make up for that loss (The average console owner bought more than 8 games per year). </p>
<p>Console systems used to have a 3 year life cycle. When the XBOX 360 was released, the expected life cycle was increased to last at least 7 years (It actually could have lasted 10 years).</p>
<p>When the 360 was released in '04, Xbox raised the price per game to $60 to help paying for the increased technology per console. Sony followed with the price increase. The price raise was said to be temporary...</p>
<p>In '07, the industry put out a press release saying the gaming industry could go back to pricing games at $50 but they could go even further to $40 &amp; still profit.</p>
<p>At that point, the market had already showed they were willing to pay $60 &amp; the publishers didn't lower prices. </p>
<p>It was around that point, publishers started selling $40 DLC raising the true price point to $100 per game (If you want the full game). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a steal really when you consider that a movie is 2 hours of entertainment for $20<del>-$30</del>, you're paying about $10/he for entertainment.  Most games take about 30-60 hours to complete, so you're only really paying $1-$2/hr for your entertainment.  If the margins were the same, we'd pay $600-$1800 for a game.  Games are a way better entertainment value than movies.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a price that consumers will pay and that a game can make a profit on. That's the short answer. </p>
<p>The longer answer is that it depends on what platform the game is intended for. </p>
<p>PC - All of the hardware costs are paid for by the consumer with no subsidies. There can be little to no publishing or licensing fees that have to be paid by a developer and so much of the cost of a game goes directly into their pockets. This results in PC games often being less expensive than consoles even though they tend to be higher quality. Prior to the existence of $60 cross platform console games, pc games tended to be more variable in their cost even when brand new games came out. Some games might cost $20 brand new, others might cost $200 (for office programs etc). But when consoles adopted the $60 new game price, many pc games followed suit. </p>
<p>Consoles - Developing hardware for new game consoles is expensive, and the actual costs of the hardware themselves often exceed the asking price of the console. This means when a new console is released, even if you don't count the millions of dollars spent developing it, and just look at &quot;How much does it cost to build one&quot;, they are often sold at a loss. A console that takes $500 to make might be sold for $400, at a loss. However the games for consoles have traditionally been more expensive in order to offset this cost. So consoles are cheaper up front, and the console makers make their money back from game sales. They do this by charging licensing fees to game makers to publish on their system, and this helps offset the cost of the hardware. Later as console hardware becomes cheaper to produce due to mass production and cheaper sourcing of parts, they might even turn a profit on the console sales as well. </p>
<p>Modern game development takes considerably more time, money, and effort than it has in the past but the cost of games has mostly stayed the same. This is partly due to having more gamers willing to purchase these games. For example say that in 1990 there were 50,000 gamers and games cost $60 that might mean that if 40% buy your game, you might make 1.2 million and cover your million dollar development costs. Now in 2017 there might be 200,000,000 gamers and if even 30% buy your game you have made 3.6 billion dollars! So even though the games cost the same, the fact that there are more gamers buying them, helps keep game costs low through economy of scale. This helps cover the much more expensive development costs of AAA titles. </p>
<p>As long as the number of new gamers keeps growing, and they keep  buying games, then everybody pays less for those games. If the number of new gamers started to drop, and if the total number of gamers should begin to decline, and people bought less games, then they would have no choice but to increase the cost of the games since less are being sold. Or they could cut their development costs and make simpler, cheaper games. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
