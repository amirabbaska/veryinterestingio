		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on what you consider &quot;fusion power&quot;. Starting and maintaining a fusion reaction for some time? Been there, done that. Getting more energy out than you put in? On the todo-list, check back at the end of the next decade. Commercially viable fusion reactors? Ehhh...</p>
<p>Scientists have already generated fusion reactors in various tokamak-reactors (donut-shaped) around the world. The problem is that these tokamaks were too small and more energy was used up sustaining the reaction than was produced. These reactors were meant purely for research.</p>
<p>Currently under construction somewhere in France is ITER, which will be, with some distance, the largest tokamak reactor and will be the first fusion reactor to generate more power than it uses. But it's still very much a research-device, loaded with all kinds of sensors and with a design goal of sustaining the reaction for only 1000 seconds. Parts of the reactor design haven't been finalized yet and are still under research.</p>
<p>The goal is to have the first plasma established around the turn of the decade and the start of fusion operation in the second half of the next decade.</p>
<p>Competing with tokamaks are so-called stellarators, which use a more complex shape to make the fusion plasma easier to stabilize. Recently, the Wendelstein 7-X hit the news because it had created a very high temperature hydrogen plasma. The W7-X, however, is not designed to actually start a fusion reaction, it is primarily a design study into the viability of the concept and the properties of such high temperature plasmas.</p>
<p>Following ITER and W7-X, the DEMO project is the project that will involve the creation of the first commercially viable fusion reactor, able to operate fusion plasmas for long periods of time, while extracting energy out of it. The project is still in an extremely early stage and most recent estimates of when it will become operational point to the second half of the 2040's, but this will greatly depend on what is learned at ITER.</p>
<p>Actual commercial implementation of fusion power will follow the successful operation of DEMO, building on what is learned in that device.</p>
<p>So yeah, that's about 50 years away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm surprised that no one has mentioned the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polywell" target="_blank">Polywell</a> yet. It uses electrostatic confinement, magnetic mirroring, and plasma pressure to generate fusion. It's much smaller and simpler than a tokamak or stellarator, and would cost a lot less to prove or disprove as a practical fusion reactor, on the order of <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/low-cost-fusion-project-steps-out-shadows-looks-money-n130661" target="_blank">10s of millions of dollars</a> instead of <a href="https://www.iter.org/faq#Do_we_really_know_how_much_ITER_will_cost" target="_blank">10s of billions of dollars like ITER</a>.</p>
<p>The Polywell is one of the few fusion technologies that offers the possibility of &quot;aneutronic&quot; fusion using a pB11 (proton / Boron-11) reaction. It's about 10x harder to achieve than D-T (deuterium-tritium) or D-D (deuterium-deuterium) fusion, but it has the nice property that it generates near zero neutron radiation.</p>

The team would be able to progress a lot faster if they had more money.</p>
<p>It was invented by Robert Bussard, an American physicist and rocket scientist. (If the name sounds familiar, it's because ships in Star Trek use one of his proposed inventions, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bussard_ramjet" target="_blank">Bussard collector</a>, to gather hydrogen gas from the interstellar medium.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Am I the only one that thinks <em>this</em> should be our #1 science policy priority?  This seems more important than space travel because it would affect more people more quickly; more important than global warming because it could be key in reducing our effects on the environment;  at least as important as cheap desalinization since the extra energy could help that project along with other project involving feeding and housing our planet's growing population.  More important than disease research, since some of the top killers are really energy/sanitation issues (to the degree that they are not actually just political issues).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/1RTJabAxJmo" target="_blank">This</a> is a video of the director of MIT's plasma science and fusion center talking about the current state of fusion, and at the end he talks about the so-called &quot;high-field&quot; approach to magnetic fusion energy. They have a reactor design called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARC_fusion_reactor" target="_blank">ARC</a>, which is just a tokamak reactor that uses new high-temperature superconducting material that can go up to about twice as high a magnetic field strength as current, conventional superconductors.</p>
<p>Fusion performance scales as either magnetic field squared or cubed, depending on how exactly you define performance, but that's a gain of between a factor of 4 and a factor of 8 with these new superconductors. ITER and most other modern fusion devices use older superconductors, and the prospect of using them for a powerplant was always going to be a bit iffy. With better superconductors, it becomes a lot easier. There are still inherent issues with tokamaks that need to be addressed, but it's the closest to having a real break-even (or better) fusion reaction so far. </p>
<p>Also, the question for fusion at this point is not really &quot;when&quot;, but &quot;how much money&quot;. If you go by the fusion research budget of the EU or USA, be ready to wait for a few decades until China catches up with the western fusion programs scientifically. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tokamak isn't the only way to potentially achieve fusion. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility#DOE_Report.2C_July_19.2C_2012" target="_blank">The National Ignition Facility</a>, for example, uses laser pressure.</p>
<p>Of course, NIF didn't do so well. The experiment works by using lasers to push material in a pellet together and get it to fuse. But with the current pellet design they discovered they needed about 3 times more powerful lasers... not really feasible. Their funding got cut in 2012.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT1:</strong> Saying the laser needs to be 3 times more powerful isn't quite accurate. The pellet targets as they currently work require 3 times as much energy, which would damage the optics. But a better pellet design could fix it.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong> The funding didn't get cut. But they were mandated to stop focussing on fusion and focus more on fundamental physics.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT3:</strong> NIF has <em>two</em> funding sources: one for bomb research one for fusion power. That's why I seemed to think they just did fusion and others seemed to think they just did bombs. It's actually two huge, fully-funded projects using the same facility.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
