		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soaking a wound in salt water can kill bacteria because it essentially draws the water out of the bacterial cells. However it's important to note that for wound care soaking in salt water is generally not recommended. This is because while salt kills bacteria it also kills healthy cells that are necessary for wound healing.  </p>
<p>When you get a cut the best thing to do is irrigate it with normal saline (which can be bought at any drug store) or regular tap water. This is just to get whatever immediate dead skin, dirt, bacteria are there out. The next step is to cover the wound. </p>
<p>Another false remedy is hydrogen peroxide. Although it kills bacteria through a different mechanism then salt it is not recommended for wound care because it can prolong wound healing. Hydrogen peroxide kills bacteria but also kills good skin cells </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt is toxic to many organisms, especially if they havent tried adapting to it. Your body can combat the new salt introduction by dispersing it through the body, as well as the lymphic system, but the foreign organisms dont have that luck of mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of diffusion If you have a permeable barrier (ie your mouth skin), salt/water/the like can pass through it, going from the side with more stuff in less space to the side with less stuff in more space.</p>
<p>Now, let's say the inside of your mouth skin has an infection. There's a lot of water there now. If you swish salt water, as per the exaplanation above, there's more salt (stuff) in less space (water) in your salt water conpared to the infection stuff. Therefore, the water from inside your infection bubble goes into the salt water (since this way there's an equal amount of salt per water inside and outside your mouth skin, and salt can't really go through your mouth skin). Now your infection doesn't have enough water to survive and it dies.</p>
<p>yaaaay</p>
<p>Edit: what /u/matador2553 said is good too. I just explained how the bacteria dies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You use osmosis to kill the bacteria. Stuff like salt, honey, vinegar, and anything super sugar drain the water from bacteria and kill it.
So yes a super salty water will kill the bacteria, it will also kill some of your cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a process called osmosis. Osmosis keeps a balance of concentrations both inside and outside of bacteria. So if you put salt water on a wound, the concentration of salt in the salt water is very high, however, it is very low inside of the bacteria. Due to osmosis, the salt will enter through the cell membrane of the bacteria and go inside of it. The bacteria will eventually be holding too much salt water and it will break open the cell membrame which eventually kills it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
