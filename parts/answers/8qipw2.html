		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, this could happen in theory. The reason that spoiled food makes us humans sick is because of the growth of harmful microorganisms and the subsequent release of toxins from those microbes. Many of the microorganisms that would grow on our human food would also grow on the soft tissue in insect bodies. However, due to our differing physiology, the things that make humans sick are seldom the same things that make animals sick, and so the insects that feed on other insects wouldn’t necessarily get sick from salmonella. It seems very likely that some of the microbes that grow on dead insects might produce toxins that could be harmful to scavengers but most animals that feed on dead things are adapted to handle the bacteria and fungi that grow on this refuse. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Soft bodied insects such as aphids tend to fully decay in the hours to days range, after that there really isn’t anything left.</p>
<p>However hard bodied and/or dried insects such as beetles, some flies, spiders, etc. tend to stick arounds for a <em>very</em> long time. The Guiness Book of World Records shows the oldest known pinned insect from a natural collection at around 300 years old, which is far younger than the lice found on mummies and combs dating back thousands of years. Given the proper conditions dried dead insects could remain around for thousands of years without significant signs of decay.</p>
<p>So really it just depends <em>what kind</em> of insect you’re talking about, but most tend to stay in pretty good condition and even the ones that dont will provide nutrition for microscopic organisms for a very long time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My bearded dragon gets sick from dead insects, by observation it seems dead insect is bad for eating. Also when crickets start dying in their container, if I don't remove the dead ones the rest will swiftly follow, but I think that's to do with ammonia getting released. If that kills the others then eating the dead ones can't be good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parasitoid wasps use venom to either totally or temporarily paralyze their host insects. For instance, a caterpillar will rot and dry up within a day or so if killed. A parasitoid female will lay eggs on the caterpillar after &quot;stinging&quot; it to paralyze it. The caterpillar does not rot, instead it remains alive but paralyzed for over a week while the wasp eggs hatch (24-48 hours) then wasp larvae feed on the paralyzed caterpillar until they pupate, 12 days later.</p>
<p>Other parasitoids go one step further: the host insect not only stays alive, but it continues feeding and growing, providing more nourishment for the parasitoid wasp larva growing within. I have seen aphids still alive, with wiggling legs and still feeding, while 90% of their body is filled with a wasp larva.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I breed Dubai blaptica roaches for show animal feed and this is actually a big discussion.  And I don’t see anyone here mentioning the most important part, the gut load.  </p>
<p>Back in 1955 they carre d out a set of experiments on food absorption by periplanta americana and found that absorption/digestion rates in some insects lead to a potential for food borne pathogens to enter the food chain. It can take so long to digest food that Bacteria bloom, there is a suggestion that this is evolutionary in nature due to a potential higher calorie count. </p>
<p>So as far as a roach goes, it’s more of a concern about what they eat being bad than the roach going bad.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
