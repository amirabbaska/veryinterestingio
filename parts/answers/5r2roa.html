		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi - this is David Goldenberg from MinuteEarth. We’re excited to chat with you about our new video on growing human organs in pigs. Here’s another great source of info as we get into the details: an article from Friday’s New York Times: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/science/chimera-stemcells-organs.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/science/chimera-stemcells-organs.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0</a>. From the article: “Almost no one wants a talking pig.”</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thought of another question: why don't pig (or rat) bodies reject the foreign organs they grow? I would expect an autoimmune response. Does the animal's immune response need to be suppressed, or does their body accept the foreign organs as native for some reason?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is the physiology of humans  and pigs so similar that there is a realistic chance of pigs surviving to adulthood with (presumably) human sized and shaped organs? I know that simply in terms of size some human and pig organs are similar, but I still find it surprising that human organs could functionally &quot;fit&quot; in the body of a pig. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a pig were engineered to grow a human brain, and it was otherwise healthy into adulthood, is there any evidence that the pig might be capable of more human-level reasoning? Do we have any idea how a pig with a human brain might differ from a normal pig with respect to its behavior?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
