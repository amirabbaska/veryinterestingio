		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes there are subtle differences. Fuel (at least in Europe, and I assume in the rest of the world) must comply to a certain specification. This fuel sits in huge tanks at the depot. During the loading of the road tankers additives are added to the fuel, these additives are usually very expensive, and a very small dose is required for one tanker batch. Additives are usually (not always) exclusive for a certain oil company like shell or BP - they have their own stash and dedicated pipes at the depot. But the main fuel still comes out of the same large tank(s). So there is a difference between the premium and normal fuels, there are things blended into the fuel. How much of a difference these additives make I don’t know though…</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
