		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're in fight or flight response and your sympathetic nervous system is activated. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system actually shuts down saliva production, digestion and other rest and digest functions so you can use all your available energy to fight or run away. Some people think the nervous swallow is because saliva was building up before production was shut off, I personally believe it's a nervous reaction like saying 'umm'. It gives you that extra second before you need to respond. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
