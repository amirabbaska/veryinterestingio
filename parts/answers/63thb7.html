		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The real measure is how long it takes the average worker to earn enough to afford a given item.   </p>
<p>So say it's the year 1900, and your rent is $5 per month and you earn 25 cents an hour, so it takes you 20 hours of labor every month to afford your rent.</p>
<p>So in the year 2017, your rent is $1000 per month and you earn $25 per hour.   So it takes you 40 hours per month to earn enough money to pay your rent.   So your dollar has 50% less spending power from then until now.   </p>
<p>But this is purely speculation... obviously there were a million different types of apartments/houses/mortgages back in the year 1900 and the same applies today, it's difficult to make a true &quot;average&quot; for any of that, same with wages, it's difficult to say that the average worker today makes a certain amount.  We have people earning $7 per hour and people earning $250 per hour, sometimes in the same building.   </p>
<p>The true Consumer Price Index tracks hundreds of items and tries to quantify this sort of thing, but many argue that it's not very accurate.   In 1900, you probably got a room with a bed for your rent, and no kitchen, and a communal bath at the end of the hall that everyone used.   Is it a fair analogy to compare that to a modern apartment, wired for cable and internet, with a dishwasher and garbage disposal, hot water heater and air conditioning?   Probably not.   So you see how hard it is to compare then to now.   Just look at how much cars have changed over the past 50 years, so it's hardly fair to complain about the price going up when you are getting so much better of a product for your money.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To understand inflation you need to understand the difference between money/currency and wealth.</p>
<p>We create wealth all of the time. Let say you pay 1 millions dollars to mine materials out of the ground and you sell those material for a profit. That profit is new wealth that you created. Then someone could buy a bunch of materials and pay workers to create a product that they will also see with a profit, creating even more wealth. We create wealth with human work (physical or intellectual) and from natural resources.</p>
<p>Now if you continue to create wealth, but your amount of currency stay the same, then the value of that currency will increase. People will want to trade more currency that there is so currency will become rare and the value of that currency will increase over time. That's deflation and it's bad. It's bad because it become more profitable to keep your money than invest it. And without investment, you can't create as much wealth.</p>
<p>So the solution is to print more currency as wealth increase in your country. To ideal goal would be to print the exact amount of currency as your country create new wealth. The problem is that it's hard to estimate the exact amount of wealth that will be create so you can print the exact amount of currency you need.</p>
<p>The value of your currency depend on the law of supply and demand. Your production of currency if you supply of that currency. And the amount of wealth you create is the demand. If you over produce your currency you have a higher supply than your demand so the value of your currency decrease over time. If you under produce your currency, well it's like I said at the beginning. You have a lower supply of currency than the demand (wealth). So your currency increase in value.</p>
<p>So now you have a choice. You know you can't produce the exact right amount of currency, so you can either over produce currency, which create inflation, or under produce currency which lead to deflation. The answer to that is that a little bit of inflation is better than a little bit of deflation. Because a little bit of deflation still incentive people to keep their money, while a little bit of inflation incentive people to invest their money. And investment is an engine of economic growth.</p>
<p>So yes. Our currency have lose spending power since 1970. But we have a lot more currency, so we actually have a higher spending power. Well, the country as a whole have a higher spending power. Individual can lose their spending power if there isn't a good redistribution of wealth in your country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It sort of means that. Your grandparents might have said &quot;back in my day you could buy a loaf of bread for a nickel!&quot; There's truth to that, today a loaf of bread cost $1-$3 or so. However back when the Model T (first mass produced car) was being made they paid their workers $5 a day and that was a very high paying job. Today people get paid $7 an hour due to minimum wage laws. </p>
<p>So inflation only gives part of the story and isn't really a bad thing. Inflation is generally under control of the Federal Reserve and they try to keep it around 2% or so. In doing so goods and products rise in price by about 2% and due to that workers ask for a 2% raise to meet that price, which in turn can make prices rise again etc. </p>
<p>Really what you need to look at is the median salary and a standard 'economic basket'. The basket is a term that basically means take a bunch of standard stuff people have to buy each year and compare that year over year. If the basket is rising in price faster than the median salary we have a problem. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably, it depends on what you buy.  Inflation is measured by comparing prices of a basket of goods over time, but that's complicated by some goods changing.  A can of coke hasn't changed very much since it was invented, but television sets or mobile phones have changed pretty dramatically since the 1970s.  </p>
<p>So when measuring for inflation you have to estimate how much a good has changed over the period (if your parents had a 25&quot; color CRT TV in the 1970s that cost $700, and you have a 50&quot; flat screen that cost $400, has the price fallen by 42% ($400 to $700), by 71% ($28 per inch vs $8 dollars per inch), or has the price risen because you have to spend $600 per year on cable (or $120 on Netflix) while they watched free broadcast.  </p>
<p>30% less spending power means that when someone made estimates for all the changes that have happened technically to products, as best they can, $1,000 today buys about the same amount of stuff that $700 did in 1970 (however that includes salaries).  </p>
<p>It's like that because we have a money supply that grows, which allows easy financing of the economy's capital requirements and gives the Federal Reserve a healthy amount of ability to control the economy's growth rate via bank interest rates.  When our money supply was relatively fixed (because it was based on how much gold had been found) there were short swings of inflation and deflation that occasionally made debt very, very costly.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since 1913, the USD has lost about 95% of its buying power!  (1913 is significant because that's when the US government created a new central bank after we killed it, twice).  </p>
<p>The way I explain buying power to people is to explain the relationship between labor and what you can do with the fruits of your labor.  </p>
<p><strong>Money is simply a medium of exchange</strong>; meaning, it is a means by which I can exchange 1 hour of my labor for my boss for your book.  That is, you don't care that I did 1 hour of work for my boss.  However, my boss gives me pieces of paper that you can use to buy your lunch.  I want your book and you want my pieces of paper so you can buy lunch with them.  </p>
<p>So my 1 hour of work turns into your lunch through my $10.  </p>
<p>Since the US Government divorced the USD from its gold and silver backing, the USD has turned into a fiat money (a more complex term that just simply means nothing is backing it - you cannot take $1 to the government to get the gold or silver backing it).  Even though the spending power of a money backed by gold or silver will fluctuate, the fluctuation is not controlled by any single group.  Now, the USD is controlled, mainly, by the Treasury and the Federal Reserve (it is largely controlled by the faith put in it by the world market for USD - however, that market is heavily influenced by the Treasury and the Fed).  </p>
<p><strong>In short, as the supply of a good or service increases, holding other variables constant, the value of each unit of the good or service tends to fall.</strong> The same is true for money.  If today there are $100 in circulation, each $1 you own can, let's say, buy you a gallon of milk.  If tomorrow there are $200 in circulation, then, most likely, each gallon of milk might cost $2 (or much more depending on whether a panic sets in!)  </p>
<p>But the spending power of a unit of money goes down (one dollar could buy you a whole gallon but that fell to two dollars per gallon after the change).  </p>
<p>The same is true with labor.  If today there are 100 people who can perform the task of painting my car and each of them are willing to charge $10 to do the job, and then tomorrow there are 200 people willing to do it, they'll push the price down to $5 or lower!  The power of that unit of labor falls as the supply of it increases.  </p>
<p>It is like that because all valuation is subjective.  You subjectively value my $10 based upon what it can do for you (buy your lunch) and I subjectively value your book to be worth about $10 which is worth about 1 hour of my labor and my boss values 1 hour of my labor to be worth about $10 (on and on and on).  If the total number of units of currency in circulation increases, the person providing your lunch might no longer value your $10 (that you got from me) to be worth the lunch because he had to pay more for the constituent parts and then demand $15 for the lunch!  </p>
<p>Anyway, </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> <strong>All valuation is subjective</strong>.  The power of a dollar is what you can exchange it for and the function of a dollar is a present store your past labor (credit is a present store of your future labor).  <strong>As the supply of dollars increases (by the treasury or the fed) the per-unit value falls because each individual subjectively tends to have a lower valuation of what he or she can exchange it for</strong>.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
