<p>However, there are auditory motion aftereffects (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03204166" target="_blank">Grantham &amp; Wightman 1979</a>; <a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03212091.pdf" target="_blank">Dong et al. 2000</a> &lt;- pdf!) where interaural difference can make it seem like a sound is moving left-to-right around your head and you can get aftereffects for subsequently presented sounds.</p>
<p>There are also aftereffects for temporal duration, which may be closer to what you have in mind: after repeatedly hearing a tone of a particular duration, subsequently presented tones seem to last for a shorter amount of time than they actually do (<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03207361.pdf" target="_blank">Walker, Irion, &amp; Gordon, 1981</a> &lt;- pdf!; <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep10124" target="_blank">Li, Yuan, &amp; Huang, 2015</a>). </p>
<p>Finally, there are aftereffects to changes in volume: after adapting to a gradually loudening tone, subsequent tones will appear to get quieter (<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03206201.pdf" target="_blank">Reinhardt-Rutland &amp; Anstis, 1982</a> &lt;-pdf!). Similar effects exist for frequency modulation instead of volume (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-014-0812-2" target="_blank">Alais, Orchard-Mills, &amp; Van der Burg 2015</a>). There are also aftereffects to frequency more generally (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1113/jphysiol.1972.sp009962/full" target="_blank">Kay &amp; Matthews 1972</a>; <a href="http://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.382792" target="_blank">Regan &amp; Tanley 1979</a>).</p>
<p>So, in short, there are auditory aftereffects similar to the waterfall effect for externally generated sounds. Not really sure how that applies to internally generated speech.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
