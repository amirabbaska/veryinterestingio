		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Basically sound has a huge problem crossing a barrier where there is a large &quot;Impedance mismatch&quot;  like between water and air.  When sound hits that &quot;soft release&quot; (because the air's impedance is much less than the water impedance) it gets reflected back into the water and doesn't radiate out efficiently.  You have a similar problem of sound starting in the air and moving to the water.</p>
<p>However, for sound created in water, you should be able to hear it in the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes you can hear it perfectly. I am a commercial diver. We use an underwater speaker designed for divers as an emergency recall or communication system. It's about 5 grand for the whole set up but it's amazing. We spend long hours at a shallow depth, so often we play music and it travels way further then you might think. </p>
<p>Actually it's cheaper than that. Lubell labs makes ours. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can. In fact, there are purpose made speakers you can buy for your pool. It's pretty trippy the first time you hear a song underwater.
The Broadmoor Hotel and Resort had them in their main pool back in the 90's. Not sure common they are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A speaker is only a diaphram that is moved back and forth so quickly using magnets that it creates vibrations in the air that our eardrums pick up.</p>
<p>So in water there is a higher density of particles and thus would actually transmit sound way more efficiently.</p>
<p>This is why when in a pool underwater you hear everything (produced underwater) amplified.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a swim coach and during our practice a synchro swim team also practices in the diving well. They play music everyday from speakers and you can hear the music perfectly underwater all the way in our lanes. So I don't see why an under water speaker would be any different. Maybe it would, idk I'm just a swim coach. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
