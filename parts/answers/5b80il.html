		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fire works a little differently than people imagine.</p>
<p>When you look at something like a campfire, the actual wood isn't on fire. (Well, it's 'on fire', but combustion isn't occurring much at all on the wood's surface.)  And the flames themselves are not super-heated <em>gases</em> emitting blackbody radiation.</p>
<p>Now, the gas particles are hot, and they <em>are</em> emitting red and even yellow light, but there's so little mass that the light from the gas is barely visible at all.</p>
<p>Instead, when you look at a fire, what you're seeing are little soot particles that are being vaporized off of the wood from the intense heat, and being carried upwards by the convection.  That glowing soot is what provides the flame with enough mass to emit enough visible light for us to see it.</p>
<p>Now, this soot is plenty hot - well past its flash point.  So as soon as it runs into enough oxygen it will burn.  In a steady state flame, there is very little oxygen near the wood, so you have a lot more unburnt soot, so the flame is both redder (cooler) and brighter.  As you go outwards (upwards due to gravity) the soot starts encountering more oxygen. So more soot burns and the flame gets hotter.  So the flame is simultaneously more yellow - hotter, and dimmer - less soot, so less dense, so less overall light.  As you get towards the tips of the flame, that's the boundary where there is basically more than enough oxygen that pretty much all the soot burns. So the flame is technically hottest there, but there's also no soot left - just gas - so the visible flame dies away.  The heat being generated all the way up the flame, mostly towards the tip, radiates back down and continually heats the wood, freeing more soot particles and continuing the cycle.</p>
<p>And if it's not hot enough, fewer soot particles are liberated, less oxygen is consumed, so the edges of the flame shrink, get closer to the wood, and thus heat the wood up more.  So there's a feedback system involved that will tend to keep the flames at some roughly constant height based on hot much fuel and oxygen you have available.</p>
<p>The reason that flame has so well-defined of edges is basically because if you consider diffusion of oxygen into oxygen-free gas, it's a pretty slow process.  If I take a tank of oxygen and a tank of nitrogen of equal pressure and attach them by a hose, the two gases won't really mix all that quickly.  An open flame is going to have a bit more active gas mixing, but it's a good first-order understanding on why there's such a well-defined, narrow barrier between <em>'not-enough'</em> and <em>'plenty-of'</em> oxygen for the soot to burn and thus for the flame to dissipate.</p>
<p>This is also why you can do cool party tricks like <a href="https://youtu.be/C5eTn5d0cvg?t=14s" target="_blank">re-lighting a candle from its smoke trail</a>  Smoke is basically unburnt soot - unburnt fuel.  This is why you can tell a smokey fire is too cold and inefficient - lots of smoke means that the fire doesn't keep the soot hot enough for it to ignite by time it gets access to oxygen. </p>
<p>This is also why when you blow on a flame, the flames get smaller while the fire seems to get hotter - you're providing extra oxygen into the flames - where flames are basically the area of superheated soot suspended in gas too deprived of oxygen to burn.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
<p>For a campfire, the wood is the fuel tank, the flames are the fuel line, and the tips of the flame are really the combustion chamber where most of the fuel gets burnt.  What you see as 'flame' is actually the super-heated fuel in the line, which hasn't ignited because it's oxygen deprived, but is hot enough to glow from the heat radiating from the combustion chamber (flame tips).  Once it gets far enough away that it has abundant oxygen, it all burns, heating up the fuel in the fuel line to keep it glowing, and signifying the edge of the flame, as there is no longer enough soot - enough mass - radiating blackbody emissions for you to see.</p>
<p><strong><em>Edit</em></strong> - This is what I get from doing things from memory.  Everything above is fine, but below in some of the responses, when talking about gas stoves I need to talk about where the blue color comes from - rather than blackbody radiation, the blue light comes specifically from chemical emission spectra as particular compounds gets Oxidized.  In a number of comments I mention Carbon Monoxide, CO, being combusted into CO2 as the culprit.  Wherever you see me say that, <em>please imagine instead I said &quot;C2, CH, and CO&quot;</em> as C2 and CH combusting into CO2 <em>also</em> emit blue light, and are far more <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/28/Spectrum_of_blue_flame.svg/479px-Spectrum_of_blue_flame.svg.png" target="_blank">responsible for the majority</a> of the blue light emissions than CO.  The general principle that a blue flame is a result of a hotter fire with excellent access to oxygen, and represents more complete combustion still holds.  Special thanks to /u/esquesque for correcting me.</p>
<p>Also I woke up today to discover that you guys all <em>really</em> love fire.  Can't blame you - it's fascinating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A flame of the type you're thinking of is incandescent soot particles (I.e. hot smoke). The soot is emitting something close to blackbody radiation, which causes the usual &quot;fire colour&quot;. The intensity of the emitted radiation is proportional to the fourth power of the temperature, so relatively small variations in temperature can create large differences in brightness, hence the sharp edges. </p>
<p>I believe most of the heat in e.g. a candle flame is being carried upwards by convection from the source, which leads to the predominantly vertical shape. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If you are more interested in the science of flames, I would recommend Michael Faraday's lecture series &quot;The Chemical History of a Candle&quot;. It's six short and approachable lectures for a general audience that not only breakdown everything you never knew you wanted to know about fire and a candle, but give a fantastic encapsulation of what is great about science. It's kind of a Victorian era Cosmos. </p>
<p>&quot;The Engineering Guy&quot; Bill Hammack <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0INsTTU1k2UCpOfRuMDR-wlvWkLan1_r" target="_blank">put together a video series</a> re-enacting the lectures as close to the original as he could, while also using the video format to allow visual aids and annotation of details that are not captured in reading the transcripts. It's a great watch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity. Hot gas rises. You see incandescent particles in the flame. The 'edge' is cooled by surrounding air and is too cold for you to see the IR coming from it. In space, fire burns in a spherical manner as you would expect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
