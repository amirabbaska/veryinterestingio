		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other responses have gone into what makes an individual long-lived. This post will address the question as OP phrased it: what determines the lifespan <em>of a species</em>? And what's the deal with human longevity?</p>
<p>Many people have a concept of aging that could be described as the &quot;wear-and-tear&quot; model. Basically, the notion is that as you go through life, you accumulate nicks and dings from macroscopic scars and stretch marks to accumulating microscopic injury and DNA damage. Eventually it's just too much and you run down. <em>It turns out this concept is markedly untrue, at least at the species level</em>.</p>
<p>Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, has been the workhorse of many experiments, including those studying longevity, life-history theory, and evolution. Many years ago, researchers working with flies did an evolution experiment. They selectively bred fruit flies for longevity, and in a remarkably short time they had flies with dramatically longer life-spans than is the norm. These flies weren't evolving novel genes in just a few generations, rather, they had recombined existing alleles in ways that lead to longevity. The important thing to note is what happened when these long-lived flies were re-introduced into a 'normal' population. Did these super-long-lived flies thrive? No, quite the contrary. Within a few short generations, any sign of longevity had disappeared. In competition with their 'normal' counterparts, they were immediately outcompeted. (I tried finding the original papers, here's a <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/97/7/3309.full" target="_blank">modern replication</a> of these sorts of studies, with more precision.)</p>
<p>What these researchers discovered was that while longevity is perfectly possible, and within the realm of already-existing genes in most populations, this potential isn't realized <em>because of trade-offs</em>. Increased longevity is exchanged for decreased fitness in other areas. Perhaps these long-lived flies in nature would be less likely to evade predators, have more difficulty finding food, or are less likely to find a mate. Everything has a cost. Note that this is different than the 'programmed' idea of death, that your genes have predetermined a time of death for you. In the life-history model of aging, it's not that DNA 'wants' an organism to die, far from it - it's just that other traits (that hurt longevity) are more directly advantageous to the propagation of genes, and so combinations of genes with these traits out-survive and out-reproduce the combinations that lead to longevity.</p>
<p>The immune system gets interesting. Unless something else kills it first, it's all but inevitable that an animal will die of cancer. The ticking clock of mutations accumulate, eventually leading cells to proliferate out of control, breaking internal apoptosis mechanisms, evading the immune system, and eventually killing the host organism by hogging the lion's share of nutrients and energy.</p>
<p>What exactly is a 'cancer resistance gene' or a 'cancer susceptibility gene'? Why would anything evolve a 'cancer susceptibility gene'? That doesn't make sense, and they don't. Rather, it's a gene that is perilously close to breaking something important, if it mutates. <em>Redundancy</em> is an important concept. If you have 3 copies of something important, you're more or less ok if 2 of them break. If you only have 1 copy, you will be in trouble quickly. Animals that tend to be long-lived, such as elephants and whales, tend to have many, multiply redundant copies of genes involved in important functions like apoptosis and immune regulation - the sorts of genes that when they break <del>tend to cause</del> are no longer able to stop cancer.</p>
<p>Humans don't seem to have nearly enough multiply-redundant copies of these sorts of genes to explain all of our longevity, while it might contribute somewhat. We don't look like elephants or whales in this respect. This sort of evolution towards longevity would reasonably be expected to take a relatively long time to evolve, as many duplication events would have to happen, and then spread through the population. </p>
<p>It seems humans are probably like the flies that were selectively bred specifically for longevity. In humans, the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/428128a" target="_blank">grandmother hypothesis</a>  conceives of human longevity as something that is directly advantageous to gene propagation (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandmother_hypothesis" target="_blank">wikipedia</a> introduces the concept well). It's a sort of grandiose kin selection, where elderly humans in prehistoric times were still able to contribute to the survival and reproductive fitness of their children, grandchildren, and extended relatives. Unlike other species that experience a rapid deterioration after their own ability to reproduce goes into decline (such as salmon after spawning), humans <em>could</em> contribute into their later years, and so longevity was selected for. Maybe we're not so unlike our experimental flies after all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolutionary biologist here, a lot of the posts here are accurately describing the mechanisms by which we are better protected from aging, but behind each of those is a genetic prerogative for longer life.</p>
<p>The first principle is that the fitness of an organism is defined as its ability to produce offspring which in turn survive to reproduce.</p>
<p>If humans live longer that a comparable species, it must be because of an increase in fitness. Some of the leading theories are longer term parental care or multi generational families.  Think about it this way: why should women ever go through menopause?  It's because having non reproductive women in the social group increases the fitness of her offspring. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>
<p>Metabolism. As a general rule, the slower the organism's metabolism, the longer it will usually live.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Growth rate. The slower the growth, the longer the lifespan.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From an evolutionary perspective, if an animal is likely to be eaten early on in its life, it doesn't make sense for that species to invest energy on lengthening its life. More likely, it would invest its energy in producing as many offspring as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>An animal that is not easily predated is more likely to invest energy in processes that lengthen lifespan, and focus on raising just a few offspring (quality vs. quantity).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting factoids:</p>
<p>Naked Mole Rats live up to 31years and are pretty much immune to cancer.  In fact researcher have trouble causing cancer even when they try. High-molecular-mass Hyaluronan in their bloodstream prevents cells from becoming overcrowded (as happens with tumors)</p>
<p>A clam named Ming was determined to be 507 years old at the time it was dredged and killed.</p>
<p>Also, a 390 year old Greenland shark was recently caught.  Apparently the age range from the tissues they collected ranged between 275 and 500, with 390 being the most likely average.  400 years old... damn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
