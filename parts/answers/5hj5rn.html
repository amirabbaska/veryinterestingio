		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi there! The answer to this question is about the units of the absorbance spectrum you have shown us. The units are in wavenumbers, not nanometers. 600 wavenumbers is approximately 17,000 nm. Hope that clears things up!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've mistaken the wavenumber for wavelength.</p>
<p>700cmâ€“1 = 14285.71 nm</p>
<p>So, far outside of the visible spectrum, into the infrared. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm thinking spectral sensitivity might have some influence on this. The human eye actually has rather different sensitivity to different wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The sensitivity rapidly falling off close to the UV and IR region. Cameras might very well mimick this effect to make pictures look as natural as possible. This would make detecting weak CO2 absorption in the far red part of the visible region rather difficult.</p>
<p>The videos are using an IR camera which detect thermal radiation. Therefore the CO2 might show up due to its low temperature and IR emission. This does not really relate to the absorption of IR light by the gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was a long time ago but I used to calibrate visibility meters for the defence forces (I think they were used at airfields) and pure CO2 was used as a calibration gas.
I forget most of the details, I remember they used a small IR gas laser and a motorised chopper and simple optics, CO2 gave a quite drastic response to IR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
