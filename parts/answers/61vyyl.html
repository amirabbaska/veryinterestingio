		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/Ender37 is wrong. The surface of a curling rink is not smooth, but is pebbled. This effect is achieved by spraying drops of water onto the ice that freeze into little bumps. The pebbled surface actually decreases friction for the stone because there is a smaller area of contact between the stone and the ice. The sweeping comes into play as the stone is traveling down the ice. Sweeping the ice in front to the stone briefly and slightly raises the temperature of the ice, which further lowers the friction. More sweeping means the the stone will travel further and curl less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC from the last winter olympics they move back and forth very quickly creating friction and thus heat which melts the ice. Then the curling stones skim faster over the thin layer of water on top of the ice thus created.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
