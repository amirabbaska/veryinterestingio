		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I this is really hard to explain because 1 second taking 1.2 seconds makes no sense to us and it just doesn't happen anywhere on Earth the only time you see extreme examples of it happening is in physics textbooks. In real life it's more like gps satellites being a tiny fraction of a second off. But everything will happen slower. If you take a person or a radioactive sample to a place were relativity says time should pass 2x slower then in the standard reference frame a identical radioactive sample will have double the half life. The person will live 2x as long as the other person. </p>

<p>I think this is one of the best real life examples of general relativity from June 2018. The basic of it is that they observed a star zooming around our galaxies center black hole at 25% of the speed of light. The velocity of the star after the encounter does not line up with Newtonian mechanics which assumes time passes at an constant rate. But if you calculate the velocity according to general relativity, by assume that time passed slower for the star when it was moving at it's fastest then the value for the final velocity of the star lines up exactly with the observed velocity of the star after the encounter with the black hole. </p>
<p>The only way it's possible for that star to have the orbit it currently has is if the 12 second we saw it take for the star to swing by that black hole somehow only was 10 seconds for the star. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time dilation was predicted by Einstein. The atomic clock was later used to confirm it. It would be quite a coincidence if time dilation only happened to one specific kind of clock which hadn't been invented yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well one way to think about it is that time dilation is not the sole effect we've been measuring when we use the theory of special relativity. The gamma factor of time also raises the mass-energy of a thing and we've been using that for particle accelerators and to explain the difference between the binding energies of atoms and other such things </p>
<p>So with all that in mind we would come to two possibilities </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>is that the gamma factor which has been working consistently as it should in other works of theoretical calculations just so happens to have an effect on Cs or Mercury dripping or whatever process to mimic gamma exactly and then we Occam's razor (simplest explanation that fits the evidence is the correct one)</p>
</li>
<li>is that all those other factors are actually explained by some artifact of gravity interacting with matter and then we also Occam razor </li>
