		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lightning bolts don't &quot;go&quot; anywhere, they're just the visible glow of ionized air. Lightning happens when the electric potential difference between clouds and the ground is too high and the air can no longer sustain it. The air breaks down, forming an ionized channel (the lightning bolt) that allows current to flow until the two regions are at the same potential. Afterwards, there is no potential difference and therefore no discharge. The air that made up the lightning bolt is just normal, non-ionized air again and some electrons have been transferred to the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lightning bolt is basically a narrow, violent flow of electrons and ions. This flow does indeed disperse inside the ground, as a roughly spherical wave in the 3D field of charge density. On the surface there are currents flowing in the radial direction from the striking point. If you find yourself walking directly towards or away from where a lightning strikes, there may be a huge voltage between your feet due to this. This so-called &quot;step voltage&quot; often kills many cows that hide beneath trees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

They move in segments called &quot;stepped leaders&quot; and meet hundreds of feet up in the sky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
