		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could dark matter particle be a particle with an imaginary charge? </p>
<p>Dark matter does not interact with electromagnetic radiation, which is produced by electrically charged particles. Charge is quantized, which means there is a meaningful way of representing charge as rational numbers: positive, negative and even fractional.</p>
<p>Would a particle having imaginary charge make sense theoretically, and if so, would the matter constituted of such particles be undetectable by electromagnetic radiation, just like dark matter is?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Noether's theorum provides an underlying symmetry for each conservation law. </p>
<p>Are these symmetries a property of the math used, or do they suggest a physical underlying symmetry in the structure/geometry of space itself?</p>
<p>If the latter, what more do we understand about said structure? Is it in any way related to the SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) gauge symmetry of the Standard Model?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Russian billionaire Yuri Milner has a plan to use Photonic laser thrust to accelerate cube-sats up to 20&#37; the speed of light in an effort to try to reach Alpha Centauri.  </p>
<p>My question is, given the red-shift of radio waves at those speeds is NASA's Deap Space network capable of maintaining communication with such a craft? If not is this a simple engineering problem to crack?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
