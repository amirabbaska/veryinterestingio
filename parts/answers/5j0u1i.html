		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General background: The atmosphere is a fluid. The temperature of a fluid changes its density. Temperature fluctuations occur due to interactions between the earth, the makeup of the atmosphere, and the sun because of the earth's rotation, axial tilt and orbit. Small changes in one area can build up and affect large changes in another. These changes are seasonal and cyclical and on large scales create the weather we experience and the climate over the whole planet. </p>
<p>To your question: Have you ever played that game where you get a wet paper towel and see who can put the most marbles on it before the marbles come crashing through? A similar thing happens in the clouds. A pocket of cold dense air can break through a layer of warmer air and, because of a combination of gravity and air pressure, the colder air comes crashing through. Extreme versions of this effect are called microbursts.</p>
<p>You can experiment with hot and cold colored water to see how this works. Get two identical glasses. Fill a glass up to the top with very hot water and add a drop of red food coloring. Next fill a glass to the top with very cold water and add a drop of blue food coloring. Get something sturdy but very thin and wide enough to cover the top of the glasses like a large playing card or old tablet screen protector. Get two small round magnets. </p>
<p>Experiment 1: Place the cold water glass on a table you can get wet. Place the separator on top of the hot water glass and gently turn upside down and place on top of the cold water glass. Slowly remove the separator. </p>
<p>What happened? </p>
<p>Experiment 2: Start over, but this time reverse the positions of the hot and cold water. </p>
<p>What happened? </p>
<p>Experiment 3: This time put one of the small round magnets into the cold water glass, put the other on the bottom of the glass and move the magnetically connected balls to the center of the glass' bottom. Now when you've got the cold water glass on top of the hot water glass remove the exterior magnet and watch the interior magnet punch a hole through the thermally separated water. </p>
<p>What happened? </p>
<p>Let me know because I haven't done this experiment since middle school earth sciences <em>mumbles mumbles</em> years ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually, gusts are the result of one of two things happening.</p>
<p>Gusts during warm, dry conditions are caused as follows;
The sun heats up an area of land faster than the surrounding area, owing to the fact that dark, non-reflective surfaces absorb heat better than smooth, pale colored surfaces. eg. A freshly plowed field will absorb more heat than unplowed fields. This patch of warm earth in turn heats up a layer of air above it and, when the patch of hot air reaches a large enough volume, as hot air rises, it rises from the ground as a giant invisible bubble of warm air. (Glider pilots and birds know these bubbles as &quot;thermals&quot;). As the giant bubble of hot air ascends, cool air from the surrounding area rushes in from all directions to take it's place and will be felt as a wind gust. The  gust will be flowing towards the area where a thermal was just released. In a rural area surrounded with fields, the gusts might be quite gentle, however in cities with enormous areas of bitumen roads and concrete buildings, the thermal activity is constant and as the day warms up, the gusts will become constant and very strong.</p>
<p>Gusts during stormy conditions are generated by large storm clouds which contain cold, dense air. While the cloud is small, the cool air inside the cloud remains trapped inside the cloud, however as the cloud grows in size and it begins to extend into the upper atmosphere where it is much colder, the cold air inside the cloud becomes so dense and heavy that this heavy, dense, cold air sinks back to earth in a sudden stream of cold air. This is known by airplane pilots as a &quot;downdraft&quot;. When this downdraft hits the earth, it spreads out in all directions and will be felt by observers on the ground as strong gusts which will flow away from the base of the thunderstorm cloud. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The collapse of a distant air mass thunderstorm produces an outflow boundary of wind.  </p>
<p>Could also be the break of a temperature inversion.  The temp increases with height, unlike the normal decrease, and that is called an inversion.  At a certain level the temp begins to decrease again, and as daytime heating occurs the temps reach equilibrium.  Strong winds from above the inversion will then flow to the ground.  </p>
<p>Also possibly aliens...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barring a thunderstorm or other strong local disturbance, it's likely very windy above you. A small change in temperature, density, etc forces some of that moving air mass down and you got clipped by it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
