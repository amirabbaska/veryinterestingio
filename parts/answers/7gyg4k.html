		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no known mechanism by which the particles &quot;send a message&quot; to one another. The phenomenon is the result of creating a system of two or more particles whose wavefunctions depend upon one another. By measuring an aspect of one particle, its wavefunction is collapsed to known value, which causes the other particle's wavefunction to be known as the other value.</p>
<p>For example, take two electrons that are known to have a total spin of 0. Each electron has a 50% chance of being measured to be either spin-up or spin-down. If you separate them, each will still have a 50% chance.</p>
<p>However, if you separate them without changing their spin, and then measure electron 1 to be spin-up, then you will find that electron 2 is spin-down 100% of the time. How does it know that electron 1 is spin-up? Nobody really knows. It's an active area of research, however.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A specific example of entanglement can be represented mathematically as |11&gt; + |00&gt;, where |XY&gt; is a notation that means &quot;first particle is in state X and second in state Y&quot;, and the + really means that they are in both situation (00 and 11) at the same time, not either one but a superposition of both.</p>
<p>For our example, that means you have a superposition of both particles 0 or both particles 1. Now when you measure the first particle you will not measure a superposition,  what you can get is either 1 or 0 as a result. For the sake of argument, let's  say you get 1. You know -- if you knew the state beforehand -- that the only state in which the first particle was in state 1 was |11&gt;, so now you know that the second one is also in state 1.</p>
<p>That's entanglement in a nutshell.</p>
<p>The real weirdness appears when you separate the two particles before measuring them, so that they can't know that the other particle was measured, even if they'd have communicated at lightspeed somehow. It will still stay consistent and the statistics can be shown to be different than that of particles that'd have been fixed at either |00&gt; or |11&gt; without you knowing, i.e. not in a superposition. It's been showed experimentally in an experiment called the violation of Bell inequalities. Fun fact: Bell thought that his inequities would not be violated, but it was actually proved otherwise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Now tell me about delayed choice experiments.  Do they not point to even more interesting details about this phenomenon, such as the particle seeming to have always been in that state before being measured, even though it was supposed to be in super position?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you had two guns. One in each hand. You also had a stiff wooden plank strapped to your back, extending the length of your outstretched arms forcing you keep your arms at full length and you cannot bend your arms in any way. If you raise one arm, the other arm is forced to be lowered by the stiff wooden plank.</p>
<p>Now in the case where you always fire both guns at exactly the same time we can say that the position of the guns is related to each other, because of the stiff board forcing the direction of one gun to be effectively opposite of the other gun.</p>
<p>Raise one arm so the gun is pointing to the ceiling and fire. You make a hole in the ceiling but you also KNOW there MUST be a hole in the ground. It doesn't matter if the ground was 5 ft away or a mile ( lets assume the bullet can travel in a straight line for an infinite amount of distance and ignore real things like air resistance for now etc), you still know there's a hole in the ground.
When two photons are entangled, there's a similar dependency on each other for things like their position and momentum. When you have two detectors for use in a quantum experiment, which is measuring the output of a non-linear crystal that generates entangled pairs , your two detectors will always receive the two photons at exactly the same time, you'll get synchronous clicks.</p>
<p>Since you got this far, its time to have a little ''mind blown'' experimental example!</p>
<p>Take a laser, but this laser is a special one where you can get photons coming out both ends, instead of just one end. Turn down the intensity of this laser until your basically only getting one photon out of each end at a time and where these photons are quantum entangled.  </p>
<p>Photons can have a polarisation. This is basically an orientation of the direction in which the propagating electromagnetic wave travels. For linear polarisations this direction is constant with propagation and can take any angle between 0-360, where 0 is arbitrarily defined by you . Now the cool part. Polarisers are sheets of material with molecules arranged in their surface such that only specific polarisation states can pass through. The non red/blue type of 3D Glasses in cinemas these days are polarisers, so your left eye sees a different image to your right eye because one type of image is polarised in one direction vicea versa. Now lets say we put a horizontal linear polariser at some point in the path of one of the entangled photons. The polarisation of the photon is random, it can be horizontal, vertical , 45 degrees -45 degrees or any angle in between. </p>
<p>If its horizontal it gets through 100% of the time and if vertical is blocked. But something interesting happens at 45 degrees. it actually has a 50/50 chance of getting through or getting blocked. However, in the times when it gets through , its polarisation will actually flip to horizontal afterwards, kind of like throwing pennies at a slot machine, if you throw the penny exactly ride itll slide easily through the slot, throw it at a bit of an angle it might bounce off but maybe it 'chinks' through the slot, changing its orientation. </p>
<p>However, remember that other photon  we made which was flying off into the cosmos? Well since it was entangled with the first, if we had measured the polarisation of the first photon, we would know that the polarisation would be the same in the second photon. However, at the moment the first photon when it gets through the polariser and flips to horizontal, when it started at 45, the other photons also instantaneously flips to horizontal too. </p>
<p>No matter if its at the other side of the lab or the other side of the universe. </p>
<p>And no, this is not superluminal information transfer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related question: with all the bajillions of particles in the universe, how do we know that some particle A is entangled with some other particle B?
