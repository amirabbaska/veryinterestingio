		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The CD has a table of contents which lays out the tracks, where they are located on the disk and can include a 'pregap' before tracks which will probably show as a count down.   More info: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregap" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pregap</a> and a sample specification for a CD TOC: <a href="http://www.a1cds.co.uk/images/Mervs-Sample-PQ-sheet.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.a1cds.co.uk/images/Mervs-Sample-PQ-sheet.pdf</a></p>
<p>Why? Presumably for a nice pause between tracks without having to have a gap at the end or start of the track if they are played individually.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my day, the early aughts, rappers fancied a comedic skit in between songs. Sometimes humorous, sometimes as context for the next song. Sometimes just 'cause. </p>
<p>Busta Rhymes' &quot;Extinction Level Event&quot; had it's skits stored in the pregap so if you listen straight through you get the full experience, but if you skipped around the CD the track would go straight to the song. Still magic to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s funny and kinda sad that the negative space before tracks, specifically before the first track of albums, is going to be a thing of the past. Some artists have used this to “hide” “secret” songs. </p>
<p>I think specifically of 311’s record Transistor, which has an almost two minute intro to the song’s title track that exists in negative time. Being that it’s the album’s first track, it can only be heard if you rewind the CD back from it’s start. Kinda cool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My time to shine, professional CD mastering engineer here. The pregap shows a negative count before each track and is usually done to conform to the Red Book CD Standard developed by Sony and Phillips int he 80's. </p>
<p>The CD players we had back in the 80s were primitive by today's tech so the pregap became part of the standard so that players had time to mute and unmute between tracks. On an old player if you didn't have a pregap between tracks it might not be able to do the switch smoothly enough and you'd likely hear a clip.</p>
<p>Fun fact: You can extend the pregap and hide unindexed audio within as a sort of 'secret' track so to speak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember I had a 5-disc turntable for CDs, and the remote had not only the track-skip button, but also the index buttons.
I had only one CD that used indexing:  Jean-Michel Jarre's &quot;Chronologie&quot;.  Indexing would jump you to certain key sections of songs within tracks.
Never saw that again on any other CD.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
