		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some ingredients just don’t mix well together. If you add 1 tsp of vanilla extract to 2 cups of flour, you’ll get a 1/4 cup of sticky vanilla sludge in the middle of 1 3/4 cups flour. So most recipes will have you mix dry ingredients with dry, watery ingredients with watery, oily with oily.</p>
<p>When a recipe tells you to mix butter and sugar -- sometimes it’ll tell you to cream them together -- it’s because the sugar crystals are sharp, and when you mix them into cool butter they incorporate tiny bubbles of air. That’s why some recipes will tell you to do it for 4 or 5 minutes, or until the butter turns pale in color. It softens the butter, without warming it, so it will mix better with dry ingredients. If you were to soften the butter by melting it, you’d break it down into its components, which are butterfat and water, and you’d have a devil of a time incorporating them back together.</p>
<p>But there’s still more to it. Eggs are often beaten separately just so that they mix into beaten eggs, not clumps of beaten yolks and strings of whites. And eggs can be affected if you mix things into them. If you mix salt directly into eggs, the salt causes some of the proteins in the eggs to break down, which will change the way the eggs cook. Sometimes you want that, sometimes you don’t. Jacque Pepin says you should salt your eggs before making an omelet; Gordon Ramsay says you shouldn’t. Some people salt the eggs 15 minutes before cooking, some right before cooking, some not until after cooking. It’s a matter of taste, but it definitely makes a difference.</p>
<p>Sugar, too, messes with eggs. If you mix egg yolks with sugar, the sugar will make the yolks coagulate, as if they were being cooked with heat.</p>
<p>Then there are base-acid chemical reactions. Remember mixing vinegar (an acid) and baking soda (a base) together? When you make chocolate chip cookies, one of the ingredients is baking soda. Another ingredient is brown sugar. Brown sugar is basically white sugar and molasses, and molasses is acidic. Once everything is mixed up, the baking soda reacts with the acid from the brown sugar, and creates tiny bubbles of carbon dioxide, which gives the cookies some lift. That’s a chemical reaction that runs out eventually, and so any recipe that requires that sort of reaction will be careful not to let it happen too quickly. If you were making buttermilk pancakes, and started by mixing everything together, the baking soda would start reacting with the acidic buttermilk before everything else was mixed together. And then as you mixed it, it would be deflating.</p>
<p>Baking powder is commonly used. It contains baking soda, and a powdered acid. That way you can use it in recipes that don’t have any or enough acid. If you wanted to make chocolate chip cookies with all white sugar, and no brown sugar, you’d want to use baking powder. Most basic cakes using baking powder. But as soon as it gets wet it starts reacting, so timing is important.</p>
<p>It can be very difficult to mix watery ingredients and oily ingredients. When they really are mixed together it’s an emulsification. Butter is an emulsification; Mayonnaise is another. Mayonnaise is basically oil, lemon juice, and egg yolk. Getting the oil to mix with the lemon juice is almost impossible, but egg yolk is an emulsifier -- it has proteins that are basically oily on one end and watery on the other. So you start by mixing the egg yolk with the lemon juice in a blender. Then you slowly add the oil into the whirring blender. If you just dumped in the oil too it wouldn’t work. You have to drizzle it into the blender slowly. It’s easy to screw up homemade mayonnaise.</p>
<p>Acids will make milk curdle, so if you’re making lemon custard or lemon ice cream, you can’t just add lemon juice to milk. You’ll mix lemon juice with egg yolk, and only after it’s well mixed will you add the milk. And you’ll need to keep whisking it until it’s all evenly mixed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of reasons.</p>
<p>Wet ingredients mix together better with other wet ingredients. Same goes for dry. Also, once you hydrate flour, the more you mix it the tougher the finished result, so mixing dry with dry and wet with wet and then mixing the dry with the wet only until just combined, you minimize toughness. </p>
<p>On top of that, if you want something with lots of air, you might strategize the order you mix things. If you just put a bunch of shit together and mix it you will get a lot less air than if, say, you separate the egg whites, whip those alone, and then fold that into everything else. Creaming butter and sugar has similar results, the sharp sugar crystals help get air into the butter before you dissolve the sugar into other things. </p>
<p>Also if you are adding chunks you usually do that last because they get in the way of mixing and they might settle to the edges or clump together if you mix them aggressively, or if they are fragile like fruit they might break apart. Waiting to the end lets you gently fold them in and distribute them nicely. </p>
<p>Another issue is fats and water. Oil and water don't like to mix, but egg yolks contain lecithin, which helps them mix, so its common to beat together fat and eggs before trying to combine them with other things.</p>
<p>Temperatures sometimes matter too. Softening butter is different from melting butter because melting butter causes the water in it to separate from the fat. If you add ice cold milk to melted butter it can clump up. If you chill a dough with butter in it before baking it will take more time in the oven before the butter melts, which can affect the end result. Choux pastry is partially cooked in a pan before being cooled and piped into a shape because heating and then cooling it causes the flour to gel, which changes the texture.</p>
<p>If you branch away from strict baking, you'll encounter things like tempering eggs, where you add beaten eggs to a hot liquid. If you just dump them in and mix the eggs will scramble, but if you beat the eggs fast while slowly adding the hot liquid, you can mix the hot liquid evenly before the eggs have time to cook in the heat, and once they are brought up in temperature and increased in volume you can then mix everything together.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for the gold!</p>
<p>Since lots of people are asking: I don't know of great book for learning this sort of thing, I wish I did so I could recommend one. The largest single source for me was Alton Brown's tv series Good Eats. He talks at length about these things and keeps it entertaining, so its easy to watch for hours and you pick up a lot. Other than that I picked up a few things here and there so I don't have very specific recommendations. Some people have mentioned books in comments to this one, I haven't read them so I don't know if they are good, but you could look there if you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easier to fully mix the dry ingredients together before you add the wet ingredients, and it's easier to mix the wet ingredients before you add the dry ingredients. Once you mix then together you get a sticky mess so it's much tougher to get everything uniformly distributed. Instead you tend to get all the salt in one place, the eggs swirled in and the milk on the bottom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, for many cakes/pastries, you want to avoid mixing the batter/dough too long with the flour in it.  The mixing(kneading) process increases gluten development (good for bread, bad for cakes).  More gluten development leads to a tougher, chewier product, instead of the delicate crumb of a cake or muffin or brownie where the flour was folded in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
