		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Licensed clinician here. Cognitive impairment with depressive disorders is a common symptom. Clients show decreased memory and attention, with increased disorganization of thought. In some clients, these symptoms can remit with treatment (meds and therapy). In clients with depression that is treatment refractory, those symptoms can be pervasive even with treatment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clinical neuropsychologist here:
Depression does not make you &quot;dumber&quot; in the sense that it does not cause a deleterious effect on intellect. It also does not cause &quot;memory&quot; problems, in the same way that say, Alzheimer's would - that is to mean it does not cause a loss of previously encoded memories.
It does affect attention and the ability to accomplish a goal, whether that goal is right now, ten minutes from now, or ten years from now. Thus, the overall problem is one of executive dysfunction.
The best way to think of depression with regard to it's effects on mental abilities is to think of it as a source of competition for cognitive resources.
The notion that we &quot;multitask&quot; or can attend to multiple things at once is not true. We actually shift our attention between things throughout the day - sometimes we are focused on internal thoughts, future-oriented worries, ideas, 'eureka' moments, etc. This is called the 'default mode' attention network, or 'daydreaming' for lack of a better term. Other times we are attending to external stimuli while engaged in a task, like filling out paperwork or listening to someone speak to us. We switch between these attention systems thousands of times per day, some of us spending more in the default mode than others. Those suffering from depression are much more &quot;default-modey&quot; if you will, and not only do they spend much more time in their own head, but the flavor of their ruminations are generally negative and self-deprecating. Thus, they are focused on &quot;depressive&quot; feelings/emotions and this becomes a state of internal distraction. There's a reason we say &quot;pay&quot; attention - it costs us something and we don't have an unlimited amount of it. These thoughts fight for  attentional resources and thus they have less remaining to engage in goal-directed behavior. In addition, depression has autonomic effects on the arousal system that can cause you to feel lethargic, amotivated, anhedonic, etc., and these all affect attention and processing speed as well. </p>
<p>More importantly, perhaps, is that depressive symptoms don't feel good, so when they are particularly difficult to bear the person suffering from them will make attempts to get rid of them. If they have good coping skills they will do things like exercise, speak to someone about what's bothering them, practice mindfulness, etc., but often the behaviors used to alleviate negative affect are maladaptive (drugs, alcohol, physical altercation, etc.) and end up prolonging symptoms in the long run. That's an entirely different conversation that I always have with my patients when they don't understand why they consistently act in ways that go against their values. It's the foundation of cognitive behavioral therapy. </p>
<p>Edit: Wow! Given this topic is one that is dear to my heart, I'm thrilled to receive my first gold for this comment and it's very much appreciated! I'll try to get to all of the questions in my mailbox as best as I can, but it might take a day or two. Thanks again!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Judging by many comments, it seems as though the brain begins to lose its memory functions as a result of the described disorders. Is it at all possible to regain what has been lost, or will a person who has been untreated for an extended amount of time be subject to forever being &quot;dumb&quot;? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depression and many other mood disorders such as anxiety are closely related to higher levels of cortisol and inflammatory makers. High levels of circulating cortisol can lead to atrophy (shrinking) of the hippocampus (a area important for our memory functions). Therefore these diseases can cause what we call cognitive impairment. Or what people can percieve as &quot;dumb&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
