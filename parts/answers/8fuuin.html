Change their body position so bed sores don’t happen. Change their linens, brush their hair. It’s a nice experience. I’ve done hygiene care for semi-conscious/dying patients and it’s really rewarding. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah and it can be nasty sometimes. Unfortunately these patients are usually neglected, not by nursing homes, but by their own family typically. I've seen patients with bed sores so bad you can see their bone and their mouth with so much gunk in it they likely never clean their mouth. Then those family demand they go back home with them when they are clearly unfit to take care of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think there is a reason for a big disparity between the top two comments. For an acute patient who is intubated and ventilated they are typically in an ICU, where staffing is anywhere from 1:1-1:3 depending on the acuity of the patients. In this setting every 2 hour oral care is expected with assessments/meds and the bathing practices that  u/swild89 mentioned.</p>
<p>Depending on the patient/medical team at 14-21 days we tend to have the trach/PEG talk. Once a patient has a tracheostomy we continue to attempt to wean the ventilator but if unable the patient will be transferred to a long term acute care unit for ventilated patients where the ratio is usually 1:5-6. If they are able to be weaned to a T-piece or Tbar (humidified oxygen via trach) or no longer require airway assistance while still in a persistent vegetative state they will be transferred to a hospital floor (1:4-7 ratio) and usually eventually a long-term skilled nursing facility (this is where we run into the 1:20+ ratio).  Routine oral care is still indicated, but with more patients it can be harder to provide all of the required around the clock care while still performing the required basic tasks to maintain licensure and employment. Unfortunately the less acute the level of care, the more patients each staff member is responsible for. Total care patients require a huge amount of effort between incontinence, repositioning, medicating, and oral hygiene. So in short, nursing and ancillary staff will provide oral care for patients but the less acute the comatose/ minimally responsive patient is the more thin their caregivers attention will be spread. </p>
