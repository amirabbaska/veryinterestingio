<p>If I have $100k in available credit from credit card companies and/or banks and find out I'm about to die, what stops me from blowing the $100k before I'm dying</p>

<p>Nothing stops you from using your credit. That's what the credit is there for. For you to use. Now, if you use it in a suspicious manner it might get flagged and temporarily blocked, but a quick call should sort that out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and how would they recover their losses?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So your real question is how to creditors get money from deceased debtors. The answer is: they file a claim against the estate, the executor of the state has to sort it out and make sure that all creditors get paid. If there isn't enough money to go around, then there are priorities and such that dictate who gets what and how much. Usually this is determined by the local laws and precedents.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these posts have the right idea, but to go one step further: If the deceased has no estate to go after and the credit company writes off the debt as a loss, then that can be deducted from taxes owed. Meaning the government/IRS would receive less taxes from them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you die, your creditors will get paid out of your estate before your heirs get anything. So, if your estate is worth $300,000 and you owed $100,000, then your heirs inherit $200,000.</p>
<p>If your estate isn't worth enough to pay off the creditors, a judge will decide which creditor gets what.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If your estate was work less than $100K, your heirs would get nothing, but the credit card company would have to take a loss on the rest.  Note that if your estate is worth less than $100K, it is pretty unlikely you will have a $100K credit limit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you are unmarried have no children and have no valuable assets (house, jewelry, valuable antiques) It's unlikely that your creditors will give much of a shit after you're dead.  If you borrow a bunch of money and run up credit cards on something non-tangible like travel than there's nothing for them to seize.  </p>
<p>At the end of the day &gt;100K is a small enough amount of money that it would require more time and resources to recover than it would be worth.  Most companies would just write it off.  </p>
