<p>Digging and excavation techniques improved. We can dig deeper faster.</p>
<p>We can identify things as dinosaur bones easier.</p>
<p>Also technically no human has ever seen a dinosaur bone. Just the shape of one cast in limestone and other soft stone of the sort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that dinosaurs are a clade. That is thousands of different of species of dinosaurs. Some of those species had huge bones which is excellent for fossilisation. In addition they also existed for millions of years. That is a long period of time for those bones to be fossilised in.</p>
<p>Our human ancestors, on the other hand. Well, those were just a handful of species. They were around for a much shorter window of time, and our bones are much smaller and therefore might not also stand up as well to the process of fossilisation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dinosaurs were around for about 165 million years, and a lot of them were <em>huge</em>.</p>
<p>The genus <em>Homo</em> is only a few million years old, and <em>Homo Sapiens</em> have only been kicking around for about 200,000 years. Compared to dinosaurs we are tiny, and haven't been around for very long at all. Which makes our fossils a lot scarcer than theirs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dino bones are big. Lots of them died in mudslides and by being buried in ash or lost to tar pits or whatever.</p>
<p>Humans tend to retrieve their dead and put them in specific places, many of which are not particularly prone to fossilization.</p>
<p>Dinosaurs are not one species, but many, many species while humans are only one species.</p>
<p>So the likelihood of finding a human skeleton in fossilized condition is fairly low, just like finding a specific species like T-rex is fairly unlikely.</p>
<p>Most of the &quot;Good fossil&quot; rock is actually sea-bed or creek-bed where silting is a great way to perform the necessary prep for subsequent fossilization.</p>
<p>Meanwhile we are finding a lot of good human tidbits in peat bogs and the few undisturbed tombs.</p>
<p>Strict fossilization, the replacement of the calcium and other organic material with rock-like material via ion exchange (it is ion exchange right?) takes much longer than you think.</p>
<p>So to be preserved something has to be buried just so. This is why you don't see billions of bison skeletons cluttering up the western united states, stacked like chord-wood even though the existence of bison for thousands of years in numbers in the hundreds of millions is pretty much an established fact.</p>
<p>So up until recently there were surprisingly few humans, and indeed great apes in general, and they were not fond of living in the conditions that lead to being suddenly covered in silt. So the chance of any one body being preserved is so unbelievably small that the cumulative chance that more than a minuscule fraction were actually were preserved explains the results to date.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of other answers consider that human corpse disposal practices tend to be methods that preclude wide scale fossilization. We burn them, bury them in organics rich and wet top soil, we toss them into the sea. These aren't exactly ideal conditions for longevity here.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
