It’s practically your nail plate (part of your nail that is visible) except it’s white because it’s much thicker than the rest of your nail plate. This thickness hides all the blood vessels that are underneath it making it appear white. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others mentioned what it is, Ill answer the “what can it indicate.” The moons can be used to indicate capillary refill rate. </p>
<p>If you press your fingernail into the nail bed, it squeezes all the blood out of your finger and turns it white. This is called “blanching”. When you let go, the blood will rush back into the capillaries (tiny blood vessels) and return it to normal color. Medical professionals can count the amount of time it takes for the color to return to normal, to help monitor your hydration and efficiency of circulation. “Capillary refill rate” refers to the amount of time it takes for the blood to return and bring the normal color back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
