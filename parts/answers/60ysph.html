		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't speak to everything you listed, but shaking your leg is a matter of tricking your body into thinking things are moving along.</p>
<p>Your body often takes simple input signals to mean specific things, even if they seem useless or irrelevant. E.g. if you have a stomach ache, putting your hand on your stomach seems to help with the discomfort even if it doesn't actually do anything to help with the ache. This is because it <em>does</em> help when you're covering an open wound on your skin; and your body isn't smart enough to figure out which aches can be helped by putting your hand on them and which cannot. It only knows that &quot;covering a painful area&quot; is a good thing to do.<br />
Result: giving physical attention to a part of your body that aches will generally cause your brain to register less pain.</p>
<p>Shaking your leg (or alternating both legs, which I tend to do more), pacing in a circle, ... all give your brain the signal that we are running or walking.<br />
A classic example is people tapping their feet when they are queueing somewhere. They want to move along, so their mind is urging their body to start walking and making progress.  (Similar to how your instincts can override your conscious mind when starving and near food; your body can urge you to do something that addresses a current issue. Hunger, thirst, violent outbursts when threatened, the urge to walk, ...)<br />
Instead of ignoring that impulse; your body diverts it into &quot;fake walking&quot; instead. You move your leg like your brain tells you to, but you do it in a way that you don't physically move forward.<br />
Regardless, because your body feels your leg being used, the urge to move along is lessened because your brain thinks you're already handling the issue. </p>
<p>It's a way of lying to yourself. The reasons to not move (e.g. you'll be in trouble if you try to walk through a TSA checkpoint instead of queueing in line) can outweigh the benefits of moving (making progress), but your instincts aren't smart enough to comprehend the complexities of all of these consequences.<br />
So to prevent your mind from wrongly urging your body to walk; we instead choose to trick our mind into thinking we're doing what it wants us to do; without actually doing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many studies on fidgeting and mindfulness. </p>
<p>One theory suggests that fidgeting is a coping strategy for stress and that it's a sign that one is attempting to reduce stress in order to maintain attention.</p>
<p>Other studies propose that mind wandering is either a default state of mind where fidgeting will occur naturally as your mind wanders and attention diminishes or that mind wandering utilizes executive resources which will diminish those available for the primary objective. Fidgeting may occupy the floating attention, the part of your brain that gets bored and help you focus.</p>
<p>There is research that shows fidgeting increasing as a function of time throughout a lecture which indicates that fidgeting is either an indication of boredom or an attempt to maintain attention by stimulating the brain with sensory information. </p>
<p>It's a really interesting subject.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people explain fidget behavior as something that is self stimulating,  and it's thought of as a behavior that helps to calm or regulate your system if there is a feeling of anxiety. It also can help you to focus. Some students with ADHD find having a fidget to keep their hands busy in class allows them to pay better attention in class, and adults find things to fidget with all the time as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming Good Mythical Morning did their research properly, it's an evolutionary left over to keep you aware of your surroundings, because from an evolutionary stand point, concentrating too hard on a single thing is undesirable. You want to be able to have early detection of potential predators. Today, we spend a lot of time at a desk doing mental tasks, without the threat of predators, but our brains want to continue the behavior, causing fidgeting. We often tend to forget we are just animals with deep seeded instincts. Give the episode a go, it was enlightening. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have any specific studies or articles to back this up, but I think the general idea is that pretty much all animals, including humans, all naturally move around quite a lot in the wild.  Before civilizations, humans were hunter gatherers for 10s (100s?) of thousands of years.  You were pretty much a child, so naturally moving around a lot, raising a child, foraging, or tracking/hunting animals.  Everyone was doing their part for the group.  All the time.  Once all of your needs were taken care of, you probably just dicked around for the rest of the time.  But, you didn't have any modern things.  Basic tools.  That's it.  So that dicking around would have all been physical activity.  Wrestling.  Just running around.  Training for hunting or foraging.</p>
<p>The only time you would be still would be to deliberately rest or to sleep.</p>
<p>Even with the advent of society, most people would have been workers or artisans and farming or making things all day.  Still pretty much active at all times, and still doing very active leisure activities.</p>
<p>Now, since the inudstrial revolution, and more specifically, with the advent of electronics, society has pretty much told you to stop, sit down, and don't move.  For the majority of your day.  This is going against millions of years of biological programming that has made it beneficial for you to always be moving.</p>
<p>You shouldn't find it very surprising that a lot of people get very uncomfortable when they sit still for long periods of time.  They have millions of years of programming telling them not to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
