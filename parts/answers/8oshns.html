		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it depends on the blood tests, however, its typically to get rid of all the fats and sugars that are suspended in your blood following a meal.</p>
<p>If you fast, then your body will process those fats and sugars from your blood. Whats left over are the risiduals which are produced by your body (ie, chloresteral, insulin etc...). By fasting they can get a somewhat accurate snapshot of the levels in your blood to know if you have high chloresteral due to your liver producing too much or insulin levels due to diabetes etc...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To make sure it’s JUST your blood and your body, not your food.</p>
<p>For example, I am not diabetic, if I eat something sugary, my blood sugar will spike THEN my insulin will bring it down.</p>
<p>If u/viccsilver, who is diabetic, eats something sugary, their blood sugar will spike and will not be brought down.</p>
<p>If we had both just eaten, the spike wouldn’t tell the doctors anything. They need to see how the body reacts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Meals disrupt things in variable ways (depending on how long ago you ate and how much it was).  It's like if you were trying to measure how deep a pool is at a water park - you'd want to make sure the waves were turned off and the water was still before taking your measurement. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Fasting Blood Glucose Test is the primary test for diabetes.  It's the routine bloodwork test that is most likely the cause of your instructions to fast.  There are others, but usually that's a function of something specific the doctor is investigating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood tests are a snapshot in time. If you slam three donuts and get blood-work done thats not a real accurate picture of whats going on in your body all the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
