		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our body has what's called the autonomic nervous system. As its name suggests, its major role is to regulate all of the non-voluntary movements. This includes controlling heart rate, breathing rate, motility of your bowels and so on. You probably have come across it as the &quot;fight or flight&quot; &amp; &quot;rest and digest&quot; responses. </p>
<p>The former is what's called the sympathetic nervous system and the latter the parasympathetic nervous system. They usually control the same organ but have opposite effects on that organ. For example; The sympathetic system causes your wind pipe to widen (dilate) and the parasympathetic system causes it to narrow (constrict). If you think about it, that makes a lot of sense. In a fight or flight situation you want your wind pipe to be wide so you can get more O2 per breath.</p>
<p>When we cry, our body senses distress and so ends up activating the sympathetic nervous system. Especially when you are in severe distress, the response is quite strong. So when the sympathetic neurons fire, it ends up distending our wind pipe as discussed above. </p>
<p>Anatomically our windpipe (trachea) lies directly in front of the food pipe(esophagus). Thus when our windpipe is widening, it pushes against the food pipe closing it shut. When we attempt to swallow, we are essentially pushing against the weight of the trachea giving us that lump in our throat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a speech therapist. In learning about the anatomy and physiology of the mouth, throat, and larynx, I learned that when a person experiences  emotional upset or shock or some other extreme emotion, the muscles of the larynx are greatly affected by that emotion. That's why you can tell if someone is upset or mad just by the sound of his/her voice. The muscles contract which is not what the airway likes. The trachea and airway want to stay opened and relaxed so that breathing can continue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
