		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found a decent explanation for it.</p>
<p>&quot;The large scale of the Tharsis shield volcanoes suggests that they formed from massive eruptions of fluid basalt over prolonged periods of time. Similar eruptions on earth are associated with flood basalt provinces and mantle hotspots. However, on earth the source region for hotspot volcanism moves laterally as lithospheric plates travel across the stationary mantle plumes beneath them. Without this mechanism of lateral movement, the Martian surface remains above the plume source so that huge volumes of lava will erupt from a single central vent over many millions of years of activity, thus generating a single shield volcano of enormous volume. With this in mind, it is interesting to note that the volume of Olympus Mons is roughly equivalent to the total volume of basalt in the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain.&quot;</p>

<p>The other aspect is the rate of erosion is incredibly slow compared to Earth.</p>
<p>Edit: another thing worth noting is the theory that a giant asteroid collision may have been what set off the Tharsis Shield volcanoes in the first place. So a fuller understanding of volcanism on Mars has to take the overall history of the planet into account.</p>

</ul>
<p>As an extreme case, the &quot;mountains&quot; on neutron stars can only be millimeters to centimeters in height.  </p>
<p><em>Edit more info:</em> </p>
<p>Note, geologic activity determines what kind of mountain forms and their characteristics including height. The surface gravity is simply a limiter that <em>if</em> tall mountains form, they are restricted from getting too tall due to gravity. Here's a lot more info on the geology involved including deformation of tectonic plates and glacial weathering  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Howdy, Mars scientist here. There are a few reasons.</p>
<p>Mars had active volcanism, but probably no plate tectonics. So while on Earth we end up with Island chains, that hot spot on Mars never moved, and just kept building up in the same place for millions of years. Mars also has a much thinner atmosphere and basically no liquid water for most of its history. That means erosional forces aren't nearly as efficient on Mars, so mountains aren't worn down as fast. Finally, Mars is smaller than Earth, so its gravitational pull isn't as strong. This is likely a very small effect, but it conceivably might be important. </p>
<p>This is all outside my area of expertise, so I may have missed some stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from lower gravity, you also need to consider that most mountains on earth are measured from sea level whereas on Mars they are measured from the base of the mountain. For example, if you were to measure Mauna Loa from its true base, it would be 56,000 feet (around 10.6 miles) high. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The surface of the earth is moving. So we get volcanoes showing up in a line, like the pacific ring of fire.  </p>
<p>Mars doesn't have a spinning molten core and so the surface doesn't move around.  As a result, when you get a pressure point that pushes up lava, it just keeps building up creating monsters like mount Olympus. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
