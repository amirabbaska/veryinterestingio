By drowning out the sounds with white noise, you don't have that effect as often and your body has a chance to relax.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like to think of it as a sonic curtain between you and the rest of the world. The nature of white noise* is that it fills up the whole range of sound, so every other sound is blocked out a little by...well, essentially nothing. It gives us a chance to retreat into our own little worlds a little bit. </p>
<p>*in my experience, “pink” or “brown” noise is actually slightly better. White noise involves the whole spectrum equally but other “shades” can fill up certain parts of the spectrum more than others. It’s been my experience that these other shades are better suited to actual life, where white noise is more a laboratory thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a white noise app that I run through a speaker when I sleep.  The main draw to this app was the fact you could build your own mix from sounds other people uploaded including odd, but still soothing, sounds.</p>
<p>You find out that people have different tastes in &quot;soothing&quot;.  The one that I can give an example of myself is a PC running with the fans on. This is mainly because I ran my computer 24/7 in the same room I slept in for two years (dorms) that even then if had the option to not sleep in the same room, I would move it into my room.</p>
<p>From the type of sounds I am about to list, some I could not sleep to but they all have at least one of the qualities I think are critical to a good sleep noise: personal familiarity(forced to sleep in), constant, soft regular beat comparatively to main noise (no bongo drums by themselves), droning, and perfected looping (the ones you could detect where the clip's end was KEPT you up and from other people's feedback, it was very noticable and downvoted because of the defect).</p>
<p>-Urban city : people talking, loud taxis beeps, etc</p>
<p>-Windchimes : Random dings. Some made with built in rain</p>
<p>-Rains of various quantities - From a sprinkle to a downpour on a car roof.</p>
<p>-Appliances - Clothes dryers, washers, dishwashers, and air conditioners, windows fans.   One major similarity between them all is they all try to muffle the sound they generate to some degree.</p>
<p>-Vehicles - Trains, random motorcycles.  I can see the train thing working because I used to live in a small town that had a train whistle far in the distance because it was approaching another town.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I grew up in the Midwest on the wrong side of the tracks--we were too poor for AC, so we used box fans and such throughout the house.  The drone is soporific, it lulls you to sleep.  Several of my siblings, as well as myself, use fans to this day to get to sleep.  I know a lot of people in the same boat.  You can buy a fancy white noise generator, or you can buy a cheap box fan.</p>
<p>I will say that when I lived in the Colorado high country, I spent a summer and fall living in a log cabin next to a small stream cascading down from a mountain gully above the cabin.  That sang me to sleep at night, it was the best.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
