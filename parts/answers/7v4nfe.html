		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt is sodium chloride. Your nerve cells communicate partially using sodium. When a bunch of sodium rushes into a nerve cell, it &quot;fires&quot;.</p>
<p>The salt that gets into the wound dissolves (splits into individual sodium and chloride), and because there's so much of it, the sodium rushes into nearby nerve cells, overloading them and causing them to fire. </p>
<p>There are some nerve cells that are specialized to detect pain. Since the nerves that detect pain are constantly sending signals to the brain because they're overloaded with sodium, your brain interprets the constant signal as constant pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurons operate by maintaining a resting equilibrium with a  high K+ gradient inside the cell and a high Na+ gradient outside the cell.  Stimulation causes the Na+ pores to open and Na+ ions rush into the cell, creating the electrical potential to rise from about -60mV to +30mV.  These numbers are variable but think of an electrical circuit using diodes.  The voltage has to rise above a threshold for a signal to be passed.  When the threshold is met, a signal is sent through the nervous system.  Now, adding a lot more Na+ ions to the mix increases the potential outside of the cell membrane.  This is equivalent to dramatically ramping up the peak voltage of a signal and zapping your circuit.  However, instead of frying the component and killing the circuit, you create a short circuit that overloads a component downstream, your brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt pulls water out of cells, and with an open wound the salt can get in a lot deeper, where there's more activity in the body (blood, nerves, other tissues). That's a lot to pull out of a small area, so it hurts more than just the wound, or salt on undamaged skin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
