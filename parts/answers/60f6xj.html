		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When i was young i went to the beach with my parents every so often. But this one time i was swimming out a bit too far. Before i knew it the current was taking me and my beach ball to open sea. In my struggle to get back i had to ditch the ball and my mother and a bunch of strangers had to pull me out of the water.  To this day i still dream about that fucking beach ball and i have no clue why. The experience was not scary but the scene of that beach ball drifting away makes me feel sooo guilty that i remember it decades later.  In short: dont ever lose your beach ball because it will haunt you</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One example of uneasiness I know of can be caused by getting good news about something after you got bad news about it just moments ago. Even though everything is actually okay, you still feel uneasy because the hormones from both instances are still running around your system and conflicting with each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
