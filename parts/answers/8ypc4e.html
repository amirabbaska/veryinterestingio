		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's harder to imagine in our society, but in almost all of nature <em>calories</em> are the currency. Top priority is to conserve them.</p>
<p>What's the point in having large muscles that you never use? They're wasting your calories supporting themselves, and providing you <em>nothing</em>. </p>
<p>To be beneficial in evolutionary terms, the muscles need to help you do something. Otherwise it's more beneficial to scrap them. So your body builds just the amount of muscle that you need to do what you do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our body is inherently <del>lazy</del> efficient. It will try to save energy if possible.</p>
<p>Imagine our hunter/gatherer ancestors. Your acquaintance Bruce is really buff. His muscles don't shrink even when he doesn't use them so he built them up during summer and fall. However, when winter comes, his muscles still demand a great deal of energy. Bruce didn't account for this while storing food and ends up starving to death.</p>
<p>Your ancestors had muscles that shrank without use. They used less energy during winter and could get through enough of them to raise the next generation and pass down that trait.</p>
<p>Nowadays, our bodies are not that different from our ancestors but our living conditions have changed greatly. Though we want to now, it's hard to burn fat or keep our muscles because our bodies still want to conserve energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscles adapt to the needed environment. So if you keep using them the cells say &quot;hey this jerk keeps lifting heavy stuff so we need more of us to make it easy&quot;. When you dont lift the cells say &quot;we don't need so many, put the energy where it's needed&quot; so muscles shrink. Im not a biologist, but id bet its a remnant from our evolution when our predecessors didnt have plentiful food, so if one part of the body wasnt stressed (like when you work out) the energy stored goes to making other needed cells and functions to ensure survival. </p>
<p>Similar things happen to burn victims. If a burn is bad enough their kidneys shut down because all of the body's effort is going toward rebuilding skin cells and healing which means there isnt enough energy/food/ability to produce cells (whatever you want to call it) beyond just trying to heal a major wound.</p>
<p>In summation, the body has finite energy to expend at any one time and will automatically decide where to expend those resources based on the stresses placed on the body. Stress goes up one place, energy expended elsewhere goes down (in the case of lifting it goes away from producing fat). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, muscles (like everything else) are made up of cells.  The &quot;small tears&quot; are some cells getting damaged.  The immune system clears up the remains of the cells, and then your hormones send signals for the cells in the muscle to multiply, so the muscle &quot;grows&quot; in bulk by having more cells.</p>
<p>If you don't exercise, the hormones go the other way and signal the cells in your muscles to NOT multiply; cells die when they get old (and again the immune system clears up the remains), so with time fewer cells are in that muscle that you haven't exercised.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hypertrophy is the act of tearing down muscle fibres and having them rebuild stronger.
Atrophy is when they start to shrink.</p>
<p>Basically, use it or lose it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
