<p>If the two 100-floor buildings are one NYC block apart, which is 0.05 mile or 1/500000 of Earth's circumference, their 100th floors, which are .2 mile higher than their first floors, are going to be 2 <em> .2 mi </em> pi / 500000 further apart than their first floors, which comes out to .16 inches or 4 mm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Humber Bridge (UK), Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge and others all took curvature of the earth into account during the design stage.</p>
<p>Fun fact: the 1995 Great Hanshin Earthquake occurred after the towers had been constructed but before the road deck had been started, moving the towers 1 meter further apart, causing a minor redesign.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The towers of the <a href="http://mathscinotes.com/2017/01/effect-of-earths-curvature-on-suspension-bridge-dimensions/" target="_blank">Verrazano Bridge</a> are different heights due to the curvature. I highly doubt adjacent office buildings will have any noticeable variation however. The distances are too short, and deep foundation work would offset some of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
