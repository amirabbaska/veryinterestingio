<p>If you were to hover between them, it might cause an arc.</p>
<p>There was a lot of testing done to determine how close is too close for electrical safety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look closely at a picture of a glass insulator like they use on the towers, you'll see that it's designed to have both a long surface area between one end and another, plus the bell shape helps ensure it's hard for rain to reach or remain on the inside surfaces. </p>
<p>Power companies also wash the insulators as part of regular maintenance, using boom trucks that spray deionized water that's a very poor conductor. By keeping the insulators clean, when rain hits them it doesn't become a good conductor and voltage leaks are minimal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Power System Engineer here: Insulators are used to keep circuits separated. Insulators are typically ceramic and are structural supports that donâ€™t conduct electricity. The insulators have groves on them so a complete coat of water cannot exist to create a circuit from phase to phase or phase to ground.</p>
<p>Here is what an insulator looks like</p>

<p>EDIT wording - rain is still conductive, just less so than you might think. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>There's a path my wife and I have hiked a couple times that goes under some high voltage transmission lines.  Both times we went under them they were making a sound like a steak sizzling.  Why is that?  (The first time we heard it we were like, uh, do we really wanna walk under that?)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
