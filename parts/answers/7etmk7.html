		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can already see the effects of restricted content on academia through the paywalled publishing practices of most journals. The high cost of institutional licenses or large-scale purchasing of individual articles can be an overwhelming expense for new companies or smaller universities. Science relies upon the free flow of information and knowledge between persons and institutions around the world. Ending net neutrality puts that at risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure if this is the right place to ask but here goes.</p>
<p>I'm not American, but how would this impact an internet user of another country?</p>
<p>I know there are localized version of some of the major websites (Google, Amazon, etc), but if there isn't really one for smaller ones, would they be impacted but reversing net neutrality if browsing from outside of the USA?</p>
<p>More generically, how would someone outside the USA be impacted if net neutrality gets killed?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What would it be like if Verizon partnered up with Pizza Hut and then limited calls to other pizza places unless you paid them a premium? What if you had to listen to an advertisement before making a phone call? What if you had to pay extra to talk to people on other phone networks or landlines?</p>
<p>These are just a few ways you can try to relate Net Neutrality to people who don't understand why it needs to be protected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be proactive in case we lose the fight, what are the technical limitations of starting my own ISP using WISP technologies (or any other technology for that matter) and expanding from there? </p>
<p>Basically, how far does ISPs control of the internet reach? Infrastructure wise, where do they fall? If I start a service and then need to gain access to the rest of the internet, how would I go about that, or do they own that too, and we are totally screwed? Can they throttle/shape/block any content from any other provider that passes through their Tier 1 network?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
