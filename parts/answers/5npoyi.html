		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just an easily-recognizable convention to indicate that &quot;something goes here, and the name itself is not important, so you can avoid trying to determine whether the name is significant — it's not&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;x&quot; would be similar in some mathematics as the stock fill-in-the-blank.</p>
<p>Once a convention is established, changing it is confusing, so the best term to use for everyone writing new things is the existing one.</p>
<p>Wikipedia has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foobar" target="_blank">more detailed history that tries to trace out possible etymology</a>, but any other term could have done as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Foo and Bar are the most common <em>metasyntactic variables</em> used by Anglophone programmers.</p>
<p>I suggest you look at the Jargon File, a late-70s compilation of hacker slang:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/go01.html" target="_blank">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/go01.html</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/metasyntactic-variable.html" target="_blank">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/metasyntactic-variable.html</a></p>
<p>The entry on 'foo' traces it back to The MIT (model) Railway Club, which actually contributed a number of terms to the lexicon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It appears to have originated from the military acronym FUBAR - but no one know for sure.</p>
<p>It was popularised as a placeholder variable by MIT during the 1960-70's.</p>
<p>Since then it's just become a bit of a meme, in the same way that all beginner programming tutorials print &quot;Hello World!&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of this responses are misinformed, probably because they don't program, but answers like /u/nounhud are good. People focusing on FUBAR are wrong. While it may share a root and phonetically they sound similar foo and bar, as seen in programming examples, is no reference to how messed up some code is such as /u/Hickorywhat is describing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
