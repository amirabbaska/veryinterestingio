		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A turbo charger is connected to the exhaust. The exhaust spins a set of turbines extremely similar to a jet engine. The air gets compressed in the turbines and is then forced out with greater force and is then rammed into the engine. The higher compression in the cylinders makes more power.</p>
<p>A supercharger is connected to the engine itself and uses that power to force more air into the engine at higher pressure making more power.</p>
<p>Basically the name of the game is more air at higher than normal pressure. The only difference between the two is how they generate power to force air into the engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, more air in the engine means more fuel can be exploded which means more power. Superchargers and turbo chargers both do this just in different ways.</p>
<p>A Turbo charger is just a fan that pushes air into the engine. But how do we spin this fan? Using the exhaust coming out of your engine already! Because it uses exhaust gas to run, turbo chargers are actually quite fuel effiecient. But that fan has to spin up, hence when you take off in a turbo car, the turbo &quot;spools&quot; and gradually gets stronger as the exhaust gas spins it. Luckily this is an exponential process - you take off, some exhaust gas spins the fan, which shoves some air into the engine, making it run harder, producing more exhaust gas, spinning the fan even more, etc etc.</p>
<p>Basically a turbo charger is just a smart way of recycling the usually wasted exhaust gas to spin a fan and push more O2 into engine for more power.</p>
<p>Super chargers are exactly the same thing in concept. They force air through the engine to create more explosions! But they don't have to &quot;wind up&quot; or &quot;spool&quot;... Why? Because they are powered by the engine itself!
This means you get instant air into the engine, no need to wait for a fan to spin up from exhaust gas. A downside to this is the engine is now running itself, and the supercharger, and then even more fuel for when more air is pumped into it. They are very bad for fuel economy, but in terms of speed they are faster.
I'm more of an expert on turbochargers (jdm life) so my supercharger knowledge might be off so feel free to correct me!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of answers here that are in the ballpark, but missing details.  This is decidedly not a ELI5 type of answer, but the question is broad.</p>
<p>Superchargers and turbochargers increase the volumetric efficiency of an engine by increasing the manifold pressure beyond atmospheric pressure.  The goal is to put more oxygen into the cylinder so that more fuel can be burned, which means more power can be generated.  When you push the accelerator in a naturally aspirated engine, you have only the pressure of the atmosphere pushing air into the cylinders.  That means a 1 litre engine can, at most, contain 1 litre of air/fuel mixture (very clever engineering gets some engines above this slightly).  Forcing the air into the engine allows you to cram more than 1 litre of air into a 1 litre engine, often as much as 200-300% more. </p>
<p>How they differ is in how they generate that pressure.  Superchargers are just the compressor which is driven directly by the engine, either with a gear set or belt, typically.  Just like any other accessory, driving the compressor takes some of the power from the engine.  This isn't a problem, as the supercharger always adds more than it requires.  There are a bunch of different types of compressors used, and they all have different strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>Turbochargers have both a compressor and an impeller.  Instead of the compressor being driven directly by the engine, it's driven by the expansion of exhaust gasses.  Because the exhaust is considered waste, turbos are more efficient than superchargers, essentially reusing the waste to produce power.  But, because they aren't driven directly by the engine, they are less responsive than superchargers.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turbo uses exhaust, supercharger is connected to the belt system, both force air into the engine. With a turbo you’ll see more high rpm power, with a supercharger you’ll find more low end power. There is also a power charger, which does some sort of mix of both.
Super chargers are mounted on the top of engines (not sure if it replaces or sits on the carb.)
Turbos are connected to the exhaust pipe and the fumes spin the fan that forces are into the engine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both try to achieve the same goal: air compression.  A more compressed air charge means it can be combined with more fuel. More fuel + more air equals a bigger bang when the spark plug ignites the fuel air mix, and you get more power.</p>
<p>Both use a turbine mechanism to achieve this.  The difference is how the turbine is powered.  In a turbo charger, exhaust gases power the turbine.  In a supercharger, the engine itself turns the turbine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
