		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on you what you qualify as a solution, one might say there <em>is</em> currently a solution to baldness. The solution, however, is surgical.</p>
<p>The hair on the top of your head is different than the hair on the crown/sides of your head. The hair on the top of your head is susceptible to [DHT or Dihydrotestosterone] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dihydrotestosterone</a>).</p>
<p>The hair on your head is in a constant state of shedding and regrowth. DHT strangles the follicle which makes the regrowth hair come back smaller and less healthy that the hair it replace. Eventually the follicle gets so strangled that the hair that replaces the original is microscopic and seemingly gone. This is when baldness occurs.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_transplantation" target="_blank">Medical Hair Restoration, or hair transplantation</a> is an effective solution to baldness if the end goal is to <em>not</em> look like a bald person. What it involves is moving a specific number of hairs from the sides of your head to the top of your head. It doesn't cure the underlying &quot;problem&quot; but it masks the results of that problem to a degree.</p>
<p>The issues with this treatment is that if you get it prematurely (before you're actually bald), you will have to go multiple times as the non-surgically-replaced hair falls out. Some doctors only recommend 3 maximum hair replacement surgeries, so they often recommend waiting until you're significantly bald or start a regime of drugs after your first surgery.</p>
<p>Often people will fix problem spots with the surgery, then start taking/using medications like <a href="https://www.drugs.com/cdi/finasteride.html" target="_blank">finasteride</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minoxidil" target="_blank">minoxidil</a>. The surgery effectively &quot;fixed&quot; the thinning/bald areas and the drugs prevent future hair from falling out.</p>
<p>The problem with the above mentioned technique is that often, the drugs can have <a href="https://www.drugs.com/sfx/finasteride-side-effects.html" target="_blank"><strong>serious side effects</strong></a>. In the end, however, you can be successful in &quot;curing&quot; the effects of baldness.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there's no simple, non-invasive or potentially chemically dangerous solution.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>24 here, almost 25y old. Using minoxodil for two years now.</p>
<p>We lose our hair mainly in the center part of the head 'cause the follicles in that area are susceptible to the hormone dihydrotestosterone. The follicles on the sides are much less susceptible, and we don't really understand why yet.</p>
<p>This hormone is a result of the processes that the much more known Testosterone endures in the body. To fight the presence of the dihydro variant, you have to fight Testosterone itself.</p>
<p>Finasteride does exactly this. If you use it you're very likely to even get hair back. My granddad was using this at 70+ to help his prostate and was growing hair back.</p>
<p>The problem with Finasteride is that it will give you hair but you are also pretty likely to lose libido, to get erectile disfunction and there seems to be cases of sterility.</p>
<p>That's why I never accepted it. The alternative is Minoxidil, which will make the process slower by giving the follicles where you apply it more breathing room before the Dihydrotestosterone kills them. </p>
<p>This is what I'm using, till it gets to that point where shaving just looks better and then that's the way to go. </p>
<p>When you're bald you can consider autotransplant: they'll get your sane follicles from back and sided and put it on the center part.</p>
<p>Elon Musk has had a transplant, if you're interested on how much successful it can be. He's a much more handsome man now</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A significant part of male pattern baldness (the type of baldness i assume your are talking about) is due to genetics and the hormone dihydrotestosterone. baldness is caused due to the sensitivity of the hair follicle to that hormone. topical treatments can reduce the effect of the hormone on a patch of hair (Propecia and Avodart) but a &quot;cure&quot; would require major alterations to either the production of the hormone or to the sensitivity of the follicle.  either one of these would be likely to produce significant (possibly dangerous) side effects in the patient. so far no permanent treatment has made it through enough clinical trials to be considered effective and safe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you can afford it, they pick hair follicles from the back of your head and transplant them to the top of the scalp and the front. My big brother and two cousins have been through the process (cost about $2000-$4000) and after 6-12 months, they have full hair and you can't notice a thing unless you closely inspect the tiny hole scars on the back of their head; which is difficult because now they grow hair there. </p>
<p>tl;dr There is a solution, it's just not cheap enough for everyone</p>
<p>ps: they told me they just got painkiller injections on their head first, had to sit straight for a day, and felt no pain, and even had lunch in the middle of the procedure. You have to sleep with a special pillow for a week or so and your head is bandaged. It's a good idea to take it on holiday or a 2-3 weeks break from work. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before I explain anything to address the question, I'd like to point out that these types of questions are really hard to answer. &quot;How does X work?&quot; or &quot;How did we cure X?&quot; is easy to simplify and present in a manageable format because we already have the entirety of the story, so we know what is important and what isn't. &quot;Why isn't there a X?&quot; or &quot;Why don't we understand X?&quot; is really hard to answer because we don't actually know what we don't know. There's no way to predict what is important for the solution to a complex problem and what is just a red herring until after you've solved the problem. Anyway...</p>
<p>There are actually plenty of solutions to baldness. But the problem is that they aren't viewed as acceptable (whether medically or socially). Toupees are a &quot;solution&quot; to baldness, but people think they look goofy. Women wear wigs all the time, and they can be difficult to distinguish from natural hair, and the same can be said of high-end toupees. But the toupee has become a meme representing socially inept or unacceptable schlubs. Hair transplantation is another option that quite literally eliminates the defining factor of baldness: the lack of hair in an area. People still question its ability to make &quot;normal-looking&quot; hairlines, but that is mostly informed by past techniques and not more advanced current approaches. So you're not really asking for a solution to baldness so much as an easily accessible, socially and medically acceptable solution to baldness with no or minimal side effects. And adding those caveats to &quot;solution&quot; makes it a great deal more complicated.</p>
<p>If you're talking about <em>pharmaceutically</em> treating hair loss, that's a slightly different issue. Firstly, male pattern baldness (or &quot;androgenic baldness&quot; because it can affect women too) is genetic, and it is very difficult, if not impossible, to &quot;treat&quot; genetic disorders. You can't really change the genes in a person (barring some exceedingly technical and/or experimental approaches). Your best hope is to eliminate the symptoms, which can be done with some of the approaches I've mentioned above. Secondly, baldness is related to hormonal signaling. Playing with hormones is difficult and can have some pretty severe side effects, most of which aren't acceptable when your goal is cosmetic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
