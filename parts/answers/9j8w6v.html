		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That dead fish smell is largely the result of a chemical compound called Putrescine.  Putrescine is an amine (volatile, and therefore smelly compound) that is produced during the breakdown of amino acids (lots of this occurs in dead flesh). The longer the flesh has been dead, the more amino acids are breaking down which leads to more Putrescine.  </p>
<p>Human aversion to compounds like Putrescine (and it’s cousin cadaverine) is likely an evolutionary trait to prevent people from eating rotten flesh.</p>
<p>Interestingly, when you add a carboxylic acid (like citric acid found in lemon juice) to amines like Putrescine, you form an amide, which is much less volatile, and therefore less smelly.  Try it next time you have some raw fish in front of you.  Lemon juice should drastically reduce that dead fish smell.</p>
<p>Edit: u/Kaiserbread pointed out that citric acid protonates the amine instead of reacting to form an amide.</p>
<p>Also u/APE_PHEREMONES has a great explanation if a fish specific pathway in another comment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>“In order to maintain fluid balance, ocean creatures must fill their cells with amino acids and amines to counter the saltiness of seawater. Ocean fish tend to rely on trimethylamine oxide (TMAO) for this purpose.</p>
<p>The problem, or stink, arises when fish are killed and bacteria and fish enzymes convert TMAO into trimethylamine (TMA), which gives off the characteristic fishy odor.</p>
<p>This chemical is especially common in the flesh of cold-water surface-dwelling fish like cod. So cod would start smelling faster than, say, catfish.”</p>
<p>So, ocean fish will have a more fishy smell than freshwater fish.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most psycho girlfriend I ever had worked in the fish market at Ralphs. Came home smelling like rotten fish every night to launch into a psycho rant about something. 30 years later when I walk by a grocery store stinky fish market there is that little twinge of &quot;oh no, the smell of evil&quot; that pops up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
