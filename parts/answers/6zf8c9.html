		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a great CGPGrey video on this on YouTube. Its called Americapox or something.</p>
<p>I think it largely states that it was due to the americas not having domesticated animals which humans stay in prolonged contact with (in densely populated areas like cities), and that most dangerous diseases spread from animals to humans. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with what has already been said, indigenous peoples of the Americas had much better hygiene than Europeans, even when they had densely populated areas. This helps stop diseases from not only spreading, but forming/evolving in the first place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cow, pig, horse, sheep, goat, chicken, duck, camel, pigeon. All of these animals had been domesticated in the Old World and most of them were also carriers of disease. Most of the deadly diseases come from animals, a disease does NOT want to kill its host, unless it thinks its host is a totally different animal, in which case, oops.</p>
<p>Compared to that plethora of animal diversity in an Old World backyard, they had just the llama in the New World. Yeah, go figure. The Old World children contracted the diseases when they were small and resilient to the high temperature fevers the diseases subjected them to, making them immune from future attacks via immune system memory. When the Old World people came about, they brought the animals with them as well, as well as numerous other articles made out of those animals. We're also talking about a period of time where people in the Old World didn't bathe out of fear of catching some waterborne disease.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another factor is that Europe is connected to Africa and Asia, while America is isolated, so Europeans have been in contact with more diseases than native Americans in the first place. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As (can't believe I'm going to type this) /u/bunchofcunts noted stronger immune systems is the main factor, but it should be noted that syphilis went from the New World to Europe and infected many millions of Europeans.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
