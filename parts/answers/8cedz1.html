		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An embassy is a building where the ambassador works. An ambassador is a representative of a foreign country.</p>
<p>At its most basic, and ambassador is a sort of messenger -- in fact, the word &quot;ambassador&quot; comes from a very old Celtic word that meant &quot;messenger&quot; or &quot;servant&quot;.</p>
<p>For example, the French ambassador to the US works at the French embassy at 4101 Reservoir Rd NW in Washington D.C. His job is to officially represent the French government. That is, if the US government needs to say something really important to the French government, instead of jetting over to France, they can just summon the French ambassador. Everything they say to him, they are saying directly to the French government.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the embassy is also tasked with looking after its own citizens. If, for example, you're in a foreign country and your passport is stolen, you can go to your country's embassy, prove your identity and get travel documents so you can get back home. If you're arrested for something, your embassy can help you find a lawyer, ensure that your rights are respected and -- if the charges are plainly ridiculous or you're being badly mistreated somehow -- try to secure your release.</p>
<p>If you hear that a government has &quot;summoned the ambassador of country X&quot;, that usually means they want to severely criticize that government. If a government <em>expels</em> the ambassador of country X, that means the two countries are no longer on speaking terms.</p>
<p>There's a myth that an embassy is technically on the soil of the country it represents; i.e., if you go into the French embassy in Washington DC, you're technically in France. This is not true.</p>
<p>But there is a concept of &quot;diplomatic immunity&quot;. Think of, for example, the US Embassy in North Korea. If the North Korean police kept going in there for whatever reason, you'd start to think that maybe the North Koreans were interfering with or spying on the work of the staff. So there is an agreement that countries should not interfere with the work of foreign diplomats: the police, army, even the fire brigade don't go into an embassy compound without the permission of that embassy's government. It's not illegal, but it could start a war. Also, diplomats don't have their official briefcases searched by customs, and so on.</p>
<p>But because of this diplomatic immunity, it's an open secret that &quot;diplomatic staff&quot; are often actually spies. And even where they're not spies, they often can't be prosecuted for criminal acts: there are cases of diplomats literally getting away with murder because the murder was committed inside the embassy and that government refused permission for the host country's police to investigate it.</p>
<p>That's why many countries have expelled Russian diplomatic staff recently. This came in the wake of the poisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in the UK, an act which is strongly suspected to have been done on the orders of the Kremlin. If so, it would likely have been committed by somebody under cover of diplomatic immunity: they could have smuggled the nerve agent in diplomatic baggage, and the British police won't be allowed to arrest them or even investigate them. But what the British can do -- and did do -- is to declare some of the diplomats &quot;persona non grata&quot;, meaning they must leave the country.</p>
<p>This first of all is basically a way of punishing Russia. But also, it's hoped that at least some of those diplomats are actually spies, and that by expelling them, the British have made it harder for the Russians to carry out further similar attacks.</p>
<p>EDIT: Thanks for the gold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
