		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Me and another redditor had a short exchange about a similar topic a couple days ago and since there are no perfect answers yet, here is what I researched afterwards (it was mainly about whether insects would be able to recognize humans): The brain of an insect works entirely different from the brain of a mammal or other larger animals. They are much more instinct driven to a point that they will move and even mate after being decapitated until they eventually starve. Some roaches even retain &quot;memory&quot; without their brain.
So for insects I concluded that they would not understand what a human or any larger animal is and would only perceive them as a warm surface. Someone who knows more about this is welcome to correct me though. </p>
<p>So overall I think there are limiting factors for every kind of animal like sight etc, but the most important point is the complexity of their brains and their cognitive ability to understand the concept of another animal in the first place.
Personal anecdote concerning other species: I am fairly certain from the behavior of pets that small birds and mammals know perfectly well what a human is and can distinguish them.</p>
<p>Edit:
Guys I know that spiders are no insects, that is why I am talking about insects and not spiders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The limit would be complexity, and that in turn is limited by size. </p>
<p>Spiders, though, are a diverse group, with varying lifestyles and minds, and depending on the kind of spider there's also a question of how well it can even see. If it was a <em>Portia</em>, I wouldn't be suprised if it knew exactly what was going on, but if it's a blind cave spider, well, it percieves you through vibrations and smells only. Most spiders are closer to the latter category.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I doubt anyone will be able to tell you exactly what a spider is thinking.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think animals are able to identify and recognize other animals based on how similar they are, there are so many traits that make them similar (warm blooded, hair/fur, live births). An example being mammals identify other mammals a lot quicker than they would with an insect.</p>
<p>Like how lions hunt gazelles (itself a product of instinct and food chain hierarchy), dogs will chase after whatever small backyard rodents they see (squirrels, chipmunks). Dogs identify humans and react to their presence as well as creating relationships with much bigger mammals (documentaries with a lab and an elephant being friends, lion cubs raised by dogs).</p>
<p>My dog- a small cairn terrier- chases smaller mammals too but when he finds anl insect on the ground (a spider, a fly or a stinkbug) he has absolutely no idea what to make of it since it is nothing biologically like him.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tricky bit is &quot;recognize&quot;. Even a single celled paramecium senses when it bumps into something and changes direction, but probably doesn't consider it another living thing.</p>
<p>I think insects can distinguish generally between life and non-life, since they'll bite or sting you but don't seem to do that to a stick. Compared to a stick, your finger is (probably) warmer and has a different chemical signature - oils on the skin, salt from sweat, dead skin cells etc.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, at some scale your dead skin cells might be scavenge-able food for something perhaps the size of small zooplankton, and so your finger now looks like a surface covered in food. So then they might 'recognise' you differently, but react to life their own size with a 'fight or flight' instinct. Does that still count? I guess it's up to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
