<p>Sorry for the long type up, but I'm a current vet student (with a fair amount of real-life clinical experience too) and actually just sat in on a presentation of this last semester and found it super fascinating. </p>
<p>TL;DR at the bottom if you want. </p>
<pre><code>
**Now here goes....**

While these types of allergies are rarely diagnosed, they most certainly do exist and are probably more common than most people think. 

For the most part, allergy symptoms in dogs and cats have conserved mechanisms and present similarly to how they would in humans (less so cats than dogs I must add. Cats are physiological weirdos).

Just like humans, most pet allergies worsen during certain seasons or when the animal is stressed, or sometimes they just spur up for seemingly no good reason. 

But while most animals have a certain trigger or pattern to their allergies and flare ups which are fairly easy to recognize, there are also plenty of animals who, again like some humans,  just have absolutely terrible allergies years round. And just like in humans, the first steps we can take for these pets are simple allergen exposure tests, which can provide a lot of information. One of the allergens of some tests includes human skin/hair/dander samples, and some pets do present mild reactions to this. 

For most pets simply attempting to limit exposure, and antihistamines can do the trick. Some, however, require a daily dose of expensive drugs that target cytokines, granulocyte receptors, and secondary messengers...basically a bunch of other things that cause allergy symptoms. For most of the rest, this works, although some might also need (or want) to have antigen exposure injections and behavioral conditioning to really make things as best as possible. 

But even still there are that 0.001 % of dogs whose symptoms just don't respond enough to these treatments (or sometimes rich owners who want 'holistic' and 'natural' drugless remedies - which is fine...in some cases..)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>So basically,</strong> every once in a while a dog comes around that just blows other dogs out of the water in terms of how bad their allergies are and how much this makes their lives suck.</p>
<p>For dogs like this, the simple test mentioned above do not always produce the results we need them to and so individual treatments plans are developed based on the dog and sometimes require the expertise of a veterinarian who specializes in the clinical symptom(s) the pet is presenting (i.e. dermatological symptoms, ENT symptoms, GI symptoms, etc). </p>
<p><em>Aside -- I keep saying dog because I have never seen a cat reach this level of allergy suffering - although I have seen them test positive to allergic to human antigens at one of my past places of employment</em></p>
<p>For extremely problematic cases, often times the first steps taken after general skin tests, serology tests and bloodwork fail to produce results is trying to identify what the pet is responding to by slowly treating every aspect of their life as a variable and then removing it, and watching for improvements. </p>
<p>Usually, this begins with food substitutions (since protein allergies are extremely common) and can progress to the dog's entire environment needing to be altered, and activity and travel limited, or completely stopped, except to and from the vet's office. </p>
<p>This whole process requires a ton of effort, vigilance and is extremely taxing on both owners and their pets since even the slightest exposure to an allergen can ruin days, weeks and even months of observation and attempted treatment. </p>
<p>I have only seen a few cases of dogs requiring this level of treatment, and of those few, I have only heard of one case introduced as a case study where the major cause of allergy symptoms was determined to be direct or indirect exposure ..to well...people.  </p>
<p>~~</p>
<p>Long story short, this relatively young, absolutely beautiful (and probably expensive), unaltered duck toll retriever presented to one of my professor's previous workplaces with severe itchy, scaly skin, excessive hair loss, occasional GI problems, and recurrent hot-spots( amongst other symptoms). After almost a year of treatment and careful monitoring, they decided to try isolation therapy as one of their last attempts, and it ended up helping the dog significantly. </p>
<p>The exact isolation procedure was pretty intense and required a ton of special set-ups, special cleaning, and honestly probably wasn't a great way to treat a pet, but it certainly provided a lot of insight when the dog's symptoms began to improve. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, we never learned what happened to the pup after being diagnosed with severe human allergies, although we did conjecture as a class as to his fate. And afaik, no exact mechanism was identified either so everything while this interesting case was identified, we really don't know much about it all.  </p>
<p>But yea, I hope that answers your question sufficiently! </p>

**TL;DR: Dogs (and to a lesser extent, in my experience, cats) can be allergic to humans, and sometimes can be diagnosed with relatively simple exposure tests - which can involve testing for human antigens.**

**One dog we learned about in a case study was diagnosed with a human allergy so severe it was virtually untreatable with drugs. We never found out what happened after that, unfortunately. I like to think he lived a long happy life and passed away peacefully knowing he was a good boy**</code></pre></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep! I'm a veterinary technician in a dermatology practice. It's something we test for in our standard allergy testing, either through blood or skin tests. It is something some pets are allergic to but not typically a huge contributor to their symptoms. We can add human dander to an allergen mix for them, which consists of bi-weekly injections exposing them to their allergens so they don't flare up when exposed. We can also treat with medications for itching. Antihistamines are not very effective in dogs because allergies are not a histamine reaction to the same extent they are in people. Typically we give Apoquel or Cytopoint injections, which target the proteins in the sequence that causes the itching sensation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My 3yo Bernese Mountain Dog has been battling bad allergies most of his life. We had him tested and turns out one of the top things is Human Dander. So not exactly, directly allergic (would die if touched) but still irritated by touch. His ears are always warm and red and he chews his feet until they get infected. </p>
<p>We've tried allergy shots, full time cone wearing, boots, chaga mushrooms, bentonite clay, everything.  The only thing that works is a prescription calls Apoquel (spelling?). After a few days he's a different dog, only downside is because of his size he currently takes about 3 pills a day and they run just over $2.11 a pill...thankfully we have insurance on both of my Berners. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes pets can absolutely be allergic to things, including people and even inanimate objects. I had a problem crop up with one of my cats where he started losing fur on his chin and neck area, developing sores, pustules, it was pretty nasty. Turns out it was the metal water bowl touching him as he drank and irritating his skin. It caused hives, he scratched them, and that led to hair loss, scaly skin, and all manner of unpleasantness. </p>
<p>For human beings there are tests you can take to check for sensitivity such as prick tests on the skin where your skin is pricked or scratched in the presence of an allergen and then left to see if a reaction occurs. </p>
<p>Such a test should work on pets however it's not something that would be commonly done unless there was a reason to. You'd have to shave a patch of fur off, give them the test and then bandage the test site up to protect it until it could be observed later. </p>
<p>My little guy ended up recovering thanks to something I never though I would need to buy again.....Stridex pads. Yep, the stuff every teenager has had to deal with when acne started. Applying the pads and wiping along with changing to a plastic bowl took about a month to get back to normal. You kind of have to keep the cat from licking the medication though and easier said than done. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely! I worked at vet clinics for 10 years and they actually test for human dander as an allergen in allergy tests. They also check for allergies to cat dander (for dogs), fleas, and most of your &quot;typical&quot; human allergens like molds, ragweed, and so on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
