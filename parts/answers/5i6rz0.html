		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D is the final, biologically active form of Vitamin D. It's quite a process to get there though.</p>
<ol>
<li>Initially the skin itself synthesizes 7-dehydrocholesterol. </li>
<li>UV light (sun) acts on this to produce Previtamin D.</li>
<li>Previtamin D undergoes a temperature rearrangement to form cholecalciferol (Vitamin D3 - your over the counter supplement).</li>
<li>Cholecalciferol is hydroxylated in the liver to produce 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OH-D, what your doctor checks when he checks your 'vitamin D levels'). </li>
<li>This compound travels to the kidney where it is hydroxylated again to 1,25OH-D. </li>
<li>1,25OH-D's responsibility is to maintain serum calcium levels by increasing GI absorption of calcium and phosphate. In a more complex feedback loop involving Parathyroid hormone, they together ensure healthy bone turnover.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The production of 'vitamin' D (in reality, a hormone, not a vitamin) is a three step process. The first step is chemical reaction produced by UV light from the sun, or an artificial source, causing a structural change in a substance in the dermis of the exposed skin, one of several plant sterols obtained from the diet. The next two steps take place in liver cells and then kidney cells based on a particular enzymes. The final product <strong>calcitriol</strong> is released into the circulation where it acts on distant organs such as the intestine and the kidney itself to increase ion transport capability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
