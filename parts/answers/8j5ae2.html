<p>If you ignore your thirst, it just gets worse and worse. You get headaches, you become light headed, your mouth becomes so dry it hurts to swallow, hurts to speak. It becomes all you can think about. The thirst completely consumes you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's only subtle at first. From age 16 to 18 I was homeless. It's horrendous when it actually hits. It will drive you to strange lengths when you're like 14 hours away from death by dehydration. Hunger will as well. It's the only time in my life where eating an old discarded piece of chicken parm out of a trash can tasted like $300 meal. Even broke into a house once just for a drink of water. The thirst can, in fact, be real.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being able to pose this question suggests that you have never been deeply thirsty. </p>
<p>Go work a hard day in the hot sun without water available and you will experience dire thirst. If you want to get an idea how strong thirst can be, try holding your breath for a couple of minutes; real thirst is slightly milder than the need to breathe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In nature edible food is always hard to find. You're foraging for plants or hunting animals, either of which requires time and effort before a pay off.</p>
<p>But water? water has always been plentiful in the areas that host species like humans. Be it a river or a lake or whatever. and while there might be some danger associated with it, it is <em>mostly</em> safe and predictable.</p>
<p>You need water =&gt; Walk to a river and drink.</p>
<p>You need food =&gt; Either look around for the 1/1000 plants that you can eat easily, or you go find an animal and chase it down for a few hours before it collapses, then you eat.</p>
<p>The time delay between <em>starting</em> to look for food and <em>acquiring</em> food is much larger normally. So hunger starts out a much stronger feeling.</p>
<p>But, it does not end that way. Thirst builds, and builds and builds, until it is overwhelming. Just as bad as any hunger pain.</p>
<p>So, thirst <em>isn't</em> a weaker or less distinct sensation, it just takes longer to build up to the same level hunger starts at, because water is normally easier to acquire.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
