		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is going to be some flow of money in through government things,  like teacher salaries,  Medicare,  Medicaid,  social security,  and welfare, building grants, education grants,  etc. </p>
<p>Sometimes people also have jobs in neighboring places or remote jobs,  in which case they are basically exporting their labor. </p>
<p>However,  it is totally possible for small town to &quot;dry up.&quot; Often small towns like that did have one main export,  be it a factory,  a mine,  a few farms,  etc. And if that employer goes under then it can  ripple and slowly squeeze out every job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>I've driven through towns that seemed to only have gas stations and a couple stores. If they have to buy from elsewhere, where does that money come from?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Farmer comes into town to shop at the store, and brings his money with him.  When he leaves, the money stays at the store (For the present instant), and he takes his purchases with him back to the farm.  So the town exports &quot;distribution services&quot; to the surrounding agricultural lands.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to be a farmer.  It could be a hunter, a snowmobiler, a backpacker, some other form of tourist, or a DestituteGoldsmith.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most small rural towns are commercial hubs for local farmers.  They need places to get the basics without taking to much time away from their farms.  They also provide a place to delivery and sell their grain/cattle without having to ship it very far(most small town are connected via rail or highway and have large grain elevators or cattle yards).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your town of 1000 &quot;in the middle of nowhere&quot; is <em>still the middle</em>.  People from miles away - like farmers outside the city limits - are going to drive into town because that's where the nearest post office/store/etc is.</p>
<p>Maybe it's on a highway/freeway/railroad with lots of traffic passing through.</p>
<p>Maybe it's near a popular tourist destination, like a ski slope or hunting/hiking/camping area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
