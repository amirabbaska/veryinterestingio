		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the answers are right but not complete. &quot;NoCaptcha&quot; reCaptcha uses heavy obfuscation of its JavaScript code in order to try to prevent an analysis of what it is measuring. This guy <a href="https://github.com/neuroradiology/InsideReCaptcha" target="_blank">https://github.com/neuroradiology/InsideReCaptcha</a> figured out what it measured by some reverse engineering and later these others <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.blackhat.com/docs/asia-16/materials/asia-16-Sivakorn-Im-Not-a-Human-Breaking-the-Google-reCAPTCHA-wp.pdf</a> figured out some of how it measures the user profiles, enough to break it.</p>
<p>These days it gets easier and easier to track individual users and devices (even if they are using different browsers!) so these techniques have the potential to work as long as how they measure it remains &quot;secret&quot;. If not, all these measures can be faked.</p>
<p>To me, is appalling to see that Google is following here the principle of Security by Obscurity, that has a long tradition of failure in IT Security. Instead they should be more bold and sponsor serious research and Security by Design. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A very important part of this, is your actual browsing history, known by Google. If Google recognize you, and knows you are browsing like every other human being would do (check the news, read your email), than you get the easy challenge. </p>
<p>However, if Google doesn't know, or trust you, you can get a lot picture solving challenges. Sometimes I have to solve 3 challenges before reCAPTCHA is satisfied. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of speculation, but not enough hard data here, unfortunately, as it's not open source.  Most of the speculation is towards things like human interaction.  As a person, to check that box, you need to use your mouse to move the icon to the box, then click it.  You're very rarely going to be dead center.  If you're a program (at least a simple one), you're going to use Javascript or something similar to move the cursor to the center of the box, then click it.</p>
<p>The thought is that it looks for non-human style movements and controls to identify bots.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>reCAPTCHA takes account of a whole lot of information about how your cursor moves before you ever click that box.  If it looks like something a spam program might do, it throws up an extra challenge, like identifying features in images, that humans are still much better at than bots.  Things that can set it off include &quot;teleporting&quot; the cursor to the right location, moving it in perfectly straight lines, and similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
