		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple factors at play. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Physically, sarcomeres (in muscle cells) generate force. The <del>bigger</del> more numerous these are (the current dogma says that muscle cells increase in size not number, while sarcomeres increase in number), the more force <em>can</em> be generated. It gets more complicated for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennate_muscle" target="_blank">pinnate muscles</a> but we will gloss over this. However...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Muscle cells have to be told to fire. This is where the central nervous system comes in. The CNS gets better at activating the <em>right</em> fibers at the right time. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_unit#Recruitment_.28vertebrate.29" target="_blank">Read more here</a>. Of course, this is related to...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Technique. Good technique is both practicing the timing of muscle recruitment <em>and</em> posture to maximize force transmission from the fibers to the weights. OP doesn't mention what &quot;lifts&quot; he is considering, but this will be especially true for Olympic lifts (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmTRWHFjfec" target="_blank">snatch / clean and jerk</a>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are also biochemical adaptations, like intramuscular ATP and creatine levels, and the enzymes that generate these. For more than a couple reps, you'll also be talking about clearance of waste products and regeneration of ATP from glucose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grip strength. For some exercises, grip strength is the limiting factor. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stabilizing muscles. Just because you have quads of steel doesn't mean you can squat 500 lb if you have a weak back and core. Think of stabilizing muscles as the <em>physical</em> aspects of &quot;good technique.&quot;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fiber type. Some fibers are fast twitch and some fibers are slow twitch. (Ok, technically, it is more complicated than that, technically we are talking about Type I vs type IIa vs type IIb) Basically, some fibers are good for aerobic activity (running) while some fibers are good for anaerobic activity (lifting). And of course, fast fibers are going to provide greater benefits for something like olympic weightlift (snatch and clean &amp; jerk) vs deadlift. </p>
</li>
<li><em>Leverage.</em> Muscles can only generate tension, so all movement can be reduced to a changing of the angle of a particular joint. Therefore, all joints basically form the basis for a lever. <a href="http://sciencelearn.org.nz/Contexts/Sporting-Edge/Looking-closer/What-levers-does-your-body-use" target="_blank"><em>However,</em> not all joints are the same type of lever.</a> For something like a biceps curl, long arms actually <em>penalize</em> you! Evolution decided (and rightly so!) that it was better to trade of strength for a compact system of 3rd class levers gives us a good amount of strength but also an incredible range of motion. The other point a lot of commenters are mentioning is <strong>insertion point</strong>, or the place where a muscle connects (to a tendon which connects) to a bone. Small changes in the insertion point can drastically alter the functional <em>strength</em> (as measured by a weight lifted) versus <em>force generation</em> which is the force the muscle is pulling on the bone. There's no easy way to explain the math here, but <a href="http://www.aaronswansonpt.com/basic-biomechanics-levers/" target="_blank">here is a site that appears to do a good job of explaining it.</a></li>

I assumed green tag was general nickname for flair, but they're actually color-coded based on discipline. I also have flair over at /r/science already.

<p>But for the record, I'm now a PhD student in biomedical engineering and have taken lots of physics/statics/dynamics/engineering physics courses, physiology, biochemistry, and biomechanics. And a bit of a lifting and fitness junkie. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is the physiological cross sectional area (PCSA) and not anatomical cross sectional area (ACSA).  The ACSA only takes into account the belly  (widest point) of the muscle. The PCSA takes into account the angle of muscle pennation as it switches back and forth between (like your quads etc). Usually the more switches in the angle of pennation results in the greater PSCA. For muscles without different fiber directions (parallel muscles or strap muscles) the ASCA = the PSCA.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The maximum amount of force is proportional to the area of the muscle's cross-section. The maximum amount of displacement is proportional to its length.</p>
<p>Muscle fibers are composed of repeating units called sarcomeres. Each sarcomere produces only so much force, and the thicker a muscle is, the more sarcomeres in parallel, adding up more force. The longer a muscle is, the more sarcomeres there are in series, the more displacement. Muscle volume is proportional to cross-section area and length, and so a bigger muscle by volume or mass (density being uniform) can perform more work (force times displacement). Keeping other factors the same, more work also means more power (work per time).</p>
<p>Muscle fibers are often at an angle, called pennation, to the line of action. The cross-section above refers to the area across the fibers. The overall force between the tendons at the ends of the muscle is scaled by the cosine of pennation, the more pennation the less useful force. Pennation can be thought of as a form of gearing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seeing a ton of broscience (not brio, lol) and conjecture in this thread. </p>
<p>The largest determining factor for strength and power output as it relates to lifting is improvements in the adaptation of the central nervous system and recruitment of muscle fiber type.</p>
<p>Your body adapts to the stimulus which it receives on a regular basis. Cross-sectional area and muscle hypertrophy go hand in hand with time under tension, but it is not the largest determining factor for strength. </p>
<p>Look at any elite Olympic weightlifter. Many of them look &quot;fit&quot;, but not overly muscular, with the exception of their enormous quads, yet <a href="https://youtu.be/nOWcrqOSevs" target="_blank">can produce enough force to clean and jerk 213kg (468lbs) at only 83kg (182lbs) body weight.</a> </p>
<p>Conversely, a bodybuilder who only cares about hypertrophy may spend the majority of their training time focusing on moderate loads, high time under tension, and low rest periods to maximize muscle size, but will not develop the recruitment patterns from the CNS to utilize that muscle into heavy compound lifts, and will subsequently be &quot;weaker&quot; than a person who routinely lifts heavier weight more often, assuming both lifters use correct form.</p>
<p>Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on who you are), the amount of type I, II, IIx, etc. fibers in your body is genetic, although through training you may be able to change the characteristics of one fiber to be more like another. For this reason, at the elite level, the sport usually chooses the individual and not vice versa. An elite marathon runner or cyclist will usually have a higher percentage of type I fibers which allow greater oxidation and are highly resistant to fatigue, but will not have a large percentage of type II fibers which are recruited under very heavy or heavy &amp; fast loads, like a powerlifter or Olympic weightlifter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
