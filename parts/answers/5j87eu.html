		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There would be plenty of signs of our civilization. Brick and wood cities can be analyzed 3000 years later. In another 3000, our paper writing would probably be dust. Our electronics unreadable. But inscription and engraving? That will stay. So the ceramic plate with a prayer on it at your grandma's house? Someone might be able to reconstruct it.</p>
<p>They'd look at our cities and see a lack of bullets in most of the walls, implying we didn't die due to war. But plague or moved away.</p>
<p>Dirt would collect and settle, and stuff would catch fire. They'll be able to tell the fire happened after.</p>
<p>C14 dating would give an approximate time period that things died. Our nuclear reactors/bombs would end up throwing the count off though, comparing stuff from now to a hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Go farther out in time? Writings no longer legible unless preserved in a bog. Some skeleton would survive. We can find Dino eggs and bugs and feathers, a human should be able to survive better. And there are 7 billion of us in the same strata. Some future Schliemann will hit the jackpot and screw everything up.</p>
<p>Our biggest structures would survive in fragmented form. Dunno if their use would be apparent or not. It'd be up to the structure. </p>
<p>And the elephant foot at each reactor would be obvious. As would the waste spoil at each enrichment facility. They'll find uranium where the isotope percentages are off. It's how we found the natural nuclear reactor in Okla. ( I think)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer the first part,  but there are a few Shows you can watch they did this topic. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aftermath:_Population_Zero" target="_blank">Aftermath: Population Zero</a> was on the National Geographic channel.  They did an overall View of the planet.
Their final statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(25,000 years A.H)
Earth enters a new Ice Age, and glaciers expand south covering most of the Northern Hemisphere. The last traces of New York City are completely erased. Most species however adapt and thrive; sea lions, ducks, fish, wolves, horses, cattle, elephants all adapt alongside many other species. However, evidence left by Moon exploration missions and certain plastic items will survive intact for not only thousands, but millions of years after mankind has vanished. They will be the last legacy of the human race.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_After_People" target="_blank">Life After People</a> was on the Discovery channel.</p>
<p>This series broke it down a little:  Structures, Chemicals, Roads...etc.   The first episode did talk about the bodies and what happens to them.  Its been a while since I've watched it,  but I might have some more information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Miners in deep dry mines, like salt mines, would probably be the longest lasting non-fossilized corpses.</p>
<p>The mines would collapse at some point.  Plate tectonics, changes in climate, and asteroid strikes would cause some salt deposits to be destroyed or washed away.</p>
<p>However, the oldest known salt deposits are 1.7 billion years old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So you're basically asking that based on what we've recovered from when dinosaurs went extinct, what equivalent would be left of us in the same time period? </p>
<p>A good clue would probably be to figure out what the populations of given extinct species were, and then extrapolate based on how many fossils we've recovered to what amount of human fossils we'd expect to recover. Were there 7 billion dinosaurs at the time of the KT extinction?</p>
<p>My guess is that most of our population centers would probably be underwater in 65 million years, but if you were to take one of the Chinese megacities that's deep inland, future paleontologists would probably find evidence of some layer that would clue them into the fact that something foreign to the expected strata occurred, and just through sheer numbers you'd probably find some fossils. So a place like Chengdu which has a population of 15 million, if they all died in this mass extinction event, you'd probably expect some bones to survive as fossils. </p>
<p>But let's take some small locality that was inhabited for the past 500 years with a population of a few thousand, not sure if people would be able to identify that it ever existed in 65 million years, then you'd have to start thinking about what technology they'd have then, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
