		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="http://www.sears.com/articles/appliances/washers-dryers/what-is-the-permanent-press-cycle-on-a-washer-or-dryer.html" target="_blank">Sears</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A washer on permanent press will wash clothes in warm water and rinse them in cool water, maintaining a mild agitation and spin. The warm water helps relax creases while the slow spin prevents new wrinkles from forming. A permanent press cycle is gentler than a regular cycle, making it good for synthetic fibers like polyester, rayon and knits. Because it does not use hot water, a permanent press cycle will also reduce shrinking and color fading.</p>
<p>A dryer on permanent press uses medium heat to smooth out wrinkles as it dries, while avoiding the high heat that can shrink clothes and fade colors.</p>
