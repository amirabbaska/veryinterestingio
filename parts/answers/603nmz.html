		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's easy to determine which company owns which IP address. When you use a VPN your IP is changed from the one you are using with your ISP to the one you are using with your VPN.</p>
<p>If  your vpn provider own their own pool of up addresses then it's easy to just block all the ip's belonging to that company.</p>
<p>If your a smaller company and you are using your providers IP address pool then you are going to have to explain why you need so many IP's (IPv4 addresses are scarece these days, my provider charges me a premium for them basically so I only use what I need) or why you need to change them so often. That can you look very unfavourable and they might just drop you as a company completely. This game has already been played with email spam. So providers are always wondering why you want to change your servers IPs so often.</p>
<p>Now IPv6 have a huge address space, but people like NetFlix will just blacklist the block of IPv6 addresses you have instead of just the single address (something very similar happened on Wikipedia recently, a single troll (we presume) was using T-mobile to vandalise Wikipedia, after a number of warnings and the like they just blocked the entire block of IPv6 addresses customers use to connect to the net from editing content on Wiki).</p>
<p>NetFlix are contractually obliged to region lock certain content. So looking for patterns such as a large amount of content being served to a small range of IPs with many different logins looks fishy (if that's not a residential ISP) can flag those addresses for closer inspection, and then you wonder &quot;Why does this server siting in a datacenter login as 50 different NetFlix users and consume a fuck ton of content compared to the average user?&quot; Just block it and get the owner of the IP to come to you and ask for it to be unblocked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>VPNs do not hide the fact that you are using one.</p>
<p>The way it works is you connect to the VPN and all your Internet traffic goes to that VPN, who then forwards it on your behalf, just like your home router. Instead of your ISP seeing all the IP addresses you connect to and sites seeing your IP address when you connect, they will see only the unidentifying VPN IP, which is why they are &quot;anonymous&quot;. Most VPN providers have a set range of IP addresses. If your ISP or a site like Netflix can figure out these ranges (not really difficult), they know you are connected to a VPN. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former Netflix employee here, this is my moment. Often people would call in for tech support and forget they were using a VPN. When we would pull up their account info we could see both the country they signed up in, and the country they were streaming from, which could be a vacation or an out of state relative etc... </p>
<p>The dead giveaway was when they lived somewhere like Canada, and they asked about a show that was exclusive to somewhere like Australia. I could never call them out on it directly, but I could let them know that VPNs were against policy, and make note on the account.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people are saying just IP address, but there's so much more that Netflix is able to do to detect VPN:</p>
<p>The big one, and most reliable way to tell is packet size. When you send any information over the internet, network equipment like routers break it up into small pieces called packets. Most networking equipment maintains the same size of packet when sending over the internet. Because VPNs need to add information to every packet, they automatically break up your actual packets into smaller than usual chunks to leave room for their own information. Netflix looks for this smaller chunk size. </p>
<p>Typical VPN users tend to be more security and privacy concious than other users. Therefore, they have a high likelyhood of installing browser extensions such as ghostery, donottrack, adblock, and similar. They can build a fingerprint of these users, because they have enough of them. </p>
<p>It really isn't packet size, fingerprint, or IP range that they use, but rather a combination of all of them. Netflix and other large internet companies have so many users that the data they can collect and use from them is incredibly accurate. They have a complex system of algorithms that look at all the data and determine if you're a VPN user or not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have IP range lists that they are constantly expanding. That's why some VPN's used to work with Netflix and others not. Until they expanded their lists and included more. The VPN I use used to work with Netflix until fairly recently. Then it just stopped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
