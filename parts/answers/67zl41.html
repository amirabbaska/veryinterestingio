		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know, there's a great story about the counterfeiter Frank Bourassa who only printed 20 dollar bills. They stayed in circulation for quite a while, because people didn't scrutinize as harshly when they checked twenties. He printed millions, and eventually got caught, made a plea with the government, and afaik only spent a few months in jail, because he would only tell them where the rest of his counterfeit money was if they made a deal with them. They made twenties harder to forge because of him.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As soon as you spend it, it's likely going to be deposited into that business's bank account.</p>
<p>Bank money counters spot fake bills even when a person can't.</p>
<p>Most counterfeit bills don't circulate for as long as you would think because of this.</p>
<p>Edit: The money counters I'm referring to are actually machines. We don't employee people just to count money, and even if we did with wouldn't call them money counters. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I received a counterfeit $10 from a bank once. It was part of a wrapped stack, and when I opened it to count them, one felt weird. Failed the counterfeit pen.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what became of it. I gave it to the store owner (I was a lowly assistant manager).</p>
<p>So, to answer your question: not very well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
