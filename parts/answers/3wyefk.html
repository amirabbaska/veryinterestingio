		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone whose rent is paid by this, here's my ELI5..</p>
<p>TL;DR: here are two types of strictly royalties as far as composers/writers go. Mechanicals and performance. If you're an artist or producer there's also artist royalties, producer royalties, and neighboring rights. </p>
<p>Mechanicals: these are easy. The rate is set by the government and is paid on a per-sale basis at $0.091 per song sold, and that amount is divided up amongst the songwriters (so if there are two writers, each one of them gets $0.0455 for every song sold). They're collected and administered by either the record labels (who receive the gross money for the sale and pay everyone out) or in the case of cover songs, a company called the Harry Fox Agency. These payments are usually semiannual but sometimes quarterly. </p>
<p>Performance: this is a much wider net. Is your song in a TV show? Every time it plays you'll receive SOME money - how much is up to a complex formula based system put in place by the &quot;Performance Rights Organizations&quot; (i.e. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC, GMR, etc). I've made anywhere from 3 cents to over a thousand on a single TV play (depending on how long they use it, what time of day, how many people watch the show, what network, etc). Radio plays are also paid to the writers per play, and can be up to $15 per station per play. So if your song is getting 2000 spins a week (i.e. a hit song), that's $30k per week to split amongst the writers. Not bad. The PRO's all have different pay schedules, but to make things easy let's say they're basically quarterly.</p>
<p>Streaming comes through both lanes depending on if you're published and how the song is released. Spotify/Pandora will usually come through the PRO (sometimes the former through the route of the mechanical). The rub with these services is that the music labels will license the song to them extra cheap in exchange for stock on the company or large non-specific advances that they don't have to pass along to the artists/writers - no bueno. Which is why artists/writers are complaining about streaming while the corporate side is suspiciously silent.. </p>
<p>And lastly if you are the artist you'll get an additional artist royalty from the label once you've made back the money they spent on you (or making your album). Producers are entitled to a similar royalty, albeit much smaller. And then there's this thing called &quot;neighboring rights&quot; in other countries where the people who performed on the song (musicians, producers, artists) and the label owners get an additional performance royalty for that - but that is for another day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Composers and songwriters are paid by performing rights organizations or PROs for short.  There are three in the US and one in every other country.  They are ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC.  I have included their websites at the end of this post if you want to go directly there to learn more.  Basically, radio, tv, restaurants/bar, the web, etc.  (Anywhere music is played AND money is made) must pay a fee to each of these companies.  A songwriter can only be signed to one of these companies.  They gather the money and distribute the royalties.  Most songwriters are paid quarterly.  They are generally paid three quarters behind so it can take some time to be paid for your songs.  Also, songwriters need to register their songs in order to be paid.  It is free to join SESAC if you meet with a rep.  It is a very small fee ($50) or something close to that for ASCAP or BMI and can be done online.  Also, it is hard to say for a #1 - depends on the genre  But it will be substantial.  Keep in mind, most songs are written by several people and those people often have publishers so it can be quite complicated and that number will be split and split again.  You can learn more at www.sesac.com, www.bmi.com, and www.ascap.com.  </p>
<p>To answer the other question below.  These companies either use their own in house monitoring service to see which and when songs are played.  Or they may use Nielsen Soundscan which is pretty much the industry standard.  There are also companies that monitor the internet and pay songwriters for plays they find online and then pay songwriters either on their own or through one of the performing right companies mentioned above.  One is called TuneSat, but there are others too.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two components of a song that are distinct and separate and understanding how they are different is essential.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The composition that a song writer composes and puts down in sheet music. This is the copyright and the royalty recipient is the songwriter. He is often represented by a Publisher.</p>
</li>
<li>A recording of such a composition. This is the master and the royalty recipient is the artist. He is often represented by a Label.</li>
</ol>
<p>The terminology is important. While &quot;artist&quot; seems like a fair way to describe someone who writes songs, it will cause confusion if you try to apply it that way in this kind of discussion. So songwriter-copyright-publisher and then artist-master-label is the way it is.</p>
<p>Both the songwriter and the artist receive royalties but they are quite different in how they are calculated and handled. Sometimes the writer and the artist are the same person, probably more often they are not, but even if they are, they will get checks from two different entities. Think about &quot;singer songwriter&quot; as a genre, it's referring to someone who does both.  Let's invent a writer and an artist for these examples - Joe Melody is a gifted songwriter and composer, and Bob Crooner is a singer with a killer voice. Joe Melody is represented by a Publisher, and Bob Crooner is represented by a Label. Each of those entities is responsible for tracking the usage of their intellectual property, gathering the income and distributing it to Joe and Bob. There are so many different revenue streams it's hard to break down who gets what from where but I'll try. I guess I will go by platform, and keep it simple. There is plenty of nuance and exception that will bog us down.</p>
<p>CD, LP, Cassette or other physical format, and also digital permanent download:</p>
<p>Crooner records an album of 10 of Melody's songs. His label gets him in a studio and manufactures a CD and gets it on Amazon and they also get the album on iTunes. On Crooner's behalf, his Label has requested from Melody's Publisher licenses to use the written songs. To keep it brief, these licenses are free and require only that Crooner notify Melody that it is happening. This license binds Crooner to pay Melody 9.1c for every sale he makes of him singing Melody's song. This rate is set by the government and the Label is responsible for paying it to the Publisher. The Label will administer this whole deal.</p>
<p>So a track gets sold on iTunes. iTunes receives 0.99c and the Crooner's Label a month or two later gets their 0.70c. Crooner's label then owes Melody's Publisher 9.1c. So what happens to the other 0.60c and what does Crooner get?</p>
<p>That depends. Because at first music could not be recorded and taken away to listen to again, we have a very well developed government mandated ruleset for compositions, but not for the master recordings. They were a relatively late development, and the free market has found its own level. Basically Crooner and the Label agree on a percentage of income that allows for both to earn something. Crooner agrees to a 15% royalty. Does that seem low? It's not really. Out of the 0.60c the Label is left with it needs to do a lot of things, including recoup the costs of the studio time, artwork, manufacturing, promotion etc. and also pay their rent and staff. The bargaining power of each party will ebb and flow over time and contracts will be renegotiated every couple of years. Three to five years is a normal range for a contract. If Crooner signs for 15% of net income on a three year contract and he really takes off as a singer, when the contract expires he can ask for more or shop around if he wants.</p>
<p>Radio Play</p>
<p>Crooner's song comes on the radio in your car. Crooner gets nothing. Melody's and his Publisher are members of a Performance Rights Organisation which arranges paid licenses with anybody who wishes to publicly play music and distributes fees to the songwriters based on how much airplay a song gets. This PRO will pay Melody his share direct and Melody's Publisher their share direct, this is not something the Publisher manages. How much it is depends on the PRO and what kind of deal they made with whoever is playing the music.</p>
<p>Remember how I said Crooner gets nothing? That's just the way it is in the US right now. Luckily for Crooner, terrestrial radio is becoming a smaller piece of the pie. He will get performance royalties as an artist for digital radio and digital streaming services like Sirius, Pandora or Spotify. Melody is already set up to receive his songwriter royalty. For streaming it is set at 10% of net income, not 9.1c. A lot of streaming plays, especially if they are ad-supported might bring in a fraction of a cent.</p>
<p>I'm going to stop here to see if I am getting at the info you want. I'm happy to expand and answer other questions. I've been in the business of operating label and publisher concerns for 15 years.</p>
<p>ETA: the royalty cycle is either quarterly or half yearly and you can expect to get paid 45-90 days after the end of a period for any income processed during said period. e.g. Jan-Jun might be a pay period, and everyone would received checks mid August or end September.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, I can provide a brief overview here but I'm sure lawyers and others more directly involved in the music business will have more to add and provide greater accuracy.</p>
<p>With every recorded song there are two copyrights, one for the composer and one for the recording artist. Sometimes those rights belong to the same person, sometimes not. </p>
<p>Anyway, composers and recording artists both have groups that represent them and collect royalties on their behalf. The problem is that there are multiple types of rights that can be licensed to a song or composition.</p>
<p>For example, if you want to publicly perform a composition, you'll have to get with a performing rights organization (PRO) (or rather, the venue you perform at will). Want to burn your cover to a CD? You'll need a mechanical license but that's a different organization.   </p>
<p>You can see a flow chart of the process here: <a href="http://static.myce.com/images_posts/2010/08/Music-Licensing-Flowchart.jpg" target="_blank">http://static.myce.com/images_posts/2010/08/Music-Licensing-Flowchart.jpg</a> Bear in mind that the chart is based on the UK so some terms are slightly different though the principle, to my understanding, is largely the same.</p>
<p>Theoretically, these various groups who hold all of these different rights pay the artists they represent, usually quarterly. How they determine the payment is usually by how much the songs they created are used. How that is determined varies from group to group.</p>
<p>For example, record labels know pretty well exactly how many copies of a CD are sold or how many times a song is streamed on Spotify. But how many times a song is performed in a club? Well, that's a bit more difficult. </p>
<p>To that end PROs rely on bars and restaurants to provide reporting forms on what they played. Few, in my experience, do, so it ends up being like Nielsen, where a small number of clubs are used to determine what clubs at large are playing. Like I said though, methods vary depending on the rights at issue.</p>
<p>All of that being said, music licensing is a giant mess that leaves no one happy. This is one of the reasons it's a major topic for copyright reform in the U.S. over the next few years. I know it's not very ELI5, but hopefully it helps some. </p>
<p>Edit: To answer the question about how long it goes on, it goes until the copyright in the work expires. So yes, the person will receive checks until their death and then their estate will continue to get such checks for quite a long period of time afterward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a funny little anecdote.</p>
<p>In Disney's <em>The Emperor's New Groove</em> Patrick Warburton (David Puddy, Joe Swanson, and Brock Samson, depending on your age) plays a royal bodyguard named Kronk. </p>
<p>There is a scene in which Kronk is sneaking around transporting the unconscious body of Emperor Kuzco in a sack, which he throws over a waterfall,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km40jvV5lhM" target="_blank">(See here.)</a> all while humming/scatting a little tune. Apparently, and I'm trying but I can't find my source on this, so forgive me (or back me up:) Patrick is infamously tone deaf, and was supposed to be humming something similar to the Mission Impossible theme. (Or Disney's knock-off soundalike version.) He botched the job so poorly that he was credited with an original composition ('Kronk's Sneaky Theme?' I have no idea) and Disney legal had him sign over royalties to them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
