Some traditional characters have up to 20+ strokes (lines used to draw the character).  The simplified version aims to cut the number of strokes down to be easier to read and write.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It used to be that there was only one form of Chinese. Then the communist government of China decided to simplify the characters so that they were easier for people to read and write.</p>
<p>In Taiwan, which has never been under the communist government, they didn't make that change, so they still use the traditional characters.</p>
<p>That's all.</p>
<p>Edit: I'm talking about written in Chinese, of course. Spoken Chinese is at completely different beast.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The communist Chinese government came up with the simplified characters in the 1950s to help improve literacy, as everybody else has already stated. It is argued that they were also created help stamp out certain artefacts of Chinese cultural heritage, especially Confucianism, that the communist leadership saw as contrary to the vision and intended ideals of communist China.</p>
<p>Chinese characters are composed of 'radicals'. These are basic sets of strokes that convey meaning or sound. For example, 好 (good) is composed of two radicals: 女 and 子. (As an aside, those two radicals are also characters in their own right meaning 'woman' and 'child' respectively)</p>
<p>The main means of simplification was to reduce the number radicals <strong>or</strong> the number strokes in complicated radicals. For instance, 語 (language) is composed of 言, 五, and two instances of 口. This was simplified to 语, where 訁 was reduced to 讠. </p>
<p>It should be noted that Japan also uses some simplified versions of characters, known as 新字体 (<em>shinjitai</em>), such as 学 (study) which was 學, and 楽 instead of 樂 (whereas Simplified Chinese uses 乐). Sometimes the <em>shinjitai</em> and simplified Chinese forms are the same, sometimes they're slightly different, sometimes they're very different, and sometimes one country or the other hasn't simplified a character at all.</p>
<p>The debate about whether or not Confucianism was being subverted for political capital by the communist government is one that I have no qualification to weigh in on other than to say that the debate exists, with different conclusions to be drawn depending on (A) the politics of whomever is making their point, (B) their nationality, and (C) their views of language/orthography reform.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is the same spoken language. Majority of the written word is the same, but for simplified Chinese it is easier to write for about 3000 of the characters. Only Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau learn to write traditional Chinese (I guess the English equivalent would be spelling words differently in British English vs. American English). I learned traditional Chinese, so when I see simplified writted Chinese, it is very obvious, but you can kind of guess what character they are writing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like this. Pretend everyone used to write in cursive. Some people had a hard time reading or writing cursive. Then they put out printed English, stuff is a little bit easier to read and write.</p>
<p>That’s similar of a transition from Traditional to Simplified Chinese</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
