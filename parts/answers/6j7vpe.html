		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not.  Not only do they not have a similar circulatory system to humans, there is good evidence that insects don't experience pain the way we do (some other arthropods may).</p>
<p>Moreover, how would we even know.  Pain is a subjective response, and there is no way they could communicate a headache to us.</p>
<p>Edit: Thanks for all the karma, and the responses.  There are so many responses now that they aren't even losing properly in the app when I click them.  I've been trying to reply to all the responses to my explanation, but if I can't find it when I click on it, I'm not going to hunt for it.  Have a great day everybody.</p>
<p>Edit 2:  Because so many people have asked, or in some cases tried to bring it up a counter point.  Avoiding danger, and reacting to injury is not a sure indication or pain.  It's possibly they have reflexes for damage avoidance that don't actually trigger anything like pain.  Humans have many reflexes that help avoid injury, but we additionally interpret the stimulus as pain, but as a separate part of the process.</p>
<p>The crossed extensor reflex is a great example.  If you step on a sharp object (or an excessively hot object, or something that causes a chemical burn, etc.) your foot sends a signal to your spinal cord.  In the spinal cord several synapses are triggered that connect to separate nerves.  One causes an inhibition of the extensor muscles in the leg that has the injured foot, causing you to stop applying pressure with that foot.  Another send a signal to your other leg, stimulating the extensor muscles, causing you to extend that leg, and catch your weight on the other foot.  Another sends a signal to your brain, which then registers the injury and interprets it as pain.  The interesting part is, the signals looping back to your legs fire at the same time as the signal going up to your brain, so your body is responding to the injury before your brain is even aware of it, and before you perceive the pain.</p>
<p>For all we know, insects may have injury avoidance mechanisms like these, but may not actually experience anything akin to what we call pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most likely no. </p>
<p>Insects, at least some of them, cannot experience what we call pain. For instance, if you very carefully take the tip of the abdomen of a dragonfly that is eating and put it into its mouth, it will start eating its own abdomen. </p>
<p>It really comes to the question what is pain in the first place. Pain is an unpleasant feeling - the most unpleasant one, by definition, - but WHY exactly is it unpleasant? </p>
<p>It needs to be unpleasant for two reasons: first, to allow us to stop whatever causing pain (which roughly translates to damage) in a meaningful way, not just a knee-jerk reaction on a pure reflex; second, to allow us to remember the source of pain and avoid it later.</p>
<p>In other words, pain in the way we feel it is only needed (and possible) if you can learn from it and modify your future behaviour accordingly and/or if you can produce useful reactions beyond simple reflexes. Insects have nervous system just too primitive for either of those tasks. </p>
<p>Edit: added immediate pain avoidance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A very petty additional point: arachnids don't have heads.</p>
<p>Assuming they do sense pain (difficult assumption to prove), any pain from the eyes to the most proximal joints of any limb (analogous to the shoulder/hip) would be in the cephalothorax.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
