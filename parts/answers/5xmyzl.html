		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it's true that the core reason Facebook shares lives and connects people is to make money, I'd like to instead address something I see underlying the question. I interpret your question as wondering why Facebook is making public a conversation that you observe or interpret to be private (or at the very least personal). The answer is that your friends are having a conversation in a public place. Your friends are opting to make this conversation public. It's true that Facebook thinks that this might be of some interest to you, and your friends do too. When we post on Facebook on someone's wall or comment on their posts, we do so in a public forum (not totally unlike Reddit or other forums and aggregates). Keep in mind that Facebook has a private message service where interactions are not shared with other parties.</p>
<p>Once your buddies are willing to share their conversation out loud and in public, Facebook is more than willing to leverage it to engineer your attention. Others have pointed out that the more connections you have on FB the more likely you are to engage with the service. The more you engage, the more ads you see. </p>
<p>edit: Just to add one more thing: to some degree by opting to have this conversation in public they are all but inviting others to join in. Or at the very least to observe. While your particular manners may preclude you from jumping in uninvited, I would say that those manners do not always extend to public forums... or ever to public forums.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Number one goal of Facebook is giving you reasons to look at Facebook for longer durations and in greater frequency. </p>
<p>They either have numbers (or are testing in hopes to get numbers) that suggest showing this stuff increases engagement in some way (time in app, time until next visit) more than not showing it. </p>
<p>Why it increases usage is a separate question. And while interesting, Facebook doesn't necessarily need to know why. They just need to know that it does. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Facebook makes money through targeted advertisements. If they have more information about you, your ad space is worth more. </p>
<p>Facebook tracks how long each post is present on your screen, from which they can roughly estimate how long you look at a post. By showing a friend of a friend's post (or comment) they can establish your closeness to this mutual friend as well as other variables in the post (location, product mentions, etc). </p>
<p>This is slightly more data rich than the average post they show you. They're not just doing this willy-nilly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
