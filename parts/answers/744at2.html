		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The second one.  It's a shorthand for &quot;if something bad had happened, I would have heard about it by now, so things must be ok.&quot;</p>
<p>It's a rule I live by at work.  My boss and I work remotely and our jobs only really overlap when there are problems.  If things are going smoothly, we'll often barely talk for a week or so.  So no news is good news at work - if she's calling, something's usually gone wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Example: I give blood.  Once blood is donated, it gets sent off to testing.  If the blood tests HIV+ or any other anomaly, the blood donation company will call you and tell you the bad news.  If everything is fine, they won't call.</p>
<p>In this case, no news is good news. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every parent with kids in daycare can relate this sentence. If I were at work and got a call from daycare, it is usually like “your kid is sick, please come and pick him up”. It freaks me out when I see daycare calling or left a message. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's kind of like something you say to parents before you go out for the night. &quot;Don't be alarmed if I don't call. Be alarmed if I do call.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you haven't heard from grandma in the last month, you might get worried. Nobody has called to tell you she died yet, so it's safe to assume she's alive. Not having news indicates everything is probably ok. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
