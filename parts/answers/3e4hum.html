		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they don't just number the packages 1,2,3,4.</p>
<p>That tracking number contains a lot of information.    Encoded in that number is the sender's account number,  what type of shipment it is, the specific invoice, the individual package number, and a checksum to make sure it's a valid number. </p>
<p>You can tell all this just from that number, no need to look anything up in any database.</p>
<p>That's what helps make it so long</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>part of the number is encoding information, like the class of postage or the destination post office</li>
<li>having a crazy high number protects against people trying to guess valid numbers...otherwise, I can just enter random numbers until I see a packages being delivered in my area, and steal them off of doorsteps</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parcel auditing consultant here:</p>
<p>I’m paraphrasing as best as I can here from the USPS document. The source is below, but the document is 444 pages long and isn’t exactly a page-turner.</p>
<p>As has been discussed multiple times on this thread, the USPS (like any parcel carrier) doesn’t just number their packages 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. Each segment of the standard 22-digit tracking number means something specific for the post office’s systems to assist in routing and tracking of packages.</p>
<p>If we use an example tracking number of <strong>420 123456789 92 123 912345678 1234567 1</strong>, a breakdown of these specific segments is below:</p>
<p><strong>420</strong>: [internal to USPS; not visible on the tracking number itself]- Routing code application identifier</p>
<p><strong>123456789</strong>: [also internal to USPS; not visible on the tracking number itself]- 9-digit ZIP code</p>
<p><strong>92</strong>: Channel application identifier- used by Online/PC Postage/Meter Mailers</p>
<p><strong>123</strong>: 3-digit service type code (STC) which identifies the mail class, product, and any extra services. There are hundreds of these. For example, STC 349 is “Standard Post: Signature Confirmation.”</p>
<p><strong>912345678</strong>: Mailer ID- Essentially this is the shipper’s account number with USPS.</p>
<p><strong>1234567</strong>: Serial number for the specific package</p>
<p><strong>1</strong>: Specially-calculated USPS ID number</p>
<p>I hope this helps!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One major benefit of adding extra digits is that (if the extra digits are added right) the system can detect single-digit typing errors (with 1 padding digit) and even correct them (with three).</p>
<p>This system of adding check digits is commonly used in other forms of data transfer, and also early in the history of credit cards it provided a way to detect the least skilled fraudsters when they placed telephone orders (although in the age of instantaneous data communication this is no longer relevant).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's 420 followed by the zip code then 9 then 4 digits to identify the mail class, a 9-digit mailer ID and an 8 digit package ID. </p>
<p>So it's actually 30 including the 420+zip but only 22 are displayed under the barcode.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
