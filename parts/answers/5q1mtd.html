		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one random ass question which I can answer. The answer is no. Pimples form because a hair follicle is plugged by dead skin or other debris, and the secretions (which are produced by cells) get stuck underneath. As the secretions accumulate, they irritate surrounding tissues and white blood cells are attracted to the site, carried there by flowing blood. The end result is the red, swollen, painful nodule of a pimple.</p>
<p>After you're dead, your skin cells can probably survive a few hours, if that. During that time, it'll be in self preservation mode mostly since it assumes the blood supply will return soon; it won't be actively producing the usual secretions. Furthermore, even if secretions are present, white blood cells can't get there in significant numbers due to lack of flowing blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have to admit that I was caught off guard by this question; being something that I never thought about before.
My hypothesis is that if any pimples or blackheads do form at all - which I am not convinced is very likely, the process would have to be at the very least slowed due to the fact that the heart stopped pumping blood. This, in turn, means that no new white blood cells are getting transported to the infected area - meaning little if any inflammation, and no nutrients getting transported to either the bacteria or the surrounding cells - which means everything slowly dies.</p>
<p>In short: I don't think so, unless there is some way to pump healthy and living white blood cells into the infected carcass's to be pimply area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body being dead doesn't mean the bacteria in it are necessarily dead. The cells that might keep them in check are probably dead though.</p>
<p>The question really is the bacterial temperature dependence. Can they continue to reproduce at room temperature instead of normal body temperature.</p>
<p>It is well-established that Staph. aureus can grow in food left at room temperature, and produce proteolytic toxins.</p>
<p>I see no reason the same couldn't happen in a dead sebaceous gland.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
