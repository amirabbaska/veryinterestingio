		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gloves are not the end-all-be-all in terms of hygiene.  It is actually more sanitary to wash your hands after touching something that requires it than to just wear a single pair of gloves all the time.</p>
<p>If you watch a real chef, you'll see they are very careful about what they touch.  They're not going to rub their nose/face and not wash their hands.  If they touch something that would contaminate something else (raw chicken for instance) they'll immediately wash their hands before they do anything else.</p>
<p>Gloves block your the transfer from stuff on your hands to things you touch, and vice versa, no more.  If you wear gloves and handle raw meat, or money, or any of the other unhygenic things and never change your gloves you're actually more of a problem.</p>
<p>But for some reason, there seems to be this belief that gloves are a panacea for anything unsanitary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a chef you are very aware of the fact you are handeling food to be eaten by others. In cullinary school it gets imprinted onto your brain (here in Belgium we had tests about HACCP on a regular basis)
Furthermore a kitchen reflects the kind of chef that works there. So a clean kitchen means a chef who knows how to handle their food in a proper fashion.</p>
<p>Do not use this to base a kitchen during peak hours, sometimes it gets kind of messy but never to a point where it becomes too much</p>
<p>Furthermore many chefs myself included get a feel for their food, be it the texture or if your steak is cooked to perfection.</p>
<p>Finally those goddamn gloves get in the way of everything they are uncomfortable, and when dressing a plate its just not as easy to handle your products with these gloves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clean gloves aren't any cleaner than clean hands. The things that get hands dirty also will get gloves dirty. Regularly changing into clean gloves isn't any more sanitary than regularly washing ones hands.</p>
<p>Using gloves is only really helpful if you don't want to contact the things you are handling with your bare skin such as with caustic chemicals, for some reason you can't clean your hands with soap and water (which brings up the question of how your work surfaces are cleaned), and if for some reason a hand has an open wound. In those cases you bandage the wound completely and then put a glove over that. Customers not wanting skin to touch their food is purely psychological, there is no increased danger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I have my food handlers managers license. In my course we actually did a demonstration that showed the amount of germs that you can trap underneath the gloves. Most health inspectors prefer that you do not use gloves as they trap germs, foster a lovely moist warm environment for bacteria to flourish in, and use of gloves actually discourages hand washing.
We wash our hands constantly and mine get dry and they hurt from doing it so much in the winter. But you are better off that way, promise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gloves are only more hygienic than bare hands if they are getting changed frequently.  Too often in busy restaurants this isn't happening enough.  You'll see the deli guy handling the bread with the glove, then the turkey with the glove, then the tomato, then the knife to cut it, then the refrigerator door, then you may even see him handle the money in the cash register or a broom... does he toss off those gloves before he cross contaminates something else behind the counter?  Who knows.  </p>
<p>Is the cook wearing the glove to protect the consumer from the person preparing food, or to protect the cook from the food he's preparing?  Sometimes, it's hard to tell. </p>
<p>It's more sanitary (and economical) to have cooks wash their hands frequently than to have them use gloves for everything, and use them properly.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
