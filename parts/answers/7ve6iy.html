		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Celestial bodies (and our universe in general) are electrical neutral. That's because electrical charge is a conserved quantity, meaning you can't create an negative electrical charge without also creating an positive charge, as the total sum has to stay the same. As we understand it now, this holds true for the entire history of the universe.</p>
<p>Any significant charge imbalance will quickly neutralize itself, by attracting the opposite charge. That's why the earth is electrical neutral even though it's permanently bombarded with charged particles from the solar wind: If it had accumulated a positive charge, it would then draw more negative charges from the solar wind, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Any objects will find enough charges from ions, interstellar particles and so on to neutralize eventually. Therefore, electrical forces do not play any significan role on large scales in our universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no limit on the mass of a star, but you usually can't get a really big charge on an object without the thing tearing itself apart. Once it's all torn apart, it's easier for opposite charges to get at each other, turning the whole thing neutral.</p>
<p>One exception is a magnetar, a neutron star where the gravity is just strong enough to hold the star together despite a large negative charge.  Gravity squishes protons and electrons together into neutrons, but any extra electrons live on the surface of the star and slosh around, making frickin' enormous magnetic fields.  In a magnetar, the magnetic fields themselves are so strong that they have ten thousand times the energy density of lead.  The chemistry of life stops working when you get within 1000km.  The vacuum becomes birefringent.  Atoms are deformed into long cylinders thinner than the quantum-relativistic de Broglie wavelength of an electron.  It's totally crazy.</p>
<p>But even magnetars have to be really close together (in astronomical terms) in order for the electromagetic field to have a noticeable effect:  <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0009239" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0009239</a>  estimates the charge on a magnetar to be around 10^15 Coulombs.  The mass of an average neutron star is around two solar masses.  The electrostatic repulsive force between two magnetars at a lightyear distance is around <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%28%2810%5E15+coulomb%29%5E2+%2F+1+lightyear%5E2%29+*+%289+*+10%5E9+N+m%5E2%2F+coulomb%5E2%29" target="_blank">10^8 Newtons</a>, while the gravitational attraction is around <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=6.674%C3%9710%5E-11+newton+square+meters+per+kilogram+squared+*+%282*10%5E30kg%29%5E2%2F%281+lightyear%5E2%29" target="_blank">10^18 Newtons</a>, around ten billion times greater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
