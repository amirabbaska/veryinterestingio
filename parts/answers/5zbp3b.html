		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Dr. Kraft, </p>
<p>Since we've mapped the genome, there has been discussion for universal mapping and eventually it's implications for health insurance i.e. Patient has P53 mutation and is more prone to a multitude of malignancies and is therefore a more risky subject for insuring. My question is 2 parted. </p>
<p>1) do you feel each person will have their genome mapped as a standard of care soon?
2) do you believe this will have implications for health insurance? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
