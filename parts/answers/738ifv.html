		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The liver itself is made of individual hexagonal units called hepatic lobules made of liver cells (hepatocytes), blood vessels, and connective tissue that all together perform all the functions of the liver. Think of them like honeycomb cells in a bee hive or individual solar cells in a solar panel. </p>
<p>Cutting off a portion of the liver reduces the total number of lobules, reducing the overall function of the liver. The liver cells can replicate to create more lobules in order to regenerate liver function. However, this is not true regeneration as the form of the regenerated liver (shape) is not the same as the original liver.</p>
<p>The other internal organs are not made of individual units or cannot survive having a piece cut out. Organs like the heart are uniquely shaped and designed for its function. Removal of any part would completely ruin its function. Organs that are made of individual units like the lungs (small air sacks surrounded by vessels) or kidneys (filtering units surrounded by vessels and fluid ducts) cannot have a piece cut out since the organs themselves are specially sealed. You cannot breathe properly if there is a hole in your lung and such a hole could result in fluid filling the rest of your lungs. Any removal of lung has to be completely sealed, which prevents that cut region from regenerating. Similarly, because of the large blood flow to the kidneys, injury to the kidneys could easily be fatal. Cutting off a part of the kidney means it is not sealed from leaking the massive amount of blood that flows through it.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liver cells do the dirty work for your body so they have a short lifespan (300-500 days). Think of them as operators in a chemical plant with zero protection. As a result liver stem cells are quite active in replacing the old liver cells even in normal conditions. This allows for quick regeneration after cutting off a portion of the liver.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The liver has a far simpler multicellular structure. It is basically just a mass of liver cells. If it is cut in half it just has to make more of itself. The heart on the other hand has chambers and valves and other structures that would be much harder to regenerate after being damaged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by regeneration. Many organs (the skin and the intestines for example) regularly cycle through their epithelial surfaces, regenerating them on the order of days. But to regenerate an entirely new structure, which I assume is what you mean, is a whole nother animal.</p>
<p>The simplest answer would be that the liver is relatively structurally simple and it's function isn't heavily influenced by structure as long as you get the basics down right. The key things that a liver cell needs are to be able to see the blood (to pick up whatever metabolites need to be processed as well as assess systemic metabolic state) and act accordingly, as well as be able to dump bile acids into the small intestines to aide digestion. As long as a liver cell has a blood supply and connections to a bile duct, it will work. Also note that one of the main jobs of the liver is to handle metabolism of toxic compounds; it stands to reason that the liver has an intrinsic need to be able to regenerate cells lost during this process. To that end, liver cells actively maintain their regenerative potential and are also surrounded by supportive stellate cells that, among other roles, may or may not provide a scaffolding function during regeneration. Even then, the regeneration is not perfect; the shape of the liver isn't maintained and scar tissue is formed as well.</p>
<p>Compare this with losing a limb. Regeneration of a limb would be completely dependent on proper structural formation for function to follow. The bone needs to regrow in just the right size and shape, which means that the bone would also need some way of sensing what size it already is and constantly adjusting it's own growth to match the desired morphology. Same thing with muscles and neurons. Each muscle fiber needs to grow to the correct length, with the correct orientation both to the bone and other muscle fibers surrounding it, and attach to the bone at the correct place at the correct angle. The motor neurons need to send out processes to each muscle fiber, with the correct number of processes on each cell, to adequately control the muscle. Note that this is completely different from what the cells are designed to do in a normal state. Every ability that the cell has comes at a metabolic cost to maintain as well as risk of dysregulation; it simply isn't optimal for those cells to try to hold onto some semblance of regenerative capacity to the detriment of what it was originally designed to do.</p>
<p>Of course, this is par for the course during embryonic/fetal development, but the setting is completely different from adult life. Normal development starts from an extremely regulated start point in an extremely regulated microenvironment. The uterus and blood supply takes over most of the life support functions so each cell can focus solely on proper growth and development during the critical early phases. These progenitor cells are different from the fully functional cells in adults. The whole process is regulated by a very tightly controlled series of chemical gradients that give each cell an idea of where it is and needs to go from there. All of these characteristics are lost by adult life because they no longer serve a significant purpose.</p>
<p>I've read through a few other comments regarding regenerative potential in other species. I'm not an expert on other species, but do bear in mind that most of these species are evolutionarily much more primitive and regeneration isn't as perfect as one might be led to believe. When a starfish regenerates, it's new arm might be double or half the size of the original. A lizard's tail is mostly just cartilage when it regrows and doesn't retain the same functionality as the original.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Regeneration necessitates a complex and adaptive set of cellular sensory and communication abilities as well as growth potential that isn't worth maintaining in adult life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a feeling that ELI5 here should be like this: liver is like a sponge. If you cut out a part of it it's still a sponge, it still does work. And as it's made of cells that can be grown one to each other rather freely still maintaining the overall organ functionality - it can regenerate. Other organs are like a balloons that contain more balloons (in which you'll find another set of balloons and so on). If you cut a balloon, it will lose its shape, functionality and what's contained inside. It will break down and will not regrow by themselves to the same shape (highly specific shape)...</p>
<p>Therefore half of a liver is a functional liver with half of it's capacity and half of a heart is just leaking ;) And heart simply can't be leaking as it's a pump.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
