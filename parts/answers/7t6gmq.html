		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Police are general law-enforcement officers hired by any number of different agencies (city, county, university, hospital, etc). They are hired by any agency with local government authority.</p>
<p>Sheriffs are elected officials usual governing over a specific county in a state, separate in legal authority from the police. They have legal jurisdiction over any areas not already incorporated by a police department (such as areas in a county outside of city limits), and they also run legal processes and usually jails within the county. The sheriff can appoint deputies who generally have similar legal authority to police officers.</p>
<p>Rangers in the legal sense are only found in Texas, and have the highest policing authority in the state. Park Rangers are appointed in federal natural parks and usually have policing authority within their boundaries, but they also act as conservationists and naturalists.</p>
<p>Marshals are deputies of the Federal US Courts and can subpoena or arrest those charged with a federal crime. They don't have the full authority of police or sheriffs but are generally seen as an interstate federal authority similar to police.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Troopers are usually part of a general state police force. These are most often only used in areas of state government jurisdiction, most commonly on state highways.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Jurisdiction, mostly. </p>
<p><strong>City Police</strong>- usually cover city. </p>
<p><strong>Sherrifs</strong> - usually cover a county. </p>
<p><strong>State Police</strong> - handle crimes that span multiple counties within the state</p>
<p><strong>State Troopers</strong> - handle only State highways &amp; State govt security ( a state usually has either State Troopers or State Police, it varies )</p>
<p>It's designed to make sure there is a balance: Enough resources to handle high density area, yet someone is still responsible for the rural sparsely populated areas. They intentionally overlap and can temporarily act in support of each other. They can handle any type of crime that falls sitting their area, with the exception of State Troopers:  They are limited to highway crimes such as transporting of contraband, drink an driving, traffic fatalities, etc but are very good at that and can act as 'State Police' in emergencies. They also have specific expertise in accident reconstruction that is considered 2nd to none even at the federal level. </p>
<p>As for 'ranger', if you mean a Park Ranger, they usually have juristiction just within a National or State Park.</p>
<p>If you mean a 'Texas Ranger like lone Wolf McQuaid, I'm not sure. It's Texas, they everything different there. Gotta love 'em for that. :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Police officer and Deputy are pretty much the same job, at least in Nevada where I live. The only difference is a Police Officer is employed by a city, where as a Deputy is employed by the county.</p>
<p>A Sheriff is the chief law enforcement at the county level, so a Deputy (Or Deputy Sheriff) works for the Sheriff. Sheriff is an elected position, again at least in Nevada.</p>
<p>A Ranger is federal Law enforcement, their jurisdiction is usually limited to federal lands such as National Parks.</p>
<p>Just to add to this you also have State Police that protect the Governor and state buildings, Corrections officers who work in prisons, Highway Patrol and Parole and Probation officers. All of these are law enforcement and all cover different jurisdictions, many of which overlap.</p>
<p>Source: Once, long ago, I held several of these jobs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To clear things up regarding rangers, since I'm actually one. </p>
<p>There are non Law enforcement rangers. There are law enforcement rangers. Your state, city or county park system may have different terms. Most rangers are not game wardens/conservation officers (focused on hunting/fishing violations). </p>
<p>They keep peace in parks, enforce rules, and protect natural/cultural resources. Depending on the agency they may be fully licensed peace officers with arrest powers, or they may be simply regulatory enforcement with varying degrees of power. </p>
<p>Federal Law enforcement park rangers (National Park Service especially) are fully licensed federal law enforcement officers. They can arrest, detain, and search you. They can enforce laws outside of the park if they want as well, but generally are busy enough and/or respectful of government boundaries. Outside the park, they may simply call it into County or City police depending on the severity of the offense. </p>
<p>State park rangers (In Texas we have state park police) vary. Most states do have dedicated fully licensed law enforcement rangers. They are state police like troopers, wardens etc. They do the same thing and have all the same power of other state police and can and will arrest people outside of the parks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the US, jurisdiction, mostly.</p>
<p>It varies a lot state to from state to state, but in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A police officer is the most generic term, but they typically works for a city and has jurisdiction within city limits.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>State patrol has jurisdiction statewide, but typically focuses on highway traffic enforcement.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A sheriff has jurisdiction within a county.  It is typically an elected position and focuses on the parts of the county outside of city limits.  The US Court system is often structured by county, so the sheriff will often be responsible for enforcing court orders, like evictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A deputy is a police officer who works in the sheriff's department.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ranger works on public lands, like parks, forests, and open space.  Their job mostly involves maintenance, conservation and public safety, and typically do not have arrest privileges.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A warden is like a park ranger with arrest privileges.  They are usually involved in enforcing hunting regulations but can act in a police capacity as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A marshall works for the federal courts, and is largely concerned with fugitives.</p>
</li>
<li>An agent is anything else.  They typically work for an investigation branch of the federal or state government, although some have more specific duties, like secret service agents protecting the president.</li>
</ul>
<p>To make thing more confusing, cities and counties can pass laws extending jurisdiction.  Two cities might have an interjurisdictional agreement, or a state might allow an officer from a neighboring state to retain arrest powers in the event of a pursuit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
