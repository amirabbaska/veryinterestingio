		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="https://www.healthpages.org/health-a-z/fever-adults/" target="_blank">https://www.healthpages.org/health-a-z/fever-adults/</a> you have a fever - well you knew that.  I suggest a trip to the doctor just to be safe, do you really want to wait to find out that you have a serious problem? People die after starting out with symptoms like yours.</p>
<p>Ranges in Body Temperatures:
A temperature of 100.4°F (38°C) indicates a fever, called pyrexia in medical terms.</p>
<p>*Temperatures between 37.2°C and 38°C are called low-grade fever.</p>
<p>*Temperatures between 38°C and 41°C are called pyrexia.</p>
<p>*Temperatures between 41°C and 43°C are called hyperpyrexia and are serious.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Infection is the usual cause of fever. When our body is being invaded by foreign bacteria or virus, our body produces an army of cells to combat it, when they are released the alarm also goes off (hypothalamus- in charge of thermoregulation) kind of a reaction, which increases your body temperature. The more army being deployed the louder the alarm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
