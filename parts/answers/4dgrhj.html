		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The captcha is a 3rd part widget made by google that has a lot of logic behind it.  One of the main purposes of it, is that a crawler can't click it.  It has to be actually clicked for it to register, and the developer can see if the user has been authenticated when the submit button is clicked.<br><br>Because it's in an iFrame it makes it more difficult for bots (and web developers) to trigger the clicking of the div that contains the checkbox due to the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy" target="_blank">same-origin policy</a> present in all major browsers.  This stops developers like me from having my submit button trigger the captcha.  My option is to check to see if the captcha has been verified yet, but I can't trigger an automatic captcha.  Which is a good thing, if I can do it, then so could a bot visiting my site.<br><br>Presumably, google could create a captcha that is just a button, and that could trigger a submit on the actual page.  But that would get confusing for the user.  Styling would be an issue. As well as the times when a more traditional captcha is required.<br><br>Look at the following captcha demo page.<br><br><a href="http://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo" target="_blank">Captcha demo</a><br><br>Now, look at it in incognito mode, and verify that you are human.<br><br>You'll notice a different type of interaction that really doesn't lend itself to a button click.  This is also in addition to being accessible to people with visual disabilities.  Which is beyond the scope of a button with a single click action.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

A lot of captchas are third-party widgets that provide the <del>entire</del> captcha* form through their API. <br><br>But still, technically it should be feasible to trigger the captcha form from your submit button with reasonable effort, depending on which API or code is in use.<br><br>Next time I’ll be doing a form with a captcha, I’ll give it a try.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I believe it is because Captcha functionality is generally a stand alone application that can be plugged into any form.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Most of the answers here put the spot light at the iframe. But that's wrong because normal captchas can also be used in iframes.  <br>Google [creator of the no-captcha reCaptcha] realized that today's AI can resolve captcha's image BETTER THAN HUMANS, therefore, making it useless.  <br>They decided that using analytics, AI, ip/cookie checking and behavioral variables would be way more efficient than cryptic image captchas.  <br>Today, if they're not sure if you're a human, they will ask you to select images containing &quot;pancakes&quot; [or something] inside a 4x4 set of images. This is harder for bots than text image captchas.  <br>  <br>edit: realized that's not the question asked. Sorry for this.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Since a single button is obviously recognizable to robots as the form element that must be pressed (otherwise we wouldn't need CAPTCHAs in the first place), I gather that you'd suggest multiple buttons, only one of which is the correct one, that are labeled in ways only humans can recognize the right one.<br><br>The answer is that this simply provides no additional benefit, and is probably less convenient for humans.<br><br>The buttons can't simply be labeled &quot;Submit&quot; and &quot;Cancel&quot; (because the robots can read that too). You can't make them different colors, because that kills your accessibility.<br><br>The only thing you can do is give the buttons longer labels in natural language (similarly to the statement &quot;I am a human&quot;). But then you're just left with the same function as the checkboxes - <em>and</em> you're using a form element for multiple functions (CAPTCHA and form submission) which surprises the user (a bad thing), <em>and</em> the big buttons with a lot of text look odd.<br><br>Edit: I neglected some tricks you might pull with cursor positions, telling users to click the left or right side, or double-clicking, etc. But it's clear that all of these would be impossible to do while keeping your site accessible.<br><br>Edit2: I just realized that your hypothetical form might already have two buttons, one for the CAPTCHA and one for the actual submission. In that scenario, you might be able to do away with the checkbox, but then you're hoping the robot isn't sophisticated enough to just press all the buttons in the form.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>After reading the ideas already posted, my conclusion is that a few factors influence this:<br><br>- Integration: it's often third-party code, and it's easier to integrate a new checkbox than to tie the third-party code into your form's submit button<br><br>- Branding: the third-party code wants a presence on your website <br><br>- Fallback: the checkbox solution can't always be used and sometimes has to fallback to an image or text based captcha. Integrating the code into your form's submit button would make the fallback behaviour more complicated to implement.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>We developper here.<br><br>This is actualy the whole purpose of the captcha. The robots are searching for forms on a page and they want to fill the fields and click send. Adding a captcha is like adding a pre condition that works like another form inside the form element. Like saying this form is not valid until this little piece of javascript has been activated and validated. This is the part that is hard for a robot. To actually get the &quot;inner form&quot; working in order to validate the &quot;parent&quot; one. This allows for the parent form to be designed faster and more basic and the complex and secure logic to be standard everywhere and easily implemented in all the simple but useful forms.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Because not all users are interacting with the page with fully functional eyes/hands and a &quot;normal&quot; web browser.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The word guessing method is preferable. Not because it's more user friendly (it can be a pain in the ass), but because it is used to transcribe real material into digital media. Billions of words are transcribed each day, allowing us to safeguard material that could otherwise be lost.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A lot of forms are not submitted via javascript, and they are just standard forms. Validating the captcha status requires an async call to a backend to determine if it's usable or not. By making it separate buttons, you can trigger this async call ahead of time that you would submit the form so that the response has already been collected and is ready to go by the time you submit, and then it's just a simple case of a hidden input field submitting data as normal -- no form submission logic required.<br><br>It would be possible for the captcha to happen on form submit, but then it would have to capture the real form submit, cancel it, do its own thing in the background, and then trigger a new submit when it's done. And there are just far too many ways that form submit events are used across the web to do this in a consistent reliable way that doesn't break anything else. This is my guess as the #1 reason why.<br><br>The people talking about iframe stuff -- you can use postMessage across domains, and the person who owns the widget on your page also owns the iframe so you can be sure they can do communication. It's more about the form submission than any security issues.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
