		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your assumption is correct.  When you freeze cells willy-nilly, the cells will burst as ice crystals form.  Thus, they will be dead when you try to thaw them.  Methods for preventing this have been developed over the last few decades, including: rate of freezing, thawing procedure, and the inclusion of cryoprotectants.  Cryoprotectants are compounds which have the ability to prevent the formation of large intracellular ice crystals.  The most common one used in the lab is DMSO, but it looks like glycerol is the most popular for freezing clinical specimens.  </p>
<p>Here is an in-depth peer-reviewed article describing the different aspects of sperm crypreservation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Donated sperm has to be stored for six months before it can be used in treatment, in order to screen the donor for infections. Sperm cells have been frozen, thawed and successfully used in treatment for more than 40 years, although not all sperm survive the freezing process.</p>
<p>Frozen sperm must be stored in extremely cold temperatures (-196 F), but in order to ensure that the fewest possible sperm are damaged, the freezing must be gradual.</p>
<p>After a minimum of 48 hours have elapsed from the time of the initial freezing, an initial &quot;test sample&quot; is thawed and tested again to ascertain from each specimen how well the sperm survived the freezing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
