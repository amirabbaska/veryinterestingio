		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is very, <em>very</em> different.</p>
<p>&quot;Eyes&quot; are an organ that can perceive electromagnetic radition of a certain range of energies. The lowest possible energy we can perceive we call &quot;red&quot;, the highest one a very &quot;deep violet&quot;. Everything in between is other colours, and we basically perceive a mix of those.</p>
<p>Assume you could see the other types of radiation that makes up this world, you can start by the fringes of what we can see, that is &quot;infrared&quot; (i.e. you can see heat; &quot;infra&quot;red means nothing but &quot;below red&quot;) or &quot;UV&quot; (meaning nothing but &quot;beyond violet&quot;). But it does not stop there, the world is filled with other kinds of radiation, coming from space, from heat sources (or lack of heat), microwaves, radiowaves from space, gamma rays (&quot;light with so much energy that it shatters your cells&quot;), the whole UV range probably creates a very interesting world (note that some birds and insects can see in UV), the atmosphere is full of more &quot;stuff&quot; that solar winds do &quot;up there&quot;.</p>
<p>On top of that is the non naturual rediation that we create, imagine you could see mobile towers, stuff coming from satellites, radio... </p>
<p>Let me show you with an imagine how little we actually &quot;see&quot; from the electormagnetic spectrum (do not mind it is german, just watch how little our visible colours contribute): </p>

<p>Edit: What makes this even more interesting is the fact that you would not only see &quot;new colours&quot; because you can perceive new wavelengths, but the actual &quot;colours&quot; you would see were actually a <em>combination</em> of all the wavelengths you might now perceive. Forget those infrared-images you know. If there was a certain type of infrared it would look different combined with normal red, normal blue or that-UV-color. Add in different combinations of radio waves (with green, infrared, blue and microwave) and... the mind starts to boggle.</p>
<p>And here comes another real kicker: The colour, for example, we know as &quot;magenta&quot; does <em>not actually exist in the electromagnetic spectrum</em>, we only &quot;see&quot; it if a certain red and blue show up together. With more wavelengths one could perceive with more receptor cells, the more &quot;virtual&quot; colours would show up all around.</p>
<hr />
<p>Edit2: Opening up a whole new world:</p>
<p>[Sorry, this is getting a bit longer, but, well, the question posed is pretty fundamental, probably way more than OP could have assumed] </p>
<p>As was just pointed out to me I even misunderstood the question. I thought the scope was pure visual, but in the truth the world is even more complex than we imagine, even if we open ourselves beyond the electromagnetic spectrum. There are creatures with a whole lot of different senses than us, e.g. creatures that can sense the magnetic field of earth (or magnetic fields in general) and use that for orientation (birds). How awesome is that? And try to extend that to the other fields I have spoken about.</p>
<p>But that is not all. For example, many creatures (snakes, elephants) can sense the ground vibrating, in parts for many kilometers (this creates a lot of stress in wild elephants when poachers are around - if a herd flees in panic, everyone for kilometers around knows something bad is happening).</p>
<p>But there is more: the whole audio-spectrum, imagine soundwaves be hearable from infrasound to very high frequencies, bats use it for orientation to basically get sonar imagines of the sorroundings. </p>
<p>But there is more: Imagine the whole olfactory spectrum. This sounds an easy one, well, you can smell more, right? Yes, true, but it also gives our perception of &quot;time&quot; a whole new meaning. Our senses are made to only perceive things that are a few seconds old (sound) and with light much less. Smells are not only in the present, but stretch far in the past. For us that is only true for pretty strong smells, but assume you can smell subtle ones as well. First, you get a whole new idea about the present. Is that person there afraid? Are they washed? Have they eaten mint/pepper/.. lately? Are they ill? Do they have cancer? Are they horney (ok, non ELI5, sorry ;))? Who were they in touch with lately? </p>
<p>Now you also get a peek into the past: Where have people been? Through what soil were they walking? What have they eaten when they had that coat on the last time? It gets more interesting if you go to places and objects, as you can smell what had happened there, who touched them, what they were in contact with... no wonder dogs are so excited about sniffing around all the time. </p>
<p>But there is more: imagine you could perceive scales much smaller than we can: you'd suddenly find structures where you now think there is nothing, you see that the desk is made up of splinters, you might be able to &quot;perceive&quot; down to the atomic levels. Imagine you have the perspective of your cat in your house, an ant and go through your garden, imagine that of a virus going through the organs of your cat.</p>
<p>But there is more: Let us assume you perceive as you do right now, but at a much faster resolution. Go to youtube and check out &quot;The slow mo guys&quot; to see what a fascinating world you can discover that is hidden from us because it is too fast. Incredible, even with our current senses. </p>
<p>But there is more: Assume you can perceive much slower, you'd basically see how the world goes by in a larger timescale. You'd see weather patterns forming (cloud appear static, but they are not), you'd see rivers change the path and mountains rise and get eroded, oceans rise and flood things and free places (google &quot;doggerland&quot; if you want to read something cool). </p>
<p>But there is more: Imagine you can perceive much <em>bigger</em> than we can: You'd see planets circle suns, suns circle the milky way, galaxies collide, you see perceive bigger structures about space we might not even imagine, maybe you can perceive the whole of creation in its incredible vastness?</p>
<p>But there is more: assume all of the above is combined.</p>
<p>But there is even more: The question asks about the &quot;Physical&quot; world but our physical world is just a result of the quantum mechanical world of atoms and sub-atomic particles. Of magnetic and electrical fields, of nuclear fields, of gravity. In the quantum mechanical world, the real world, there is no &quot;matter&quot; just energy that interacts in ways that form what we perceive as matter, as photons, as smells and as life, as ourselves. Imagine we could somehow perceive the world where E = mcÂ² is true in a very fundamental aspect, meaning matter and energy are the same, when we could perceive the fields that turn out to be protons and neutrons (and the stuff they are made of) and electrons that form atoms and us and the &quot;physical world&quot; that was asked for.</p>
<p>That world we perceive is very, very different from what is actually there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably the biggest difference between the exterior world and our perception of it is that we are constantly seeing (and hearing, for that matter) the past.  Because we don't see the thing itself, but rather the light reflecting off of it and which travels at finite speed, we only see an object in its condition and position from a tiny bit of time in the past.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no way for you to determine what the world looks like NOW, only THEN.  Of course I can confidently predict that the TV 20 feet from me hasn't changed in the tiny fraction of a second that the light takes to travel to me...but I cannot be as confident about, let's say, Tau Ceti.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, 'dark matter' and 'dark energy' (90% of all recognisable matter) is invisible to us and we only interact with it by its gravitational force. We cannot see, touch, hear, smell, or taste 90% of the Universe (that we know of).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ol>
<li>Color</li>
</ol>
<p>Obviously, there are many wavelengths of EM radiation we can't see. Infrared, etcetera. But in fact, even within the visible range, we're missing out on a lot. </p>
<p>There's a big difference between being able to tell something is there, and being able to tell what it is. A person with total colorblindness (black and white vision) would be able to detect all the same wavelengths you can, but not tell them apart.</p>
<p>And in fact, we are little better off. When we see colors, there are many different mixtures of wavelengths that look identical to us. Your computer monitor can make you see the same color as, e.g., 568nm light, even though there is no 568nm light coming out of your monitor. That's because you can't distinguish the right combination of red/green/blue wavelengths from a pure 568nm light. </p>
<p>If we had perfect color vision (able to independently perceive all wavelengths in the visible spectrum), we would be able to detect many of the chemical components of objects by sight (especially by burning them / otherwise exciting atoms in the material). Detecting the specific wavelengths of light that objects give off is how spectroscopy works.</p>
<ol>
<li>Filling in the blanks</li>
</ol>
<p>Our brains fill in a lot of detail we can't actually see. Outside the middle of your retina (the fovea, where most of your &quot;cones&quot; are, which 'sees' approximately the area of your thumb held at arm's length), you have very poor color vision. Your peripheral vision is actually not far from b&amp;w. Your brain fills in the color in the periphery, as well as many other details you can't actually perceive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll explain this like I do to my astronomy students:</p>
<p>It is no coincidence that the human eye sees approximately the same energy of photons that our sun produces.  That is to say, the majority of the Sun's photons that reach the Earth's surface just so happen to have the same average wavelength (around 5500 Ã) that the human eye can see.  This is a product of evolution.  The sun produces this light, so we evolved to see this light.  The ability to see light gives us a huge advantage in terms of survival - to see our environment, potential mates, and predators - and not having it would be an obvious disadvantage.</p>
<p>So let me re-word your question.  Would it be evolutionarily advantageous if what we saw with our eyes <em>didn't</em> reflect everything that is real around us?  If not, then our brain did a hell of a job &quot;rendering&quot; what it thought our eyes were seeing, so well that we can perform the everyday tasks we do today with mathematical precision.  And that's just light we can see.</p>
<p>It is true that there is an entire universe out there that we cannot see with our eyes.  However, we as a species have done a great job at seeing those invisible parts by building things like telescopes that can allow us to see what we can't see with our eyes.  </p>
<p>And then there is dark matter and dark energy, things that we cannot see no matter what, but until we can actually understand what these things are, we cannot make any substantial claims about them. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, yes, the world largely is as it appears, thanks to the help of technology.  But this is only true if what we're seeing is the actual universe, and not some elaborate computer simulation controlled by our powerful overlords, but that's a whole other story...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
