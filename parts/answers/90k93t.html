		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;modern&quot; razors are disposable razors. Before that people used a straight razor. If you make an incredibly sharp razor it will be incredibly brittle, if you make it of something sharp and not brittle it will be incredibly expensive. If it rusts, it'll rust in the bathroom and oxidation dulls a blade far more than use will. </p>
<p>The other option is to have a blade head that you can use a few times and get a new one. If you chip a carbide razor, it's expensive trash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The very nature of razors means they <strong>have</strong> to wear out quickly. Razor edges are <strong>microns</strong> thin, which means they're prone to corrosion and wear very quickly, there's literally no other option; and all razors are about the same. It doesn't matter if it's a $0.99 Bic disposable or a $30 a pack five blade vibrating number. The 5 Bladed one might stay sharp longer (less use on each blade per shave).</p>
<p>You can make your razors last longer by thoroughly washing and drying them after each use (oil on skin and moisture corrodes them faster). </p>
<p>Ultimately, the best option is to grab a well made straight razor and a stropping strap. A single straight razor can last literally a lifetime, and when stropped correctly will retain its sharpness indefinitely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It absolutely matters what kind of material razor blades are made out of. The bulk material can be different, and you can put very hard wear resistant coatings on that material.</p>
<p>For example, The Mach 3 kind have something called diamond like carbon on them (bonded like carbon but amorphous, and easy to deposit.) This used to be advertised. This really helps with reducing corrosion and improving wear. I have found that at least rinsing them and isopropyl alcohol to make sure they are totally dry really helps keep them alive. It absolutely matters what materials these are made out of, and the highest rated comment on here right now is totally wrong.</p>
<p>I stick with Mach 3s because I have found them to be the longest lasting, and it's probably because of that coating. No I do not work for that company :-). But I am a materials scientist and I used to work on DLC and diamond thin films.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diamonds are <em>hard</em>, but they're not <em>sharp</em> in the way razors need to be.</p>
<p>Carbide steel won't last any longer - as others have noted.</p>
<p>However, if you want to escape the expensive razor blade gimmick (which you may not - a Mach 3 is a good razor that will almost never cut you), you can get a traditional double-edged razor. The blades are about 10-15 cents each if bought online in bulk, and you can usually get 10-15 shaves out of each one. More, if you're careful about the blades. Much easier than a straight razor, and much less maintenance. I've used one for six or seven years now for shaving at home. I keep a Mach 3 for travel or when I'm in a hurry.</p>
<p>/r/wicked_edge can help you. There's no real need to spend a fortune (although you can, if you like, and the fancy stuff sure is nice). A basic kit of razor, blades, brush, and shaving soap can be had for under $50 if you're trying to economize, and it will last you for a long, long, long time. Seriously: I bought a sampler pack of 50-100 blades (somewhere in there, can't remember) to try different brands when I started double-edge shaving, and I still haven't used them all. I've used maybe five blades on my Mach 3 in that time for travel or quick shaves.</p>
<p>I did switch from shaving in the morning in the shower (shaving as necessary task) to shaving in the evening at the sink (shaving as pleasant grooming experience).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
