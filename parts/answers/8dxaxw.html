The body doesn’t store enough of the vitamin D precursor to cause an overdose. It also isn’t the final “activation” step for vitamin D.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been a while since I took biochem but I recall that the product of the enzyme for one of the precursors for vitamin D also slows the process of that enzyme. So basically the more you produce the less active the enzyme is until the product gets used up a bit. </p>
<p>There's a lot of these mechanisms in the human body to stop over production of a bunch of things. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because your body is only capable of producing so much vitamen D. </p>
<p>Its like how you can’t boil a pot of water with a match but can with a stove. Both provide heat, but a match only has so much heat it can provide until it is used up (and its not enough).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some vitamins are fat-soluble (Vit A, D, E and K) and some are water-soluble (C and B). Water soluble vitamins can be eliminated in urine, so you can't overdose on them. You can technically overdose on vit A, D, E, K.</p>
<p>The sun &quot;makes&quot; vitamin D because it's rays can modify cholesterol into vitamin D. It's a cool trick but the proportions mean you can't really overdose on it. Most people don't get their recommended vit D dose via the sun but via food. UVs just add a bit.</p>
<p>Aka: The sun helps the organism to make vit D but not in sufficient quantities that you can overdose on it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
