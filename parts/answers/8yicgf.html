		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the ground gets heated by the sun, some of the heat is radiated back upward. However, air below sea level is quite dense and absorbs a lot of this heat, radiating it back to the ground, essentially creating a mini greenhouse effect.</p>
<p>This happens everywhere at the same latitude, however the high valley walls 'trap' the heated air within the valley, as it cannot overcome the atmospheric pressure to 'flow over' so to speak. The valley walls also block any little incoming moisture from the Pacific.</p>
<p>What you have in the end is a trapped 'bowl' of compressed, heated air that cycles and bounces around the valley because it cannot escape the mountains and has nowhere to flow. It's pretty much a giant, natural convection oven.</p>
<p>On top of this, there is very little vegetation or surface features to retain the heat, so most of it is just forced into the air.</p>
<p>P.S. I've never even been to the US but remember being puzzled by the same question years ago. There might be more factors at play which I don't know of, so take what I  said with a grain of salt!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Equator is also often too moist to get that hot, clouds are very effective at getting rid of sunlight and a lot of tropical regions have some clouds every day. &quot;Horse latitudes&quot; and places deep inland don't get clouds too often, so the ground gets the full amount of solar radiation. Also rain cools it down but idk if this is significant on large scales</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
