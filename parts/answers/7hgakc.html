		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What occurs when you pass out from extreme pain is a form of what is known as <em>vasovagal syncope.</em> Syncope means to lose consciousness and vasovagal refers to effects on the vasculature/vessels (vaso-) from the Vagus cranial nerve (-vagal). When you experience sudden and extreme pain, the information is sent to an area in the brainstem called the solitary nucleus, which is an input area for several cranial nerves, with the Vagus nerve being one of them. Of the twelve cranial nerves (which almost exclusively supply the head and neck), the Vagus nerve is special because it travels extensively around the body and innervates a wide variety of organs and blood vessels. It is involved in <em>parasympathetic</em> control of the nervous system, the branch of the autonomic nervous system that is commonly associated with &quot;rest and digest&quot; rather than the sympathetic &quot;fight or flight.&quot; With activation of the parasympathetic Vagus nerve, the heart slows down and beats with less force per pump (<em>rest</em> and digest). This is combined with a decrease in what is known as <em>sympathetic tone.</em> Sympathetic tone helps to keep blood vessels constricted, and when that is withdrawn, blood vessels can dilate. So, a decrease in cardiac output (less blood pumped from the slowed heart rate and contractibility) combined with dilated vessels, significantly reduces blood pressure too quickly and the brain is temporarily less perfused by oxygenated blood, leading to loss of consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Edit below: More ELI5ish</strong> Sorry to anyone confused by the description above.</p>
<p>When you experience extreme pain, your body sends signals to the part of your brain that is the control board for a special nerve that &quot;relaxes&quot; a lot of your organs (slows heart, increases gut movement for digestion, etc). This nerve slows your heart down and causes it to pump less blood per unit time <em>at the same time</em> that nerves that keep your arteries constricted stop doing their job. So, you get less fluid pumping through wider pipes and, unsurprisingly, this can be measured as reduced blood pressure. Less blood is delivered to the brain, and the person loses consciousness. In the absence of any major bleeding, the body will correct the overshoot and the person will regain consciousness eventually.</p>
<p><strong>Edit #2 - TRUE ELI5</strong></p>
<p>Sudden and extreme pain flips a switch in your brain, which makes your blood vessels relax (by expanding) and your heart rate slow down <em>and</em> pump less blood with each beat. This brings less blood (and less oxygen) to your brain and you pass out. Your body fixes it quickly, but after you pass out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as i know this is not 100% explained by science. </p>
<p>But faint from pain could be triggered as a relaxation reaction of one's body. After severe pain the &quot;vagus nerve&quot; influence the vessels. If its influence is strong enough vascular tension, blood pressure as well as puls per minute decrease and one's muscles relax.</p>
<p>In extreme cases one's brain doesn't get enough oxygen, the consequence is a so called &quot;Common faint&quot;. As the designation &quot;Common&quot; implied it is a not really dangerous kind of faint.</p>
<p>The level of pain that triggers this reaction differ from one to another.</p>
<p>Many psychology touched physicians are convinced by this reason.</p>
<p>PS This is what i know from my biology education at school. So hopefully one can explain better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Perhaps the greatest faculty our minds posses is the ability to cope with pain. Classic thinking teaches us of the four doors of the mind, which everyone moves through according to their need.</p>
<p>First is the door of sleep. Sleep offers us a retreat from the world and all it's pain. Sleep marks passing time, giving us distance from the things that have hurt us. When a person is wounded they will often fall unconscious. Similarly, someone who hears traumatic news will often swoon or feint. This is the mind's way of protecting itself from pain by stepping though the first door.</p>
<p>Second is the door of forgetting. Some wounds are too deep to heal, or too deep to heal quickly. In addition, many memories are simply to painful and there is no healing to be done. The saying &quot;time heals all wounds&quot; is false. Time heals most wounds. The rest are hidden behind this door.</p>
<p>Third is the door of madness. There are many times when the mind is delt such a blow it hides itself in insanity. While this may not seem beneficial, it is. There are times when reality is nothing but pain, and to escape that pain the mind must leave reality behind.</p>
<p>Last is the door of death. the final resort. Nothing can hurt us after we are dead, or so we have been told.</p>

<p>I've had a history of what seemed to be vasovagal syncopes, however I think it was mostly regarded as somatic symptoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll add a hypothesis for why the fainting occurs from pain and the sight of blood, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_\(medicine\)#Other_causes" target="_blank">courtesy of Wikipedia:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>One theory in evolutionary psychology is that fainting at the sight of blood might have evolved as a form of playing dead which increased survival from attackers and might have slowed blood loss in a primitive environment. &quot;Blood-injury phobia&quot;, as this is called, is experienced by about 15% of people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syncope_\(medicine\)#Vasovagal" target="_blank">And here:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Vasovagal (situational) syncope is one of the most common types which may occur in response to any of a variety of triggers, such as scary, embarrassing or uneasy situations, during blood drawing, or moments of sudden unusually high stress.</p>
<p>Much of this pathway was discovered in animal experiments by Bezold (Vienna) in the 1860s. In animals, it may represent a defence mechanism when confronted by danger (&quot;playing possum&quot;).</p>
<p>An evolutionary psychology view is that some forms of fainting are non-verbal signals that developed in response to increased inter-group aggression during the paleolithic. A non-combatant who has fainted signals that she or he is not a threat. This would explain the association between fainting and stimuli such as bloodletting and injuries seen in blood-injection-injury type phobias such as trypanophobia as well as the gender differences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Â </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falling-out" target="_blank">Also, a tangential bonus:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Falling-out is a <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture-bound_syndrome" target="_blank">culture-bound syndrome</a></strong> primarily reported in the southern United States and the Caribbean. It is described as a constricted consciousness as a psychological response to anxiety and specific stressors. Sudden collapse characterizes episodes of falling-out, whether without warning or preceded by dizziness and a spinning sensation. The individual suffering from symptoms of falling out can usually hear and understand what is going on around them.</p>
