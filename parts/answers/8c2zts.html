		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I assumed the answer would be down here somewhere and just stopped by to upvote. Unfortunately it isn’t, so here you go in true ELI5 fashion:</p>
<p>A long time ago a man had a gas station and wanted to sell more gas (and soda and chips) than everyone else, but he needed a way to get people to notice his business. Of course, he could’ve taken out advertisements in the newspaper, filmed commercials for TV, and even had someone dance on the street corner with a sign advertising his gas station, but all of those would be expensive. And besides, his competitors had more money and could do even more advertising than he could. </p>
<p>But the man was clever and he knew two things for sure: people love to get a good deal and he had the cheapest gas in town. So the man posted a giant sign in front of his store with his (lowest in town) price. Now when people went to the other gas stations, they felt they were being duped and business started to roll in. Of course, the other gas stations had no choice but to lower their prices, but by this time everyone in town assumed that the man with the giant sign MUST have the best prices since he HAD A HUGE FREAKING SIGN with his gas prices posted outside. So of course all the other gas stations built their own signs as well.</p>
<p>As with many changes, this one had consequences that no one thought of at the time. Because by advertising price above all else, the man with the gas station had accidentally taught his customers that everything else was irrelevant and that clean bathrooms, good food, and better quality gas were simply gimmicks designed to distract them from the lowest price which was (they were sure) the only thing that mattered. And now all gas stations must advertise their prices, for fear of being seen as the “rip-off” option in town, and since most people aren’t sure how much good gasoline might save them in the long run, and they have difficulty putting a price on any of the other features of a gas station, many still choose their gas the way they were taught to all those years ago by that first man with a sign. (/ELI5)</p>
<p>This is a subject taught in any marketing school as a cautionary tale about choosing how you compete in your market. Once you teach your customers that price is the only important decision factor, it’s hard to unteach that. A great example of this is airlines which for years only showed their price and not amenities, seat space, or tv screens when shopping for flights. As a result, customer unfriendly practices took hold and Spirit airlines was born.</p>
<p>So how much does gas shopping actually save you? The people in this thread referencing differences of $1 during the year are only fooling themselves (I can’t buy gas at July prices in January no matter where I go). So excluding truck stops (whose high prices tend to reflect a less price sensitive community who value other amenities provided and who aren’t paying the bill themselves), how much do you actually stand to save?</p>
<p>The average American car gets roughly 25mpg and the average American driver drives roughly 1,125 miles every month. Let’s also assume a relatively liberal difference among quality gas pumps (discount gas is another issue you can read about <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2016/07/08/autos/aaa-cheap-gasoline/index.html" target="_blank">here</a> ) and say you can save 5 cents per gallon. Thats 45 gallons of gas for a grand total of $2.25 in savings for the month. </p>
<p>Having worked in the field of marketing for a decade, I can tell you with confidence that there are VERY few industries that inspire the same kind of constant research and brand switching to get a $27 savings on a purchase which totals over $1,300 yearly on average. But customers have been trained to make this decision on price, and with electric cars becoming more and more common, I suspect the gasoline industry will die altogether before anyone can change the dynamic. </p>
<p>Light at the end of the tunnel: check out Buc-ee’s. I don’t know how widespread they are, but they are all over Texas and they will change what you think about gas stations. </p>
<p>Edit: Spelling
Edit2: Can’t say that I’m surprised my first Reddit Gold contains a Buc-ee’s reference. Thank you kind stranger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's interesting. So this is called elasticity. Every product has an elasticity to pricing. Gas stations have the smallest gap. This is why they are constantly changing their prices to stay within a small margin of the comp set. Each station has the ability to solicit a percent of demand (customers) if they stay within 2 cents of their direct 3 comps (gas stations). Greater than 2 cents they will lose too much demand And although they make more money at higher prices the revenue goes down with less customers. The goal is to find the perfect balance. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In part because people have this weird tendency to not think about their free time as having any significant value.</p>
<p>Which is really fucking weird. It's one thing if you're living hand to mouth, but lots of &quot;normal&quot; people seem to value their free time at cents per hour, and they view those who don't feel the same way as &quot;lazy&quot;.</p>
<p>If the best thing you can think of is driving out of your way to save pennies, go home by the fastest route instead and go for a short walk, maybe stop by a library and pick up a book or two, or something...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm 100% with you OP.</p>
<p>I sometimes specifically go to gas stations that are &quot;pricier&quot; (barely) because they're less crowded.</p>
<p>If I want to save money, I'll buy cheaper groceries or eat out less.</p>
<p>Pricing differences for gas are negligible and not worth my time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve often thought the same, but then I calculated it. </p>
<p>We put $50 fuel in our car per week. We don’t use a lot, so these numbers could be massively scaled for families which do use a lot. </p>
<p>If it’s 1.49/l (our closest station) we get 33.55l. If my wife fills up on her way home from work at the discount place it’s 1.19/l and we get 42.02l. </p>
<p>Over the course of a year (assuming prices remain steady) that’s an extra 440.44l of fuel - or nearly 7 free tanks of fuel. Our car gets approx 9l/100km, so that’s nearly 5000km of free fuel. </p>
<p>If we had to drive 10km out of the way to buy that fuel, then that’s 5200km extra and therefore not worth it. </p>
<p>I’m not sure whether the price discrepancy is this bad in other places, but it is where I live. We go to the discount place because, while it’s out of the way usually, it is part of the wife’s route to and from work, so we don’t need to add distance / spend money to save money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
