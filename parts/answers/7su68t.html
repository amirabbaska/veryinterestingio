		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of space is like that.</p>
<p>If you look at the sky, the majority of the lights you see are from stars within our own galaxy, and most of these are nearby stars less than a few thousand light-years away. Beyond that, you can't see individual stars - you can only see the general wash of faint light that makes up all the numerous stars of the Milky Way, our own galaxy. You can also see three other nearby galaxies - Andromeda, and the two Magellanic Clouds - but these are pretty faint and you need fairly dim lighting conditions to see them. They are also quite close as far as galaxies go - Andromeda is millions of light years away, and the Magellanic Clouds are hundreds of thousands of light years away. These are all galaxies within our &quot;Local Group&quot; of galaxies.</p>
<p>So if you left the Milky Way but stayed within the Local Group, you would lose most of the light (because it comes from nearby stars), but keep a few dim galaxies visible as faint splotches on the sky.</p>
<p>But of course we can do better than that. Groups and clusters of galaxies are small blobs where all the galaxies are concentrated. These blobs are arranged in &quot;filaments&quot;, and there are huge voids between these filaments. The universe is mostly empty space, with clusters and groups of galaxies taking up only a small fraction of it.</p>
<p>So from one of these voids, you would not really see anything. You wouldn't even need to go very far away from a galaxy cluster for the sky to be almost completely dark. If the only galaxies that appear big enough to be visible with the naked eye are millions of light years away, then moving tens of light years away would cause most of those to disappear. We can't even see the Virgo Cluster with the naked eye, and that's only 65 million light years away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your best bet might be going the other way and finding a dark nebula.</p>
<p>A cloud of gas light-years across would be hard to detect around you, especially with the naked eye (they're pretty diffuse) but could block all stellar looks from reaching you if you were in the middle of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One should add though that human vision adapts to darkness rather quickly. In space you would have a clear view on stars that are much dimmer than what could usually be seen on earth. You can see objects that are by a factor of 100 dimmer than Andromeda under good conditions. Large voids in the universe typically have a density that is 1/10th of the average. So galaxies are by a factor of 2.2 further apart, maybe a bit more. Andromeda would then only be dimmer by a factor of 4.8. So I think it is rather unlikely that there is any spot in the current universe where a free floating human could see nothing because everything is too far away. Even in the largest known voids in the universe you should be able to see some galaxies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
