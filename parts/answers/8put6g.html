<p>Here's a <a href="http://bigislandnow.com/2018/06/08/6-am-clear-view-into-puu-oo/" target="_blank">recent news update</a> about the lava flow that is currently entering the ocean. Specifically, look at the following quote from the June 8, 6am update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Strong thermal upwelling was noted in the ocean extending up to 1000 yards out to sea from the visible lava front.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That may not sound like much but it is. It's enough that getting a boat that close is dangerous and trying to swim or scuba dive near the lava can easily kill you. Trying to do science in those conditions isn't easy.</p>
<p>Look at the Wikipedia definition for <a href="https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/kilauea/status.html" target="_blank">laze</a>. Basically, it's the hot lava reacting with the ocean to create deadly acid. Not nice.</p>
<p>There are also things like giant steam explosions and large portions of newly formed lava collapsing and creating tsunamis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Does the water in contact with the lava super heat it, killing off any organisms living close by?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, of course. But it really depends on your definition of &quot;close by&quot;. I live on the other side of the island. Many tourists consider that so &quot;close by&quot; that they've cancelled their vacation plans even though the only real affect we feel is extra vog (overcast skies).</p>
<p>Look up Kapoho. Here's a good <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/06/us/hawaii-volcano-kapoho-bay/index.html" target="_blank">before/after</a> comparison. That was a gorgeous bay filled with all sorts of organisms. Now it is all under lava.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
