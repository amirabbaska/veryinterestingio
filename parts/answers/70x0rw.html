		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They aren't warning other grass.</p>
<p>The chemicals being released do a couple things.</p>
<p>They help heal the grass, help seal the grass so that it's a bit more resistant to dmg (doesn't do shit against a steel blade, but helps against a caterpillar).</p>
<p>And it can help to call certain bugs that feed on the bugs that feed on the grass.</p>
<p>Edit: Some grasses will also release certain chemicals that make their leaves taste awful to bugs. </p>
<p>Some grasses can also concentrate nutrients into their roots to better rebuild.</p>
<p>re-Edit: for information on the talking to other plants bit </p>

<p>The smell may also be a chemical warning to other grass to preemptively taste bad, but its far more likely that other grass is warned via the Wood Wide Web</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the premise of this question may be flawed. The smell is a combination of chlorophyll and other fluids being released from the grass when it is cut. Plants typically communicate with other plants via the superhighway of fungal mycelium which live in a symbiotic relationship around the root zone of the plant. The chemical signals being transmitted inside of a fungal network mimic neurotransmitters in the human brain. The warning process actually takes place through the root zone of the plant, aided by fungal symbiosis. Not through the exterior transfer of pheromonal triggers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People like to think that it's an animal trait to like to stay alive, and protect and defend themselves, and plants are just totally inert. But that isn't true. Unlike animals, plants can't run away and escape danger, but plants are every bit as opposed to being killed and eaten as any animal is. Instead of running, plants engage in physical warfare: spikes and tough exteriors and all kinds of other things, and chemical warfare: releasing a number of different chemicals in response to being attacked by an herbivore. These responses fall into three main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Direct defense. Some chemicals released by plants are intended to directly harm the predator eating it. Many plants, such as clover for example, use cyanide as their poison of choice. Sometimes, to prevent poisoning themselves by accident, they'll even compartmentalize their cyanide into a two-part weapon system, storing a harmless, nontoxic cyanide precursor inside their cell cytoplasms, and storing an enzyme in their cell walls that breaks down that precursor into active, deadly cyanide. Getting munched on by a herbivore breaks the cell wall and mixes these ingredients, poisoning the predator. Plants can also harm their herbivore attackers indirectly too, through things like producing an analog of the mating pheremones of the herbivore's natural predator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Local repair. Some chemicals that plants release when they're damaged, such as jasmonic acid, serve as plant hormones that signal the rest of the plant to brace and prepare for damage. Plants constrict their water channels to avoid losing water through their damaged parts, produce saps and sticky coagulants to block off the damage, produce antibacterials and antifungals to protect against infection, increase cell replication to heal faster, and start producing bitter, foul-tasting molecules that discourage herbivores from continuing to eat them, as well as enzymes that block digestion, making itself less nutritious.</p>
</li>
<li>Remote signaling. Many of the same chemicals that direct plants to start repairing themselves, such as jasmonic acid, are also highly volatile, and signal neighboring plants to start bracing for impact and preparing themselves as well. In response to distress signals given off by nearby plants that are being eaten, plants will produce bitterants and digestion-blockers, making themselves unpalpatable to their herbivore predators. In fact, this is the reason that giraffes have to be nomadic creatures: you never see a giraffe herd strip a tree completely bare, because after munching on a tree for some time, the tree becomes bitter and inedible, and depending on wind conditions, other trees for miles around become so too. So the herd has to keep moving, trying to stay ahead of the chemical cloud of anguished screaming their leaf-munching inspires, in order to keep finding new trees which are still delicious and haven't yet hardened themselves.</li>
</ol>
<p>Of course, plants can't tell the difference between an animal's teeth and a lawnmower's blade, so against us, all their chemical screams, poisons, and distress calls don't do them much good, and make a pleasant summertime perfume for us instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plants can't move, but they <em>can</em> react. We animals are <em>so obsessed</em> about moving, but that's not the only kind of defence.</p>
<p>Some defensive plant chemicals cost the plant a lot of energy to build, so building/prepping them constantly isn't an efficient plan. It's like constantly outfitting yourself with new suits of body armour long after the war has ended - costly and unnecessary, at a time when energy needs to be spent elsewhere. Better to wait and live normally, and suit-up after the warning alarm is raised. </p>
<p>These grass signal chemicals are just that - a warning alarm, telling the plants nearby to get toxic/distasteful. Some other  volatile chemicals act as deterrents to insects, like a bad smell. Still others have been known to attract the predators/parasites of plant-eating insects. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/12/secret-language-of-plants/amp" target="_blank">This article</a> discusses a number of these scenarios.</p>
<p>When you're stuck in one spot and can't move quickly, it seems you have 3 options: become gross, smell gross, or call in the enemies of your predators. Maybe even all three at once ;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
