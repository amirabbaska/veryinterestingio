		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The science advisor for interstellar was Kip Thorne, who just shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for his modelling of the gravitational waveform emitted by two merging black holes. He had the movie studio run a relativistic ray tracing code to generate the images of the black hole (given a small accretion disk in place around it). The simulation was the most detailed of its type ever made, and resulted in the publication of 2 academic papers. It did not include magneto-hydrodynamic modelling of the material in the disc, and left out some effects such as doppler boosting, doppler shifting, and gravitational redshifting, but the Einstein ring around the black hole is entirely a result of the light travel paths around the black hole in accordance with GR. </p>
<p>So yes!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interstellar is probably the most accurate model of a black hole we have made thus far (as someone else also mentioned). And yes a black hole would appear spherical, black holes are made when matter is compacted into such a small volume that not even light can escape the gravitational pull near it, and the black sphere you would see is the area that light can't escape from.</p>
<p>But black holes are super interesting. Inside of a black hole is a weird place, spacetime is so twisted that no matter which &quot;direction&quot; you move you are moving in towards the center of it. Another fun fact is that you can never see something cross the event horizon (the black area that looks like the &quot;surface&quot; of it) since the light leaving something would come to a standstill (and be red shifted out of the visible spectrum) and never reach you. But unless you get close to/inside a black hole you wouldn't experience much unusual, at the end of the day it's just a really a really dense object. If our moon was suddenly replaced by a black hole of the same mass not much would change other than our night sky being darker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wonder if the question was meant to be about wormholes, as in the movie they mentioned why it's a sphere.</p>
<p>It would be another interesting question anyways; I've always wondered if going through one would really be like a rollercoaster ride as in Interstellar, Contact, etc, or would extremely distant objects simply be(come) closer and we would just travel between them without noticing the wormhole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matter attraction via gravity clumps material. Little material, little form control resulting in some irregular shapes. The more mass, the more spherical the object as the stronger and stronger gravity attempts to cram maximum matter into a single spot. It doesn't take much, as even the asteroid Ceres attempts to gather spherically. There is only so much room for the molecules to gather so they collect in a ball/spherical shape as they grow and absorb matter (accretion). Some planets and stars may have bulges that make them lightly asymmetrical, but it's not likely in a blackhole. One thing that could distort a black holes appearance is if has relativistic ion jets. But A black hole is a sphere in the sense that everything that goes within its Schwarzschild radius (the distance from the center of the black hole to the event horizon) cannot escape its gravity. Thus, there is a dark sphere </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
