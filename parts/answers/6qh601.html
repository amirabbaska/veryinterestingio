		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key word is 'similar'</p>
<p>a car is NOT a Faraday cage, especially given the newer construction methods being used on modern automobiles.</p>
<p>The large openings for the windows are the primary difference between the chassis of a car and a real Faraday cage. In order for a signal to be blocked, the size of the opening has to be on the order of 1% of the wavelength of the signal to be blocked. for broadcast  FM radio in the US ,88-108 Mhz, the wavelength is between 3.4 meters and 2.7 meters respectively, leaving a maximum opening size of approximately 2.5 cm. higher frequency signals having shorter wavelengths, the maximum opening size decreases as frequency increases.</p>
<p>Because a car doesn't have a homogeneous surface, either interior or exterior, it will is some cases act as an attenuator, and it other cases as a concentrator for both internally and externally generated signals.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cage is a function of wavelength.  Car might protect against a mostly-DC lightning strike (I still do not want to try it) but light can definitely get in through the windows.  </p>
<p>Generally, the higher the frequency, the smaller the wavelength, and the smaller the holes needed to screen out the signal.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is described &quot;similarly&quot; in how the lightning will conduct through the metal to the ground, rather than arcing throughout the cabin filling it in like a mini lightning death chamber. Surely some arcing can occur, but more likely around the corners and such than through the middle.</p>
<p>It is not enclosed enough to stop EM waves from passing through, so, yeah, the windows are enough. It may also not be correctly grounded to stop the EM waves, but is sufficiently capacitive to conduct electricity.</p>
<p>Also, thunder is sound, which passes through the car just fine...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
