		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are already bacteria which can eat some plastics. A nylon eating bacteria was discovered in 1975 and is one of the best examples of evolution in action
Edit: It actually digests one of the byproducts of nylon manufacture</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon-eating_bacteria" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon-eating_bacteria</a></p>
<p>And there is good evidence of polyethylene digestion by bacteria too.</p>
<p><a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es504038a" target="_blank">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es504038a</a></p>
<p>So it's quite probable that more microbes will evolve plastic digesting abilities for a wider range of plastics. Possibly some of these already exist at the bottom of landfills.</p>
<p>Personally I don't doubt that we could direct the evolution of microbes to digest further plastics. The difficulty comes identifying which plastic will be amenable to enzymatic digestion and which microbes already have enzymes which with a little evolution will be able to accomplish such a task.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possible, but don't hold your breath, this isn't the Andromeda Strain. We had an entire geological era, spanning about 100 million years, whose defining characteristic was the evolution of wood and the lack of any organism capable of breaking it down.</p>
<p>Trees quickly covered the world, but didn't decompose after they'd died, leading to the rich coal veins we enjoy today. Wildfires blazed across continents, and global oxygen levels were nearly twice what they are now. This was why such enormous life forms were able to evolve, most of which would asphyxiate in today's atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK, I had chemistry decades ago, so take this as a suggestion rather than a citation... </p>
<p>There are different types of plastics. There are &quot;addition polymers&quot;, which include teflon and polyethylene. These are really difficult to eat. There are &quot;condensation polymers&quot; like nylon and polyester that are more similar to proteins and maybe starch.</p>
<p>There is nothing magic about the chemical bonds in plastic except basic thermodynamics. Polymerization is exothermic. That means you need to add energy to break it up. You even need to add energy to starch in order to break that down. But when you break down starch, you end up with lots of yummy delicious sugar, so it makes sense to eat it if you want to get energy and your tummy is specialized for doing just that.</p>
<p>If you were to add energy to polyester and break that down, you would end up with a lot of strange alcohols. acrylates, and acids. Some of these are edible to some bacteria, and they'd snack on it if nothing better was around. Other things might find them slightly poisonous.</p>
<p>Now take polyethylene, which is the vanilla condensation polymer. Nothing there except a chain of carbon. It's one step away from being carbon black. There's really no energy here that would make it worth eating. Try burning it if you don't believe me. It burns eventually, very slowly. But if fire doesn't want it, neither does your tummy-- or even a tiny bacteria tummy. The energy was lost when the alcohol underwent chain polymerization. It got quite hot during the process.</p>
<p>So if you were to pump a lot of energy into polyethylene, you might be able to recover something worth eating that would make the entire process energy-gaining, but not by much.</p>
<p>In the meantime, how do you attack it? The surface is very hydrophobic. So bacteria can't really snuggle up, and their ectozymes can't really get into the surface. &quot;Degradable plastic&quot; is a trick where a bit of starch is mixed in to create pores in the surface, iirc, so that nature can get in close and start to do it's thing. But there needs to be a long, long process of mechanically degrading the material before it becomes bite-size for a bacteria.</p>
<p>One thing that does get in nicely, I've heard, is UV radiation. Plastic left out in the tropics will begin to break down due to the sun pouring energy in. At some point the sand will cleave off micro bits of it and those will get digested by bacteria-- or at least taken in and dissolved into a case of bacteria indigestion. So all that plastic floating in the South Pacific might not be out there for a million years... it might break down in mere centuries.</p>
<p>Edit: It has been pointed out in other replies that a polyethylene dissolving bacteria was discovered in the gut of a worm. This doesn't really conflict with what I wrote above. The PE in question was a thin film, and they are looking at very small bits of it getting broken down-- a few micrometers of a pore forming over 60 days. It's not clear if this is being done as a food source, or if bacteria would have some other reason to break it down (perhaps it could resemble something in nature-- like a waxy leaf coating-- that the bacteria needs to dissolve in order to eat. So it makes sense to spend a bit of energy.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every few years there is a story about yet another bacteria that can eat plastic.</p>
<p>The earliest report I know of is from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nylon-eating_bacteria" target="_blank">1975 with the discovery of a bacteria that eats nylon</a>.  There is the <a href="http://www.mnn.com/green-tech/research-innovations/blogs/boy-discovers-microbe-that-eats-plastic" target="_blank">2009 story</a> about the kid that supposedly isolated plastic eating bacteria from garbage, and the <a href="http://aem.asm.org/content/38/3/551.full.pdf" target="_blank">1979 paper</a> about biodegradation of polystyrene, the <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es060408h" target="_blank">2006 paper</a> about a fungus that does the same thing, and there is a lot of speculation about similar processes happening in the ocean.</p>
<p>It looks like plastic eating organisms are actually pretty common.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
