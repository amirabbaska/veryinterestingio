		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a caterpillar forms a chrysalis to metamorphose, despite common misconception, a suite of enzymes doesn't literally digest the body down to a rich fluid to reform anew from scratch. Only some of their organs do that; the rest remain largely intact and simply undergo radical remodelling via cells undergoing programmed death to be replaced by other rapidly dividing cells. A chrysalis is not quite just a bag of protein goop.</p>
<p>With this in mind, how does a caterpillar survive? Let's break it down:</p>
<p><strong>Oxygen:</strong> A developing chrysalis clearly needs some sort of gas exchange taking place to keep breathin'. All insects breathe through teeny pores that line their bodies called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiracle" target="_blank">spiracles</a>, which lead into long tendril-like tubes that penetrate deep into the body, carrying oxygen. Thankfully, during metamorphosis, this respiratory system remains intact (even through a bit of renovation), allowing the developing butterfly to continue breathing throughout.</p>
<p><strong>Nutrients:</strong> Unable to forage for food, a stationary chrysalis is at risk of running out of energy - after all, it uses a considerable sum to forge a new body. However, before enclosing itself in a hard outer shell, the caterpillar spends almost all waking moments gorging itself, storing up an enormous amount of energy as body fat. During metamorphosis, it's this stored fat that's broken down into the requisite resources needed to survive; a chrysalis can lose over half its weight during the entire process, as this fat is broken down.</p>
<p><strong>Waste:</strong> As with the spiracles that provide oxygen and remove carbon dioxide, a series of malpighian tubules remove excretory waste - albeit in this case not outside the chrysalis. They're likewise retained through much of metamorphosis and release concentrated nitrogenous waste into an isolated subsection along where the caterpillars intestines once hung about. When the butterfly emerges, it releases all of this, well, poop and bits of old caterpillar carcass as a red fluid out the abdomen, known as meconium. Finally released of this debris of its past experience, it can stretch its wings and fly away.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Now I'm just thinking about the practicality of more complex creatures using metamorphosis, ala mogwai-to-gremlin.  </p>
<p>In those movies, after they got wet they went into a chrysalis state before emerging in their final stage as intelligent bipedal reptiles.  </p>
<p>Is there any way this could ever happen in nature? The process seems biologically tied to simpler life forms. Furthermore, is there a direct relation to the offspring quantity/quality (i.e. insects vs mammals) preference and metamorphosis?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is just one of many things that is awe inspiring about nature. I wonder if humans will ever fully understand these processes and be able to create such a complex metamorphosis of life. </p>
<p>I'd love to understand more about the process of evolution that could create life this way. Is this metamorphism unique to butterflies and moths?</p>
<p>I read some more and Mosquitos metamorphose. Here's a detailed description of what happens in a cocoon &gt;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also how do they know how to fly from birth? Birds seem to take a while to learn to fly rather than fall.  </p>
<p>Is it just that flying for a butterfly is simply a case of moving their wings, whereas for a bird itâ€™s a bit more complex?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
