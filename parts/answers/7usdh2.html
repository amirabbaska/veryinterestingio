<p>My first thought was that they couldnâ€™t survive place but some can. The article says that NASA has process to clean rovers to not contaminate other celestial bodies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On an episode of dear hank and john (a podcast with a mars news segment) hank talks about how they discovered possible ice on the surface but won't drive the rover there in order to not contaminate the area. That way, if they find life there later, they can be sure that it was there before. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and there are multiple categories of sterilization under the Committee on Space Research (COSPAR). Almost every step of a spacecraft's life, from construction to assembly and launch, is done in isolation so as to avoid contaminants. For potentially life-housing space bodies, crafts must be held to Category III or above. In particular, rovers searching for evidence of life can have no more than 300,000 spores in total. Some requirements are as low as 300 or 30.</p>
<p>However, no sterilization method is completely effective, as spores can find their way into even the smallest openings. If a rover discovers some proof of life on Mars, NASA has to thoroughly analyze the findings to make sure it's not something that might have tagged along, false positives and the like. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, yes. NASA has pretty strict planetary protection measures in place.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States is a signatory to an international treaty that stipulates that exploration must be conducted in a manner that avoids of the transportation of living organisms to celestial bodies. One reason to avoid that is simple: we wouldn't want to go to Mars and &quot;discover&quot; life - only to figure out later that we brought it with us! Scientists also want to study the planet and any life that might be there in its original &quot;pristine state.&quot; ...</p>
<p>Components tolerant of high temperature, such as the parachute and thermal blanketing, are heated to 230 Fahrenheit (110 degrees Celsius) or hotter to eradicate any microbes. The core box of the rover, containing the main computer and other key electronics, is sealed and vented through high-efficiency filters to keep any microbes inside. Some smaller electronics compartments are also be isolated in this manner.</p>
