		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello! Here is as ELI5 as I can make it:</p>
<p>Imagine the spinal cord as a thin wire that branches into smaller wires at body side of things. The tip of each branched portion is responsible for delivering messages corresponding to different kinds of stimuli (touch/pain/temperature etc.). Because the spinal cord is thin (keep in mind this is simplified), different signals compete to travel up the spinal cord and be &quot;felt.&quot;</p>
<p>To address your question directly, muscle soreness is helped by rubbing because rubbing introduces a new kind of stimuli. Before rubbing, dull pain stimulus from your muscle soreness was moving up the spinal cord uncontested. After rubbing, the dull pain is competing with your new touch input. Thus you &quot;drown out&quot; the pain signal with touch signal.</p>
<p>Rubbing a cut doesn't work the same way because your input is activating both the touch and the pain receptors in that area. In such regions, pain receptors are often hyperactive, which causes them to outcompete other input.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>
<p>(Some of the more astute neuroscientists will realize that I left out Lateral Inhibition, but I'll let you Google that on your own)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A muscle's natural state is to be relaxed. Contraction causes movement. A &quot;sore&quot; muscle is in a contracted state even when it shouldn't be. Massaging it causes the muscle fibers to relax (heat will do the same thing) which can relieve the soreness. </p>
<p>An acute injury usually involves injury to nerves. Any pressure on these injured nerves will stimulate the nerve which causes pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Muscles soreness (often called DOMS) occurs when muscles perform eccentric or lengthening contractions such as in your biceps when you lift weights or in your hamstrings when running. These contractions cause microscopic tears which trigger an immune reaction by the body to try and heal itself. This reaction - inflammation - lowers the pain threshold of the nerves so that they are more sensitive to pain. The reason the body responds this way (aka causes pain) is so that we are aware of the injury and more careful when using it. Essentially, sore muscles are caused by micro tears in a muscle and the body responds with inflammation which leads to pain. </p>
<p>Massaging sore muscles helps to relieve muscle pain for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Massaging helps reduce the production of inflammatory cytokines (proteins that cause inflammation).</li>
<li>Massaging has been shown to increase the production of mitochondria in a cell, which aid in tissue recovery. </li>
<li>Massaging sore muscles also provides some of the same benefits as stretching: namely increasing flexibility and relaxing the contracted muscle. </li>
</ul>
<p>When you have an acute injury such as a cut or burn, your nerves react in a similar way as they do in sore muscles, by becoming inflamed and more sensitive to pain. However, touching an acute injury can be incredibly painful compared to the pain of massaging a sore muscle. The reason for this is twofold. First and most importantly, the nerves in a cut or burn are exposed to the elements. When you touch a cut or burn you are directly touching these nerves, whereas when you massage a sore muscle the nerves are far beneath the surface of your skin. Secondly, there are generally more pain receptor nerve ending on the surface of your skin because that is where the body interacts with the environment. This is especially true for areas like your fingertips or face. </p>
<p>TLDR: Massaging sore muscles helps to reduce inflammation and therefore reduce pain and increases the production of microconidia which aid in tissue recovery. When you touch an open wound you are <em>directly</em> touching nerves that are already inflamed and overly sensitive due to injury. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All injuries require bloodflow in order to heal.  Massaging a muscle will bring more blood there, thereby increasing healing (heatpacks work too for this reason).  If you overly touch a cut or something similar, then you will be causing more damage through reopening wound, tearing skin further, or causing infection.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have to point out that pain relief comes a while after the actual massage. The act of massaging a sore muscle can be quite painful, much like manipulating a bruised or injured body part. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
