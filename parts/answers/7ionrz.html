		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans originated in warm locations, and when it was cold, that was usually night when they were in their shelters anyway.</p>
<p>Evidence supports the hypothesis that humans didn't move to icy-cold locations until <em>after</em> the invention of clothes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the most widely-accepted theory, for most of the existence of our species we didn't live in areas that were cold.</p>
<p>Homo sapiens evolved in central eastern Africa about 500,000 years ago, and remained only in Africa until about 150,000 years ago.</p>
<p>There's also no particular reason to believe that early humans were unclothed. By definition all members of homo sapiens in the last half a million years have had the same capacity for intelligent thought and reasoning that we do, so it's entirely within possibility that when humans did start to migrate to colder parts of the planet they used animal skins and furs to keep themselves warm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What people are saying about when humans left is true, modern humans started wear clothes about 170,000 years ago well before leaving Africa. However, other hominids were living outside of Africa and tools to take hide from animals show up about 780,000 years ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
