		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most natural dust particles are caught in the nose hairs and cilia that mucus that lines your nose and trachea. Most living creatures have evolved ways to filter that from reaching the lungs in first place, and that that does, gets filtered out by the body.</p>
<p>Dust particles 2.5 - 10 microns wide, often made from industrial activity can get into the lungs, and might not always get removed. Typical examples are crushed gravel dust that gets stirred into the air from roads, construction and farming. </p>
<p>Less that 2.5 microns is often soot from industrial, vehicles, and wildfires. This stuff can cause all kinds of respiratory problems, heart attacks and cancer. Some of the new materials, such as carbon nanotubes are extremely small, and like asbestos fibers, deeply enter the lungs. It's currently not fully known what the long term effects are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes dust will get into your respiratory tract all the time.  Luckily, in the lining of your trachea (the tube that links from your throat to your lungs) the cells there produce a lot of mucus.  The cells also have a bunch of little motorized hairs called <strong>cilia</strong> that push that layer of mucus upwards.  Much of the dust that gets into your respiratory tract gets stuck on the mucus, and the cells' cilia will push that mucus upward, and upon swallowing that dust-clogged mucus goes into your tummy where it's digested.  This is called the <strong>mucociliary escalator.</strong></p>
<p>Some of the dust will get deeper into your lungs past the mucociliary escalator, but there are white blood cells deep down in there that will gobble up and destroy much of that foreign material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have extremely sensitive nerve endings surrounding the entrance to the trachea which trigger you to cough if they feel foreign matter. For items that get through you have cilia, cells with tiny hairs that can move to transport dust that gets caught in mucus, yet another way the lungs clean themselves.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, all the time actually. As long as the lungs can expel the irritants it's not a problem. When you get sick and cough up nasty stuff it's kind of the debris left over from the battlefield. Your body attacks and kills the invaders which may be bacteria, fungus, or virus, and all the damaged junk gets expelled through coughing or re-absorbed.</p>
<p>When you get an irritant in your lungs it causes the body to respond by producing more mucus which helps collect and pull the junk out where it can be coughed up. </p>
<p>There are substances which can get into your lungs though and the body cannot expel them, and instead they can stick around for years and decades damaging the lungs and resulting in scar tissue and lung damage. Asbestos is a really good example of that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
