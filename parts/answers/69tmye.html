		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Deep down enough, the pressure of the hydrogen becomes great enough that it turns <a href="https://phys.org/news/2017-01-metallic-hydrogen-theory-reality.html" target="_blank">metallic</a>, which is a sort of degenerate matterâ€”meaning there is no clear separation between individual hydrogen atoms and molecules, and all the electrons in the atoms have been compressed into the nuclei such that the entire system is just free nuclei and electrons.</p>
<p>It is also suspected that rocky cores roughly the <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063399000434" target="_blank">size of Earth, but much more massive than it</a> reside at the centre of Jupiter and Saturn, with the one in Saturn probably a little smaller. </p>
<p>However, there is no clear &quot;surface&quot; like what we are used to seeing on telluric/icy planets. The outer atmosphere consists of methane, ammonia, water ice and various other light gaseous clouds. Then about 100 km down from the cloud tops, it's mostly hydrogen. This hydrogen simply gets increasingly denser, until it becomes liquid several thousand kilometres down from the cloud tops. About a third to halfway to the centre of the planets, the pressure approaches 10^(11) to 10^12 Pa,  where the hydrogen becomes liquid metallic hydrogen. See <a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/galleries/gas-giant-interiors" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>The metallic hydrogen behaves like a liquid metal. Because of the immense rotational velocities of Jupiter and Saturn, as well as their internal heat, this liquid metal behaves like a dynamo and generates very strong magnetic fields. </p>
<p>Furthermore, metallic hydrogen may have some intriguing properties, like being a room temperature superconductor (refer to the first link on metallic hydrogen).     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it's 100% known yet. But here's my take on the current understanding:</p>
<p>Think of it more like transitioning from a gas to a solid, over a gradient rather than there being a surface. There is a rocky core, but it's surrounded by hydrogen. So much hydrogen that the densities are so great that as one goes deeper, it becomes liquid, then solid.</p>
<p>So there is a rocky core, with a surface, of sorts. But that's meaningless because to reach it you'd have to penetrate increasingly dense, then solid, layers of hydrogen. And there isn't necessarily a sharp line where the hydrogen transition from one state to another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not in a tradtional sense, but there's probably some solid stuff down there. All the pressure from the atmosphere pushes down on the denser gasses lower down compact them into liquids and solids sorta like pressing loose snow into a mold and having it keep a shape.</p>
<p>I'd also imagine that there's just a whole bunch of asteroid-meat sitting in the center of Jupiter and probably the other gas giants</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
