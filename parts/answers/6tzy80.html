<p><strong><em>Production</em></strong></p>
<p>Basically, there are two main ways to make graphene: one is to start with graphite and try to separate the layers to individual layers; the other (CVD) is to stick individual carbon atoms onto a metal catalyst/substrate, so that all the carbons bond to each other to make graphene.</p>
<p><strong>CVD</strong></p>
<p>Now, with CVD, we can make insanely high-quality and purity graphene. But, CVD is very limited in scale. Basically imagine you are trying to make the world biggest pizza. You're limited by your oven, the wooden board to put it in and take it out of the oven, etc. CVD works best in batch-type processes, and unless the reaction works in air (which with graphene, it does not) you cannot have a continuous &quot;conveyer belt&quot; CVD process.</p>
<p>CVD is great for small-scale graphene, but difficult to scale to any industrial applications; maybe with specific high-end transistors or optoelectronic components, but more specialty stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Starting from Graphite</strong></p>
<p>Now, when you start from graphite... That's how graphene was first produced, in 2003 (published in 2004). They used scotch tape, and had some poor guy sitting there peeling scotch graphite with scotch tape for hours and hours, and found that a very small percentage of the particles on the tape were peeled into single layers (ie., graphene).</p>
<p>Since then, improved &quot;top-down&quot; methods have been developed, generally with two routes. One is to put graphite into DMF/NMP or ionic liquids, some of the very small number of solvents in which graphene remains stable-ish, and then to either use sonic vibrations (sonication) or other methods to shake or spread the layers apart. Here, you have a delicate balance. More energy input = more sheets separated, but also more damage to the sheets. Typical yields are under 1%, so to get 1 gram of graphene, you're usually looking at about 1 kg of graphite. Graphite isn't expensive, but the main challenge is the scale of reaction becomes difficult, and isolating single layer graphene from the many, many few-layer (typically defined as 2-10 or 2-50 layers, depending who you ask) is very, very difficult.</p>
<p>The other top-down approach is to oxidize graphite, commonly with a mix of acids and oxidizing catalysts (Hummers' Method), to get graphite oxide. This can then be sonicated to single layer sheets of graphene oxide, with up to 30% yields. However, it uses very harsh chemicals, in huge reaction volumes (dozens of liters to get grams) and the product has tons of oxygen defects, which drastically reduce the electrical and optical properties, and even mechanical properties. You can then use reducing agents to remove many of these defects, in ideal cases improving purity from about 50-70% initially up to 96%. However, doing this takes time, and yield after reduction is not very high, and it still is not nearly as good for electronics as CVD.</p>
<p><strong><em>Applications</em></strong></p>
<p>So basically, graphene falls into three categories.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>High quality in limited scale (CVD and even the first class of Top Down): really interesting for fundamental science, people can do and learn amazing things with it. Already has applications in research, but niche stuff that wouldn't support a whole industry. Could, potentially, be a big thing for some optoelectronic devices with further development, and either cost reduction or improved scaling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decent quality, in good yields (reduced graphene oxide): With the higher yield, it has a lot more fields where it's interesting. Mechanical properties are still very good, so structural composites are already a thing (similar to chopped fiber composites, almost). Optical and electronic, you already lose a lot of the amazingness that graphene can offer, even with the very small impurities in this stuff. Also, these materials are much less geometrically uniform, making subsequent manufacture into electronic components more challenging. There's also a lot of interest in these materials for biomedical and biotechnical applications, but still tons of questions. Some studies claim that graphene can be toxic, some say it's not. Looking deeper, we see that the details matter - some types of cells can handle some types of graphene, others can't, and anything you change, changes the outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>Shitty quality, very high yield (sticking with graphene oxide): basically useless for electronics, some optical stuff is still possible, but not the exotic stuff. Also interesting for bio stuff, but with the same problems as above. One nice thing, GOxide is pretty stable in water, which graphene is not, without modification - which can be important for bio applications, since water shows up a lot in biological systems!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong><em>What to Expect</em></strong></p>
<p>Graphene can do a lot of wonderful things, that part of the story is true - it is a wonder material. The challenges are also there, though. First, you have to come up with a way to use these properties for beneficial applications. Then, you have to be able to produce the product/device cheaply enough, and fast enough, for the application - electronics generally need higher quality and can tolerate lower (but still high) throughput, while bio looks like quality is less important (research into how purity and other factors affect graphene in the body is very complex and ongoing) but really needs very high throughput - just think about the number of grams you need to put into one patient's allotment of pills (gram-scale) vs. the amount of precious heavy metals in your cell phone's semiconductors (barely measurable).</p>
<p>The biggest thing is, in some of these fields, there are other materials that are maybe not as impressive, but much easier to produce and use. To put it simply, if you can get 70% of the performance, and it's still 20% better than the current options, or you can invest time and money trying to wait it out for graphene to get that 95% performance... What would you do?</p>
<p>TL;DR - Graphene is in many simultaneous races (each application/industry is separate, after all) to become feasible faster than the market decides to just go with one of those &quot;almost as good&quot; options. This could kill graphene for those fields, if companies already shift manufacturing and processing to use these alternative materials, potentially driving up the cost to adopt graphene materials in the future, making feasibility an even bigger problem.</p>
<p>EDIT: I hope it goes without saying, anything you are still curious about, or would like explained more, or ELI5'ed, just ask. It's always challenging to judge or predict how deep of an answer people are looking for, so I hope I struck an acceptable balance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Perhaps there is a way to trick bacteria or single layer lifeforms or plants (spores?) to make graphene for us?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
