		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pop up ads have somewhat died down over the past 10 years or so. This is because most people now understand exactly what a pop up ad is and why they didn’t actually win 1,000,000 or whatever.</p>
<p>You will notice now that the most recent try of ad is the ‘FBI Virus’ or similar. This ad claims your computer is broken or you did some bad thing and must call this number and pay lots of $$$$ or you will be arrested etc.</p>
<p>There is also the ‘browser hijack’ style where some ad seems to appear as an error message, something to the effect of “you need adobe flash player to view this” and then you click on it to supposedly download adobe flash. You’re actually not. Your downloading a very stingy piece of software called a PUP, or Potentially Unwanted Program. These will change your homepage, search engine, even cause more pop ups.</p>
<p>But basically, to answer your question, these ads preyed on the lack of knowledge the general public has towards computers and cyber security. Because we now pretty much all know what a pop up ad is, we close it, but back when they first started they were just as successful as today’s fake Microsoft support technicians from India. The reason they are still around is some people still don’t get it, and the people running these ads like to cling to their old ways haha.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once was producing a marketing company conference for a huge marketing company out of the UK. There was a woman pushing pop-up ads who gave a talk about the &quot;Value of Pop-up Ads&quot; (This was about 15 years ago when Pop-ups were relatively new). </p>
<p>The talk spiraled into a rather spirited Q and A session where about 90% of the marketers in the audience told stories of how their clients saw the use of pop-ups as denigrating to their brand. They said that respectable companies didn't want their brand associated with them as they were seen to be intrusive and annoying. </p>
<p>The upshot of the comments was that the companies gave them the thumbs down, despite reading about the favorable ROI in using them.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, let me first say all the answers that have already been posted are interesting and insightful, and what I’m  writing is not to override them. That said, I have a slightly different perspective on these than most.</p>
<p>In political psychology (the field in which I am a graduate student), there have been quite a few studies of the influence of ads like this, and the consensus is that they work. I’m not tapped in to the world of research in commercial advertising, so I don’t know if it would directly transfer but, to my mind, a candidate is just another product.</p>
<p>What we know is that, no, people don’t really read these ads. They even see them as annoyances a large portion of the time. But through the use of carefully selected imagery, colors, sounds, etc. it is fairly easy to manipulate emotional reactions and, perhaps more importantly, core affect towards a candidate (and presumably a product). </p>
<p>Let’s tie this to a tangible example to illustrate it. If I have a candidate, John Smith, and I want Senator Smith’s vote total to go up, I would begin by researching what causes people to have more good feelings (positive affect) toward a candidate. One strong variable in that regard is familiarity. That is, as people become more accustomed to seeing Sen. Smith’s name and face, the more familiar her seems and the more name recognition he will have, which translates to higher vote totals. So in this case, I don’t care if the “customer” is clicking the article that’s popping up, or reading the text that says “get out and vote for a great American blah blah blah”… I simply care that they are seeing John’s name and face over and over so they recognize it in the voting booth. At least theoretically, this should play out on the shelves of the supermarket as well. </p>
<p>Emotional manipulation is quite successful and fairly common as well. I don’t need you to click on an article saying how Trump did scary things A through Z. I simply need to create an ad that uses a deep red color, bold and sharp text font and features a picture of Trump with a menacing face. This will result in increased levels of anger. The same can be done to induce anxiety or enthusiasm. It’s not hard to imagine a pop-up advertisement that is aimed simply at having the viewer see the brand name for a laundry detergent, for example, with tranquil images of a field of flowers and a cloudy day. They don’t care if you click through. You will still associate “Downy” with “peaceful, happy”. </p>
<p>Now, of course, the effect size of these methods is fairly small, but with the relatively low cost of online marketing for any sizable company, they can afford to cast a rather wide net. Even if these emotional and affective appeals only substantially work on one percent of people, if you’re advertising to 100 million people, you’ve won yourself a million customers. Now imagine what an effect that could have on a vote total. That’s why so many political advertisements have migrated to the web. </p>
<p>TL;DR- I could be drawing connections that just aren’t there, but it seems to me that the same psychological mechanisms at work in online political ads could feasibly play a similar role for pop-up commercial advertising online. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;vast majority&quot; of the time they're immediately closed, true, but the &quot;vast&quot; majority&quot; of ALL ads on the internet are ignored, one way or another.</p>
<p>There's an entire industry built up around trying to increase the click-through-rate (CTR) of ads from 1% to 1.5%. If an ad has 100,000 impressions, that's the difference between 1000 clicks and 1500 clicks. Ways to do this are by conducting multivariate tests on the content of the ad (images or text) and picking a winner as soon as it's statistically significant, or experimenting with placement (banner ads across the top, towers on the margins, interstitial ads, etc).</p>
<p>As far as placement goes, no ads have higher CTRs than pop ups.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
