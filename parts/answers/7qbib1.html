Inside the mask, there are thin rubber sheets which act as one way valves. One the rubber starts to break down, it allows contaminates to be breathed in via the exhaust. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>CBRN (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) filters will not remove radiation per se - you cannot force the radioactive material to decay - but what they <em>do</em> prevent is those radioactive particulates - also referred to as fallout - from entering the lungs.</p>
<p>Filters expire if not used in one of two ways:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The chemicals inside expire. Most, if not all, chemicals will eventually break down and thus become unusuable. The charcoal inside a gas mask filter will absorb moisture from the air in certain circumstances. The small amounts of chromium in gas mask filters can also break down, but I am not entirely sure how.</p>
</li>
<li>The filter lets air in. This is most common on cheek style filters found in the US M17 and Czech M10 mask. Because the entire filter is exposed to the air, and all of the cotton material on the filter is &quot;active&quot; in that it removes contaminants, it is constantly reacting with contaminants in the air. The filter can only filter a finite amount of particulates, vapors, etc.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gas masks for radioactive particles are just like any other gas masks.  They filter out particulate matter in the air from getting to your lungs.  Radioactive and not.  It will not stop gamma rays from getting to your face or body.  All it will do is keep out the alpha and betas from getting inside you where they can do the most damage.  Remember,  alpha is basically stopped by your outer layer of skin, and betas are stopped by your clothing.  It's when they manage to get inside tou, through ingestion, inhalation,  or some other means, that they can do serious damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
