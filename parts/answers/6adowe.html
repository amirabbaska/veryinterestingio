		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't possible with passive optics. You can see this by appealing to entropy. Unpolarized light is an example of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_state#Mixed_states" target="_blank">mixed state</a>, while polarized light, whether linear or circular, is a pure state. The entropy of a pure state is always lower than the entropy for a mixed state. </p>
<p>So to go from unpolarized light (a mixed state) to polarized light (a pure state) at the same intensity, you would need to decrease entropy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's a good question! I don't know myself whether a practical setup exists, but at least in principle, it should be possible.</p>
<p>One theoretical way to do it is to use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarizer" target="_blank">polarizing beam splitter</a> which is (more or less) lossless, like the Nicol prism, and then use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faraday_effect#Faraday_rotation_of_semiconductors" target="_blank">Faraday effect</a> to rotate the polarization of the other before finally combining them again. But this seems rather impractical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This happens more frequently than you realize. When the sun is low and reflecting off of the water  or car windows, that is usually polarized.  This is why polarized sunglasses are sold to people who spend their time on a boat. They filter out the glare from the water without losing viability.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can use a polarising beam splitter to divide the horizontal and vertical components,  then you can pass the horizontal components through an optically active medium (polar molecules or atoms in a magnetic field) to rotate then 90 degree to vertical. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
