		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For reference, at the peak of the last ice age, the world was about 4Â° Celsius colder than it is now. That created a mile high ice sheet that reached down though Ohio and Pennsylvania. It's predicted we will warm the atmosphere by that same amount in the next hundred years. So, basically, we'd have another ice age. Anything from the middle us and up would be ice, Florida would be a temperate region, and serve as refugia for temperate plant species - if their dispersal could keep pace with falling temps. Otherwise they'd go extinct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a while climate models of earth could not get out of &quot;snowball earth&quot; when all the water froze because even when factors start to warm the earth more the snow is too reflective.  This is not really the case since we are not in the iceage any more, but it does show that there is more room for a positive feedback cycle in getting colder, since there is more water to freeze than ice to melt.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The average temperature during the most recent ice age in our planet's history was only about twelve degrees cooler than the average temperature today. As a short example, global warming and ocean acidification have caused a small increase in ocean temperature, only about a degree. This causes the dinoflagellates that live in the pores of coral to be expelled into the warmer water in a process known as coral bleaching. This relatively small temperature change has already wreaked havoc on the great barrier reef, the largest living structure in the world, home to a staggering percentage of the Earth's oceanic biodiversity. If the world were cooling at the current rate that it is heating, the cold would kill the coral just as quickly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

This post is asking for speculation and subjective opinion on a very broad topic that is not well-studied.
