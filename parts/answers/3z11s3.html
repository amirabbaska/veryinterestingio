		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The one child policy <em>wasn't</em> in effect until around the Reform and Open Door policy, with Deng Xiaoping.</p>
<p>In China, the reason for the huge population boom during the Mao years- even overcoming the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution- is typically given in the context of the Korean War.  Famously (or maybe not, depending on what you know of history), the Chinese engaged in a lot of human wave attacks against UN forces in North Korea, to the point that sometimes the soldiers didn't even have guns.  They had like shovels and hoes and sticks and shit.</p>
<p>UN forces still shot a lot of them, because...I mean, if someone is running at you with a shovel, are you just gonna let them hack you to death?  But fairly quickly, a large number of UN troops didn't have a stomach for doing that.  And there were still a lot of Chinese would <em>did</em> have weapons, so it wasn't a complete barrel shoot.</p>
<p>Anyway, as I think we all know, the Chinese <em>did</em> end up helping the North Koreans push back UN forces from the Yalu River back to the 38th parallel.  Mao famously told everyone, in a stirring speech, that guns and shit are great and all, but all China really needed to overcome its shackles were <strong><em>people</em></strong>.  This went right along with the Communist narrative that was basically at its height (the CCP had only just recently defeated the KMT and pushed them to Taiwan) you know &quot;Power to the people!&quot; and all that.</p>
<p>So Chinese people were highly incentivized to expand their population.  Like 30 years later, Deng saw that this was really, really bad.  And then 40 years after that, the CCP has decided to relax the standards a bit, because the one child thing came really close to reaching its goal, but now there's challenges associated with that, too, so, ya know, you gotta adapt to the times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes when we analyze statistics, we forget to place them into the context of people's everyday lives.</p>
<p>For a very long time, health outcomes have been very poor in much of the world, with a high child mortality rate. When a parent is likely to lose one or more children, then they develop a culture where they have many children, sometimes five or more, just to be sure that they don't run out.</p>
<p>In 1960, China's government began to focus on health care. Infant mortality dropped, life expectancy increased, and for the first time in China's history, nearly all of the children grew up. These children themselves had large families, but <em>their</em> children did not.</p>
<p>While it is true that legislation played a role in that, it only helped to expedite this process. We see the exact same forces play out in every country as medicine becomes widely available - a brief population boom followed by a transition to small family sizes. This is because when you grow up without infant mortality, you begin to see all of the advantages of small families over large ones, instead of viewing small families and imagining the loss of brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>If you'd like to know more, look into Hans Rosling, a statistician from the Gapminder Foundation. They produce a fantastic digital archive of statistical data, and use it to cultivate educational videos.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There been a few answers to this question here, but I have not seen comments addressing this part of the issue with demographic momentum.</p>
<p>When a country undergoes so called demographic shift, what happens is that a country with a high birth rate/fertility and high death rate/ low life expectancy loses the high death rate, mainly from improved healthcare innovation, while the change in high birth/fertility rate takes time to catch up.  In this case, life expectancy went from 35 in 1948 to 66 in 1976 (literally more than a year in life expectancy per year), and infant mortality went down from 227/1000 live births in 1949 to 53/1000 live births in 1981.</p>
<p>China is in a unique situation in this case, in having a policy forced upon them.  Before the policy was implemented (and in fact why it was implemented), the death rate was going down significantly while the birthrate was not, leading to a rapidly expanding population.  When the policy was enacted in 1980 (as other commenters have pointed out), the fertility rate in China was very high at the time.  So despite people now only having either no children, one child (or more with a few exceptions, but that is not important), the large young population were not dying and were actually entering reproductive age and having their one kid, increasing the population further.</p>
<p>I hope this makes sense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>hello well lest bypass some of the comments about medicine..<br />
thats common in everywhere where antibiotics were introduced in that time (1960s)
the question t hand was about the one child policy  and HUGE chinese population growth...</p>
<p>china is a mostly insanely poor rural 3rd world country with limited or no real government presence outside the big cities like many poorer countries.
china is on a bigger scale.. so the government has little positive effect in everyday life of average person outside  the coastal cities.
people breed to survive and large infant mortality and many kids is still normal..
the one child policy was focused at &quot;hostile ethnic minorities&quot; and the urban middle class, government employees ect ect. some government employees had pensions and so didnt need to make kids to pay for them in their older years... so the government reasoned they dont need kids..
the ethnic minorities it was just a method of elimination....
some ethnic minorities were in targeted for serilization in their native lands and then if they moved to majority chinese areas were allowed to have as many kids as they wanted... another tactic of population control, Tibetans in coastal cities is a good example...</p>
<p>the ethno nationalist sudo-state cooperatist government (prc) desired to keep the more developed urban areas less over populated.. </p>
<p>due to internal passports this has created many &quot;illegal students&quot; in chinese schools and lots of other crazy bullshit..
china has a rapidly growing population as census statistics show.. but the chinese government reports falsely their own statistics that dont match the rapid growth.. just s they give out false ages for their population to show they are much older than they are. hahah so funny.. average life expectance in china is probably actually in the late 60s for men but many dead people live on for decades, vietnam and thailand are other good examples...
for example to that malaysia life expectance.. (a much healthier population with proper nutrition state supplied medical services and a wage 10x higher) is 74.8 years which is probably relativly accurate.. while china claims  75.2 which is laughable... just as is vietnams and thailands warped statistics.. Philippines gives a more accurate life expectancy of 68 years(the reason being i suspect  pensions and pension fraud on the public side.. and on the state side just fake statistics.. quite normal in these countries)</p>
<p>a friend of mine who worked in statistics in thailand said if all the people were really alive who getting the 10 $ or so of &quot;thai pension&quot; every month actually thailand would have 2 or 3 million more people... many of these ghosts vote until they are 100..</p>
<p>in china its far far more brazen and ridiculous...</p>
<p>so any statistics on population growth and family size we can say are only guesses, the only thing we can see is huge rural and urban overpopulation in china.. and that does tell us they are still having lots of little kiddies...........</p>
