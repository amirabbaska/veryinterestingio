		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so apparently I am the first medicinal chemist to discover this post! I have some things that I could shed some light on that nobody else has seemed to cover!</p>
<p>So, yes, amphetamine, the main ingredient in adderall, is extremely similar to methamphetamine. In fact, meth is simply amphetamine with an added methyl group at the N-position. The addition of this methyl group has two consequences that make methamphetamine  a more powerful drug than amphetamine.</p>
<ol>
<li>The methyl group makes the molecule overall more lipophillic (fat-soluable). As such, fat soluble compounds diffuse across the blood brain barrier much more quickly and in higher concentrations. This in tern elicits a more powerful rush and euphoric high, because that drug rushes into the brain much quicker. This effect is enhanced by quicker routes of administration such as smoking or injecting that already send a large amount of the drug directly to the blood stream.</li>
<li>The methyl group has effects on metabolism. Methamphetamine is active on it's own, but as soon as it enters the body, the methyl group is slowly being cleaved, as the molecule is metabolized into amphetamine. This increases the duration of the drugs effects by a large percentage, because not only does methamphetamine have to go through it's elimination halflife before it is cleared from the body, but the methamphetamine that is metabolized into amphetamine, is active on it's own, and must go through it's own halflife just as if someone were to have taken the amphetamine alone.</li>
</ol>
<p>So yea, Meth is innately a stronger and more euphoric/addictive drug than amphetamine because of these medicinal chemistry properties, but I would argue that this isn't what makes street meth so much more dangerous than prescription meth, the other answers reflect this a lot better. The purity of the drug is a huge danger as you don't know exact ingredients like you would pharm grade drugs. The lack of accurately measured dosages is a big danger, especially since even 10mg of meth may be cut with 5mg or more of inactive or different ingredients with unknown effects. Also, people redose and redose for days on end because you can buy tons of meth in powder form, this is when amphetamine psychosis kicks in and people start doing stereotypical meth head shit. Amphetamine psychosis can happen to people on ADD meds too, I saw it happen to my GF in college as she picked bugs out of her face even when she knew they were not there.</p>
<p>And yea the worst thing about street meth/amphetamines vs ADD meds is route of administration. Just as I said the pharmacological differences of meth are enhanced by more direct method of administration such as smoking or injecting, these are the methods that most often are associated with the most danger. There isn't really a way to achieve the same type of rush from prepared ADHD medications, as one does from smoking or injecting straight crystalline forms of the drug. Now in the UK, speed is popular, which is a clandestine amphetamine preparation, and I am sure you see all of the same shit you see from meth in the US, despite the fact that amphetamine is the same chemical in adderall. Preparation and method of administration and dosage measurement are the main differences between street and Adhd stimulants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The only difference between Dexosyn and street meth is purity and formulation (although to be fair, formulation is pretty important for determining the effects of a drug, and as u/CanaryBean pointed out the route of administration is also important).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the good stuff has been covered, but what hasn't been covered is that both amphetamine and methamphetamine are analogues of a chemical that is already in your body called phenethylamine.</p>
<p>This is used by your body to regulate dopamine and a number of other neurotransmitters, and all that amphetamine and methamphetamine do are to replicate the action of this normal body chemical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor here. I don't see this mentioned in any of the top responses, so I'll give a try at explaining.</p>
<p>Sometimes the drugs used to treat ADHD are methanfetamine. Sometimes they are similar drugs of the same class. They basically act in a similar way: they are stimulants that increase the availability of cathecolamines in the synapse.</p>
<p>But a lot of what causes addiction in drugs is the speed at which they act. Faster acting drugs tend to cause more addiction. The rush is higher, and the crash afterwards is more intense, too. This makes you want to go back and take another. This is one of the reasons why heroin causes more addiction than methadone, even though both act basically on the same opiate receptors.</p>
<p>ADHD medications are usually taken orally, which has a slower absorption and lower peak of effect than if they were smoked, inhaled or injected, so they tend to cause less addiction, too. Some of the drugs used most effectively to treat ADHD have a longer half life, either because they are absorbed slower, or because they need to be metabolized in our bodies to produce the most active form of the drug. This speed affects the way they act.</p>
<p>Additionally, the context and circumstances matter a lot. Getting a drug from a doctor, you know that you have oversight and you can't just go buy more. It's a controlled situation. It's very different from buying it recreationally where only you decide when to get more. Also, having low levels of life satisfaction can also increase your chances of becoming addicted. If you are diagnosed with ADHD by a doctor, generally that means you have either a family that cares enough to take you to the doctor, or a job that allows you to afford it, both of which make it less likely that you'll become addicted.</p>
<p>Edit: there's a great explanation <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/94rk1a/comment/e3o78k6?st=JKHNPWHH&amp;sh=594a72cf" target="_blank">here</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
