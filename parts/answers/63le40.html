		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OK.  Lets look at 2 people. </p>
<p>Person 1 makes $1,000,000 per year.  They spend 25% of their income on the necessities of life, like housing and food.  They spend some on car payments and other luxury items.  They spend $1,000 per month on food.  They save around 33% of their income for retirement.</p>
<p>Next is a person who only makes $20,000 per year.  They don't save anything, don't have a car and don't spend on luxury items. They spend $500 per month on food, 50% of their income on rent and the remainder of things like a cell phone and bus passes.  They have very little money leftover at the end of each month. </p>
<p>Now, each person gets a 10% raise. What happens.</p>
<p>Well, person 1 does not really change much.  They might make a special purchase, but chances are they'll just increase their savings a little.  This additional income does not provide person 1 with very much real world benefit in their day to day life (aka utility).</p>
<p>Person 2 on the other hand. They might be able to get a better apartment.  They might be able to get a cheap car or pay a back bill that has been eating them via interest payments.  Person 2 spends all their income on necessities of life, so additional income provides them with tremendous real-world benefit.</p>
<p>This same effect can be seen with even larger sums of money.  Say each of those 2 people got a windfall equal to 1 years salary.  If that happened to me, I could repay my credit cards and car payment and still have enough left over to have a downpayment on a home.  I'm living paycheque to paycheque and such a windfall would really change my life.  Someone who's already earning lots might just dump the whole amount into savings, or buy a better car or nicer house.  Not really life changing events, but still beneficial things. </p>
<p>So the less money you have, the more the next bit of money means to you.  Poorer people tend to spend more of their money on critically important things.  Wealthy people tend to spend more on those important things, but not as a percentage of their overall income. So additional income means &quot;less&quot; to a wealthy person than it does a poor person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first $500 toward housing is more useful/important because it determines whether you have a home or not; while the second $500 determines whether it's 1 bedroom or 2 and what neighborhood it's in; while the next $500 determines a second bathroom and whether the kitchen is from 70's or 2000's; at $5000 rent it's about ocean views or private tennis courts... at each level, the next set of dollars are less and less important to the basic role of housing and more about qualitative enhancements. So we tax less the dollars that determine whether somebody has something important to living or not, and tax more dollars that would otherwise go toward enhancing that thing, because it easier to settle for 4 bedrooms instead of 5 than to afford an apartment or not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, the more money you have, the less important any given dollar is. </p>
<ul>
<li>Person 1 has $5 dollars to pay for lunch. He pretty much have to spend all $5 and is left with 0% remaining. </li>
<li>Person 2 has $10. She could spend it all on lunch, but wouldn't <em>need</em> to; she can still get the same $5 lunch as before. She might splurge and get an $8 meal, but she'll have 20% of my money left over. </li>
<li>Person 3 has $50 and can afford to get anything he wants. However, even if he went nuts and spent 5 times as much ($25) on  lunch, he'd still have 50% of his money left over. He'd have 10x as much money as Person 1, but doesn't need to spend it all for lunch like the first person did. In fact, he could buy lunch for all three of them and still have money left over.</li>
</ul>
<p>The reason that this comes up in tax policy is that it is easier to collect taxes from the last two people than from the first one, because those people have money that isn't <em>needed</em> for something. </p>
<ul>
<li>Taxing the first person $1 means that that person would have $1 for food; he'd go hungry. Taking any more in tax means that they'd be extra hungry.</li>
<li>Taxing the second person $1 means that her extra money is reduced by 50%. Taking any more would eliminate their savings or force them to get a cheaper lunch.</li>
<li>Taxing the third person $1 would reduce their savings by 4%. They'd have to take a lot more before he couldn't pay for his chosen meal. </li>
</ul>
<p>As such, it can be seen as more fair (or at least more effective) to tax those people who don't &quot;need&quot; the money than try to take it form those who do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In eli5 terms: i have 1 pizza, and you have 10 pizzas. Then we both receive 1 free pizza. That 1 freebie is &quot;worth&quot; more to me because i doubled my pizza total (1 &gt; 2) while you only gained a 10% increase (10&gt;11). </p>
<p>Also, maybe i want to eat more than one pizza. Now i can! But you had 10 pizzas. You aren't gonna eat the extra one, you'll probably save it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
