But a spinning star has poles and an equator, just like the Earth does. This star is ejecting mass at the poles. You see something similar from the matter falling into some <a href="https://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=49599" target="_blank">massive black holes</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many different shapes that planetary nebula can take, and  correspondingly many different ways to explain those shapes. </p>
<p>In <a href="http://imgur.com/a/gz5gz" target="_blank">this</a> image figures a1 to a4 are a schematic representation of the main classes of explanations that have been proposed.  (The following is adapted from <a href="http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.astro.40.060401.093849" target="_blank">here</a>)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set of six schematic diagrams showing possible formation mechanisms. Schematic a.1 GISW model in which an symmetric fast wind from the star expands into a previously ejected slow wind the lies like a torus around the star. The fast wind is then escapes more easily out of the plane of the torus.</p>
<p>Schematic a.2 represents the Magnetized Wind Blown Bubble in which a weakly magnetized fast wind expands into an aspherical density distribution and toroidal magnetic fields (dashed horizontal lines) constrain the outflow and produce jets (arrows) along the axis. </p>
<p>Schematic a.3 represents models with a rapidly rotating central object (a disk and/or a star) that launches a collimated wind. Misalignment of disk and star rotation axis produces multipolar lobes. </p>
<p>Schematic a.4 represents outflows driven by episodic jets where precession of the episodic jet can create the lobes.</p>
<p>Schematic b.1 and b.2 represent processes that can create the toriodal slow wind. In b.1 the source of the slow wind is a common envelope evolution for short period binaries.</p>
<p>Schematic b.2 represents accretion disk formation via Bondi accretion and Roche lobe effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just from looking at the picture I'd guess at the second, where magnetism along with a dense cloud around the equator of the star helps create outgoing jets. It seems like in this case and these jets later hit an even older spherical cloud and are now breaking trough that. It is worth keeping in mind that the central object creating all this is no larger than the other stars in the image, and so the clouds we see are truly huge structures in the sky, about 1.5 light years across. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
