		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I thought this video was interesting, this guy tested and measured his blood sugar levels after trying various sugar substitutes with his coffee.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2HnkDGuBqk" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2HnkDGuBqk</a></p>
<p>Test Results from the video notes:</p>
<p>Coffee Only: 15 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>Coffee + Heavy Cream: 19 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>Swerve (erythritol): 16 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>Splenda: 11 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>Truvia: 8 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>NuNaturals Monk Fruit: 24 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>Sugar: 41 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>Equal: 13 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>Sweet' n Low: 10 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>Sukrin Fiber Syrup Gold: 89 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>EZ-Sweetz Liquid Sucralose: 5 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>Sukrin Gold (granulated): 4 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>Sweet Leaf Stevia (liquid drops): 5 mg/dL increase</p>
<p>It would be nice to see other samples and if the results were similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Non nutritive sweeteners affect insulin levels. There are three basic ways your body responds to food. Cognitive is the quickest and kicks into action even before you taste anything sweet. Just as stimuli associated with food can cause your body to react by salivating etc, even the mere anticipation of consuming something sweet, or the sweet taste on your tongue, is enough to induce hormonal changes. This is called cephalic phase insulin response.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalic_phase" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalic_phase</a></p>
<p>The second quickest way your body responds is mechanical. From the sensation of a full stomach, to chewing, your body is again already reacting by altering levels of leptin, ghrelin, insulin.</p>
<p>Finally, the slowest mechanism is actually your blood sugar levels. Your blood sugar levels are kept stable by your body reacting before your blood sugar levels change, however, your actual blood sugar levels are of course regulated directly. </p>
<p>You can do all sorts of neat things by tricking people, if you give someone a self refilling soup bowl they'll eat like a gallon of soup. This is an example of cognitive mechanisms overriding mechanical mechanisms.</p>
<p>NNS definitely can essentially fake out your system by causing your body to prepare for a blood sugar spike that never comes, essentially crashing your blood sugar levels, and then direct mechanisms have to scramble to cope.</p>
<p>Here is one of many articles that can be located on google scholar via keywords non nutritive sweetener, insulin, hormones. Many, many, many people, including in many fields of academic science, are in fact unaware that NNSs are NOT metabolically inert and can have negative effects. </p>

<p>Edit: my controversial personal opinion, based upon this research and personal history, is that sugar consumed in moderation is healthier than excess NNS. NNS are directly related to weight gain through hormonal dysregulation. Of course medical factors alter this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is not yet a consensus answer to this important question. There are mixed findings in the literature: an older study performed in mice (PMID: 19221011) found no effect of sucralose on blood glucose or insulin levels when it was directly injected into the stomach, whereas another study found that ingestion of a sucralose solution increased blood insulin levels in obese study participants (PMID: 23633524). However, this study in humans was criticized for overstating its findings (see PMCID: PMC4030094), possibly due to the small number of study participants (N = 17).</p>
<p>Anecdotally, a graduate student in the lab where I did my dissertation research tested the effects of sucralose on isolated pancreatic islet hormone release (islets are the endocrine part of the pancreas which produce insulin), and found that sucralose had no effects on insulin or glucagon secretion (she was evaluating whether or not there were functional taste receptors present on the islet cells, i.e., whether islets &quot;taste&quot; sugar in the blood). So perhaps if there is an effect of sucralose on blood glucose levels, as suggested by some studies, it could increase blood insulin levels through canonical mechanisms (direct sensing of blood glucose by the islets, and also the amplifying mechanisms such as the &quot;cephalic phase&quot; mentioned by some of the other comments</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
