		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some wonderful people volunteered to have radiation shot at their head to see if they could replicate these light flashes. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray_visual_phenomena#Ground_experiments_in_the_1970s" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray_visual_phenomena#Ground_experiments_in_the_1970s</a></p>
<p>There basically seem to be two plausible hypotheses. One is that very high energy particles could generated Chernenkov radiation within the eyeball. This would be seen as a flash of blue light. It's not confirmed, but it's plausible.</p>
<p>The ground-based experiments showed that even particles incapable of generating these literal flashes of light still caused people to <em>see</em> flashes of light just fine. Since radiation shot at the brain doesn't seem to register anything, it further seemed reasonable to conclude that direct activation of neurons in the visual processing centers of the brain is not the cause.</p>
<p>Instead, it is thought that most radiation that causes visual phenomena does so through directly activating photoreceptor cells in the eye.</p>
<p>Now, one of the curious things about the way the eye works, is that even when you are &quot;dark adapted&quot;, that is, you have not seen a bright source of light in about half an hour, it takes the activation of more than one photoreceptor cell to register a visual phenomenon. It's thought it actually takes around 10 cells to do so in the dark adapted state.</p>
<p>A way this can happen with radiation is through what is called a &quot;particle shower&quot;. Basically, a high energy particle interacts with an atom, and liberates an electron. But that liberated electron has so much energy it can actually bump into another atom, and liberate another electron. It's like a chain reaction, except it's less energy every time, so it doesn't go on forever.</p>
<p>Anyway, a particle shower like this can cause a small region of cells to all get hit by ionizing radiation, and that could cause you to see a flash.</p>
<p>So all that aside, your question asked about people who were subjected to &quot;high amounts of radiation&quot;. It's known that victims of criticality accidents report seeing very bright light, even in well lit areas. One also reported feeling as if he was &quot;burning up&quot;. Since everything I told you was based on the study of astronauts and test subjects, these were people exposed to high energy, but low doses, of radiation. There could be something more going on with someone who is exposed to a really tremendous, even deadly amount of high energy radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The metallic taste is probably because of radiation damaging or at least irritating the chorda tympani nerve which communicates taste to the brain. It is part of an actually pretty complicated feedback loop where each nerve  <em>inhibit</em> the signal of other nerves! This particular nerve seem to have a particularly strong (inhibitory) influence upon the others.</p>
<p>Hard to tell about metallicity in paritcular. I think it is just by &quot;accident&quot; that if you damage this nerve, now more uninhibited signals from others just happen to result in a sour or metallic taste.</p>

<p>Some report that following consistent exposure of this metallic taste, they have subsequent reduced/lost taste altogether, so this doesn't seem like something you want to sense for long periods of time...</p>

<p>I have no special sources on this but I would guess that pins and needles and bright flashes are radiation activated nerves and photoreceptors. I <em>d</em>o know that bright spots/flashes in digital camera sensors can happen from activated photoreceptors by radiation (you can sometimes see that in photography from e.g. the IIS or the Moon), and since we have a biological counterpart there...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know the answers are mostly about ionizing radiation and charge neural membranes. But the patterns of sensation suggest direct activation in the sensory cerebral cortices inside the cranium, and not the peripheral nervous system (yes I know the retina is CNS). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
