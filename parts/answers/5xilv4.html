		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This will probably be burried, but here it is.
I have a studio art degree from a public university with an emphasis in oils. I was in school just a few years ago.
When we began our photorealism classes, the professors taught us the  technique of copying pictures, detail for detail.
Painting from life and painting from image, are very different.
Now, I hope this captures the spirit of ELI5, because I havent studied the human eye or how image transfer works in the human brain.
We see in three dimensions, right? So when we look at a real life model we see every detail of the light against that three dimensional form. But to capture all of that in a TWO dimensional form is rather difficult. So I was taught to &quot;cheat&quot; at first. By painting from a photo, technology that didnt exist during the Renaissance, my eye is now translating a two dimensional figure into another two dimensional figure. Why this is easier for the human eye, I don't know. But from experience, it's definitely much easier to paint a convincingly photorealistic image from a picture over doing it from a real life person. </p>
<p>And in response to the comment about the paintings not necessarily looking photorealistic, and instead just looking like &quot;Renaissance&quot;...you're half right.</p>
<p>The masters of the Renaissance respected the human form and got as close to life-like as possible. Photorealism (a term coined much later, at the turn of the century) was the holy grail. It meant more money, the more life-like the commissions became. In their minds, there was nothing better than the natural human form, nothing more beautiful, save perhaps their paintings of it. But they also glorified the human form much like the Greeks did before them. So the human figure was made to look much more lavish, much more exquisite, than it really was. (Some masters admittedly added more musculature to their sculptures and paintings than was anatomically correct.) And there were many iterations of this concept, a noteable contributer being Sir Reubens (the one that painted his ladies nice, rosy, robust, and chubby.)
So yeah, it was supposed to look even more beautiful than the natural form, but photorealism was absolutely a goal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modern artists can achieve photorealism because they are copying from photos.</p>
<p>Photographs are images captured by a device. The capabilities and settings on the device determine how the image will appear - change the settings slightly and you'll get a very different image. Therefore, a photograph is not explicit reality but a version of it captured in a certain moment, under certain conditions, at a certain angle, by a certain device with certain settings (selected by a human, which is why you should reconsider photos/video as a kind of objective reality in the first place - think about this when watching the news or Youtube).</p>
<p>Go outside and take a photo. Now look at the scene with your eye and compare it to the photo. You should be able to notice differences.</p>
<p>Now come back an hour later and look at the same scene with your eye. At minimum the light has changed, objects might have moved, cloud cover changed, etc.</p>
<p>Consider that creating a detailed painting takes many hours. </p>
<p>Consider that while the artist is working, the conditions of the scene will change.</p>
<p>Consider that when working from a photo, nothing changes. Even the conditions under which the artist views the photo itself do not change since we have the luxury of electronic artificial light.</p>
<p>When working from a photograph, the artist is copying a vision captured by a machine; when working from reality, the image produced is built directly from the impressions of a human without the mechanical middle-man.</p>
<p>So: which method represents reality more accurately as a <em>human perceives it</em>? Of course, the question itself only leads to more questions ;)</p>
<p>My background: I have a degree in fine arts and prefer to paint in oils. I use photographs as a reference for anatomy, proportion, colour but build the image according to whatever imagination inspired it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ability to work from a photograph (and to extrapolate the skills learned this way to drawing live models). A lot of renaissance work - particularly in portraits has the hallmarks of using a camera obscura (basically an image projected in a lightbox) which has a few issues in terms of scale (often the person's head is in focus but their shoulders aren't, also head looks giant compared to torso). Don't forget as well that painter in that time was much more of a craft than an art - painters needed to earn enough to eat and sometimes that meant fudging things to suit the vanity of the subject/comissioner which necessarily adds some distortion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think your comparison with trompe l'oeil masterpieces is not comparing like for like really. You can't compare a pencil drawing to oil painting as the medium affects the end result and oil paint is quite a thick viscous material that does not really lend itself to fine details in the way that a pencil or ballpoint does.</p>
<p>I also think the increase in realism over the centuries has two causes, one is that as technique improves the next &quot;great&quot; artist has to up their technique to be successful in the same way that Olympic records are broken for a more mundane example.</p>
<p>The second change is technology and scientific discovery, as human knowledge and technology changes human perception changes too.   As printing improved and photography appeared peoples perception of realism changed to match the level of detail these new techniques brought with them. For us in the modern age it is for example quite normal to think of a picture being made up of small dots or pixels but if someone were to think in that way in the 17th century would of been quite unique.</p>
<p>On another level it is debatable if level of detail equates to quality, a high level of detail at worst is only a indication of a certain level of craftsmanship and not a automatic indication of artistic merit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like pose another version of your question. How did sculptors create such life like images from marble and other stone yet various paintings did not compete? I understand as other have said that the technology for fine point pens vs oil painting is different enough to not portray as good of details. I don't see exactly how that isn't the same for sculpting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
