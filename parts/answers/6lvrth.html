Which if I'm reading your question right is what you're asking, basically using 'historical' sensory data to track prey as opposed to direct sight and chase style hunting.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>As a follow up:</strong> </p>
<p><em>If</em> the answer is humans are the only animal that can track using foot print (etc) cues, would this be because of our cognitive ability to think about the problem? </p>
<p>Scent can directly set off memory cues for a wolf, or urine under UV ability will show to be a rodent (because of certain chemicals left in the trails). But foot prints take a whole lot of perception such as what sort of animal is that? Is that worth the chase? Are these tracks new or old? If that animal injured because the one foot is limping (and I'm sure there's a lot more to it that an actual hunter could add there).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhtuHXInt88" target="_blank">documentary </a> about coywolves speaks about the animal's ability for observational learning and how it's helped them remain mostly unseen in urban spaces by their human neighbors by becoming accustomed to peoples patterns.  I briefly looked for the specific part but couldn't find it. It's worth a watch at &lt;50mins, I just didn't have the time tonight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Incidentally, a recent study debunked the myth that the human sense of smell is feeble, and there was some evidence that we can track by scent: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/may/11/not-to-be-sniffed-at-human-sense-of-smell-rivals-that-of-dogs-says-study" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/may/11/not-to-be-sniffed-at-human-sense-of-smell-rivals-that-of-dogs-says-study</a></p>
<p>Also, as a contrapositive to your question, there must be or must have been something in the ocean that hunts visually, which resulted in the molluscs developing such a ridiculous camouflage system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
