<p>Both body parts and cancer cells that are alive need circulation. Ostensibly, &quot;dead parts&quot; like hair and nails can't get cancer because they are not growing. But they can be affected by cancer, certainly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question! One thing you might find interesting is &quot;heart cancer&quot; - basically never happens / extremely rare. The reason we almost never find cancer in the heart is because the cells have terminally differentiated and mostly stopped dividing. This is also the reason recovering from heart attacks (myocardial infarction) where some heart muscle has died is not easy - we do not yet know how to repair the dead part of tissue, since the cells do not divide to do it by themselves. Cancer needs cells that are proliferating to gain traction, so these won't do!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only vouch for the area that I am well versed in.</p>
<p>You cannot develop cancer cells in the teeth, despite teeth being organs  like your liver and lungs. This is partially because the bulk of the tissue that forms a tooth does not have any mechanism to reproduce itself  but rather, it has a remineralization process to reinforce the layers in response to gradual damage.  </p>
<p>Point being, I have never read of a single case of &quot;dental cancer&quot; in my life and I have read many odontological texts. Oral cancer? yes. Dental cancer? I don't know of any cases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here is something really interesting: there are cells in the body that are sort of “dead end” products. They live a short while to do very specific jobs, then die off. The best example I can give is very specialized intestinal cells right at the tips of the little villi, the fingerlike projections that carpet your intestines.</p>
<p>There was a study done in mice where oncogenic mutations were expressed specifically in adult intestinal stem cells at the base of the villi, or only in the tip-top “dead end” cells. Even though the very powerful cancer-causing mutations were the same in both cases, only the mice in which the mutations were in the intestinal stem cells got cancer.</p>
<p>We call these dead end cells “terminally differentiated”. The hypothesis is that these cells don’t divide enough to turn into cancer and may also just die too soon. The corollary is that we think there’s something about the way adult stem cells stay alive for a long time and in a state where they can become many different types of cells lends it to getting cancer much more easily. </p>
<p>Edit: I should add that maybe if we forced them enough, they could turn into cancer. Terminally differentiated cells can be turned into embryonic stem cells by the iPS process. But at the very least, it would be very difficult to make it happen in an actual animal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
