		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, we can remove protons from a nucleus using various kinds of nuclear reactions.</p>
<p>If you're asking whether there exists any nucleus with only neutrons in it (besides a single neutron), no such nucleus is bound. There are only resonances, like the dineutron and the tetraneutron, which decay with half-lives on the order of 10^(-22) seconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the far extremes of the table of isotopes are the proton and neutron drip lines. They are called that because any nucleus past them are unstable to neutron/proton decay. They're mostly extremely short lived and none of them are long lived enough to form atoms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
