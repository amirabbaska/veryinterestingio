		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Limbs falling asleep due to lack of blood flow is an urban myth. If blood stops flowing to a limb, that limb starts to die. You are pinching a nerve in the limb which makes it go to sleep. That tingly feeling when it comes back is your peripheral nervous system starting back up in that limb (more or less) No harm done.</p>
<p>Wow this blew up. Ok, sorry for not being specific enough. I took from what op stated that this was the usual falling asleep on a limb and waking up with a &quot;dead&quot; limb. This is mostly not harmful at all. This is not taking into account the nerve being pinched for extended periods of time or repeatedly from use like a wrist over a keyboard. Those events can cause damage and should be looked at if feeling has not returned after a short while. I just wanted to put people at ease that 99 times out of a 100 your limb falling asleep from a nap or just sitting in a weird way will be completely fine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tingly feeling is usually related more to nerve impingement/entrapment. It's actually pretty hard to completely cut off blood flow to your limbs by compressing/ligating vulnerable vessels. Using the arm as an example, here is the <a href="http://imgur.com/CMtLdm4" target="_blank">blood supply</a>, and the <a href="http://imgur.com/CgykZRR" target="_blank">nerve supply</a> to the upper limb. (Source: Netter's <em>Atlas of Human Anatomy</em>). In the first image, note all the vessels that branch off of the subclavian, sections labelled 1 &amp; 2. The vessels that wrap around the back of the scapula (shoulder blade) and connect with the others around the glenohumeral joint (where the ball of the humerus meets the socket of the shoulder blade) provides <em>collateral circulation</em> even if the subclavian/brachial artery is pinched shut in the axilla (armpit), the most vulnerable point.</p>
<p>Now look at the nerves. With the exception of the musculocutaneous nerve, all the nerves that innervate the upper limb pass through the 'pit' of the axilla that is vulnerable to compression (The MC nerve is also vulnerable, just less so).</p>
<p>The same applies to compression at other vulnerable points, there's almost always better collateral blood supply than there is innervation, since taking out nerve supply upstream cuts off the downstream more effectively than with blood flow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Many instances of sprained/broken ankles, wrists, strained tendons, etc. are a direct result from trying to walk on sleeping limbs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
