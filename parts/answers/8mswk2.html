		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a little bit of an energy cost for adding a proton due to the repulsive Coulomb interaction that the additional proton feels with the rest of the nucleus. There is no such cost for neutrons, because they have no electric charge.</p>
<p>Except at very high Z, the Coulomb force is generally much weaker than the nuclear force. So bound states can still form even with lots of protons, but the surface of minimum binding energy per nucleon (the &quot;valley of stability&quot;) tends towards N/Z &gt; 1 as you go to higher mass numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Strong force has a very small range, and only affects Neutrons and Protons in the nucleus. and vastly out powers the electromagnetic force. Electromagnetism repels the protons from one another. Basically, as you get more protons, the Strong force from one side of the atom to another is very weak between protons. So to get over this, you need neutrons, which don't add to the electromagnetic force but do to the Strong force. </p>
<p>Basically, neutrons are glue holding repelling magnets together. As you get more magnets, you'll need even more glue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
