		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arcade culture is a big deal in Japan. One of the reasons is Japanese kids go to arcades to socialise a lot more than American kids do. Japanese arcades are sometimes 10 story buildings, filled with games of every type. Usually there's at least one entire floor devoted to dance/rhythm games. People that live in Japanese cities tend to have small apartments, so, it's hard to have all your friends over to play games, they go play at the arcades. Dance/rhythm games are a social thing and the Japanese take it very seriously whereas in a lot of other developed countries, arcades have died out, yes they still exist but nothing like the scale of what you find in Tokyo. I've been lucky enough to visit quite a few countries, Arcades in Tokyo are amazing. They even let you smoke and drink. Japan is awesome. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Arcades, and rhythm games are specifically brought up and talked about. It's actually a pretty interesting topic, and the 3D video/exploration is neat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
