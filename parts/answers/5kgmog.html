		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It deep-ends on what you mean by &quot;extremely large.&quot; Many abyssal creatures are gigantic compared to their shallow water water relatives.  Examples:</p>
<p><a href="http://eol.org/pages/2924326/details" target="_blank">Japanese Spider crab <em>Macrocheira kaempferi</em></a>: 18-feet across.</p>
<p><a href="http://squid.tepapa.govt.nz/anatomy/article/the-body-of-the-colossal-squid" target="_blank">Colossal Squid</a> up to 43 feet long.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aquariumofpacific.org/onlinelearningcenter/species/giant_isopod" target="_blank">Giant Isopod</a> over a foot long, but compare that to the tiny pill bug relative.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.livescience.com/51103-giant-oarfish-photos.html" target="_blank">Giant Oarfish</a> up to 110 feet long.</p>
<p>It is very likely that new animals will be found in the under-explored deep sea.  This, along with the fact that there are many examples of deep sea gigantism, lead me to strongly suspect there are undescribed animals out there that are extremely large when compared to their nearest known relatives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Presumably you mean just the parts of the ocean under a certain depth. In fact there are probably things in just the open parts of the oceans over great depths aswell. </p>
<p>As an example we know that there is a beaked whale, the spade toothed whale, that does definitely exist. Until 2013 it was only known from certain partial skeletons found around the Pacific. In 2013 a mother and calf were washed up dead in New Zealand. They were at first misidentified and buried.  They  have since been dug up for examination. They are the only full specimens in the world of a species noone has ever seen alive. </p>
<p>If we can know nothing about a large animal (the mother was like 6.5m) like this that surfaces at least every hour then it is more than feasible to assume there are large animals we dont even have hints about yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the problems with the 'depths' is that that they very little access to energy, no sunlight, very limited nutrition. This makes most of the big creatures that live down deep eventually limited in size by these constraints.  So any deep deep organism has to rely on their food coming from above in limited supplies. Most deep sea animals have to be very careful about handling energy resources because of this.</p>
<p>Is it utterly impossible? No, I guess, but it would have to be some massive massive jelly like blob that would move enormously slowly and have very limited energy stores. Nothing like Godzilla.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
