<p>Let’s say the plane crashed into the sea, and the black box was drowned in salty sea water for some time. When retrieved, it will be thrown immediately into normal water to avoid corrosion so the people will have more of a chance of recovering the data.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it’s distilled water and it’s used  because it won’t cause more corrosion.  I work with cameras and when they get saltwater infiltration we immediately or ASAP give them a soak in distilled water to dilute the corrosives found in seawater to attempt to mitigate as much corrosion as possible.  This is actually a technique that Sony Corp. suggests when dealing with cameras and (way back in the day) VTRs were hit with a wave from the reporter at the beach live shot.  It works probably about as well as it can as there’s instant corrosion on things like copper and gold when seawater hits it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If it is taken out of the water and allowed to dry, the salts in the water become concentrated and deposited on the surface. The concentrated salts can cause damage where dilute salts might not, and with ones that use magnetic tape, salts drying onto the surface of the tape will definitely damage it.</p>
<p>Storing it immersed in fresh water will start the process of diluting and flushing out the salts, and prevent anything from drying out before it is properly cleaned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
