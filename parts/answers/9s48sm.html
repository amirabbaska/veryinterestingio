		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before I answer, this is a MASSIVE oversimplification. Your question touches on topics like action selection, motor neural motivation and inhibition, etc, which some people spend their whole lives studying.</p>
<p>There's a part of the brain called the Basal Ganglia which is responsible for inhibiting motion. At any given moment, your brain might be considering a bunch of different movements. The Basal Ganglia has neurons that produce inhibitory neurotransmitters to suppress the many random signals vying to be sent down to your muscles, waiting for the brain's dopaminergic (reward and motivation) system to kind &quot;override&quot; that suppression. </p>
<p>So when you &quot;think about moving&quot; (say for example you picture yourself throwing a ball) you're activating all the parts of the brain associated with motion (the frontal cortex is planning your sequence of fine motor movements, your occipital lobe is imagining what it will look like visually when you pick your target and track it, your motor cortex is activating cells related to musculoskeletal movement in your arms and shoulders, etc) but your Basal Ganglia is just saying &quot;Nope&quot; before the whole signal goes to your muscles.</p>
<p>To better understand how the brain motivates and inhibits motion, I'd recommend reading about motor disorders like Parkinson's, Huntington's, or hemiballismus, which show scientists what happens when certain parts of the brain degrade, allowing them to better understand the functions of those brain regions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I suffer from Functional Neurological Disorder, aka Conversion Disorder). This comes into play often for me. I may want to speak or move, but my body will not perform accordingly. I have to do some quick thinking to adjust my mental trajectory so I can get a passibly desirable alternative movement or means of communication. I would love to learn more about the intent vs function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Degree in neuroscience and currently in med school.</p>
<p>A large part of the frontal lobe’s role is inhibiting pathways elsewhere in the brain.  So thinking about saying something, but not actually saying it, involves your frontal lobe essentially saying “shhhh” to the parts of your brain that would actually initiate your actions.</p>
<p>This is why often in cases of frontal lobe brain injury, or if someone has been drinking a lot of alcohol, people have less social inhibition.  Their frontal lobe isn’t working as well, and that “shhhh” doesn’t get communicated as well, if at all.  There may be a lower threshold between thinking about saying something and actually saying it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
