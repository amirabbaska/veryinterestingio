		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no hard set definition of what a religion or &quot;church&quot; is in US law and each group that desires to gain tax exempt status under the religious clauses applies and then is either granted or denied that status. Once granted there is really no strong mechanism to remove the status as attempting to do so would be hindering a recognized religion and would be a violation of the First Amendment (or at least could be argued to be a violation). </p>
<p>Scientology obtained the status after years of petitioning for it, and finally effectively holding the IRS hostage by filing hundreds (if not thousands) of individual lawsuits that bogged down the system and force them to divert resources from other issues and took up court time from more legitimate cases. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is from Australia, but I'm sure the reasoning is the same.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Church of Scientology requested a tax exemption from wages originating from a religious institution based on the Victoria Pay-roll Tax Act 1971. The High Court asked the question on whether Scientology was to be accepted as a religion, and decided that they were. Scientology met the two criteria that they stipulated for the determination of whether an organization is religious; first “belief in a supernatural Being, Thing or Principle” and second, “the acceptance of canons of conduct in order to give effect to that belief.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, it meets the same standards as any major religion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
