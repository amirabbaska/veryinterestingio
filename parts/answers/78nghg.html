		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>deodorant kills the bacteria that grow in your armpits so they don't make the smell you associate with body odor, and usually also smells nice</p>
<p>antiperspirant blocks your sweat glands so that they don't extrude the sweat that the bacteria feed on to make body odor</p>
