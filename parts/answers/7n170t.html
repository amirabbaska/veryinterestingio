Basically, we have a map for most of the observable universe that can be used to navigate. The required navigation equipment would consist of a bunch of very large telescopes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When using a compass you are comparing your location to a known location relatively far away.  But this only tells you one Line of Position - you know you are somewhere on the line that points directly to Magnetic North.</p>
<p>While close to a coastline, sailors use landmarks with known positions to determine their position: determine the bearing to the two landmarks, plot the two lines on a chart, and where the two lines cross is your position.  Note that you are just trying to determine latitude and longitude, not elevation, so only two lines are needed.</p>
<p>Once the coastline drops below the horizon you have to resort to celestial navigation.  Because the Earth is rotating relative to all the stars and the Sun a new element is introduced: time.  Overly simplified, this process would be to take bearings to several celestial objects, then look up in a table where they should be at a particular time, then adjust for your actual time.  This is what reduced the accuracy of navigation before digital watches: accurate time is essential.</p>
<p>In space, the same process can be applied.  For travel within the solar system, the stars in our galaxy can be used to orient your spacecraft, and the planets can be used to determine location.  In this case the planets are moving, but they are moving in a deterministic manner - we know where they will be in the next few years.</p>
<p>How it's actually done is slightly different:  <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-space-probes-navig/" target="_blank">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-do-space-probes-navig/</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, aerospace engineer here! I've been seeing a lot of speculative answers. I'm sure there is some good stuff hidden too, but I wanted to talk about how modern spacecraft actually figure out where they are. There are a lot of ways to figure that out, and there are two main questions: where am I and where am I pointed?</p>
<p>Let's talk about Low Earth Orbit, or &quot;LEO.&quot; That's where most of our satellites are, so it's a good place to start.</p>
<p>&quot;Where am I&quot; is easy. For most satellites, that's going to be GPS. I'm simplifying here, but by determining how far you are from 4 or more GPS satellites, you can determine where you are in space. Spacecraft GPS essentially works the same way as it does in your cell phone. &quot;Where am I&quot; can also be determined by things like ground radar and then transmitted up to the satellite so it knows where it is. Spacecraft accelerometers can sense how your velocity is changing, and integrate that to estimate your position.</p>
<p>&quot;Where am I pointed&quot; is also pretty easy. There are a bunch of different sensors that can figure this part out. There are sun sensors, star trackers, and horizon sensors. Those are the most common. Let's talk about star trackers because that's probably the most simple to visualize. We know exactly what the night sky looks like, so it's easy for us to make a map of it. A star tracker takes a picture of the night sky, looks at where all the stars are in that picture, and then matches that to a specific piece of our star map. By doing that, you now know where how you're oriented in all three dimensions (yaw, pitch, and roll). Horizon and sun sensors work in a similar fashion, but can't measure all three dimensions at once.</p>
<p>Now, it gets a little tricker and expensive when we're talking about missions in deep space, like Mars or Pluto. The best tracking method we have is called  Delta-Differential One-way Ranging, or Delta-DOR. Essentially, it composed of two measurements. How far away is the spacecraft from Earth, and where is it in the sky? How far away is easy - you send a single from Earth to be retransmitted by the spacecraft. You measure the time it takes for the signal to travel from Earth to the spacecraft, then back again. That's going to take some time, <em>minutes</em> in a lot of cases. You divide that time by the speed of light, and that tells you how far away it is. Then you have to figure out where it is in the sky. That requires using two of NASA's Deep Space Network antennas thousands of miles apart from each other. Each antenna listens to a signal sent from the spacecraft. By determining how much longer it took to reach one antenna than the other, you can figure out its position in the sky. But remember, only Earth knows where the spacecraft is at this point. You then need to tell the spacecraft where it is.</p>
<p>I have a flight so I'm kind of rushing this explanation, but if you're interested I can answer more questions or clear stuff up!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Awesome question! Determining your position and attitude in space is all relative! Like you mentioned in your post, there is no absolute firm fixed frame of reference for the universe, so everything is determined &quot;relative&quot; off of something else that appears &quot;fixed&quot; from the observer. For example, in Low Earth Orbit (LEO), the stars appear to be fixed in their positions relative to the Earth and spacecraft, so are sometimes used for navigation purposes.</p>
<p>In LEO you can use the following instruments on your spacecraft to determine your relative position and/or attitude:</p>
<ul>
<li>GPS Receiver - Because the GPS satellites are in Medium Earth Orbit (MEO), satellites that are in LEO can actually use GPS signals to determine their position.</li>
<li>Star Tracker/Sensor - Some other people here have described Star Trackers in more detail, but basically they determine your spacecraft's location relative to the stars as they appear &quot;fixed&quot; from the observer's point of view.</li>
<li>Earth Sensor - Also known as a horizon sensor, this helps the spacecraft determine the edges of the Earth for attitude/position determination.</li>
<li>Sun Sensor - Similar to an Earth Sensor, but with the Sun as a point target.</li>
<li>Magnetometer - Determines the orientation of the spacecraft relative to the Earth's magnetic field.</li>
</ul>
<p>I think one other person here mentioned Pulsar Detectors as well as a way of navigation, which would also totally work! But to my knowledge is not used popularly for commercial spacecraft. Hope this helps!</p>
<p><em>Additional Edit</em> - Also forgot to mention, that another really popular method for LEO spacecraft is ground-based observations. Using telescopes and radar data from a very accurately located observation point, an instrument on the ground can determine the orbital characteristics of an object in orbit around the Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
