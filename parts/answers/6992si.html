		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves cook by vibrating molecules at the atomic level, which creates friction and releases energy in the form of heat.  This means the heat is actually generated from inside the food, and not just blasting the outside surface of the food.  Microwaves can heat more parts of the food at once this way.  This heat then spreads to other parts of the food, heating it up.  If you've ever eaten something that was heated in the microwave and it had cold spots, it's because those spots had less water (or the microwaves aren't evenly distributed within the chamber).  This is why most microwave cooking instructions tell you to let the food rest, so that the heat can reach equilibrium throughout the food and you won't have cold spots.  Interestingly, this property is also what prevents most non-food objects from heating up in the microwave; they contain no moisture so they don't vibrate and thus don't generate heat. </p>
<p>On the other hand, ovens use a heating element (electric or gas, usually) to heat the air in the oven (convection), which means heat transfer must occur from the outside-in. As each &quot;layer&quot; of food is cooked, the next layer wants to reach equilibrium and starts taking heat from the warmer layers.  This process is called conduction.  It takes longer for each layer to heat because the previous layer needs to heat up first in order to transfer heat inward.  This process takes much longer, but unlike a microwave you don't end up with the uneven heating problem and don't need to let your food rest so the heat can be evenly distributed.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5?  Ovens are really inefficient.</p>
<ul>
<li>Microwaves heat certain materials (e.g. water) with a beam that penetrates the food.  (Pure radiation -- not nuclear obviously, electromagnetic/radio waves.)  Use &lt; 100% power to have the beam turn off/on to let the heat redistribute in the food.</li>
<li>Ovens heat the air which then heats the food.  Convection ovens / air fryers are faster at this since they circulate the air.</li>
<li>Sous-vide heats &amp; circulates water which then heats the food.  Water can transfer heat a lot quicker than air, but you can't get it above boiling.</li>
<li>Smokers heat/circulate air, much like an oven, but at lower temperatures with more smoke.</li>
<li>Deep-frying has heated oil that transfers heat.  You can get it above the boiling point of water, perhaps even circulate it, but you'll get tons of oil on your food.</li>
<li>Pressure cookers heat water into pressurized steam, but don't really circulate it.  As steam transfers heat better than air a pressure cooker is faster than an oven for many things.</li>
<li>The oven range heats the bottom of the skillet/pot which conducts heat into the food through direct contact.</li>
<li>Grills are a combination of direct conduction (the grill grate), convection (rising hot air), and radiated heat (from the flame).</li>
</ul>
<p>Each cooking method has trade-offs and produces different results which is why we use so many.  Microwaving is fast, but not even cooking due to variable absorption of the beam, so we mostly use it for reheating.  Sous-vide is the most even cooking, but it takes a long time since the difference in temperature between the water bath and the food asymptotically approaches zero (less heat transfer with less temperature difference).  You also don't get the Mallard reaction without higher temperatures (think the grill marks on a steak).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>&quot;Microwaves cook from the inside out&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>This is a myth which is only partially true.</strong></p>
<p>Microwave energy is absorbed by water (and etc.) which then makes the water molecules hot. So the energy that gets inside the food is reduced because the water on the outside part already absorbed it. Therefore heating from the outside in.</p>
<p>However if the food has a dry crusty outside, and fleshy meaty inside, like for example, a hotpocket, the microwave energy isn't reduced because there's not much in the crust than can absorb it, therefore heating from the inside out.</p>
<p>TL;DR: The reason why some microwave food cooks <strong>faster</strong> with a microwave is because like the hotpocket, they have been specifically designed to cook well with a microwave</p>
<p>Edit: other than food designed to cook well with a microwave, there are also other examples of food that cook well with microwaves just by coincidence. Toasting sliced bread works because the porousness of the bread let's hot water evaporate so the microwaves <em>git in there gud</em>.</p>
<p>In contrast, reheating fried food in a microwave just makes them soggy because frying makes the outside crispy by dehydrating them. Microwaves heat the wetness inside making it want to come out and evaporate, but instead, it just deposits on the outer layer of fries making it a disappointment.</p>
<p>In summary, in the cases where a microwave <em>can</em> cook from the inside out, it will generally be faster than a regular oven.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I don't see mentioned is why ovens are bad, (at heating relative to microwaves in the context of this question about time required) most of the focus has been on microwaves. The heating element in the oven heats the air around it, which in turn passes the heat to the air particles around that, and so on. Also, hot air rises and circulates allowing colder air to come into contact with the heating element. Air is not very dense, and has poor heat capacity and conductivity, there are not many atoms and molecules per volume to 'hold' the heat and thus pass it on. As examples, you could put your hand inside an oven at 200c for a few seconds, and be fine, but (don't) try putting you hand into boiling water at 100c for any seconds. A liter of liquid water is 1kg, but 1kg of steam water is 1600 liters, the same amount of heat energy is spread out 1600 times the volume.</p>
<p>Edited first line to include ovens are bad &quot;at heating relative to microwaves in the context of this question about time required&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
