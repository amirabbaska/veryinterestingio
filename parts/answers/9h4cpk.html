IIRC, they don't really know who patient zero is as HIV is a result of a random mutation that unfortunately allowed it to infect humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several known strains of HIV. Two are closely related to SIV from particular groups of chimpanzees, and a third is related to SIV found in Gorillas. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2935100/#!po=23.3333" target="_blank">The NIH has a a summary of HIV’s origins with citations.</a></p>
<p>Chimps seems to have acquired it from other monkeys. It appears to be endemic to African monkeys.</p>
<p>It probably spreads to human hunters via blood-blood contact.</p>
<p>HIV doesn’t tolerate being out in the open air for long. It’s very unlikely that it would become “airborne”, but I’m no expert.</p>
<p>Just imagine all those researchers wandering around Africa collecting samples of chimpanzee poop so we can study HIV. What a job.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is estimated that HIV crossed over to humans sometime in the early thirties, but there is no true way of confirming that. Patient zero is assumed to have been a hunter butchering a monkey. </p>
<p>It continued on for 50 years killing everyone that contracted it before it was first isolated in 1983. It took more than ten years before the first effective antiretroviral treatment arose. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So it's thought it came from the same area that Ebola came from in Kenya although they are not really sure. As humans continue to expand and occupy new territory which was formerly jungle and wilderness we put ourselves at risk for contact with animals that may carry new diseases.  Add globalization and a new virus in the jungles of Africa continent could easily spread worldwide very quickly.  I just read a book called The Hot Zone by Richard Preston.  In it he follows the beginnings of Marburgs virus and Ebola as well as touching on HIV aids.  It's thought that human contact of blood form an infected animal. Possibly monkey.  FYI. That book is horrifying.  Makes you realize how fragile we are and how close we are to another global epidemic.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wading through all this arguing is difficult, but I think I understand that it’s most likely the handling of bush meat, which I gather is monkey or simian meat? I have a question; is the transmission only possible via sexual or blood-blood contact? Specifically, if a human slaughtered and ate an infected simian, or like, literally bit into it and ate it raw, would they become infected? Or would that also require open cuts in the mouth/digestive tract for the blood to transmit through?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
