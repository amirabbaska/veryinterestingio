		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You read <em>probabilistically</em>.</p>
<p>You don't look at each word, figure it out, then move to the next word.</p>
<p>When you read, your eyes make ballistic movements - they don't run smoothly across the page, but rather move in jerks called <em>saccades</em> from position to position. You're not looking at a video feed of a page, but rather a bunch of tiny snapshots.</p>
<p>The top comment right now says &quot;Your eyes actually take in multiple words at a time&quot;, but that's not really true, at least not in the way people typically assume it is. You can only see with detail a very small area of the page at a time (you aren't consciously aware of this the same way you aren't consciously aware of the fact that most of your visual field can't see color). Your eyes will frequently take in <em>less</em> than a word at a time in detail, and you don't necessarily aim saccades onto individual words - you might aim at the edge of a word to get a detailed look at the beginning of one and the end of another for instance. And the less detailed part of your visual field is going to pick up things too - you might not be able to pick out the letters in an adjacent word, but you might be able to make out its length.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, you're trying to minimize the number of saccades it takes to read something. So your brain is trying to guess where to aim the next saccade based on what you've read so far and the different alternatives you're considering for what's next. The goal is to figure out what it says, which means to raise the probability of one of the possible words/phrases/sentences/discourses as much as possible.</p>
<p>In a lot of cases, you're not going to be aiming at every word, or even aiming so as to put every word into that high-detail area at all. If you can be pretty sure what a word is without looking at it, or without looking at all the letters, you can skip a saccade that you would have spent looking at it.</p>
<p>The word <em>the</em> is very predictable (i.e., not very informative), very common, and very short. In fact, it's the most common word, and since word frequency is Zipf-distributed (google that if you care), that means it's the most common by a <em>lot</em>. It's also part of a very restricted syntactic class (think &quot;part of speech&quot;, <em>the</em> is a <em>determiner</em>), so there aren't many alternatives and all of them are much less frequent. Which all adds up to <em>the</em> being the least informative word in just about all contexts.</p>
<p>So if you're programming your next saccade and you predict a <em>the</em> and maybe you detect an appropriate-length next word with the crappier part of your visual field, you're going to program your next saccade to just skip past it - you can already be pretty damn sure it's a <em>the</em> without having to look at it. In a sense, you probably don't actually read most instances of the word <em>the</em>.</p>
<p>It's not just that you don't pay much attention to the second <em>the</em> as that you don't pay attention to <em>the</em> much in general. It's not very informative. And a second <em>the</em> isn't informative either - it's anomalous, but it doesn't create some other confusing meaning, nor does it allow you to better predict what phrase/sentence/discourse you're reading. Given that it's the most common word, that doubling is a common error, and that doubled <em>the</em> isn't informative, if you did notice it there at all (which is probably a big if), it makes sense to just ignore it, and it's probably also the case that you have a lot of practice ignoring it.</p>
<p>There might also be something to how quickly you process <em>the</em> - some sort of overlap of neural activation due to the speed that causes two <em>the</em>s to be perceptually indistinct even though two <em>car</em>s in a row for instance are perceptually salient, but that's considerably more speculative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: For those of you requiring an extra &quot;the&quot; in my comment, you'll find it up here: &quot;the the&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to what others have said, the human brain, when reading, doesn't actually see every word, unless you're not fluent in a particular language. Your eyes actually take in multiple words at a time and parse the sentence based on the words you've taken in. This also means that unless a particular particle is deadly important to the sentence, your brain ignores it. It also partially explains why you sometimes go back over a sentence if it doesn't parse correctly. An extra &quot;the&quot; doesn't change the meaning of a sentence, so you continue as if you understood.</p>
<p>(Edit: some source for those interested in how reading works: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_%28process%29" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reading_%28process%29</a> and of course this page has a nice, long reading list of sources at the bottom)</p>
<p>My question would be to those people who read languages such as Chinese or Korean or Japanese: does the same thing happen if you put two of the same particle in a row in a sentence? For example, would a Japanese person reading &quot;英語 がが わかりません&quot; spot the mistake or gloss over it in the same way native English speakers gloss over superfluous incidents of &quot;the&quot;?</p>
<p>Edit: it's curious and interesting as hell: about an equal number of native Japanese speakers gloss over the mistake as much as stands out for the others. If anyone has any research on reading and word cognition in non-roman alphabetic languages, I'd love to read it.</p>
<p>Edit2: As others have mentioned, the eye's saccadic movement system also has a lot to do with this. This wiki page has more information about it for those who are interested: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_in_language_reading" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_movement_in_language_reading</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a phenomenon called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attentional_blink" target="_blank">attentional blink</a> where, when you're rapidly presented with stimuli, your brain will perceive two identical stimuli in a row as a single stimulus.  Basically, your brain sees &quot;the the&quot; and assumes there was only one.  </p>
<p>In nature, identical stimuli in rapid succession are vanishingly rare - if you see two crouching tigers from the same angle and in the same position in a quarter of a second, it's much more likely there was only one tiger and you just blinked; so your brain edits your perceptions with that in mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Language is not a simple pipeline.  Words don't just flow into your brain from the page or from your ears.  In fact your brain constructs large amounts of language from your subconscious knowledge about the rules of grammar.  </p>
<p>For example, you can take a word such as &quot;interesting&quot;, remove the t sound and play a cough sound in its place.  When people hear the word in a normal sentence they will hear the word no problem and not be able to pin-point what sound was missing.  </p>
<p>Your brain reconstructing language in this way allows you to understand your friend in a noisy bar.  It also allows you to read much faster than a child who is learning to read.  You don't have to sound out every word, in fact, you can skip over whole words that you know 'ought' to be there because you're following the rules of grammar in your head without thinking about it.</p>
<p>The word 'the' is never repeated in normal grammar rules, so when you grab a few words from the title with your eyes your brain reconstructs the most sensible sentence: one with only one 'the'.  Since this rebuilding all happens subconsciously, you never notice the second 'the'.  </p>
