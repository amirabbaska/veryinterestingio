		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think if your bladder like a rubber band. It’s all about its ability to expand. Medications that decrease your need to pee do so by allowing the muscle surrounding your bladder to relax so the bladder can expand more. Additionally, the more you hold your bladder, the more it expands. Think of this aspect like the stomach of a competitive eater. </p>
<p>The stomach is designed very similar to the bladder, many wrinkles that allow it to stretch to much larger than its resting size. Before a Competition they eat tons of salad to stretch their stomachs, afterwards the stomach shrinks back Down to a normal size, making them feel fuller faster. What I’m getting at is, the more you let your bladder fill and expand, the more it will stay expanded at rest, and the more volume it can contain before the nerves that make you feel like you have to pee are stimulated. </p>
<p>Thus, to answer your question, if you’re peeing more often with less urine in your bladder, eventually it will decrease in size and you will feel like you have to Pee more often. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
