		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of sugar in your blood stream has a big impact on how hungry you are. When you eat something with sugar your blood sugar immediately rises. As time passes your body uses that sugar for energy and your blood sugar levels get low. This causes you to feel hungry, however if you wait long enough your liver will process stored fat to increase your blood sugar levels. That's why if you ignore your hunger(or sleep through it) you will feel less hungry.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Unless you're diabetic. Then you should probably not go to bed hungry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A combination of gluconeogenisis (glucose synthesis) and glycogenolysis (unpackaging of stored glucose). Alot of this is because of hormonal evolution. It's important to note that breakfast is a pretty new thing in our evolutionary timeline. For mellenia we didnt have breakfast. Cavemen woke up and had to hunt. If they were lucky theyd get dinner. So we have evolved to shift our metabolism from glucose to fatty acid oxidation and gluconeogenisis when we sleep. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being ravenously hungry all the time would be far to distracting but being super hungry for a short time is a miraculous motivator but if your so distracted by your hunger that you cant focus on hunting you wont eat. So while its still present hunger subsides after a while.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
