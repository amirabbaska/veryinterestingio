		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The National Science foundation released an article on the fastest articulated motion a human can execute, which is throwing. When an arm is cocked back it can store a lot of energy which is then released during a throw. The finger tips can reach over 100mph. A hummingbird flapping at 70 times per second with wing chord of 40mm and assuming it flaps in half a circle would have an average speed if 8796mm per second or about 20mph.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q9FrW-Wr-ds" target="_blank">The Guinness world record for drumming is 1208 strokes in a minute, or just over 20 per second.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CSaRWt4cxao" target="_blank">For guitar the record is faster, about 2000 notes per minute, or about 33 per second.</a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/tap-dancing-most-taps-in-a-minute/" target="_blank">The world record for tap dancing is 1163 taps in a minute, a bit over 19 per second.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/27310194/" target="_blank">I was able to click a button on my keyboard 70 times in ten seconds, or about 7 times per second.</a></p>
<p>What about what humans can perceive? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h3kqBX1j7f8" target="_blank">We begin to lose the ability to distinguish sounds at around 10 sounds per second, and at around 20 the sounds blend together into a low-pitched noise.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frame_rate" target="_blank">24 frames per second is a pretty standard frame rate for video, and most people perceive such video as continuous motion.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The human vocal folds can have an incredible rate of motion. An operatic soprano can achieve a pitch (fundamental frequency) of over 1000Hz, which means her vocal folds are moving back and forth 1000 times per second -- a substantially higher frequency than the hummingbird's wings.</p>
<p>Now, vocal fold vibration is not a fully &quot;articulated&quot; motion, the way flapping wings or, as in another example, throwing a ball would be. Muscle tension causes the vocal folds to come together (adduction) and to become tensed. Exhalation builds up pressure below the glottis, and the combination of this subglottal pressure and the tension on the vocal folds leads to their very rapid vibration. So while not articulated, we do create this motion &quot;voluntarily&quot; through muscle action (adduction, tension, and exhalation). </p>
<p>(And, lest you think the 1000Hz example is particular to sopranos, human speech can regularly include fundamental frequencies up to 800Hz for female adults and 400Hz for male adults).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Saccades are the fastest possible voluntary movements - they're the tiny movements we make with our eyes when reading, focussing on a different part of the thing we're looking at. </p>
<p>I did my undergrad project on measuring saccadic velocity and humans can move their eyes at a speed of greater than 500 deg/second. </p>
<p>Now that's hard to actually comprehend but think about it like this, these movements take less than 10ms to make! </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The outer hair cells in our inner ears are capable of expand and contracting at a rate of about <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1302654/" target="_blank">60,000 times per second</a> in the lab and probably closer to 10,000 times per second in practice.  </p>
<p>Although this is a single cell, the combined activity of these cells is able to actively vibrate in the membrane in the inner ear, producing sound that is detectable outside the ear called &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otoacoustic_emission" target="_blank">Otoacoustic emissions</a>&quot;.  Typically these end at about <a href="http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/835943-overview#a2" target="_blank">4 kHz</a>, meaning we are actively (although involuntarily) vibrating the membrane at a rate of 4,000 times per second, almost 60 times faster than a hummingbird's wings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
