		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is basically the brain releasing neurotransmitters like oxytocin which is normally only released when we are in love or when we feel safe/protected or are caring for children. Allegedly animals we find cute (cats/dogs) were selected for their &quot;cuteness&quot; over centuries but what makes them cute turns out to be the ratio/proportion/distance of their eyes and face face shape, which is nearly that of human children. So, in essence only human children were originally meant to elicit that feeling but we have created/found other things that also stimulate that part of the brain and thus sort of tricks us into finding it attractive/urge to protect it from harm. Baby animals are also like this and there have been citations of adult animals caring for young  of other species probably also for similar reasons: their brains are sort of hardwired to instinctively care for &quot;cute things&quot; which babies of most species are. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can understand the reason we feel 'awww' for babies etc (instinct to take care of offspring) but why do we think fluffy animals are so cute? Humans aren't fluffy. Is this because we've come to associate them with pets as we grow up, and not so much a hardwired thought?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The important news is that humanity has sunk a lot of resources into giving themselves this response.  </p>
<p>-Entire species of dogs left effectively helpless, but for their capacity to appeal to human standards for oxytocin release.</p>
<p>-Entire subreddits devoted to masturbating this oxytocin release.</p>
<p>-Tuning competitive impulses to release <em>other</em> neurochemicals whenever we present an &quot;explanation&quot; that's really just a cursory view of biological artifacts, rather than any proper effort to deconstruct modern human experiences.</p>
<p>The thing that's metaphysically happening is that humans want to connect with everything they can, and there are certain visual cues that make that easier.</p>
<p>But we have gifs of buildings falling down, and all it takes is a little face doodle to get us to empathize with them.  In the present environment, descriptions of neurotransmitters is just another way to release neurotransmitters, not any proper explanation of a thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
