		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The numbers that you are mentioning only refer to the caliber, aka the width of the bullet itself. But bullet size isn't everything when it comes to power. There's also the length of the bullet, the amount of gunpowder behind it, the length of the barrel, etc.</p>
<p>The 9mm you are referring to is a very small round, usually shot out of a handgun. The AK47's 7.62 round (technically a 7.62x39, the second number refers to the length of the case without the bullet) is thinner, weighs slightly less, has much more powder behind it and is typically shot out of a long barreled rifle.</p>
<p>All of this message that the 7.62 bullet travels faster and has less wind resistance than the 9mm meaning that it can put more energy into the target.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ah, the ambiguous &amp; confusing world of firearm cartridges. It can drive anyone nuts, (as it has me).  </p>
<p>To give idea, in one edition of Frank Barnes book &quot;Cartridges Of The World&quot;, he's listed 19 different revolver/pistol cartridges that use a 9mm and/or a .38 bullet. They are that similar in diameter. (And this does not count what is listed in his Obsolete Chapter!). </p>
<p>Now, all of these 9mm/.38 diameter bullets will safely fire through any barrel sized for such. BUT, this absolutely does not mean that every cartridge listed as a 9mm-something or other or .38-something or other, is safe to shoot in every handgun that will chamber the cartridge, nope. </p>
<p>It gets into gray areas to be sure. (Witness my graying hair from collecting cartridges for over 30-yrs, hah).</p>
<p>Another example of potential confusion is the &quot;.30 Luger&quot; cartridge, as it is called most often here in the U.S. Whereas in Europe it is called the &quot;7.65 Luger&quot; cartridge. </p>
<p>Well, .30-cal of an inch is nowhere near in size of 7.65 of a millimeter. Then to top off, the actually size diameter of the bullet itself is .309 of an inch. Yet, we here in the U.S. so often equate any .30-caliber cartridge as .308/7.62 of an inch/mm. Which is not at all set  in stone.</p>
<p>I'll end there, as I've given myself a headache, am slobbering spit off my lower lip, and have to get to my  appointment with the psychiatrist now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The 9mm is slightly fatter (which is how they are measured) but the 7.62 is overall considerably bigger.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider a BB gun vs a Nerf gun. Both are air powered and the Nerf dart is far larger. However, getting shot with a BB gun is gonna suck a lot more. It'll put your eye out. </p>
<p>This all goes back to the formula for force: F=MA. With enough acceleration(speed sorta) less mass can still generate more force. And as other people have pointed out, a 7.62 round can have both more mass and more speed. It just happens to be narrower than a 9mm round. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>9mm is a pistol cartridge. 7.62 is a rifle cartridge. Even though 9mm bullets have a larger diameter,  the larger cartridge means the 7.62 round has a much more energy behind it. Energy is a function of mass and velocity. The 7.62 may have less mass but it has much greater energy, which translates to stopping power. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
