		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Weak force&quot; is a bit misleading anyway. It rarely has effects that look like a classical force. &quot;Weak interaction&quot; is a better term. The large mass means it does not have a long range and (combined with the short lifetime of the bosons) no radiation, these would be necessary to assign a meaningful speed value to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct, but the weak force is pretty short range as a result of the high masses of weak bosons. However, since day to day life exists at much lower energy scales than the weak boson masses, we only ever see weak particles as virtual particles, and hence it is not feasible to, say, track a W boson as it moves to measure its speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
