		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it tracks your movement while you sleep.  If the wearable has a heart rate monitor, it uses that as well to further it's accuracy.  Generally speaking, the more you move in your sleep, the less accurate the readings will be.  But overall, some studies were conducted on sleep trackers, like the Jawbone and others, and it was concluded that they're pretty accurate with sleep tracking.</p>

<p>Also, to this point, no matter what your sleep tracker  says, it cannot accurately tell you about your REM, or deep sleep, stages.  For this, it needs more sophisticated equipment like eye tracker, brain waves, etc...They try to do as accurate a job as they can with movement and heart rate to measure REM sleep but it's not really that accurate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow first time that I can talk about something I've worked on. I've worked on machine learning with sensory mobile devices (like fitbit or your phone). Generally most devices have only three sensors: an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a clock. Using these three devices you can measure 7 different values at a given time (XYZ acceleration, XYZ angular acceleration, and time). By gathering several data points you can then get a sense of movement and associate certain combinations of acceleration and time as types of movements (lets call these different features). By performing experiments in the lab with people you can fit these features (predictors) to an observed action.  Now you have a model that takes in predictors and outputs an (estimated) action. Depending on the model you'll have a wide range of accuracy but overall it's pretty good. Another way to think about is linear regression (or y=mx+b) where x is a predictor and y is an action. Except we have hundreds of x's.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the fitbit I used was accurate if the measurement involved movement: but inaccurate interpretation if there is no movement. Most nights I spend 60-90minutes lying very still trying to get to sleep. This non-activity was recorded by fitbit as sleep. It isn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
