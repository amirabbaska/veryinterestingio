		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When sloths do die, it is usually because they got attacked by jaguar while pooping, which they have to go down to the ground to do, because if they poop in the trees it would likely get stuck in their fur. Apparently not pooping on yourself is so advantageous it's worth the risk of being eaten by a jaguar. Evolution bitches.  </p>
<p>It seems a common question here is, well can't jaguars climb trees?</p>
<p>Yes they can, and I'm sure not all predation literally occurs on the ground, simply close to it. I would imagine a sloth having just finished pinching one off, who retreated too slowly back to his leafy sanctuary could be easily dragged down to nom nom upon. This brings me to the point of answering the original question their defense mechanism is their extreme elusiveness and inaccessibility from predation. Sure they get fucked up by the occasional jaguar, eagle, as well as likely big ol tree snake, but by and large they can remain safe and hidden. </p>
<p>Lastly, be sure to read the comments about the super awesome extra bio nerdy mutualism that occurs between the sloth and moths/algae that also influences their pooping behavior. That shit is cray </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sloths are basically bags of intestines digesting leaves. They have almost no meat at all. On the outside, they are covered in long, wirey, matted hair that's often full of plant and mold growth.  Nothing bothers to eat them because they are a gross, difficult, and almost pointless to eat.</p>
<p>edit:  Well, this blew up while I was out!  I'll mention that all I know about sloths I learned from the great Sir David Attenborough.  This is pretty much the source of my info <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLdzZWwxn7w" target="_blank">Mouldy Sloth: Amazing Animals</a> Also, don't miss <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ndMKTnSRsKM" target="_blank">David Attenborough : Saying Boo to a Sloth</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My entire life may have prepared me to answer this question. Like yourself, OP, I too was mystified by the sloth's ability to survive in the jungle. However my questions arose while I was living in the amazon when I was around 12 years old. We had already caught a few brought them back to the city and like clockwork every two months after surviving in our backyard haven they would one day fall out of a tree and die. So i decided to become an expert on sloths and read every available resource until it came to me. I wish I could recall the name of the author but it was a book hand drawn and written in the early 1900's dedicated to the sloth. It is because of these observations and hours of research that I have come to hate the sloth.</p>
<p>Sloths have no real defense other than absence of smell. Fungus/mold grows on them that basically gives them the same odor as trees. They sleep for 80% of the rest is spent mostly foraging for food.</p>
<p>Now after this is thought, wow, not much of a defense and the snakes, ocelots, piranhas etc. must get them as well. They must fuck like rabbits in order to survive! The female sloth has one baby at a time and because of the difficulty of mating which i will get into momentarily they will often go several years without bearing any young.... I'll let that sink in. Why the difficulty mating? Sloths are pretty much blind. On occasion they will spot each other moving in the same vicinity. One sloth will then pursue (Imagine a sloth chase for a second) however because of its tendency to take naps it will often fall asleep during this adventure. When it wakes up it will sometimes forget what it was doing and go back to foraging. Lets get back to the blind part, do you know how sloths tell each other apart? There is a patch of fur on its back that is a different color. Think for a second, an almost blind animal now on the unlikely chance that it has spotted a potential mate and remembered that it wanted to mate now has to get super close to make sure they aren't the same sex. Crazy and this happens in the jungle surrounded by predators. </p>
<p>I hope this answers your question in the same way mine was answered. I don't fucking know why there are so many of them and Darwin obviously got his whole survival of the fittest spiel wrong.</p>
<p>Bonus fact: Know how they travel long distances? They climb out onto a branch and fall into the river. Let the current take them somewhere and boom they are upstream. No idea why since they are super vulnerable in the water. Possible reason to travel could be after spending days trying to get laid to find out he was chasing after a dude. Hope this helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The easiest way to explain this is that sloths are very well adapted to their habitat. Sloths do have defense mechanisms but it does not result with physical altercations for defense, it in fact relies on being inconspicuous and remaining hidden. Camouflage is an excellent strategy to avoid predators, especially in a dense canopy rainforest. </p>
<p>Sloths have essentially evolved to develop a more complex digestive system instead of advanced and specialized muscles used for locomotion; a reason why sloths are slow. This specialized digestive system allows them to feed on the tough, leathery and otherwise toxic leaves that make up the forest canopy. They basically decreased their mobility in order to be able to eat a more diverse range of flora that other organisms cannot digest. This allows them to remain in the canopy for most of their time (why leave if you are hidden and also surrounded by a plentiful food source) until traveling to a new nearby tree. </p>
<p>The slow movement of sloths as a result of this reduction of muscles for locomotion promotes growth of algae on the fur of the sloth, which allows microorganism to live on the fur. This gives a greenish brown tinge to the fur which provides excellent camouflage from predators both above (aerial predators) and below (terrestrial predators). Slow movements and color that blends into the surrounding environment will decrease the chances of being located visually.  When these microorganisms (beetles, moths,etc) that live on the fur and algae die there is an increase in nitrogen content which allows the algae to remain growing. This provide continual camouflage and also seems to be a source of nourishment for the sloth (can eat the algae of fur if necessary for a quick snack). </p>
<p>Sloths are crypsis (camouflage) specialists and maintain  mutualistic relationships (two different organisms rely on each other) with algae (provides algae a place to grow while also using it as camouflage and sometimes food), microorganisms (allowing them to live on fur allows increase of algae nutrients) which allow this unique creature to thrive in the rainforest canopy despite their slow movements that would otherwise leave them extremely vulnerable on the ground. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
