		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a <em>lot</em> of misinformation going on in here. First off, antimicrobial soaps do <em>not</em> use alcohol to kill bacteria. They commonly use a chemical called <a href="https://illumin.usc.edu/68/what-makes-antibacterial-soap-antibacterial/" target="_blank">triclosan</a> which prevents bacterial growth by inhibiting their ability to make fatty acids. Since fatty acids are a critical component of all cells (specifically the cell membrane), most bacteria will be killed by exposure to triclosan. This, coupled with the fact that a majority of bacteria will be washed down the drain upon handwashing means that antimicrobial soap is effective in killing most bacteria.  </p>
<p>That said, it is absolutely true that bacteria that are not killed by this may be resistant to the toxic compound in antibacterial soap. In fact <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/5/43/" target="_blank">this report</a> outlines a case where a bacterium was literally living <em>inside</em> an antimicrobial soap dispenser and caused a deadly outbreak in a hospital. Although there is abundant evidence that organisms can resist triclosan, whether this has happened in response exposure to triclosan in a clinical setting is still <a href="http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/5/693.short" target="_blank">under debate</a> (evidence for this is very difficult to collect). </p>
<p>TL;DR: Very dangerous bacteria can be resistant to the toxic part of antimicrobial soap. Whether antimicrobial soap directly causes this to happen is still unclear.  </p>
<p>EDIT: Details about triclosan resistance, proper use of the term &quot;antimicrobial&quot;. Also, I appreciate the follow up questions. I don't want to speculate so if I don't know the answer I didn't respond - hopefully someone else can. It's very cool to see so many people interested in microbiology! </p>
<p>EDIT: I've gotten a lot of requests to make a definitive statement about whether triclosan use results in increased numbers of bacteria that are resistant to it on your hands. In the laboratory and the environment development of resistance is common. It stands to reason that the same would hold true on your hands and this is something that scientists are very worried about. I was really surprised that when I did a literature search there are essentially no studies that directly test that hypothesis. Since no one has really looked at it I don't think anyone knows how often it happens.</p>
<p>My sources for this for those of you who want to read them: <a href="http://jac.oxfordjournals.org/content/53/5/693.short" target="_blank">1</a> and <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2014.00780/full" target="_blank">2</a>. Let me know if you guys find anything cool that I missed.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>BS in bio, currently in grad school taking microbio. I'll try to fill in some gaps that I saw. There are 2 types of bacteria, residents and transients. Residents are the ones that are always there even after hand washing. It is because of residents, surgeons wear gloves for surgery. Transients are the ones that we &quot;pick up&quot; from touching literally anything. Transients are the target when humans wash their hands and the reason why surgeon wash their hands before surgery. Ever wonder why we are told to wash our hands with warm water? I used to wonder why warm water because wouldn't that help the bacteria multiply faster than cold water? While yes that is true, the warm water &quot;activates&quot;(increase the metabolic rate of the bacteria) so that the active ingredient can complete its mechanism.(break down the cell wall, target protein synthesis, etc) Washing our hands with soap is not only a chemical interaction between the soap and bacteria, but also, the mechanical process of &quot;scrapping off&quot; whatever was on our hand, which is why soaps are slippery. It is trying to compete with the stickiness of the bacteria trying to cling onto your hand. It is worth noting, soaps don't all use the same active ingredient. Just because a bacteria has resistance to one, doesn't mean that particular resistance will help the next time you wash your hands.</p>
<p>NERD ALERT(background info):
It is important to note that it has been estimated there are more bacterial cells than our own cells in/on our bodies. Most of these bacteria cause us no harm. There are 3 types of relationships. Mutualism where it's a win/win for both parties. E. coli in your gut is a good example. They get a home and an endless buffet. #'Murica. We get them to break down things in our digestive tract that we wouldn't be able to break down otherwise. Commensalism where the bacteria benefit and we humans as the host are unaffected, neither benefit or harmed. There are mites at the base of our eyelashes that feed on our sebaceous gland secretions. They get a home and food while nothing happens to us. Parasitism is the one where bacteria benefit and us as the host are harmed. This relationship is usually the one everyone thinks of when bacteria is mentioned.</p>
<p>/u/GermTheory already explained the active ingredient so I won't go into that any further.</p>
<p>There are at least 7 mechanisms of microbial resistance that we are aware of. This is most terrifying part for me. Let's say bacterium A is resistant to triclosan via one of the 7 ways granting it resistance. Bacterium A dies and its DNA starts to leak out into the environment. Bacterium B, that is not even the same species as bacterium A, can pick up a piece of DNA from the corpse of bacterium A that gives it resistance to a triclosan. </p>
<p>TL;DR Never swab and culture samples from everyday things like your hands or cellphone. Ignorance is bliss.</p>
<p>EDIT: Obligatory update to say thank you kind stranger!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked in hand hygiene/infection control for several years. The skin has two layers of microbes: those on the surface and those that are resident. Antibacterial agents remove the top layer, but in doing so, they may damage the skin, making it easier for &quot;bad&quot; bacteria to colonize the resident layer. </p>
<p>Everything is a trade-off of benefit. Alcohol-based products are very convenient and don't breed antibiotic resistance, but they are also the most destructive to the skin over time. So, clinicians use a variety of antibiotic soaps in addition and do what they can to manage skin damage/dermatitis. </p>
<p>We are seeing <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Health/superbug-outbreak-california-hospital-160-exposed/story?id=29071426" target="_blank">superbugs</a> emerge. These can rip through a hospital and kill multiple patients before anyone can even determine the source. All it takes is one antibiotic-resistant bacteria and a warm little crevasse in a piece of equipment. </p>
<p>Additionally, the FDA has <a href="http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm205999.htm" target="_blank">singled out triclosan for additional review</a>. There has been some evidence that this antibiotic is especially harmful to the immune systems of humans. However, we should all keep in mind that the job of a broad spectrum antibiotic is to <em>kill virtually all bacteria</em>.  We <em>need</em> bacteria in our bodies for a healthy immune system. When we use these types of cleansers, the damage is often not limited to only our hands. Our fingers go in our eyes, our nose, our mouth...</p>
<p>TLDR: antibacterial soap has significant issues. Don't use it unless you don't have a choice. Plain soap and water works fine for most people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the bacteria is harmless on our skin (think staph epi), but could be harmful if it gets in an open cut or into our bloodstream. But when we wash our hands, yes there is the .01% remaining which is millions of bacterial units. They confirm this by taking swab cultures and diluting ten-fold several times, and then seeing which culture plates grow bacteria. It is not undetectable. However the .01% remaining isn't more genetically resistant to the antibacterial soap - rather it is in a formation that is stays out of contact with the disinfectant. It's in a skin crevice, or protected by natural oils, or protected by its own colony. Bacterial colonies, when in large enough numbers, &quot;cling&quot; to surfaces and form an extracellular network of goop that can help protect the bacterial cells in it. This is what you call a biofilm. So when you wash your hands, all the &quot;free&quot; bacteria gets killed/removed, all the hidden/protected bacteria never come in contact with the disinfectant and their remain. It's not selectively choosing bacteria with better genetics, just the bacteria who happened to be in a certain formation at that time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biochemist here for eli5: Antibiotics are poisons. Small doses, high toxicity. If the bacteria evolves a protein to pump the toxins out, neutralize them, or minimize the damage through another means, it could live. That is what resistance is.</p>
<p>Hand sanitizer is like dissolving your body in acid. There is no resistance to &quot;your proteins are dissolved by alcohol&quot; because you can't evolve a protein that helps you. You are overwhelmed.</p>
<p>True, both types &quot;kill almost all bacteria&quot; but one requires one or two dedicated proteins to neutralize, and the other completely annihilates the bacteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
