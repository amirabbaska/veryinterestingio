		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone here is bringing up the griptape, which I believe is not as important as they make it seem. someone who can ollie on a gripped board can do it on a board with no griptape.</p>
<p>what happens is a skater bends his knees preparing for a jump, but on the way up he POPs the tail of the board against the ground and this would cause the board to fly upwards all willy nilly...</p>
<p>except the board is still under the skaters feet, so if he keeps the board level, it will only rise as high as the board can while under the skaters feet while he jumps.</p>
<p>its all about POPPING the board up in the air while you jump and keeping it level under you.</p>
<p>Edit: I understand that you need to slide you foot up to level the board out. Sorry I neglected to explain that aspect in detail
with practice you gain better control and you can make them go higher and look prettier. took me like 2 months to learn how to ollie, and then every other trick stems from that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grab a fork, put it flat on a table, prongs up.
Now whack the pronged end with a fist, decently hard.
The fork jumps right off the table!</p>
<p>The prong end being up is a lever, which you are pivoting around the fulcrum of the curve in the fork head, with the great force of your fist.  The pivot motion imparts enough momentum to the large mass of the fork handle that it carries the whole fork off the table.</p>
<p>Skateboard is the same.  The board's rear wheel is the fulcrum.  The board from rear wheel to tail is a short lever, that you put a huge force on when you jump.  The fulcrum lever raises the front with lots of momentum, and without the human on it anymore (you jumped off), that momentum carries the board right off the ground.</p>
<p>To make it clearer with a counter-example: if you had a skateboard where the wheels were exactly ON the ends of the board, it would be impossible to Ollie it.  The small lever formed by the wheels being slightly inward is key.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Skateboard instructor here:</p>
<p>When you Ollie (jump with the board following you) you are really doing a few things at the same time.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You, yourself, are jumping in the air</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You press on the tail (back of the board sticking out past the wheels) with significant force. This force pushes the front of the board upwards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While you and the front of the board are now above ground, using your front foot, you push forward.</p>
</li>
<li>This forward push combined with the upward momentum on the front of the board provides a rotation point to bring the back of board up.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the reference to grip tape. This just helps that forward push provide more energy transfer from your feet to the board. It can be done without it, but it's significantly easier with it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it as though the surface of the board is covered in sandpaper. It's all scratchy, right?</p>
<p>Now, pop a wheelie. The front of the board rises. The front of the board is now higher than the back of the board.</p>
<p>What the skater does next is, he jumps with the foot at the back, and at the same time, slides his other foot forwards. The friction of his foot on the 'sandpaper' surface of the board catches on it. And because of the angle and direction that the friction is being applied in (forwards!), this forces the back of the board to lift to try and be level and move forwards as well.</p>
<p>Get a piece of paper, and have it sit on the ground so that one edge is touching, and the other edge in the air. Now push your hand against the top of the paper in a sliding motion. If you get it just right, you can force the back edge of the paper to lift up so that the paper is flat, before it falls back to the earth.</p>
<p>This is what a skateboarder is doing with their feet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>imagine it this way: if you have a skateboard on the ground before you, and you step hard on one end its easy to imagine it would simply jump in the air. you do exactly the same thing when you ride on the board. with one foot you simply push very hard on one end so it takes off, while with the other foot you push on the other end down so that the jump is stable and you keep control</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
