<p>The exact number is unknowable without knowing the entire history of this part of the galaxy, which we can't. Based on the recent LIGO/VIRGO discovery with the NS-NS collission creating the r-process elements we know that whatever molecular cloud gave birth to our system had to be enriched from such a collission to have the abundance of r-process elements we see. It's possible that we are the results of the supernova of those two stars and then their subsequent merger alone in which case you'd be the result of 2 stars. It's more likely that there are traces from multiple supernova and possible even multiple mergers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

From what little I understand, not all the elements come from same star types, and humans contain several elements. So what is the minimum amount of stars needed to create all the necessary elements?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The interstellar medium mixes quite well. This means that the molecular cloud that the Sun (and other stars) formed from contained bits of elements from all over the place, plus some primordial stuff leftover from the Big Bang. It ends up being a similar question to &quot;which plants did the oxygen I'm breathing come from?&quot;, and I'm not sure if we can be any more specific than &quot;lots&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the only reasonable approach to this is in terms of &quot;generations&quot; of stars.  Since the universe entered its star-formation phase, the matter from each star will gradually spread out, and the space over which it spreads is also spreading out.  I'd say it's likely that every star in our galaxy, and whole galactic clusters, if not the entire observable universe, might contain traces of the same few early stars.</p>
<p>We can track the approximate evolution of star composition through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity" target="_blank">metallicity</a>, which is apparent in the light they produce.</p>
<p>The earliest stars we can see, at the edge of the observable universe are first-generation, &quot;population III&quot; stars, are from circa 800 MY, or 13 billion years ago.  <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2015/06/astronomers-spot-first-generation-stars-made-big-bang" target="_blank">[1]</a>  These stars are thought to generally be quite massive, and therefore short-lived, but that's not confirmed.</p>
<p>Individual stars have hugely different lifespans, from a few million to a few trillion years.  So a low-mass star of less than 0.1 solar masses formed 14 BYA might still be young today, while other stars might be thousands of generations old.  However, we don't see any very low-metallicity dwarf stars, so at least in the part of the universe we can see, those long-lived stars are all from later generations.</p>
<p>Getting back to your question, I'd estimate that the stars from which our atoms arose are somewhere on the order of 10-100 generations old.  Early on, when things were more dense, each stellar formation might have mixed the components of thousands or even millions of nearby stars.  Now things are more spread out, but so are the atoms from early stars.  Much of that mixing is of ejecta from a &quot;cousin&quot; star, though, which may not add very many to the total.  So, as a fairly wild estimate, I'd say that it's on the scale of millions, as opposed to thousands or billions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these answers are weak. Although, this question is impossible to answer in a strict way, isotope chemists have used the isotopic compositions of pre-solar grains to determine what kinds of stars have contributed matter to the nebula that the solar system formed from.</p>
<p>Different stars fuse elements in different ways. This results in differences in the ratio of isotopes in different stars. For example, some presolar grains contain large excesses of Carbon-13 and Nitrogen-14, which is indicative of AGB stars (red giant stars). Other presolar grains might contain large Oxygen-18 excesses, indicating derivation from supernova material. Our solar system is a mixture of materials from many different types of stars and sources, but it is not true that it is impossible to identify these sources.</p>
<p>edit: would love to see someone comment on this topic. I think it's one of the more exciting topics in isotope chemistry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
