		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ethanol (drinking alcohol) is metabolized by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase into acetaldehyde. The same enzyme then further metabolizes acetaldehyde into acetate. </p>
<p>Methanol (moonshine runoff) is metabolized into formaldehyde and then formic acid, by the same enzyme</p>
<p>Isopropyl alcohol (rubbing alcohol) is metabolized into acetone, again by alcohol dehydrogenase. </p>
<p>All of these metabolites are toxic. Acetaldehyde is partially responsible for hangovers, formic acid is responsible for blindness. </p>
<p>Edit: my mistake, the second step is by the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase. I'm a bit busy today but I'll answer what I can on mobile </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
