		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Has to do with the wavelength.  High frequencies have short wavelengths, small enough for the electromagnetic waves to pass through the empty space in the matter.  This is why high frequencies are damaging to living cells - the wavelength is literally short enough to pierce DNA like a knife, slicing it apart.</p>
<p>Low frequencies, like HF radio, have long enough wavelengths that they pass around objects like walls unimpeded, in the same way that a small rock sticking up from the ocean floor doesn't disrupt a large wave crashing into the shore.</p>
<p>Many frequencies have wavelengths that are too long to penetrate the spaces between atoms/molecules, but not long enough to pass around the entire object unimpeded.  So they get blocked.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thinking of a photon as a particle is something of a barrier to this discussion .  Instead, think of light as a wave providing a ‘kick’ to the electron in an atom as a rate related to its energy.  The macroscopic analogy would be pushing a kid on a swing.  But not the way you’d usually push a kid.  Instead you’re pushing the child from the front and then the back and then the front and so on.  It’s not a perfect analogy but it illustrates how resonance doesn’t create an effect for high and low frequency. </p>
<p>If you push back and forth too quickly the child doesn’t go anywhere since every little push forward is immediately canceled by a push backward.  This means that the light...  er...  adult pushing the child...  isn’t having any effect on the atom’s electrons...  er...  child.</p>
<p>By contrast,  if you push back an forth too slowly you’re equally likely to be pushing against motion as you are with the motion.  Again, no effect on the electron/child.</p>
<p>Only when the adult/light pushes forward when the child/election is moving forward and backward when the child/electron is moving backward does the swinging build up height.  This is resonance.</p>
<p>The analogy of a child in a swing isn’t perfect because the person pushing has their own internal energy source (chemical entry from food). For electrons in matter, if there’s a build up of motion in the electron then that energy has to come somewhere.  The source of this energy is a reduction in the electromagnetic field’s energy which you think of as the light being absorbed by the material.  More material means more absorption, but only if the material can interact with the field at just the right rate.</p>
<p>TL;DR - if the electromagnetic field jiggles electrons too quickly or too slowly they won’t respond with an increase in motion which means the light passes right through.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Low frequencies dont do this. If the wave lenght is bigger than tge ibject it will simply ignore it, if its smaller, it will bounce and can go around it. If the frequency is too high the lenght is so small it goes through the gaps in the atoms and molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
