		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Med student here. The topvoted answers don't tell the whole truth. There are two reasons as to why pain is delayed/inhibited. <br><br>ELI5:<br><br>The first is that the inflammatory process takes time. It takes time for pain-inducing chemicals to be produced/released and for these to affect nerves, by activating them.<br><br>The second reason is that your body has a store of molecules that can be released in the spinalcord in stressful situations, which actually have a pain-dampening effect. They block pain-signals travelling to the brain, making you unaware of the pain. When the stressful situation is over and the effect of the inhibitory molecules passes, you will be made aware of the pain<br><br><br>NOT ELI5:<br><br>Reason 1: Inflammatory mediators need to be released and/or created by inflammatory cells, and need to make their way to nerve endings. Histamine for example, also causes the blood vessels to increase in permeability, effectively making exudate from the blood flow into the tissue. The increased swelling in the tissue also presses on nerves (nociceptors - sensory nerves that carry pain signals), activating them which also leads to pain, once the signal reaches the brain.<br><br>As a fight or flight response the following happens:<br><br>Reason 2: Basically what happens when you dont feel pain at the actual time of injury is your body releasing inhibitory neurotransmittors (endorphins (endogenous morphines), GABA, noradrenaline etc) in the spinal cord which inhibits pain signals travelling up to the brain, and hence less, if any, pain signals reach the brain, making you unaware of the pain. <br><br>Edit: Added another reason for pain inhibition. These two reasons combined explain why we don't feel pain at the exact time of injury.<br><br>Edit: Added a basic version (ELI5)</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

To clear things up, they are chemicals your body makes in response to the injury that help to speed up healing (they recruit things that stop bleeding, encourage tissue regeneration and protect your body from infection) but as a side effect, also cause pain. This pain is thought to be a beneficial side effect as it prevents you from using the injured body part and possibly causing further damage to an already vulnerable site.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Pain is weird. <br><br>There's nothing at the injury site itself that <em>hurts</em>. It's all in your brain. Nerves at the site of the injury send signals up about what's going on, and then the brain sorts it out. The brain actually integrates a ton of information very quickly, including memories of past &quot;pain&quot; signals in particular locations and the consequences (severe injury, major illness, nothing particularly bad). It also integrates what you're doing at the time, and in the instant it seems to dampen pain perception so you can make sure you're not in further danger. It also changes over time, and can hurt more later, when you're reliably out of danger, so that you take care of the area and don't use it so it can heal and avoid further injury.<br><br>Pain is essentially your brain's <em>opinion</em> about what's going on with your body. It can be seriously out of step with the actual state of damage of a particular area.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Gate theory. If you were to actually feel and experience all the senses your body is capable of feeling at once youd be pretty over loaded. So you only take in a few things at once. Say you were playing soccer, got kicked in the shin without shin pads but you were more focused on getting the ball in the goal. Youd quickly forget about that kick and then may or may not remember why you have a bloody scar  on your shin later at night. If you broke your shin on the other hand your mind would quickly turn to focusing on that and the rush of trying to get the ball to the goal would go away.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Heroin is an opiate, the natural compound you are looking for here is endorphins rather than dopamine. Endorphins are released after some injuries, but this occurs more often during 'resolution period' of the injury or inflammation <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6152/1394.abstract?related-urls=yes&amp;amp;legid=sci;341/6152/1394" target="_blank">source</a>, so it is unlikely that the release of endorphin is the cause of not feeling the pain until later.<br><br>Another possibility is that upon inflammation/injury in both the periphery or the central nervous system, a variety of chemicals are released from the injured tissue. These chemicals can be either pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1933721309002177" target="_blank">source</a>. The balance of pro vs. anti inflammatory mediators are important for gating pain perception i.e. if you have more anti-inflammatory chemicals you will feel less pain. As these inflammatory chemicals are produced and release pretty much right after the injury, this is more likely the explanation for OP's question. <br><br>And just to throw this out there, pain is a complex sensory experience that encompass both physiological and emotional aspects, meaning, how you feel can gate pain perception. A well known mechanism is via <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008209000574" target="_blank">descending pain modulation</a>, whereby stress can activity descending inhibitory signals to spinal cord pain circuits, to dampen down pain signals that are incoming from the injured site. I speculatively threw this out because stress can also <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301008214000707" target="_blank">enhance pain perception</a>, as well as inhibiting pain signals. This is however, only one example of how we are doing emotionally can affect pain perception. If anyone is interested in knowing more feel free to PM me. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>In most cases the pain is derived from the knowledge of the incident not the actual incident itself, its mental. <br><br>Think of it this way, how many times have you noticed an injury you have no idea how it got there but now that you notice it it hurts like hell, how did I not notice this before with all this pain? <br><br>Well that is because a good portion of the pain we feel is mental and only derives because we think its supposed to hurt. <br><br>Like when a baby is hurt, they typically don't start crying until they see someone freaking out because the baby got hurt. They are not crying because it hurt, they are crying because the reaction from the adult is not a reaction they have so crying is the next closest thing. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Initial cell damage releases various chemicals (bradykinin, 5-ht, histamine, prostaglandins) which will stimulate nociceptors. These will send initial signals via nociceptors to the dorsal horn in the spinal cord where they synapse with other neurons than will be transmitted to the brain. <br><br>Here's the catch though; in the spinal cord there are pain modulatory pathways from the pons and medulla that will INHIBIT pain transmission to the brain from the spinal cord by releasing neurotransmitters (endorphins, enkephalins, glutamate, etc.). The pain signals have to overcome inhibition from these endogenous peptides before the signal can reach the brain. <br><br>Back at the site of injury, substance P and histamines, changes in pH, potassium, etc. act to cause and sensitize the nociceptors (can take some time), causing more action potentials which will overwhelm the inhibitory transmissions in the CNS. <br><br><br><br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

There was a women who fell off a cliff and lived, but shattered her legs and pelvis but before she was rescued she felt barely any pain. she also dragged herself to be found by another hiker. Adrenaline is good for blocking out pain, but its only temporary. The only way a human being could of endured that pain and be rescued would have her brain stop the flow of pain signals, or at least dimish it. She said she knew she was hurt, but all she was concentrated on was being found. When that moment  she was found, her agnozing pain came to her as it was not important to pain block anymore. The brain does funky shit.<br><br>When it comes to small cuts/bruises, it depends where on the body. If your right next to a nerve , yeah you bet your ass your going to feel it.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Our bodies produce opioids (called endogenous opioids)just like an opioid medication (exogenous opioids) that you'd take from a pill bottle. When you're injured, those endogenous opioids are sent out and attach to the opioid receptors to decrease the pain you feel. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

There have been plenty of times that I have cut or burned myself and it has not hurt until I noticed it.  I  bet our brains are hardwired to feel the pain.

Cortisol is a strong inhibitor for pain receptors in your brain (in the short term). <br><br>This is why you hear stories of people in a shoot out only realizing they've been shot a few minutes after its ended.<br><br>I've experienced this personally while rock climbing a particularly hairy route.

That's why the free nerve endings involved in pain move slowly. And when the pain does kick in, that is to remind you to take it easy and recover.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>People who work with hot shit all the time either get used to it or kill off nerves or something. I worked in a kitchen once, and these ladies who had been there for years would stick their hands in the dish tubs full of HOT water. To me it felt like it would cause and instant 2nd degree burn. No way in hell I was doing it, but for them it was no problem. Another experience, one of the student nurses caring for my wife after one of our kids was born seemed to have a lot of trouble taking a pulse. She shared with us that her family owned a laundry and since she was a kid had spent many  hours folding cloths hot off the steam press and this had deadened the feeling in her finger tips. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>sometimes it can come down to simply Adrenalin and it takes a bit of time for its affects to ware off so only then do you feel the full affects of the pain. an example would be you go dirt biking fall off and walk away when you wake up the next morning because your system has been flushed of the adrenaline you ache like a bitch compared to when you just fell off.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>During injury chemical mediators are released either by damaged tissue or white blood cells in the site attempting repair (ie free potassium ions, bradykinin, substance P, etc) that serve to &quot;hyper-sensitize&quot; pain nerve endings. This mechanism is thought to be an evolutionary adaptation which would prevent re-injury and allow for healing. Think of a sprained ankle: the pain prevents use of the ankle and allows for rest/repair. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Bruises or injuries I haven't noticed until hours later usually occur in a few particular situations: when I would get in fights at school (not really the kind of thing that happens these days), when I exercised (running, ice skating, swimming, dance, whatever), or when I attended an energetic concert and got bruised in the moshpit by the guy next to me. <br><br>What all of these things have in common is that they are <em>active</em> situations where you get lost in the moment. I would speculate that the adrenaline rush is what cancels out the sensation of pain so that you don't notice a scar or a bruise until the next day or so. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
