Space is made up of a small, very countable, number of hydrogen atoms per cubic meter and some larger number of mobile particles like neutrinos and photons, though due to their nature, they do not change the properties of the vacuum that is space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Vacuum&quot; is a relative term. On astronomical scales, you can think of interstellar space as just a very very thin gas. There aren't many particles in it - 100 hydrogen atoms per cubic centimetre would be considered a dense region - but there's enough that over very large scales, it actually acts like a gas that flows and has pressure and everything.</p>
<p>This is important, because it's part of the &quot;life-cycle&quot; of stars. Rather than thinking of stars as lonely spheres in a vacuum, you can think of them as just one of the phases of interstellar gas, amongst many other interconnected phases. It almost behaves like an <em>atmosphere</em> or a <em>climate</em>.</p>
<p>Within the Milky Way, most of the volume is hot gas at around 10,000 K. This gas is heated by the radiation from stars, and from being stirred up by supernovae. Because the gas is so stirred up, parts of it are denser than other parts. Dense gas can cool more efficiently, because there are more interactions between particles. It also shields itself from radiation from stars. So dense cool gas tends to get colder, which means the pressure goes down, which means it gets denser etc.</p>
<p>What happens here is that you get a molecular cloud - a big cloud of cold hydrogen. But it's not a completely isolated thing - it's surrounded by warmer &quot;atomic&quot; gas around it. And within the molecular cloud, some gas will continue to collapse into little globules. These globules will form stars - a little &quot;open cluster&quot; of new stars in the same area. These stars will heat up, blow away, and ionise the gas in the molecular cloud, dispersing the gas back into the general mix of interstellar gas.</p>
<p>But even after this, stars continue to interact with the surrounding gas, with winds and radiation heating and stirring up the interstellar gas medium. As stars are fusion reactors that gradually build up heavier elements, these winds will carry these heavy elements into interstellar space, which means that later stars will be formed from a mix of gas that includes more heavy elements. Massive stars will even go supernova, throwing large amounts of heavy elements into interstellar space, and stirring up the gas dramatically. So it's not stars existing in a complete vacuum - it's really stars moving through a medium and interacting with it.</p>
<p>This even happens on a galaxy scale. Supernovae and winds from stars can cause gas to flow out of the galaxy, where gravity either causes it to rain back down in a &quot;galactic fountain&quot;, or for particularly strong outflows, the gas escapes completely. Galaxies exist within massive haloes of hot gas (like a million degrees), and when a dwarf galaxy moves through the hot halo of a more massive galaxy, the pressure can cause the dwarf galaxy to lose its gas and shut off its star formation. This is particularly dramatic in big galaxy clusters, where almost all of the gas is in a giant shared halo, and most galaxies have had most of their gas stripped off by their motion through this &quot;atmosphere&quot;.</p>
<p>I know this wasn't <em>quite</em> the answer you were looking for, but I think it is good to realise that space isn't quite as much of a vacuum as people tend to think. It often really is better to think of it as a very very thin gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The expression is 'nature abhors a vacuum' - which sounds like that state might be prohibited by the laws of physics. But it's not that extreme, it's just that a vacuum near a not-vacuum usually leads to a flow of matter so that the vacuum no longer exists.</p>
<p>On Earth, there's plenty to wipe out any vacuums that occasionally exist. But in space, there's not enough stuff to fill them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is still plenty of stuff around even between planets and even between stars. Its just going down a few orders of magnitude everytime we get further away from a source of particles.</p>
<p>If we compare the pressures:</p>
<p>Atmospheric pressure at sea level   10^3 mbar</p>
<p>Low earth Orbit     10^-8 to 10^-10 mbar</p>
<p>Surface of the Moon 10^-12 mbar</p>
<p>Outer space 10^-21 mbar</p>
<p>Between planets is quite a bit higher thanouter space because the sun is steadily giving you loads of new particles (via solar wind) - you got mustly hydrogen atoms flying around there. </p>
<p>Near planets, you basically got everything their atmosphere is made of, just a few million / billion times less dense.</p>
<p>Just as comparison, you can get a pressure in the lab like in Leo pretty easily without a lot of effort (just a turbomolecular pump with some bakeout will do it fine), and with a lot of effort you can get better than on the surface of the moon (but we are speaking here about multi $100k investments for the aperatus).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also you can get really close to a perfect vacuum with ion pumps. Once you pump down a pressure vessel to near perfect vacuum (takes 24-48 hours on the proton accelerator I worked on) then you can use ion pumps to pull out the random &quot;bouncing&quot; particles (atoms, molecules etc) left over that didn't get pumped out. Given a long enough time, you will get a vacuum so pure it's pretty much unmeasurable. The vacuum we had was classified under &quot;extremely high vacuum&quot; &gt;10^-12 torr, similar to space. Pretty cool stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
