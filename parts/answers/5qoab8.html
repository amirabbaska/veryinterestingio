		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to /u/gammbus's comment:</p>
<p>Rhine's work on ESP was very high profile at the time, at a respected university (Duke), and was supposedly done by careful scientific method with good statistical analysis -- the methodology was in fact deeply flawed in many ways, but that wasn't obvious at the time.</p>
<p>(After years of thorough critique, much more careful later experiments and analysis were unable to statistically replicate Rhine's positive results.)</p>
<p>Because of this, a lot of scientifically-minded people at the time were at least open minded about Rhine's work, who otherwise would have dismissed the subject out of hand.</p>
<p>A minor example of this is in Robert Heinlein's works; he mostly did very hard science fiction (adhering carefully to known science and engineering), but some of his stories take Rhine's work at face value -- that's not an indication of Heinlein's beliefs, just an example of Rhine being part of the zeitgeist of the time.</p>
<p>Anyway considering how high profile Rhine was back then, I agree that it is extremely likely that this is what Turing had in mind.</p>
<p>And the above context perhaps explains why someone like Turing would be influenced by &quot;obvious pseudo-science&quot;.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's in situations like these I like to point to James Randi, I am paraphrasing:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Anyone, no matter how smart or educated, can be tricked and it's impossible to know when the person being tricked is you. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would also point to his biopic on Netflix called An Honest Liar in which they describe how he and two teenaged boys convinced a whole team of Stanford (if I recall correctly) researchers into believing the boys had psychic powers, despite Randi giving them solutions to defeat the tricks. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>You have to consider though that even today a lot of people believe in pseudoscience and 70 years ago that number must have been well over 50%.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to the president of the American statistics foundation, statistics Professor <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~jutts/" target="_blank">Jessica Utts</a>  who published <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~jutts/air.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> about the statistical evidence on psychic functioning.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Using the standards applied to any other area of science, it is concluded that psychic functioning has been well established.
The statistical results of the studies examined are far beyond what is expected by chance.  Arguments that these results could be due to methodological flaws in the experiments are soundly refuted.  Effects of similar magnitude to those found in government-sponsored research at SRI and SAIC have been replicated at a number of laboratories across the world.  Such consistency cannot be readily explained by claims of flaws or fraud.</p>
