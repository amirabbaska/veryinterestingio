But generally speaking if the animal is swallowed whole while still alive it will suffocate first and then be broken down by the digestive system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On planet earth , a big pelican swallows a chick (forget the species) then flies back to its nest(1 hour flight) and regurgitated the chick back up <em>still alive</em> for the baby pelicans to tear apart. </p>
<p>I felt kinda bad for the prey chick , it was alive for an hour inside a pelicans before it was eaten.</p>
<p>EDIT : Life by BBC episode 5 , not Planet Earth series.</p>
<p>UPDATE: The episode is available on canadian Netflix at least. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many fish have pharyngeal or &quot;throat&quot; teeth that are used to grind up prey. You can usually see a cloud of blood/scales exit the gills of the fish when the grinding begins. I am pretty sure this is the direct cause of death for many of those prey items.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the case of snakes, it’s either envenomated, and so it’s dead when eaten, or constricted to the point the lights go out due to lack of oxygen to the brain.</p>
<p>Some species actually crush prey against an object in the environment, like indigo sakes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Owls swallow most prey whole and crush it in their gizzards.</p>
<p>This is different from many Falcons, such as the Peregrine which has a tomial tooth, a small point in their beak, which breaks the spine of a bird after it is caught. They are awesome because they can catch, kill, feather, and eat a dozen birds before it even lands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
