		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our eyes work best when the image on the retina isn't moving. It's just like taking a picture in the dark: if the camera moves during the exposure, the picture comes out all blurry. It's also more difficult to process a video where objects are moving all over the place. Eyes have evolved to track whatever it is you're looking at, so the image of that is stationary.</p>
<p>If you're looking at a moving object, that means moving smoothly to keep it in one spot on your retina. If you're scanning different parts of the scene, that means moving in quick jumps called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" target="_blank">saccades</a>. In between saccades the image is stationary.</p>
<p>Also of note is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vestibulo–ocular_reflex" target="_blank">vestibulo–ocular reflex</a>. That's a very quick reflex to cancel out head movements, again to provide a much more stable image. Say, if you look at the gold icon up there and shake your head, it doesn't move much at all. Even if you go overboard it's an enormous improvement. (Thanks to whoever put it there!)</p>
<p>P.S. /u/shaggorama pointed out that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsaccade" target="_blank">microsaccades</a> are necessary to maintain an image. The retina detects changes in light and would go blank if presented an entirely stationary image for a while. Microsaccades 'refresh' the retina without moving the eye as much as regular saccades. They're still quick jerks providing a succession of stationary images, not smooth motion. The point is not to take my post to mean eyes ideally want no movement <em>at all</em>; they do need regular change. I thought it would be distracting to mention this in ELI5 but here it is. <a href="/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/50spo8/eli5_why_can_our_eyes_only_move_in_a_smooth/d76ymtv" target="_blank">shaggorama's own explanation</a> and a <a href="/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/50spo8/eli5_why_can_our_eyes_only_move_in_a_smooth/d7756dj" target="_blank">sourced rebuttal</a> re the refractory period being the cause.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have not seen an answer that actually walks through the two distinct pathways (saccades and smooth pursuit) so let me explain:</p>
<p>I'm assuming when you say &quot;our eyes only move in a smooth motion when tracking an object&quot; to mean what is known as smooth pursuit. The brain is wired very differently to handle this kind of information as opposed to &quot;thinking&quot; about moving the eyes. So let me break it down:</p>
<p>Smooth pursuit/smooth motion: You tell your brain you want to follow an object. Light hits the back of your eye. That information goes to the back of your brain. The back of your brain transmits that information to areas in the brain that control eye movement. Your eyes move depending on how the object moves.</p>
<p>Saccades/Jerky motion: You tell your brain you want your eyes to move to a certain location. That signal (from the executive, most highest parts of the brain) gets transmitted to the areas of the brain that control eye movement. Eye moves.</p>
<p>See the difference? The difference is that with smooth pursuit, you rely on direct sensory stimuli, while saccades do not. Of course you have other visual cues that your brain relies on constantly when performing saccades, but in essence, you are commanding your eyes to move a certain way. Brain says &quot;eyes please move here&quot; vs brain saying &quot;eyes, please follow an object.&quot; Two very different circuits. This is why if you take two finger a yard apart and try to do smooth pursuit, you can't. You end up only doing saccades (You do not have that sensory stimuli to focus on!) This is also why the vesibulo-ocular reflex works: because you have a visual point to focus on. Your brain just does the rest to adjust your eye muscles in a way to fixate on a point.</p>
<p>There are other types of eye movements such as microsaccades but those are involuntary movements for maintaining images, not really voluntary movements.</p>
<p>Hope this answers your question!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our ancient ancestors needed to track fast-moving targets either as predator or as prey, and while we have six muscles controlling the eye (more than, say, a cow, which only has four), the parts of our brain that allow us to track movement (The frontal pursuit area, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_colliculus" target="_blank">superior colluculis</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pons" target="_blank">pons</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebellum" target="_blank">cerebellum</a>) are actually anticipating the moving object ever-so-slightly, as our eyes would lag behind otherwise. Because we're basically 'leading' the target slightly, an unexpected change in momentum means your eye zigs right for a brief fraction of a second while the target zags left, requiring us to re-acquire the target. </p>
<p>Interestingly, people with schizophrenia or autism often have a deficit in this kind of 'smooth pursuit'. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
