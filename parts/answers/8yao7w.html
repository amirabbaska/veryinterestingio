		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would someone be so nice as to explain in laymen terms what this discovery is and potential ways this new discovery could be applied?  New technologies? Or is it just a new way of observing the universe?</p>
<p>Would very much appreciate it!  Sounds exciting but to be honest I'm kind of lost.  Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wondered what &quot;Multi-messenger astronomy&quot; was and looked it up.  For the edification of other layman scientists:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-messenger_astronomy" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-messenger_astronomy</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Multi-messenger astronomy is astronomy based on the coordinated observation and interpretation of disparate &quot;messenger&quot; signals. The four extrasolar messengers are electromagnetic radiation, gravitational waves, neutrinos, and cosmic rays.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So cool! Has there been an exhaustive negative search by LIGO for events during the detection window?</p>
<p>I guess the ultimate dream would be: LIGO, IceCube, FermiLAT, and Pierre Auger (or their equivalents) all detecting stuff at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
