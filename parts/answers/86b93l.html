		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to pull out IV's, however it also depends how well they are secured. The IV tube is wrapped around the hand/thumb and taped so if it gets caught, it doesn't yank it out of the vein. </p>
<p>The IV catheter is also usually taped at the hub and then further secured with a sticky transparent film (Tegaderm is a brand-name product for example). See this picture: <a href="https://thephotochik.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_4019.jpg" target="_blank">https://thephotochik.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/img_4019.jpg</a></p>
<p>If they're yanked out, there is a chance for bleeding which will be controllable with simple direct pressure for a few minutes. The bigger risk would be infection and bruising from improper removal and not keeping the site clean.</p>
<p>When I'm removing the IV catheter from someone, I'll gently pull it from the hub, not from the tubing because there's a lot more control that way. I'll also have gauze ready to control bleeding.</p>
<p>For breathing tubes/intubation, you'd have a very hard time simply yanking them out as these both have inflatable bulbs on the tube which help create an airtight seal and to help stabilize the airway:
Here is an example of a &quot;King LT&quot; advanced airway.

<p>If the bulb/cuff was not deflated prior to pulling it out, it could cause very severe airway trauma.</p>
<p>Finally, Foley catheters (for collecting urine) are similar to the airway adjuncts in the sense they have an inflatable cuff that MUST be deflated prior to being removed. If it is not deflated and simply yanked out, it will cause severe trauma.</p>
<p>As far as the cardiac monitors, these are simply just stuck on with electrodes and will either come off from the clip to the electrode or the sticker will just pull off. These are no big deal, however these wires are stupid expensive and I would advise to not simply yank on them. If they are disconnected, then there may or may not be an alarm at the monitor/nurses station indicating there is a problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The IVs are probably not a big deal. They’re mostly fluids and medication that can’t be administered orally. You would likely just need a few bandaids. The breathing tube and catheter, though..... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can confirm woke up from coma after 42 days and repeatedly ripped all tubes out over the next lucid three days. Issue was I would not realize where I was, and the complications were the tubes issued medicines or measured vital signs, ripped tubes out of veins so many times they had to start using veins in my legs</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One time I was hospitalized from drinking too much. I was still drunk when I woke up and tried to sneak out of the hospital and ripped out the IV, the nurse caught me trying to run away lol.
She made me get back to my bed and called my friends to pick me up and proceeded to tell them I sucked my thumb the whole time and that I asked for a pacifier (I doubt I really did), they still make fun of me for that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
