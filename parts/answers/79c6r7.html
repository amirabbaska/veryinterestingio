		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Film noir is a genre of movies from the 1940's and 1950's.  These movies were pessimistic, gritty, and dark (noir is French for dark).  The characters, even the protagonists, were often corrupt in some form, such as being alcoholics, lonely, or depressed.  Common characters were corrupt policemen and corrupt politicians.  The plot was often crime based, such as police or a private investigator trying to solve a crime.  The protagonist would often fail to accomplish his goals during the movies, sometimes thwarted by a femme fatale, or by a friend he trusted.  The cinematography would be dark and menacing, for example, a dark and smoky alley in a big but empty city.  Movies like <em>Double Indemnity</em> and the <em>Malatese Falcon</em> are examples of film noir.</p>
<p>Neo-noir is a modern recreation of those movies.  It follows the same theme is a noir film, but was made after the 1950's.  Movies like <em>Chinatown</em> and <em>LA Confidential</em> are set in the time period of noir films (the 30's, 40's, and 50s), but were made outside of that time period.  <em>Blade Runner</em> has the theme of a noir film, but set in the future.  Other example is <em>Who framed Roger Rabbit</em>, which is a noir film set in the 50's, but has cartoon characters.</p>
<p>In short, if a movie has dark cinematography, corrupt protagonists, an unsolvable mystery or conflict, and if the villains wins or at least force to the &quot;good guys&quot; to do bad things, then it is noir.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the 1930s, the Motion Picture Association of America introduced the Hays Code, self-imposed standards of decency.  They were fairly strict, not just in terms of thing like nudity, vulgar language or violence.  There was a whole list of things like ridicule of the clergy, sympathy for criminals, and miscegenation, that movies were not allowed to show.  The good guys were supposed to be morally upstanding, the bad guys were supposed to twirl their mustaches and tie damsels to railroad tracks, and at the end, good triumphs over evil.</p>
<p>Film noir in many ways was a revolt against this, pushing those boundaries as far as they could go.  The protagonist is flawed and morally ambiguous, the villains are often sympathetic, and sometimes it is hard to tell between the two.  As the movie progresses, dark secrets are revealed and at the end of the movie, there are not victors, only survivors.</p>
<p>Visually, they tend to have a dark and gritty sense of realism.  Lots of shadows, meetings in grimy back alloy or smoky backrooms of seedy nightclubs.  They men are hardboiled drinkers prone to violence and the women are venomous seductresses with hidden agendas, all living in an imperfect world with few happy endings.</p>
<p>Even though the Hays code is long gone, many movies have noir elements.  Any plot driven movie with flawed central character search for the truth on the wrong side of the tracks can be considered noir.  <em>Bladerunner</em> certain qualifies, as do a lot of the Coen brother's movies.  I would not consider <em>The Matrix</em> to be noir, it was too special effect driven, too fantastic, and the central character doesn't really have a dark side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Noir is genre that usually focuses on crime, usually murder motivated by revenge and/or greed. The plots are often hard to follow and involve flashbacks, unreliable narrators, false leads, and other such things. The endings are usually bittersweet at best.</p>
<p>The main character is often male, and either somebody investigating the central crime, or has been falsely accused of it. Very rarely will they have actually committed it, and in the cases where they have, they usually don't know it until late in the movie. The main character is also generally not a &quot;good guy&quot; in the traditional sense of the word. Female characters are usually either equally cynical femme fatales, or young and naive. Cops and politicians (excluding the main character, if they are either) are usually corrupt and may even be involved in the crime. The villain is often someone of authority, or somebody very close to the victim; jealous husbands are quite common, for example.</p>
<p>Stylistically, they're usually very visually dark a few bright objects to contrast. A lot of the movie will take place at night, there are lots of very obvious shadows, odd camera angles, etc. They were most popular back in the black and white film days, but even color ones will use predominantly dark colors accentuated with a few bright ones here and there.</p>
<p>Like any genre, these are more trends than hard rules that all film noir has to follow. </p>
<p>Neo-noir is a bit harder to pin down, it mostly seems to refer to modern films that borrow themes and styles from film noir. So in that sense, it's less of a genre and more of a way to describe movies that borrow use some elements of noir. Blade Runner is a great example: </p>
<p><strong>BLADE RUNNER SPOILERS</strong></p>
<p>The male lead is a cynical cop investigating a crime (not technically murder but murder is involved) that ends up being all about revenge. Female lead is a femme fatale, and also doesn't know she's a replicant. The story can be hard to follow at times due to involving deception and the POV character beng unaware of a lot of things. Visually, the setting is very dark, but with bright neon lights in places. There are a lot of shadows and odd camera angles.</p>
<p><strong>END SPOILERS</strong></p>
<p>Of course, there are other ways that these elements can be used, as well as entirely different ones, which is why many movies that can be describe as neo-noir can be wildly different. For example, The Dark Knight could be described as neo-noir for it's dark themes, focus on crime, pessimistic tone, cynical investigator main character, corrupt cops and politicians, etc. Yet it's a very different movie from Blade Runner.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add in a small detail - film noir wasn't explicitly produced as a &quot;genre&quot;, in the way that Hollywood studios at the time would make, say, a Western or a Musical. For Westerns and Musicals and other genres, the studios intentionally set out to make easily categorizable films that were similar in theme and style to other successful films, so that fans of that genre would go see new movies each week. </p>
<p>Conversely,  Noir was a term used originally by French critics to describe a tendency that they were noticing in American films (which began screening more frequently in European cinemas after WWII) that seemed to expand on the style and themes of French Poetic Realism in the '30s and '40s. That's why it's a lot trickier to define in explicit terms, because &quot;noir&quot; films were labelled as such after the fact, rather than intentionally produced as a distinct genre. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's always a lot of debate on what noir is. So much so that it comes up on every noir panel at every mystery con. It's reached the point where it's kind of a joke and people roll their eyes and say things like, &quot;French for black.&quot;</p>
<p>I've had my view of it challenged and changed and that's affected my writing and what I focus on. So I think it's an important question.</p>
<p>Chris Holm, an excellent thriller and noir author (also did a noir UF series called The Collector through Angry Robot - you should check it out, it's excellent) put it the most succinctly of anyone I've heard. &quot;Poor options, bad decisions, dire consequences.&quot;</p>
<p>There's a difference between noir and hard-boiled that I think gets overlooked a lot. Chandler is hard-boiled, Hammett is hard-boiled (though maybe not his RED HARVEST, but I'm on the fence with that one). Thompson and Goodis are noir. Macbeth is so goddamn noir it should have its own tropes page (ambition, murder, a femme fatale, blackmail, backstabbing, guilt, everything falls apart, a violent end).</p>
<p>Hardboiled characters are, as another author, Megan Abbott put very well, tarnished knights. They are good people in bad situations who walk through the muck and come out the other side intact. Philip Marlowe might be more cynical and jaded at the end of The Big Sleep, but he's still largely the same good person he was at the beginning. Sam Spade is rougher around the edges, darker and more morally ambiguous, but he's the same way. Hard-boiled characters operate within the seediness but remain largely untouched by it.</p>
<p>But noir characters. They're fucked from the word go. They might survive, but they'll survive changed, probably broken. Even if they win they lose.</p>
<p>Noir characters are doomed and they're often doomed by their own hand. Walter Neff in Double Indemnity is a perfect example. &quot;Yes, I killed him. I killed him for money - and a woman - and I didn't get the money and I didn't get the woman.&quot; He's backed the wrong horse. And Phyllis Dietrichson, the femme fatale, who's using him, and he KNOWS he's being used and he goes along with it anyway, is just playing him. And in the end, they gun each other down.</p>
<p>More tragic is when it's bad decisions for the right reasons and it all goes to shit, anyway. Take John Rector's THE COLD KISS about a young couple trying to escape a bad situation and run into a hitchhiker who pays them $500.00 for a ride, only to die in their backseat with a fuckton of money. They could report it, let it go, give the cops the money and walk away. But they've got a baby on the way. They're trying to make a new life. They're stuck in a motel in Nebraska in a blizzard and that money could really com in handy. But they should really do something about this corpse.</p>
<p>You can probably guess how that turns out.</p>
<p>The weird thing about noir, though, is how hopeful it is. It's surprisingly optimistic. Noir characters are driven by hope and optimism. I know that sounds weird, but think about it. These characters are doomed. They can't be anything BUT doomed. It's who they are. It's in their DNA. So why don't they just roll over and give up? Because they have hope. They might be screwed, they might even know they're screwed, but they can't let it go. That hope's too tenacious.</p>
