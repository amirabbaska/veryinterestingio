		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The maximum hair length is determined by the length of the <em>anagen</em> (the period when hair growth occurs). This is different for each individual. Longer hair is possible only for people with a longer anagen. Typically this period lasts between 2 and 7 years. For some people it's longer. When the anagen period is over, the catagen or transitional phase begins. This lasts for about two weeks after which the telogen or resting phase begins. After the resting phase is over (after about one to four months) the hair will fall out. This is considered normal hair loss and you probably notice it every day. </p>
<p>So to answer your question, yes, there is a maximum, but it's drastically different from person to person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to approach the question from a very different direction, just for funsies. Human hair has a diameter of 17 to 181 µm, let's use 181 µm. The only density estimate I can find is 0.62 mg for a 4.5&quot; sample of hair (from &quot;Biomonitoring of Mercury Exposure with Single Human Hair Strand&quot;). Lastly, Wikipedia gives us a value of 10 MPa for the ultimate tensile strength of human hair.</p>
<p>If we put this all together, I'm finding that a single strand of hair could reach <strong>4832 m</strong> (about 3 miles) in length before failing under tensile load.</p>
<p>Edit - Assuming we're on Earth, that is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is theory and there is reality.  In reality, the person with the longest hair was a Chinese woman who was verified by the Guinness book of world records in 2004 at about 18.5 feet.  I found one source that said she died in 2010 with her hair at 22ft.  I found another article about an Indian guy who claims to have 62 feet of hair, but that has not been verified. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is there any way then, to help promote hair growth? Specifically beard growth? I'm sure we've all seen adds for something like Dollar Beard Club's beard growth balm/oil/formula whatever you'd like to call it, but I've been skeptical. My beard is very curly, and currently sits at about 2 or 3 inches. Its fairly full except under my bottom lip where all I can get is a little soul patch then the rest of the beard around my jaw line. How do I fill that in too? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
