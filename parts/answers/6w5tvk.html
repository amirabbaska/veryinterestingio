		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a different layer of skin that is normally never exposed unless you get cut or something to slice open your skin. Basically your skin is made up of 5 layers of skin cells that work their way up to the surface from the deepest layer. The top layer of skin is actually just a bunch of smaller layers of dead skin cells, which helps the skin withstand abrasion. The nails are just a modified form of the top layer of skin (the same type that covers your whole body). So when it gets removed, the middle layers of skin that lie below it are exposed, and are extra sensitive as a result.
As far as it's purpose, it houses a lot of sensory organs that give us information about things like touch, vibration, body position, etc. It also produces new epithelial (skin) cells that I believe will eventually be modified and become a fingernail (not 100% sure about that last part). </p>
<p>Hope this helped! Anyone else with more knowledge feel free to correct me or add on! </p>
<p>Edit: forgot to address the purpose of it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans have an extremely sensitive sense of touch. Your finger tips are filled with extra sensitive nerves that are stimulated as you grasp something, and the fingertips and nails work together to sandwich these nerves, and heighten the sense of touch. Humans are capable of sensing an object less than the width of a human hair, and you can test this yourself by plucking a hair, placing it on a table, and running your finger over it. This allows us to have extreme dexterity in our hands, which is likely due to being descended from primates who lived in trees where grip is essential for survival. Further selection in later hominids to make tools and perform other fine motor tasks essential for survival likely increased this ability over time. This is why you can dig around in a backpack or purse and find objects without needing to look because your fingers give you the information. It's also why humans are capable of incredible fine motor control to do things like paint masterpieces or perform brain surgery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though I'm not sure about this entirely, it's probably a result of gain control. The area under your fingernails is rarely stimulated except for just after you trim them etc. This means that the fibres etc which encode tactile information as everyone else has mentioned are activated in response to stimuli that would have previously needed to be sufficient to displace the nail on top. So after a while you get used to the area being exposed and become less sensitive to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason the skin there is so sensitive is to help with pressure. That's the purpose of fingernails in general. When you hold an item, it pushes against the front of your finger, which in turn pushes against your fingernail. Your skin there is sensitive to the stimuli so that you can understand how much pressure you are putting onto the object you're grabbing. It's what allows you to grab an egg with ease with your fingers without even getting close to breaking it, but if you tried the same thing with your forearms, it's a lot harder to tell how hard you're pushing against an object. </p>
<p>TLDR- it helps understand the pressure your fingers are exerting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's sensitive because it's not meant to be exposed. That skin actually provides 10-20% of nail growth. The nail being there to provide another layer of support to help with sensation on your fingertip by providing counter pressure</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
