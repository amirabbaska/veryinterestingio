		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it is. It is a routine technique in gold coating for scanning electron microscopy for samples of insulators. (Conductors like metals need no coating.) The coating is applied because the electron beam tends to charge surfaces, making bright white spots that stay. A conductive coating allows the surface charge to dissipate. Depending on your sample, the layer may or may not need to be thick enough to be seen by eye. &quot;Nice&quot; samples (relatively smooth surfaces) need just a little, rough samples more. The coating is applied as an atomic gold plasma (which is violet-colored, by the way) sputtered from a gold target in near-vacuum. From my experience, after ca. 5 min of coating at 30 mA coating current, the gold layer becomes visible. At 1 min there's no clue that the sample is gold-coated.</p>
<p>Color of a metal requires that the surface is thick enough. The wavelength of blue-violet visible light is 400 nm and layers thinner than that appear transparent. (There can be, however, scattering.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said, thin metal layers are transparent, but I want to add that they are not self-supporting. Mirrored sunglasses have a thin layer of aluminum on the front, and you have no trouble seeing through from the back. But this film would never hold itself together if it weren't deposited on some thicker substrate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, assuming it's penetration depth was greater than the minimum thickness you could make the metal at.</p>
<p>Every material has a &quot;Penetration depth&quot; which is a measure of how far electromagnetic radiation (light) can penetrate before it falls to below 40% of it's original intensity.</p>
<p>There are plenty of examples of this, and the most widely known are Visors on space suits. They are gold plated on the inside of the visor to cut down on solar radiation that can reach the astronaut inside of the suits. It adds a slight haze to their vision (since it's a thick enough coating that it is not totally transparent), but provides a huge benefit to their protection, and adds that iconic gold-sheen to their visors when they catch the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
