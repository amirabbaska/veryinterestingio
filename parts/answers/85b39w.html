<p>Since the 1970s, most jet fighter engines have been low/medium bypass turbofans with a mixed exhaust, afterburner and variable area final nozzle.</p>
<p>To boost fuel economy and reduce noise, almost all of today's jet airliners and most military transport aircraft (e.g., the C-17) are powered by low-specific-thrust/high-bypass-ratio turbofans</p>

<p>Both are powered by turbofan engines, which are a type of jet engine that has a large fan inside that makes thrust by moving air around the turbine (instead of through it).  The low bypass engines used by fighters make more thrust from the air moving through the turbine itself while jet airlinersâ€™ highbypass engines generate more of their thrust from the fan.  Basically the jet fighter is better at producing power for the size and weight of the engine and the jet airliner is better at producing power for how much fuel it uses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The single biggest difference is with the bypass ratio. Bypass meaning amount of air that goes through the turbine and is ignited vs the air that bypasses all these steps and is simply propelled by a single propeller (that is driven by the turbines). Old airliner engines look a lot like modern jet engines simply because they are low-bypass. Modern airliner engines are called high-bypass; as the name suggests this means a lot of air is accelerated more slowly by the propeller. Jet aircraft engines are low-bypass, the advantage of which is at high altitudes they provide the highest level of efficicency...but they are terrible at low altitudes. Airliner engines are moderately efficient at all altitudes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since no one here has given a comment here that I think adequately explains the differences, I'll try my hand at it. The first thing you need to know is the difference between a turbofan and a turbojet engine. While both types of engines work in the same manner in terms of combustion, the turbofan has an added twist.</p>
<p>A jet engine produces thrust by expelling gases at the rear. It does this by intaking air at the front (suck), compressing the air with a series of rotating fans to increase the pressure and therefore temperature (squeeze), mixing fuel with this heated air to create a combustible mixture which is then lit (bang), and produces the exhaust gases which are expelled out of the rear of the engine (blow). As these gases are pushed out of the rear of the engine, they spin turbines  which are what power the plane electronically.</p>
<p>A turbofan engine has what is essentially a heavy duty propellor at the front of it. In addition to providing the intake air for the jet engine, the fan also allows some air to pass around the sides of the engine, which also helps to create thrust. The ratio of air that goes around the combustion chamber to the air that actually is combusted is called the bypass ratio. In rough terms, if a turbofan engine has a higher bypass ratio, it is more fuel efficient, but less powerful and heavier. If it has a lower bypass ratio, it loses some fuel efficiency, but is also lighter and more powerful.</p>
<p>A turbojet engine lacks this fan at the front of the engine, and so all air that moves through the intake of a turbojet engine is combusted. Another key feature of the turbojet engine is that it can be equipped with an afterburner. This is positioned after the turbines which follow the combustion chamber, but before the exhaust nozzle. The afterburner uses a second stage of compression fans to re-compress the already combusted air-fuel mixture, and re-injects more fuel into that air and reignites it, sending the exhaust gases directly out of the nozzle of the engine with no turbines to slow it down. While this generates enormous amounts of thrust compared to not using an afterburner, it is also very fuel hungry. The turbojet engine itself (sans afterburner) also consumes a large amount of fuel when compared to a turbofan.</p>
<p>Airlines and almost all private jets use turbofan engines, due to their efficiency and the lack of a need for the high performance of a turbojet engine. Military fighters and other high performance aircraft used to use turbojet engines, but now use low-bypass turbofans, and some, but not all, are equipped with afterburners. There are of course exceptions to these statements, but that is the general idea.</p>
<p>tl;dr: Airlines use turbofan engines, which allow some air to be used directly for thrust without combustion, which makes them more fuel efficient, whereas fighters use low-bypass ratio turbofan engines, which are much more high performance than commerical aircraft turbofans, but consume much more fuel.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Subsonic military jets use basically the same engines that commercial jets use (cargo planes, maybe the A-10 warthog, but I'm not entirely sure)</p>
<p>Supersonic jet engines share some similarities in the components, and they both use air pressure and igniting a gas to propel the jet forward, but that's about where the similarities stop.  </p>
<p>Supersonic jets have to be designed to get air moving faster than the speed of sound. To do this, the incoming (supersonic) air needs to be slowed down first (to Subsonic speeds) before it can then be mixed with feel them ignited.  It's pretty counterintuitive, but that's how it works.  Therefore, the entire design is very different. Not to mention that the components need to be able to withstand the rigors of going supersonic in the first place.  Air has friction.  The faster you go, the more it will heal up the parts that &quot;rub&quot; against the air.  When going 800+ mph, this is a very nontrivial amount of heating.  Therefore, materials and tolerances must be of much higher grade and tested more rigorously.</p>
