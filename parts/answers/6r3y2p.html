		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The maximum amount of entropy in a given region is given by the Bekenstein bound. This states that </p>
<p>S &lt;= (2πkRE)/(ħc)</p>
<p>where R is the radius of the region, E is the total energy inside the region, and the rest are fundamental constants (k is Boltzmann's constant, ħ is Planck's, c is the speed of light).</p>
<p>If you fix the size R of the region, then general relativity tells you that the maximum energy E that can fit in it is </p>
<p>E = 1/2 c^4 R / G</p>
<p>because that'd make a black hole. If you add more energy, the black hole gets bigger and you spill out of your region, so that's the absolute maximum. Combining, Bekenstein's bound becomes</p>
<p>S &lt;= π k R^2 (c^3 / G ħ)</p>
<p>The part in parenthesis is 1 / the planck area, actually, so </p>
<p>S &lt;= k (region surface area in Planck areas) / 4</p>
<p>is a much clearer form of the bound. The maximum amount of information in a ball of spacetime is proportional to the area that bounds it... that is very weird and unexpected, and is in fact the original inspiration for the holographic principle. But let's move on.</p>
<p>So we know in Planck units that S &lt;= area / 4. Moreover, a quick calculation shows that for a black hole, it is indeed true that S = area / 4. You can also prove the converse, which is that S = area / 4 implies that what you have on your hands is a black hole. Thus, black holes are the states of maximum entropy / microscopic information for a given region of space, and to reach that maximum entropy you necessarily create a black hole.</p>
<p>This value is <em>really, really, really</em> big though. Let's try with your example. I think a pen drive can fit in a 5 cm bubble, right? That has an area of about 63 cm^2. In Planck areas over four that's 6 * 10^(66). So the entropy is</p>
<p>S ~ k 10^(66)</p>
<p>which means the maximum possible information storable is on the order 10^(66) nats which at our level of precision is indistinguishable from 10^(66) bits. That is an absolutely <em>insane</em> amount. An attempt to store, by unconceivably advanced technology of course, this amount of information in that little space is going to result in the formation of a black hole necessarily - gravity conspires back against your attempt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
