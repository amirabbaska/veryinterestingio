		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the discovery of this is relatively new, the reasons behind such are only speculated. So as a disclaimer, I'm only basing this on the speculations:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The Greenland shark lives in cold water which must contribute to their metabolism. Think of how sluggish you may feel while cold, it's your body slowing down bloodflow and such to keep you warm in the places your body wants and needs(brain, lungs etc.). Usually this damages you in places that don't get that warm blood, but it also slows damage to critical places. Creatures adapted to this just use the protecting effect of cold all around.</p>
</li>
<li>The Greenland shark is pretty big, and size also contributes to longevity. A large creature is usually pretty slow, which means that wear and tear on multiple levels(bodypart and cellular) is lesser. This added to cold water could make a big difference, but probably there's something more to it. </li>
</ol>
<p>A slower lifestyle also contributes to slower metabolism, as a Greenland shark is pretty docile and a Great White is pretty explosive in it's movements. Slow and steady keeps you healthy. Hope this helps!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Greenland sharks can't reproduce until they are ~150 years old, so they have to live, at a minimum, to sexual maturity. </p>
<p>The reason for their long life is unknown, if we understood all the factors for why animals die....However, it is postulated to be a combination of a slow metabolism and certain genes that enable proteins to fold better and remove molecules that damage DNA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a bunch of reasons why some animals live longer than other. It's not so much a rule but a guideline for all animals.</p>
<p>Some basic rules are: the lower on the food chain the animal is the more offspring they will have to compensate for being prey.</p>
<p>The higher on the food chain the less offspring because their survival is more likely.</p>
<p>In areas of extreme condition / little prey available the species in question likely has little offspring.</p>
<p>The amount of offspring animals have has a high correlation with longevity and sexual maturity. Ex: mice have more children and reach maturity quickly, elephants and whales have one child over many months every couple years and take years to reach maturity.</p>
<p>While we do not know the actual reason the Sharks live so long, we really do not know for sure why any living thing lives as long as they do (mostly), we do have guidelines that have proven to be very accurate as I described.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It lives in a very cold, relatively nutrient poor area, which means it's lifestyle tends towards slow growth, low activity. But it also has relatively little competition, so there's no need to replace losses rapidly. Thus, the best strategy evolution wise is to live long, reproduce rarely.</p>
<p>If they lived shorter lives/reproduced faster, they might over populate and exhaust their food supply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
