		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><h3>Current work:</h3>
<p>There are 2-3 vaccines currently in various stages of development. One by Vical is a bivalent vaccine that is still in the early phases of moving to clinical testing, two others have shown to remove the virus is monkeys and are promising but that word usually means at least another 5-10 yrs before results. Both are monovalent IIRC. </p>
<p>Keep in mind, most of the work done in this realm is on vaccination - largely before an infection has been acquired. Cures for latent viruses like Herpes, and other lentiviruses are much more complex.</p>
<h3>Barriers to cures:</h3>
<p>This complexity largely stems from an ability to silence their own transcription (either through miRNA or LATs or even other mechs) which makes it harder to identify infected cells. </p>
<p>In addition, many HSV types tend to infect very important cells - HSV 1 infects nerve cells near or in the trigeminal nerve and HSV-2 sacral ganglial bodies. We can’t just kill these cells, like we do with cancer cells or T-Cell therapy, these nerve cells provide an incredibly important function and, more importantly, they don’t heal (well). So our removal of the quiescent DNA/RNA/Viral transcript has to be both surgically precise and leave the cell generally no worse off than when we found it. </p>
<p>People are excited about using gene editing techniques like CRISPR-CAS9 and zinc finger etc techniques to either remove the viral genomes or permanently silence them but we’re still a bit off from that level of ability. </p>
<p>In my opinion however, CRISPR tech is moving so fast that something that is a ways off now could really be a legitimately usable technique in 1-3 years. Genomics is just exploding and the rate of information acquisition is mind-boggling. You should be excited about it. </p>
<h3>Limitations of medications:</h3>
<p>As of now, our best medications are false nucleotide analogues. A treatment developed in the 70s (?) that basically takes a component of the genetic code and replaces it with a Trojan horse component that looks like what it’s replacing. The problem is that it only works on one aspect of the virus - when it replicates its genome - which means that during periods of latency the analogues don’t do anything and they certainly don’t cure anything. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im sure that someone with more time will answer this more in depth, but due to the fact that these diseases are not life-threatening and only mild inconveniences to most, there has not been a lot of research compared to other disease States. However there is several clinical trials I believe, that are testing vaccines that reduce the chance of contracting the disease and when given to patients who already have the disease will reduce the amount of shedding and breakouts. These do not cure the disease however.</p>
<p>We have antiviral medications that will stop it from replicating and if you take them everyday you will have a low chance of having a breakout, or reduce your chance of contracting the virus from contact. However, taking them everyday is expensive and may be harmful to your kidneys. Once you've had your first break out though, the seeds are sown and the viral genetic material will hide in your neural cells. This is very much like HIV although the viruses are different in other ways. You can imagine scattering glitter in your carpet and in order to cure the virus you would need to vacuum every single piece of glitter out of your carpet. If a single cell is left to replicate after stopping antivirals it will release tons of virus to infect new cells and the process will repeat. Prevention is the best measure here. Wearing a condom will not completely protect you from Contracting this. It is a discussion that you should have with every partner or anyone that you're kissing or sharing drinks with. It is possible to contract the virus when they do not have an open sore. It is difficult to contract the virus indirectly however it is possible. Alcohol will not immediately deactivate the virus. You must halogenate it with bleach or something similar. For this reason swimming pools with chlorine are safe from transmission as well as hot tubs assuming they are treated with chlorine. However were you to put some fluid on a surface that contain the virus it may be active for up to a few hours given the right conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dr. William Halfort, a professor at SIU School of Medicine may have had some promising results in his efforts to produce a herpes vaccine. Unfortunately he was found recently to have been practicing some highly unethical and potentially illegal methods in testing his vaccine and has since passed due to a brain tumor. Its unclear whether his vaccine had any sort of effectiveness at this point, and as far as I am aware he wasn't published in any major journals. Its an unfortunate setback on the progress to a vaccine, but his work efforts (dubious as they were) serve as evidence that some are/work working on a vaccine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
