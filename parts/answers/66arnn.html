		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In common usage, the term special relativity is used more to refer  to things like time-dilation effects and such related to ones speed relative to the speed of light where general relativity is associated with the distortion of space-time in the vicinity of a gravitational source.</p>
<p>In reality, special relativity is just general relativity when there are no gravitational sources and the underlying spacetime &quot;texture&quot; (metric) is the simplest possible (i.e. special relativity is general relativity in the most boring possible spacetime structure).  Thus, &quot;special&quot; relativity is just a special limiting case of &quot;general&quot; relativity.</p>
<p>Historically, special relativity was developed first, by Einstein, in 1905 and then followed up with a more general framework in 1915ish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two short answers and a long explanation.</p>
<p>1/         Special relativity (SR) doesn't include gravity, whereas general relativity (GR) does.</p>
<p>2/         In SR, the laws of physics are the same for all inertial coordinate systems, that is those in which Newton's First Law of Motion is true.  In GR the laws of physics are the same in all coordinate systems, whether they are inertial or not.  So SR is a special case of GR.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Special relativity &quot;fixes&quot; Galilean relativity by preventing objects from travelling faster than the speed of light. This does not come from nothing, but is required by classical electrodynamics. It leads to spacetime as a four-dimensional Minkovski space replacing the old 1D time + 3D Euclidean space. This implies to things like the famous energy-mass equivalence.</p>
<p>General relativity is a theory of gravity that is consistent with special relativity, explaining gravity as a distortion of spacetime.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
