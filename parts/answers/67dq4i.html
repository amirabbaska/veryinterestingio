		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said, it's their history. Good or bad, a lot of the people living in those areas now have ancestors that were in the war. No one wants to go through life feeling ashamed all the time (even if some tell them that they should, in fact especially if someone is telling them they should). So there's three choices; ignore that entire part of your family history, town history, state history, feel like shit because of the bad stuff, or remember and be proud of the good stuff.</p>
<p>And yes, there was good stuff. The vast majority of southerners fighting for the Confederacy had never, not once, owned a slave. In fact quite a few of them probably viewed slavery as a lot of people view automation now: something that is taking jobs we could and should be working. Why should I scrape by on a meager plot of land with my sons working the fields and my daughters tending the livestock while the big plantation owner in the next county can make a fortune with labor he doesn't have to pay. So why did tens of thousands of non-slave owning lower class citizens sign up to fight for the Confederacy? Because they believed in states rights, that a state should govern itself within its own borders, and that being a part of the Union ought to be voluntary. When the Union told them that no, they couldn't leave and we're sending Federal troops to make sure you don't, that pissed a lot of people off, slavery or no. Many soldiers in the Confederacy weren't there fighting for &quot;The Confederacy&quot;, and they sure as hell weren't fighting for some rich guys with cheap labor. They fought to protect their state, which at the time they saw as their country. Back then, people still thought of states as what the name implies: its own nation. Don't forget that that's why they were called states and not some other term like province. State is a synonym for nation. That's why there's a State Department. That's why Presidents and Prime Ministers are called &quot;Chiefs of State&quot;. The State of Virginia was to them a nation called Virginia. A nation that had a voluntary membership in a Union of other nations, and should be free to leave if they choose.</p>
<p>Many southerners (and non southerners) still look up at that motivation as something good. Casting off the yoke of an oppressive government, fighting for the right of your community to see to their own affairs, fighting what they see as foreign invaders.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because 3 in 10 southern men fought for the Confederacy so a huge chunk of the South has an ancestor that fought for the CSA. Compare that with something like a percent of all Americans now are in the military.</p>
<p>Also consider that the South has an independent culture from the rest of the US. From Texas to Virginia it's The South. There really are no comparable regional cultures anymore. </p>
<p>Everybody not from the south picks on the South. I know I do. They still despise all these damn Yankees moving down south and being rude and shitting on them. So of course they have pride in the time they told all those Yankees to fuck off back where they came.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was asked pretty recently, and this is the second time I've reposted this in two days. The answer is the active effort by ex-Confederates to revise history throughout the late 19th century:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The answer has been given as to what the Confederate flag represents.</p>
<p>However, there is more to the story - <strong>why the Confederate flag is still in widespread use across the South.</strong></p>
<p>In the wake of the American Civil War, there was a very considerable effort by ex-Confederates to rehabilitate the image of the South. This historiographical narrative is called &quot;the Lost Cause of the South&quot;, and refers to the revisionist effort to portray the reasons for the South and its soldiers seceding and fighting the war as a somehow noble struggle - the <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DoomedMoralVictor" target="_blank">Doomed Moral Victor</a>, to use troperspeak.</p>
<p>The primary problem that this narrative needed to overcome was the problem of slavery being morally bankrupt. So the Lost Cause narrative went around this by suggesting that the South seceded in order to fight for &quot;states' rights&quot; and to &quot;protect the Southern way of life&quot; which was romanticized. Two Lost Cause films that promote these ideas are <em>Gone With The Wind</em> and <em>Gods And Generals</em>.</p>
<p>Next, the Lost Cause had to smear the names of the Union heroes and promote the Confederate heroes as somehow superior. Lee's gentlemanly mannerisms and brilliant stratagems are held in contrast to Grant's &quot;simple-minded butchery&quot; and vulgar habits. The defamation of Grant extended even into his term as President, which is frequently derided as an extremely corrupt administration. Stonewall Jackson's piety and tactical brilliance is venerated while his extreme eccentrism and laziness to the point of detriment is glossed over. Sherman's March to the Sea is portrayed as an episode of history's worst war crimes.</p>
<p>Next, Confederates who repented had to be ruined. James Longstreet was one of Lee's most reliable and competent subordinates, but after the war was over Longstreet criticized the South's motives for war and, even worse, dared to collaborate with the Republican politicians. His reputations was destroyed by Lost Cause revisionists, most egregiously in that blame for the defeat at Gettysburg was pinned upon him rather than Lee for decades.</p>
<p>Next, the Doomed Moral Victor narrative had to be justified ex post facto - the South had to have started an unwinnable war for noble reasons and died a martyr. The Civil War was winnable by the South - the North, despite its many advantages, still had to impose its will over a huge area and population. All the South had to do was resist and hold its key areas long enough for the North to decide the war was unwinnable, and thus come to the negotiating table. But the South's gross incompetence in the Western theatres and inability to win offensive victories meant they lost the initiative and ceded key territories (such as New Orleans and the Mississippi River) that ultimately doomed their war effort.</p>
<p>Finally, Reconstruction had to be demonized. Narratives of exploitative carpet-baggers and corrupt radical Republican administration dominated. Black suffrage was portrayed as a terrible, misguided mistake. Egalitarianism was a failed experiment that only caused disorder and disunity. When the election of 1876, the closest election in American history, rolled around, the Republicans compromised with the Dixiecrats and lifted military administration from the former rebellious states, and the Jim Crow era began as black residents of these states were totally deprived of their franchise and civil liberties.</p>
<p>But why and how did this happen? Because the North wanted it to happen. Years of war and division had taken their toll, and both sides wanted reconciliation. The North was tired of expending its resources keeping down a strife-ridden South, and the Southerners wanted their sacrifices acknowledged as well as assurances that they weren't evil people. That the rights and freedom of African-Americans in the South had to be sacrificed on the altar of reconciliation was inconsequential - the Northern population might have opposed slavery, but they were just as racist as their Southern cousins.</p>
<p>And so the narrative became set in stone as truth - the Dunning School interpretation of the war was extremely popular during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Even today, the influence and damage of the Lost Cause narrative is still readily evident. <strong>And because the Lost Cause narrative rehabilitated the image of the Confederacy over a century ago, it later became acceptable for the Confederate flag to be displayed as a symbol of &quot;Southern pride and heritage&quot;</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Southern States bore the brunt of the Covil War. All but two battles were fought in their territory, and while the North had a larger death toll in nominal terms, the South proportionally had a higher fatality rate. They gave up tons, and had nothing to show for it. This led to the lost cause movements 20-30 years after the war which somewhat successfully rebranded the confederates message, and romanticized the Rebel fight. Combine this with the Union being very lenient on the Confederacy during Reconstruction, because they didn't want to deal with a never ending insurgency, and you have a recipe for how the Confederacy is viewed by many today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
