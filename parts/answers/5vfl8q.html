		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A pharmacist is basically a specialist in medication, meaning they probably know more about medicines than some medical practitioners.  They do so much more than dispense medicine, they also offer consults on use and dosage.  They are also the last line of defence when it comes to drug interactions, especially when a patient is treated by numerous practitioners.  And last but not least, they deserve a medal for being able to translate a practitioner's handwriting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<ul>
<li>My main job is to &quot;check&quot; prescriptions that come my way to make sure they're accurate. My assistant 99 times out of a 100 is the one who types the prescription and counts the actual pills. Common physical things I catch are wrong doses (2.5 mg instead of 25mg), wrong drugs (doxycycline-an antibiotic to be avoided in pregnancy vs doxylamine a morning sickness pill) and illegal prescriptions (narcotic forgeries). Some trained technicians can perform this step but IMO the above are easier to spot with pharmacist training.   </li>
<li>Check prescriptions for &quot;drug related problems&quot; such as interactions. In my experience, pharmacists tend to be overly cautious people. So yes, we will run certain drug combos through our computer, or glance at the patient hand-out to &quot;double check&quot; ourselves-this is a good thing. Sometimes I need to remind myself of a drug I haven't seen in a long time! Once we get the information we can interpret its severity quickly, which a lay person could not. As others have pointed out, there are tons of interactions that get &quot;flagged&quot; and a pharmacist is able to determine which is important based on the individual patient. For example, I have prevented very serious problems by contacting doctors over a dangerously high dose of antibiotics in a child, or a drug interaction that was only meaningful because it was for a frail elderly lady. This is a pharmacist's job-doctors are trained for diagnosis, not drug interactions.  </li>
<li>I help people understand their medications. For example, the man who just had a heart attack and is leaving the hospital overwhelmed with a pile of meds. Without me they usually will stop taking one or two (or go back to smoking, or try a over-the-counter snake oil instead) and be at risk for a second heart attack. I sit down with them, and based on their personal needs talk about the risks vs benefits of the meds. Then I call them in a few days and follow up, making sure they've made an appointment with their family doctor. Or, I do a medication reconciliation with an elderly woman who has too many medications with side effects, and work with her doctor to see if some can be stopped.  </li>
<li>I answer people's questions 24 hours a day with more accuracy and clarity than google. (We are open extended hours) For example- its 2 AM and someone comes in with a sick child: what medication do they use? Should they go to the ER? This saves the healthcare system (or you, if you're American) money.  </li>
<li>I give flu shots which saves the government money as they pay us less than doctors, and the patient time. I also give other vaccinations, such as hepatitis B, so if you're going to Mexico you can be protected without the need for extra doctor visits.  </li>
<li>I prescribe certain medications for minor conditions, again saving the healthcare system money and the patient time.  </li>
<li>I can change some prescriptions with the patient's ok, for example if a product isn't available or something is missing from the prescription.  </li>
<li>I specialty make a lot of drugs, for example certain seizure medication for children isn't sold in liquid form- I will make this for you at 3AM when you realize you are completely out of doses for your kid.  </li>
<li>I dispense and monitor methadone, helping former addicts come off narcotics and re-integrate back in society (in partnership with their awesome nurses.)  </li>
<li>I deal with insurance agencies to try to get medications covered, sometimes contacting your doctor to see if an alternate drug would be acceptable.  </li>
<li>I consult on the phone with doctors, nurses, homecare workers etc deciding what course of action would be in the best interest of the patient.  </li>
<li>I use math calculations to be able to figure out the correct dose of things like Tylenol for infants too small to be listed on the box, again at 2 AM. Or help someone self-adjust their insulin.  </li>
<li>I get annoyed when someone is yelling at me from across the counter wondering why their order isn't done yet, asking what the heck I do all day. ;)<br />
TL;DR: Pharmacist's are drug therapy experts who can help you take charge of your health and decide if a certain medication is right for you. Like any profession there are a few dumb/lazy ones out there- but most of us work our butts off to keep you safe!</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nurse in a hospital, and pharmacists do a lot. They dose medication for patients whose liver or kidneys aren't functioning properly (meaning they're not able to clear the meds out of their system like a usual person would) and dose especially toxic medicines based on lab results. Lots of meds my patients get come with a physician order stating &quot;Pharmacy to dose&quot; bc the pharmacists are experts in how the drug works in and is processed by the body. They figure out alternate ways of getting a medicine into a patient when the usual ways aren't working, like when the patient needs a pill but chokes on everything they try to swallow, or need an IV drug but don't have an IV for whatever reason, because they have the knowledge to compare different methods if the same drug or alternate drugs that can go in a different way. They also double check medicine compatibility and dosage, which seems like a computer could do, but gets complicated when you have patients on many drugs being used in non-standard dosages for different conditions. They also physically mix the drugs, which requires a lot of knowledge of the chemistry of the body in order to ensure the med is safe to give and being given correctly. They're also in charge of a lot of the facets of making sure med errors don't happen. Pharmacists are experts on the drugs, so the doctor can focus on treating the patient, instead of reinventing the wheel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacists are experts in medications, even more so that doctors. Doctors are responsible for a lot of information and decisions, done quickly. Under those circumstances, it can be easy to order medications that are incompatible in the same patient. One of their chief responsibilities is to make sure medication orders make sense, drug interactions are minimized, doses are appropriate, and so on.<br />
That makes it sound like they're only purpose is to doublecheck Dr.'s work, but in truth they tend to have a much more in-depth knowledge of the field of medications, their effects, and their doses.</p>
<p>There's a lot more to it than that. The stuff you see them doing is counting to make sure the right number of pills get into your prescription. It gets much more difficult when there are multiple prescriptions on the same patient. Also sometimes doctors need doses that don't exist in pill form. In these cases it's up to the pharmacist to make a new pills, or capsules, or syrup liquids, in order to make the doses precise. </p>
<p>For example, let's say there is an antibiotic that is only available in  200 mg tablets. A doctor needs syrup made up to give to a baby that has 75 mg in 1 teaspoon. A pharmacist has the technical expertise and know how to mix the syrup with the pills that are available. They really are an indispensable part of the care team.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
