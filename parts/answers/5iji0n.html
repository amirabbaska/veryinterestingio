<li>They insulate themselves from air by floofing their feathers (stagnant air between their feathers is an excellent insulator)</li>
<li>They insulate themselves from ground by using a countercurrent heat exchange in their legs, aka a <a href="http://birdnote.org/show/why-birds-feet-dont-freeze" target="_blank">rete mirabilis</a> and by keeping their feet dry</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Along with insulation and countercurrent exchange, another physiological feature to point out is that small birds, like chickadees, engage in regulated hypothermia. During night time and bouts of extreme cold, they can lower their body temperature about 15 degrees celsius below normal, which saves tremendous amounts of metabolic energy. This is called daily torpor, and isn't to be confused with hibernation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They fluff their feathers up to trap a layer of air between their body and the cold air. This works the same way as a dry-suit for people to go into cold water.</p>
<p>They keep their feet from freezing with a special net-shaped network of arteries that's designed to allow the blood to cool before it reaches their feet. This way, they keep the feet just warm enough to not fall off, but they don't lose as much energy.</p>
<p>They eat almost entirely seeds through the winter, and a lot of then actually don't make it because they run out of food. That being said, seeds are fairly rich in calories so if they have a good supply they are pretty likely to survive winter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
