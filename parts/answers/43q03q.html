		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is, it is called mutualism.  Our intestines are lined with millions of bacteria, they help us break down our food and make it easier to digest.  Oral flora can, for some people, prevent cavities or plaque buildup.  There are many other bacterium and parasites that can benefit us.  If you're at the store, take a look at the &quot;probiotics&quot; section.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viruses probably played a mayor role in kick starting the (placental) mammal branch. The infection of a virus millions of years ago made it possible to create a placenta to nourish and grow an embryo right inside your body instead of having to lay an egg. </p>
<p>8% in our DNA are fragments from past virus infections of our ancestors. There is reason to believe that there are even more &quot;features&quot; we accidentally gained from viruses because of advantageous side effects. </p>
<p>Here is an interesting read about the topic: <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2012/02/14/mammals-made-by-viruses" target="_blank">http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/loom/2012/02/14/mammals-made-by-viruses</a></p>
<p>EDIT: changed to &quot;(placental) mammal&quot; as /u/EntropyDream /u/GoogleMeDoodle correctly pointed out that there are also other mammals like marsupials and monotremes who don't have a placenta.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great answers here about mutualism. But an explanation as to why there are fare MORE pathogenic microorganisms is because it's simply far easier to break complicated machinery than to improve it. Same goes for why evolution occurs so slowly yet we observe genetic mutations that cause problems all the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A key thing to remember is that a lot of these viruses and diseases are competing with us for resources. There is little benefit for something to one-sidedly improve us. But taking our resources for itself is very useful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I understand the question correctly, it's not doubting other organisms can help us, just why aren't these benefits as SUDDEN and IMMIDIATELY impactful as the dangerous microbes that pop up in the news. So essentially &quot;Why do beneficial microbes work subtly over time, while harmful microbes blow up out of nowhere&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm an engineer, not a biologist; but if I had to guess, I'd attribute it to the complexity of our bodies. When any microbe toys with our system, it can either disrupt our normal processes, make essentially no changes, or change something that is not only compatible with our body's current operations but actually enhances it. Because our bodies are built with such staggering complexity, the chances of a microbe disrupting it's delicate balance far exceeds the off chance of it being completely compatible AND happening to do our body's job better than before. And even less so that it could build enough beneficial complexity onto our existing systems to give us superpowers in such a small window of time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
