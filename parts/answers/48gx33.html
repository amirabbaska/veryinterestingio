		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow, lots of low effort BS comments. </p>
<p>Glass-Steagal separates investment banks from commercial banks. Well, it actually just defines what commercial banks are and are not allowed to do. </p>
<p>A commercial bank offers loans to the general public. Mortgages, business loans, the works. Well, before Glass-Steagal was repealed those types of banks weren't allowed to do certain things with their assets. What those &quot;certain things&quot; are is where you get into all the extremely complex antics the financial sector gets up to, such as derivatives. But basically the idea behind Steagal was that commercial banks would be isolated from the &quot;gamblers&quot; that invest in things like mortgages and re-sell expecting the price to go up and up. You tell the commercial banks that they are not allowed to take their assets, such as a mortgage loan, and put it on the market as an investment purchase for a third party to buy. By isolating commercial banks in this way you protect the &quot;general public&quot;, or at least their direct assets (Uncle Joe's mortgage), from the fallout caused by financial bubbles, which are almost always caused by overly optimistic gambling by investors. </p>
<p>The problem is Glass-Steagal was completely outdated when it was repealed. It didn't apply to the wide host of modern games the financial sector played, and the Fed (which regulates who is and is not able to act as a commercial bank) &quot;interpreted&quot; the law to not apply to really anything the modern banks wanted to do. They had long since, in the digital age, figured out how to make their relationships to one another so convoluted that a law written in 1933 simply didn't encompass the scope of what they were doing. Glass-Steagal was repealed, and there was supposedly supposed to be a replacement that fit the modern world, but that modern version was obviously never passed. Some people say the &quot;it was supposed to be replaced&quot; story is just an excuse left-wing politicians make up for voting for the repeal. Right-wing politicians don't need to defend the decision. Most of the <em>immediate</em> pressure for repeal wasn't to allow banks to intertwine with one another in ways that they hadn't already figured out how to do under Steagal, but rather to allow formal mergers between the different types of banks allowing them to operate under one roof. </p>
<p>You can point to a wide host of things and say &quot;if it weren't for this the financial crisis wouldn't have happened.&quot; For example, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae securitizing bad assets enabled much more bad banking than repealing Glass-Steagal did, although the extent of their role is disputed. You have to remember that a major goal of the government in the '90s was to increase American homeowners. One of the effects of repealing Glass Steagal without a modernized replacement was that commercial banks could totally absolve themselves from any responsibility for the mortgages they had given out by turning them into securities (both privately and through Freddie) and selling them to other banks. The idea behind Steagal was that no commercial bank should be able to create and then market securities, forged out of their own assets, in this way. When commercial banks could do this it allowed pretty much anyone to get a home (the lender knew the mortgage's value would rise with the housing market as a whole, and that he could sell it, so who cares about who the actual borrower is?), which before the crash was seen by a lot of politicians, bankers, and ordinary citizens, as a good thing. </p>
<p>A modern version of Glass-Steagal would not necessarily be a bad thing, but as President Clinton pointed out once the crisis DID happen it helped for commercial banks to be able to acquire other types of banks. If not, the &quot;too big to fail&quot; banks that would have been purely investment banks wouldn't have been able to get bought out by any other non-investment bank, and things could have been really, really bad. Then again the commercial banks wouldn't have been able to sell all their mortgage securities to every other bank in the world either, so the whole situation would have been different. </p>
<p>I think when people condemn the repeal of Steagal they're not talking about that specific, outdated law, but rather the abandoning of the ideology/concept that drove the original Steagal. Honestly I think you need to be quite educated in the field to have an informed opinion on whether or not the positives of separating investment and commercial banks outweigh the negatives. It's certainly true that in the modern situation, the distinction is barely intelligible anymore. When you get down to the nitty gritty it can hard to even define what exactly a modern Steagal would look like. You would definitely need to change how the big banks operate both internally and externally. </p>
<p>EDIT: My goal is not to be an anti-regulation shill (I think Dodd-Frank is a good thing) but instead to demonstrate that everyone had their own reasons for doing things and to expect favorable results. It wasn't as simple as &quot;let's repeal Glass Steagal so that the banks can commit fraud, screw everyone over, and collect bailout cash,&quot; which is the story I normally see on reddit. Simply by stating the other side of the story I've already been called a far right, libertarian hack, which just goes to show how bad the debate has gotten everywhere, not just here. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, all the new posts are saying what a great wall GS was at separating Commercial Practices from investment practices.</p>
<p>None of that means anything.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In 1999, the Glass-Steagall act, which prohibited the mixing of commercial banking with investment banking and other nonbank activities, was repealed. Fewer commercial banks than expected moved into mixed banking when Glass-Steagall was repealed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.philadelphiafed.org/-/media/research-and-data/publications/working-papers/2008/wp08-2.pdf?la=en" target="_blank">Mester (2008)</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Neither AIG, Bear Sterns, Lehman Brothers nor Goldman Sachsâ€™ questionable pre 2008 activities, notably subprime mortgage lending, would have been stopped by preventing them from getting into mixed banking. Mortgage lending is very much traditional banking service.</p>
</blockquote>

(Bernanke, 2010)</a></p>
<p>GS Never had teeth. Banks were doing what they wanted to and ruled legal under GS anyways. Even further to hit this idea home is the above from Mester when GS was repealed, mixing of the two simply didnt happen because of what Bernanke says above. Theres no god damn incentive to do so and what the banks were already doing were already standard banking.</p>
<p>To really ingrain why GS didnt do anything is to also tackle the many things people seem to feel about TBTF.</p>
<p>What part of too big to fail is bad? As far as we know TBTF is what stopped the crisis from getting worse. Without GS, the banks were able to buyout the failing non banking institutions such as AIG with the help of TARP.</p>
<p>So whatever policy you have in mind about TBTF you have to realize the huge advantages large banks provide (Notably their ability to service in a consistent way). <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1540-5982.00140/abstract" target="_blank">Canada's 5 to 4 Banks Oligopoly model doesnt seem to be a problem at all.</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Scale efficiency is sufficiently large to offset the consequences of reduced competition that might have arisen from a merger between Bank of Montreal and Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Toronto Dominion Bank, or both. The estimated model predicts that all the mergers proposed in 1998 would have led to slightly lower prices and, consequently, to an increase in consumer welfare.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We also see that testament to increasing returns to scale from many other economic papers as well.</p>
<p>So whats the right action? Crisis Management, not Prevention. Trying to prevent banks from getting to big doesnt do anything but hurt the returns to scale. As far as we know big banks have increasing returns to scale. Capping it makes no sense. What needs to be done is figuring out mechanisms to properly regulate bank failure which we have none of. We pulled out of ass the fix to the crisis by throwing money at it and that is largely seen as a failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's my attempt at an ELI7 or ELI9: </p>
<p>To understand Glass-Steagall, first we have to pretend. Lets pretend you have two friends, Jenny and Billy.</p>
<p>Billy loves to juggle (maybe he wants to be a clown when he grows up). He likes to juggle different things, especially cool things. When he juggles cool stuff without dropping it, people clap. Sometimes he drops things, though. Those things break.  He usually only juggles with his own toys, though heâ€™ll try juggling anything you ask him to.</p>
<p>Jenny loves to play with toys and especially video games. She likes playing new games all the time, especially on Wii U and 3DS. She also likes to borrow other people's games and lend them her own games. Jenny is a good friend of Billy's. They play together a lot. She loves watching Billy juggle, too. It makes her laugh. She makes him juggle many things. You don't like to juggle things, but sometimes you play 3DS with both Billy and Jenny.</p>
<p>One day you let Jenny borrow your 3DS so she can play a new game you downloaded. In return, you borrowed her new Wii U game. </p>
<p>After a few days, you went to bring her the Wii U game back so you could get back your 3DS. You were going to go on a vacation with your family and wanted to bring the 3DS to play in the car. Well, she was a little upset and when she gave you the 3DS it was broken. It turns out that she thought it would be funny to see Billy juggle all three 3DSs, hers, his and yours. He tried it, but dropped yours and it broke. </p>
<p>You were sad so you cried and went home and told your mom, and she called Jenny and Billy's moms. They came up with a rule. Jenny can't give Billy stuff to juggle that isn't hers, and Billy can't juggle things without asking the owner first. </p>
<p>Glass-Steagall is like the rule that says that if Jenny borrows your toys, she can't give them to Billy to juggle. </p>
<p>Some banks like to do cool but dangerous things with money. If they do it well, people clap with happiness. But if they do it badly, people cry with sadness.</p>
<p>Other banks like to lend and borrow money to people. It's not very exciting, but sometimes people need money and don't have it, and sometimes people have lots of money so they give it to the bank to hold.</p>
<p>Glass-Steagall was a law that made a rule that the lending and borrowing banks can't give that money to the dangerous banks to play with. And, that a single bank shouldn't do both things either. </p>
<p>In reality it's a little more complicated than that, but that's kind of what people mean when they are talking about Glass-Steagall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The repeal of Glass-Steagal made is so that the kids who sold crayons at recess could also buy broken crayons, but didn't have to list how many of their crayons were broken or report how many of those broken crayons weren't really useful for coloring, or even were the color brown that no one wanted to use in their coloring books. This meant that when the teachers asked the crayon kids if they had enough for everyone, they could say yes, but when drawing time happened, not everyone had crayons and it started a crayon throwing war, where lots more crayons were broken and the principle had to come in and switch everyone to colored pencils if they gave them all their broken crayons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people (wrongly) think it caused the 2008 recession.  Other comments have explained why that's wrong, and it's largely because it wasn't going to prevent either subprime mortgage origination nor securitization of said mortgages by investment banks.  Most of the institutions that failed (e.g., Lehman Bros., Bear Stearns, AIG) were not commercial banks.</p>
<p>However, there is one theoretical basis for thinking the repeal of Glass-Steagal could be bad.  Glass-Steagal separated commercial banking from investment banking.  Commercial banking deposits are insured by the FDIC.  Thus, by combining the two, it's possible the investment bank side will be incentivized to make riskier bets because those bets will be partially insured by the government via insurance of deposits.  E.g. if a bank loses a bunch of risky investments, starts to run out of reserves for their depositors, and experiences a bank run, the FDIC has to bail them out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
