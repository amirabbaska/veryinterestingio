		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A proton and a neutron aren't made up of the same things, so why would they weigh the same? A neutron can turn into a proton through Beta decay, releasing energy and an electron, so they cannot weigh the same or that process would violate conservation of energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why do you think they should have the same mass at all?</p>
<p>I think flipping the question around like that may help clear up some confusion. Up quarks mass in at about 2.3 MeV. Down are about 4.8 MeV.</p>
<p>2*2.3 + 4.8 = 9.4<br />
2.3 + 2*4.8 = 11.9</p>
<p>However the proton is considerably heavier than either of those numbers at about 938 MeV. Same goes for the neutron at 939 MeV.</p>
<p>Why the huge discrepancy?<br />
Why is the difference not even close to a quark mass?<br />
What, really is the internal structure of the proton?  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doesn't it have to do something with binding energy? As proton disintegrates into a positron and neutrino and converts to neutron and a neutron disintegrates into a electron and antineutrino and converts to proton there is some difference in binding energy. So this difference in energy results in some difference in mass?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A slightly more elaborate view of hadrons:
They're a quark/antiquark/gluon soup.
The proton has 2 more up quarks than up antiquarks, 1 more down quark than down antiquarks.
The neutron has 1 more up quark than up antiquarks and 2 more down quarks than down antiquarks.
The kinetic energy + potential energy (energy stored as inteactions) between all this particles in the soup is what gives hadrons most of its mass. The remainder mass is gained by the interactions between all this particles and the 3 remainding fundamental forces of nature + higgs field.
The interactions, for example, with the electromagnetic field are going to be diferent since the proton has charge and the neutron does not.
This extra potential energy shows itself as mass acording to einsteins mass-energy equivelancy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
