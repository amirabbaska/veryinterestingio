		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a little research, and I suspect this question is backwards.</p>
<p>The history of humans using names to describe each other likely predates the written word, so we don't have clear evidence on exactly how it evolved. It's likely that prior to having &quot;first names&quot; the way that we now use them, we still had &quot;relational names&quot;</p>
<p>The evidence suggests that &quot;Mama&quot; and &quot;Papa&quot; (or the prehuman equivalent) existed first, then as social groups became larger and more complex we had to be able to differentiate between other adults and came up with an alternative system of naming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Proto-Indo-European (3500 BCE) is believed to be the common ancestor to most of the languages spoken today and a great deal of work has gone into reconstructing it. In that language we have learned that mā́tēr meant mother and pǝtḗr meant father. It is also believed that ma and pa were the first words spoken by humans. The evidence is suggested in the similarity of mama and papa in nearly every language, including the Navajo word for mother amá, even natural barriers didn't influence early language.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not a linguist but I will take an educated guess.</p>
<p>The word &quot;mother&quot; ultimately comes from baby talk &quot;ma&quot; (like &quot;mama&quot;) with a suffix indicating kinship. This understanding comes from linguists' reconstruction of Proto-Indo-European, the common ancestor language of a vast number of modern languages and believed to be spoken around 3500 BC.</p>
<p>So 5500 years ago, linguists believe (and this kind of thing is on reasonable footing) that people were already talking about their mothers. Reconstructing language further back than this is essentially impossible. Written records of PIE don't exist so all our work to reconstruct this language is very very complicated, painstaking guesswork, which academics have undertaken by comparing the words across hundreds of languages and finding common characteristics. It's likely that many aspects of the reconstruction are wrong just because random processes will have obscured the true origin of words.</p>
<p>All this means that working out anything further back is pointless: we just don't have the evidence there to do so. So we cannot know for sure.</p>
<p>One titbit though: Koko the gorilla (whether or not you believe she can use language is a tricky subject, but let's suppose you do) has signed about her mother. If Koko really understands the signs she makes, then this means that gorillas already can understand the concept of mother, which would indicate that it's very likely we have had a word for mother for essentially as long as we've had anything worth calling &quot;language.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Regardless, mama is proto indo european. Which we don't have records for, its a fascinating subject. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not directly related, but I've read that the &quot;di&quot; phoneme is present in practically every language and always means something similar, God, gods, holy, sacred or something like that.</p>
<p>For English speakers this is retained via Latin influences in words like deity and divine. </p>
<p>Edit- it's the sound that's important and it follows all the rules that languages follow when changing over time. What this means is its not the spelled out word in English &quot;di&quot; that matters in other languages. It's the sound or some form of it. Example, ancient Chinese refers to God as Shang Di. This has changed over time to Shang Ti.    </p>
<p>Edit 2 - I'm feeling the hate right now guys. Not a good feeling. I'm not intending to present an academic peer reviewed study. This is just and fyi I thought OP might find interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
