		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dog lived for her first  6 months with her  sister who she  was identical to. They were very fond of each other. We had other dogs and plenty of mirrors but when we adopted her she would sometimes catch sight of  herself in the mirror and immediately drop her ears and start wagging her tail the way she does when she greets dogs and people she likes. When she realised it was the mirror she would just sit and stare in to it and I am sure she saw her sister in her own reflection and missed and mourned her. We arranged for them to meet about eight months later and she recognised her. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dog was separated since he was ~2 months old and it's been 7 years since he last saw his siblings. The other day my gf was out with him and stumbled upon another owner with the same breed. They started talking and it turned out that the dogs were siblings. All My gf had to say about the reaction was that our dog was very playful with his brother and didn't get jealous when My gf went to pet the other dog. Usually when he sees other dogs he gets a little aggressive and assertive and he is also very jealous so I don't know perhaps, but then again it could also be that he just happened to like this dog which is about 1/25 dogs he walks by.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that Elephants know and I know that allot of species of bird find back the same mates every breeding season.
And I know that Horses and cows and dogs don't know. </p>
<p>Hyenas know who the pups of the alpha female are, and these pups have a higher rank in their group than other pups. And these pups will become the new alpha females like a royal blood line. </p>
<p>It must be relevant to their survival or else this trait would not be copied successfully into future generations. So this would most likely occur in more intelligent creatures that live in family groups. </p>
<p>Humans however do not conclude that they are family by smell or behaviour clues, but they have language, genetic testing and pictures etc. So even if we conclude that elephants remain to know their relatives, we cannot know for sure what tips them off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
