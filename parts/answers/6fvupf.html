		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Controlled implosions aren't just about bringing a building down...its about bringing it down so the debris goes where you want it to.</p>
<p>The actual amount of explosive force needed to bring a structure down is actually low (because of gravity) So if there is a screw up in the implosion process, the building is still coming down...just in a really unsafe way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The explosives going off on their own is not a worry, it takes certain very controlled conditions for modern demolition explosives to be detonated. If the detonation sequence goes off badly enough that there are large parts of the building still standing then traditional but riskier and slower demolition tactics will just need to be used (wrecking balls and the like).</p>
<p>But the demolitions company will want to recover the unused explosives because governments tend to get a bit touchy about lost high explosives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This actually happened in my hometown about ten years ago! When they detonated the explosives, it imploded the base of the building but the rest ended up still standing, leaning a bit. They ended up tearing it down with a wrecking ball over a week or so. I can't remember how long they waited between the failed detonation and finishing the deconstruction, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I live next to a rock quarry, 1/4 mile away, they actually had this happen last year when they were blasting.  They drilled and set the charges and set them off.  One or two did not detonate, the charge is a two part mix and relatively inert with out the blasting cap.  However they had to bring in one of the bigger loaders and retrofit it with a steel cage and some other heavy steel plates before it could go and dig up the charges.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
