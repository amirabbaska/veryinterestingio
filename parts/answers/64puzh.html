		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has a lot (but not everything) to do with how light it is. During the day the natural daylight prevents production of melatonin in the brain which is the hormone we produce that regulates our body clock and tells us when to go into a deep sleep. If it's not dark enough the brain won't produce enough of this hormone to go into deep sleep mode, hence the short naps - you never quite make it into the later stages of a big sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This comes down to your circadian rhythm, usually. From a young age, most of us get into the habit of sleeping at night and staying awake during the day, or maybe having a short nap in the afternoon. This is usually linked to Zeitgebers (German for 'time-givers') which are basically external cues. The most common of these are external light. Essentially, we train ourselves into having a proper sleep at night and only a nap during the day. </p>
<p>It's surprisingly easy and simultaneously difficult to fuck up your circadian rhythm. Think about how often you stay up all night to watch a show or play a game or read a book or dance while wasted. Basically anything that throws you off your rhythm can fuck up your cycle but this is usually short term, and your body is pretty good at getting itself back on track if you're not fighting it, thanks to hormones. </p>
<p>Hormones help maintain your circadian rhythm. Melatonin and cortisol both affect your sleep cycle. Example: Melatonin, the 'sleepy' hormone, is usually produced at night, and causes drowsiness and drops your body temperature, both of which will obviously make you want to sleep more. </p>
<p>Melatonin usually starts getting produced between 8pm and 9pm, spiking around 3am and 4am, finishing about 7am or 8am. This helps us sleep through the night. There's usually a smaller spike around lunch time, but this doesn't last as long, thus leading to a simple nap rather than a full on sleep. </p>
<p>It's also why it's easier to slip back into a 'normal' rhythm after working nights than it is to start doing nights after working days. Fucking hormones! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason is your circadian rhythm, but the explanation as to what that rhythm is doing in relation to your sleep pattern can be simplified into two opposing forces:  <a href="http://whyfiles.org/shorties/282sleep-wake/images/sleeppressuregraph.jpg" target="_blank">sleep pressure and alerting stimulus</a>.  </p>
<p>Your circadian rhythm, when in sync with the solar day, controls the hormone production in your body to keep you awake when it's light out, and then lets your body fall into sleep-mode when it's dark.</p>
<p>Sleep pressure is our body's innate desire to sleep, and it builds while we are awake, and dissipates when we are asleep.  Our body's alerting stimulus fights against this building sleep pressure during the day, so we stay awake when it's light out.  When our body senses it's dark, it drops its alerting stimulus and lets the sleep pressure win out, and we go to sleep.</p>
<p>From the second we wake up in the morning, you begin to accumulate sleep pressure, and it typically takes around a full solar day to accumulate to the point where it overpowers your body's alerting stimulus.  When we nap, it's because our alerting stimulus (for whatever reason) has dropped to a point where our sleep pressure is the more powerful force.  This is common in the afternoon, around 2 pm, as our alerting stimulus experiences a natural drop off, called the &quot;post lunch dip&quot;.  Once you decide to nap, you lay down and fall asleep and let the sleep pressure dissipate.  Typically it won't take much to relieve the sleep pressure to the point where your alerting stimulus is now the stronger force, and you'll wake up after a few cycles of sleep.  With your sleep pressure lessened, you feel awake and refreshed from your nap.</p>
<p>For those of you that wake up from naps groggy and disoriented (I am one of those people), try to time the length of your nap to coincide with the length of a sleep cycle, typically around 90 minutes.  Waking up right at the end of a sleep cycle is best.  If you miss that wake-up window, you'll typically feel gross, grumpy, and worse off than from before you tried to nap.</p>
<p>This is a very simplified model, as there are a lot of other factors that go into our body's circadian rhythms, but the gist of it is, we sleep when our bodies can't keep us awake any more.  Sometimes you only need to sleep a little bit for your body to be able to keep you awake afterward.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You learned about touch, sight, smell, taste, and hearing in school, but we have many, many more senses than that. <del>Preconception</del> Proprioception, for example, which is how you can touch your nose with your eyes closed.</p>
<p>Humans have internal circadian clocks that act like another sense. It's how you can have a rough idea of what time it is without looking at a clock. Obviously it is better with some people than others, just like sight, but it can help you take a nap as opposed to going completely to sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
