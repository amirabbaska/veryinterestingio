		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Grad student studying the retina here!</p>
<p>In your eyes, you have rods and cones that take different light signals and turn them into electrical signals. At very low light levels, you undergo something called “dark adaptation” in which your cones (in daylight) take a nice break and your rods take over. This usually takes about 20 minutes, and it’s why dark rooms become visible at night after some time!</p>
<p>Your rods are really good at finding tiny amounts of light—they can literally count 1-2 photons (bits of light) per sec to incredible precision. At those low light levels, however, you become really sensitive (like increasing the gain on a camera). </p>
<p>I’m not too sure where those dots originate from—signals from rods go through a bunch of neurons to the LGN and on to different processing areas of the brain. Studying this stuff is hard, since each section can do its own thing. But my guess is that your photoreceptors trying to catch every little bit of light they can, and there’s some signals popping up that are being overamplified. Those are then turned into pretty obvious visual dots!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the absence of stimulation, your brain turns up the sensitivity, trying to get any information at all out of the environment. This means that any minor amount of light can set off one of the receptors in your eye and cause your brain to think that you saw something. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
