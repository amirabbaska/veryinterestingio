		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The milky way is a spiral galaxy. Our sun orbits in the disk similar to how the planets orbit the sun. There is a 'bulge' in the centre but we aren't in that part.
There are also other types of galaxy where they are shaped like an elongated sphere (elliptical galaxies). In these galaxies there is no particular axis of rotation and the stars are pretty amorphously dispersed</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The aspect ratio (thickness::diameter) of the Milky Way disk is about 1%.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Milky Way is the second-largest galaxy in the Local Group, with its stellar disk approximately 100,000 ly (30 kpc) in diameter and, on average, approximately 1,000 ly (0.3 kpc) thick.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In comparison, the inclination of the planets in the solar system (with respect to the ecliptic) are mostly in the neighborhood of 2 degrees, giving a thickness of ~2%.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>wee_jimmy87 answered your question in the sense of the Milky Way, but there's an interesting effect that causes systems to have more or less uniform planes and orbital direction.</p>
<p>In the earliest times of a system's formation, regardless of how large or small, you can identify the center of rotation and the overage angular momentum of everything orbiting the center.</p>
<p>Over millions of years, things that aren't in the same plane as each other eventually collide and either break or combine into larger bodies.</p>
<p>Throughout all of this, classical laws of physics apply and so <em>angular momentum must be conserved</em>.</p>
<p>After billions of years of collisions, the collective group of matter orbiting a large center of gravity (e.g. a planet, star, black hole) trend towards the average. Eventually, we're left with fewer distinct bodies that are all orbiting in more or less the same plane and in the same direction.</p>
<p>This can be observed in our solar system as well as much of our galaxy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The angular momentum of individual stars is pretty much random - each solar system is oriented differently, and only some of line up with the galactic disc by random chance. Stars form within molecular clouds that are very turbulent, and these random turbulent motions are what gives a solar system its spin and orientation.</p>
<p>You can actually see the orientation of our solar system at night if you know what to look for. If you go somewhere dark enough, you can see the band of the Milky Way across the sky. You can also find a star chart (there are loads over the internet) and look up what planets are visible right now. The planets, the Sun, and the Moon, are all in a band across the sky called the &quot;ecliptic&quot; - this is basically the flattish plane of the solar system. But you should see that the Solar System and the Milky Way don't line up - they're at an angle to each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
