		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Uranium in its natural state is not particularly radioactive. U-238 is the most common isotope in Uranium ore. U-235, the more radioactive isotope used in enriched and weapons-grade uranium only accounts for about 0.7% of natural uranium ore. But even U-235 isn't terribly dangerous from a radiation standpoint. The larger concern when handling these materials is their inherent toxicity. For this reason they are always handled with gloves and similar protection. One would have to spend a long period of time in close proximity to a very large quantity of uranium in order to receive a dose of radiation that was any more notable than the typical background radiation we receive in everyday life.</p>
<p>The perception of uranium as highly radioactive and dangerous comes from two sources. First, it is often thought of interchangeably with plutonium in this regard. Pure plutonium is significantly more radioactive and thus should be handled with much greater care, but even then, I believe the principle concern is toxicity, not radioactivity. Secondly, and more importantly, irradiated nuclear fuel is <em>very</em> radioactive, and quite dangerous to interact with. This is probably what you're thinking of. Enriched uranium that has spent time as fuel in a nuclear reactor has undergone fission, and been bombarded with particles, all creating numerous other materials within the fuel that make it very radioactive. Spent fuel like this is what we refer to when we talk of &quot;nuclear waste&quot; and it <em>is</em> quite dangerous. This is the material that conjures up <a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OY2y6NH0oKY/V5rQ1esJJ0I/AAAAAAAABDI/eW2kvO1r5gw238lfPQ_TQGvN1bl8BQbSwCLcB/s1600/homerrod.png" target="_blank">images of technicians</a> in bulky radiation suits, daintily holding on to glowing metal rods with a pair of tongs to avoid contact.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Purified uranium metal or uranium oxide is chemically toxic (like lead) but not very radioactive. You can handle it. Don't eat it. Don't fill your house with it. But it's not very radioactive. Handle it like you'd handle lead — wash your hands after touching it, don't vaporize it and breath it in, etc. Uranium oxide is just a convenient way to keep purified uranium — it is a chemical compound of uranium and oxygen.</p>
<p>Uranium ore, which is what you get out of the ground, is a mix of a lot of things including uranium daughter products that have been being produced for millions of years. Some of those are very toxic and radioactive indeed (e.g. radon and its daughter products, which include polonium). So uranium processing facilities (e.g., mills, which turn the ore into oxide), mines, and so forth need to have really careful ventilation and handling if you don't want people to be increasing their long-term chances for cancer. You don't want to build your home over uranium ores (or mine tailings) without checking for radon gas accumulation. Some of these effects are complicated and synergistic  — your chance of getting lung cancer from radon is pretty low by itself, but goes up dramatically if you smoke around the radon, for example (because you are dragging the particles deep into your lungs). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's relatively safe to handle. It's weakly radioactive and is primarily an alpha particle emitter. Alpha particles are very large so they can't really penetrate your outer layers of dead skin to damage living tissue. Just wash your hands afterward. It is a heavy metal, like lead, afterall.</p>
<p>As for the long half live = less radioactive part you should think of it like this. You have two materials. One with a half life of 2 seconds and one with a half life of 2 billions years. The short half life material would undergo the same amount of decay in 2 seconds as the long half life material would over 2 billion years.</p>
<p>Both materials will release the same amount of radioactive particles over their lifetime, but the short half life material will do so at a much MUCH shorter period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The uranium is uranium oxide is the same nucleus, which is just as unstable. We have unstable carbon-14 in the molecules of our body that can decay too! So the uranium in uranium oxide will decay at the rate of whatever isotope of uranium it is.</p>
<p>Uranium is pretty safe to handle yes. Enriched uranium is dangerous, because we've purified/concentrated/bred a certain isotope of uranium which is signifigantly more unstable. When uranium is used in a reactor or bomb, it's brought to critical mass-- where enough is packed into a space that the neutrons of their decays can hit other nuclei enough it causes a chain reaction that consumes a lot of the uranium nuclei. As you can imagine, this releases a LOT of radiation.</p>
<p>Edit: also the products of this fission, as others have mentioned, are generally unstable and both highly radioactive and toxic.</p>
<p>Bur uranium ore? There's not enough radiation released in a small time frame for it to be dangerous, except for maybe a LOT of it nearby over a long period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who work with uranium wear dosimiters and do daily radiation screening at work, to make sure they're not adversely exposed.</p>
<p>Decay rate, and hence the radioactivity produced, is inversely proportional to the isotope's half-life. The larger the half life, the smaller the instantaneous decay rate.</p>
<p>The only way there would be zero decay would be if the half life were infinitely long (i.e. a stable isotope.)</p>
<p>So despite it's long half life, uranium is still quite measureably radioactive. For example, Wilhelm Roentgen's famous discovery that uranium ore could expose a photographic plate even if the plate was wrapped in thick paper.</p>
<p>It's generally safe to handle because uranium's mode of decay is alpha particles. These have low penetrating power and are stopped by the outer layer of skin.  Furthermore, uranium dioxide is a rather inert ceramic compound</p>
<p>However alpha-emitting isotopes can still be very harmful if they're ingested, inhaled, or enter the bloodstream by some means. </p>
<p>That being said, the main way that water soluble uranium compounds are harmful is by believed to be ordinary heavy metal toxicity, due to the low decay rate. They cause damage to the liver and kidneys, or lungs if very fine uranium containing dust is inhaled. Inhaled uranium dust can cause lung cancer, on chronic exposure. This is a concern for people mining uranium.</p>
<p>Furthermore, uranium compounds don't easily cross the intestinal barrier into the bloodstream, so the danger from ingestion is low.</p>
<p>People handling uranium compounds typically wear dosimeters </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
