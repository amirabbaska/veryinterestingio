		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not strictly my area of expertise but I was wondering the same thing so I asked the SABRE people a couple of years ago at a conference. Apparently this is done to optimize climb angle and climb rate. It has something to do with the low lift generated by the short wing needing to be compensated by the engine thrust and a high angle of attack. The banana shape allow the intake to be aligned with the relative wind at high angle of attack while the exhaust points a bit downward.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The primary consideration is ensuring the inlet points directly into the local flow at the design flight condition (cruise, climb, etc).  For the pointy-type inlets, this is because they work by creating a shock wave to decelerate/compress supersonic air so the engine can handle it; this shock needs to land just inside the circular inlet, so the shock body needs to be pointed directly upstream for symmetry.  </p>
<p>All sorts of stuff affects  the local flow direction, including aircraft angle of attack, upwash ahead of the wing because it is generating lift (lift happens because the wing generates a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lift_(force\)#Circulation_and_Kutta-Joukowski" target="_blank">circulation</a> around it, making air in front of if flow slightly upwards and air behind flow significantly downwards), spanwise flow due to a finite wing and body effects, etc.</p>
<p>Note while the effect is extreme on Skylon/SABRE, the same effect can be seen on nearly any aircraft, including the <a href="https://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/systems/images/SR-71A_3view.gif" target="_blank">SR-71</a> where the inlets are pointed in and down, and the <a href="http://imgproc.airliners.net/photos/airliners/4/1/9/1265914.jpg?v=v40" target="_blank">777</a>, which even though it's a subsonic aircraft, has the inlet diffuser tipped down by a few degrees to compensate for upwash in the cruise condition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember of a tour I had a couple years ago, /u/electric_ionland has it mostly right... The short wings don't generate enough lift so they actually use the whole plane to generate lift. The plane flies at a slight angle the whole time; the cylindrical body of the plane isn't aligned to the direction of movement, so low pressure is generated on the top side of the cylinder which therefore lifts the plane. </p>
<p>The curvature of the engines is therefore to align the inlet to the forward direction of the plane. If you draw a straight line out of the front cone of the engine that's actually the forward direction of the plane.</p>
<p>Caveat: Not an aerospace engineer (just a mechanical engineer), don't quote me on this...</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
