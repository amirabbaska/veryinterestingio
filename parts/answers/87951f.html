		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Diplomats have several functions. One is simply to improve relations with the target nation, that's the most obvious and generally the reason they are allowed to be there by the target nation. Another is to influence politics in the target nation by schmoozing the right people and what not. Most importantly they are also essentially officially sanctioned spies. They pass any and all information they can gather to their home country, and it is extremely common for regular spies to be based out of an embassy or consulate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The 27 getting kicked out the UK and the last group to get kicked out of the US under Obama were targeted because they were carrying out intelligence work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For one, its a big inconvenience for the diplomats. A lot of them have families here, and they may have lived here for years, so being expelled means they have to uproot their families and homes and move back to another country, its a pretty big fuck you to official Russian representatives. Also, a lot of these operatives would play an important part in the Russian intelligence gathering apparatus, expelling these players would make Russia's job of collecting intelligence more difficult. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So there are several ways that the severing of diplomatic ties is a sanction. On the individual level, the diplomats themselves will not be happy - a posting in the US is generally very prestigious. This may not seem important, but you have to remember that diplomats are members of a quite elite club where people struggle for status and ostracised is never good. </p>
<p>More importantly, however, diplomats serve important functions. Firstly, diplomats are important for promoting and protecting Russian interests in the US, and useful to Russian businesses who operate, who are looking to invest, or are looking for investment from the US. Secondly, they serve an intelligence gathering tool able to keep a finger on the pulse of goings-on in a country. Though this is perhaps less important than it once was given the internet and easy access to media, there is no substitute for having someone on the ground interacting with other diplomats and government officials (as well as perhaps managing covert intelligence gathering). Finally, it’s a punishment because it is intended to demonstrate that the US and the UK are taking a hard line on Russian actions. Reducing diplomatic capacity necessarily reduces Russian influence in forums in the US, for example the UN, and also makes settlement of future disputes through peaceful diplomatic channels. In this sense, it’s as much a warning, as a punishment, which is why people tend to refer to these measures as ‘sanctions’ that incorporate elements of both. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Its a sign for “fuck off, I don’t want to hear it anymore.” And is a pretty drastic diplomatic move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
