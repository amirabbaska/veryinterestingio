		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just about the temperature getting a few degrees warmer. An effect of rising CO2 levels is that the global average temperature will get a few degrees warmer. That average temperature increase is a benchmark only, not the problem in and of itself. It's the other effects of the same root cause of increasing CO2 levels that are a problem.</p>
<p>The earth is a giant thermodynamic engine that takes in energy in higher amounts near the equator where solar gain is greater than heat radiated back into space, and funnels it to the poles, where solar gain is less than heat radiated to space. CO2 acts like a blanket over the system, keeping more heat in, but the equatorial zones don't heat much, they just shuttle that extra heat to the poles through ocean and wind currents. The same air currents also shuttle CO2 up to the poles, as can be seen in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1SgmFa0r04" target="_blank">this NASA model</a>, which further reduces heat radiated back into space at the poles. This means that the poles are heating up a lot more than 2 degrees C. More like 10.</p>
<p>The bulk of earth's frozen water is at the poles, so this rise of several degrees Celsius in the polar regions will melt a significant amount of land based ice, raising sea levels. This is going to cost trillions of dollars to either preemptively try to deal with or as flood damage.</p>
<p>In addition, CO2 in the atmosphere is also absorbed into the oceans. As the CO2 levels in the ocean rise, the oceans acidify, due to the creation of carbonic acid, the same acid in your carbonated soda. You may have seen of heard of people dissolving baby teeth in a can of coke, and the same thing happens to carbonaceous minerals in acidified ocean water. So organisms with calcium carbonate shells like shellfish and coral grow slower and will likely soon reach the point where their structures are dissolving faster than they grow. This kicks the legs out of the base of the ocean's food web, and will largely collapse ocean life in near shore areas with the exception of algae and jellyfish.</p>
<p>Finally, since the earth is currently being shifted out of equilibrium, the weather patterns are behaving like a top that is starting to topple, with extreme systems swinging across the globe. We are getting high pressure systems that park themselves over an area for weeks at a time, blasting the area with heat. In the ocean, this can kill corals, and much of the earth's coral reefs are already dying off as a result of these extended heat waves. Over land they reduce crop yields and can kill people. We have a circumpolar band of wind called the polar vortex that will start to meander, bringing snow to Florida and dropping temperatures across the Eastern US by 10-15 degrees C below normal in the middle of winter for weeks at a time, killing native plants and animals that aren't adapted to being able to survive that kind of cold for that long. These shifting weather patterns also change climate in areas, such that some areas will see extended drought such that there will no longer be enough water for the people that currently live there. In other areas, heavier rainfall increase flooding and landslide events, which cause millions to billions of dollars of damage to communities and kill people.</p>
<p>Any time the world goes through a climactic shift, it becomes less habitable to the species that were adapted to the old patterns. Because of the interconnectedness of ecosystems, these effects ripple in a positive feedback loop that drives up extinction rates in a runaway process that can radically alter the biome. This is not good for humans in the short run or the long run.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This diagram explains it well:</p>
<p><a href="https://goo.gl/images/gZWzAs" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/images/gZWzAs</a></p>
<p>The temperate is a bell curve with lots of average temperature, and not much extreme cold or heat. The area under the curve at the hot end is small. </p>
<p>If you increase the average temperature only a little bit (move the curve to the right) the area above a normal hot day gets exponentially bigger. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just for some context, between the coldest parts of an ice age, and the warm parts between them, there's a 6 degrees Celsius difference.</p>
<p>We're supposed to have just come out of a warm period like 8000 years ago and start cooling.  So we're still near the warmest bits.  But instead of cooling, we've already warmed 1 degree Celsius.</p>
<p>So if 6 degrees means a massive portion of the planet covered in ice and glaciers, it's clear that warming a couple degrees Celsius can be extreme on a global scale too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing I haven't seen mentioned here is that the average temperature change will be massively non proportional. It is expected to be two to three times more intense in the poles which fundamentally disrupts the normal flow pf heat from the equator to the poles. This disrupts all of the worlds primary weather systems and the weather gets insanely erratic as it tries to accomidate new equilibriums</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerdy anecdote for people who like numerical modeling and/or environmental engineering. It's relevant I swear.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>In my civil engineering undergrad program we had to learn Matlab and the course-length model we built was of a real mountain in the Sierra Nevada range. At first it was just an (x,y,z) matrix representing a topographic map, but then we started adding in factors like slope (theta x, theta y, theta z), precipitation, solar insolation, etc. Between the decent visualizations and all the data/code, we ended up with a plausible model of snow cover (depth and extent) on a mountain over the course of a year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The baseline model still had bits of snow on northern slopes pretty late into the year.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Running the model with each day's average temperature bumped up by just a degree or two (I forget if we used Celsius or Fahrenheit) was noticeably different in the visualizations. The snow melted more quickly, and less snow accumulated before the melt season began. When considering how important snowmelt is economically... kinda scary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
