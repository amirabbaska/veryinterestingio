		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're trying to tie together two things that are really totally unrelated. Whether something is &quot;private property&quot; or &quot;public property,&quot; in this sense, depends on who owns it. Who owns something doesn't really have to do with who pays for it.</p>
<p>For example, I can get the government to give me a subsidy to build my home in an energy-efficient way. Those are taxpayer dollars, but that doesn't mean the government will own my home; that's not a condition of the subsidy. </p>
<p>Nothing stops public money from going to a private venture--although, hopefully, some public interest will be advanced by the spending. In the case of sports stadiums, the hope is usually that in the long term the stadium will bring a lot of business to the city, and the government will get some of the funding back through taxes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every deal is different, but generally speaking the municipality that built the stadium retains ownership of it.  There's then some split in revenue between the team and the municipality, with the team possibly paying rent.</p>
<p>To give you a rundown on the cost-benefit analysis that municipalities go through when building these, I'll run through the new Raider's Stadium in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>The new Raider's Stadium is an example of a deal that has generated a lot of controversy due to the Raiders getting a 30 year contract to use the stadium in which they are not subject to revenue sharing and do not have to pay rent.  But in exchange for that the Raiders are paying ~60% of the cost of the stadium.</p>
<p>Clark County has a lot of reasons to agree to that deal:</p>
<p>1) Clark County retains ownership of the Stadium, after 30 years they get to do whatever they want with it.</p>
<p>2) They needed a new stadium anyway - the stadium currently used to host the State owned UNLV Rebels and the annual Las Vegas Bowl was built in the 70s and is completely run down.  As part of the deal the Rebels and NCAA get to use the new Raider's Stadium for free.</p>
<p>3) Casinos in Vegas have been hurting since 2008 - their Revenue Per Room, which is a key indicator of their profitability, collapsed in 2008 and only returned to 2007 levels last year.  Its believed that an NFL team in the city will substantially boost casino revenues, which will in turn result in more tax revenue for the County and State.</p>
<p>4) None of the costs associated with the County's contribution to the stadium are being passed on to taxpayers.  The entirety of that cost is being funded by an increase in the County's hotel tax.  The people that this cost is being passed onto (the Casinos) are supportive of the tax increase.</p>
<p>So from the Raider's perspective this is a good deal because they pay 60% of the cost of a new stadium.  While they don't own the stadium, they get all of the benefits of ownership for 30 years.</p>
<p>From the County's perspective this is a good deal because they pay 40% of the cost of a new stadium - and they were going to have to build a new stadium soon anyways to house their publicly owned college football team.  While they don't get the direct benefits of owning a stadium for the 30 years of the Raider's lease, the County doesn't have to pay any money out of pocket to have the stadium built.  Meanwhile, Casino revenue and County tax receipts are projected to increase substantially as a result of an NFL team relocating to the city.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory, the tax revenue from the additional economic activity that the stadium (well the sport that requires the stadium) will offset whatever subsidies are given to build the stadiums. </p>
<p>A somewhat &quot;incorrect&quot; but not necessarily bad reason is that it brings work to the region. Building a stadium requires a lot of work. Like a LOT of work. A single stadium could employ hundreds or maybe thousands of people for several years. If whatever politicians who approve subsidies sneak in a stipulation that the labor and/or materials must come from companies within their districts that will likely be looked on favorably by voters, because people like having a job, and if that guy is responsible for you having a job, you might be more inclined to vote for him to be re-elected.</p>
<p>A more realistic reason is &quot;bribes&quot; likely in somewhat legal forms. Donations to campaigns if subsidies are approved, funding to the opposition if subsidies aren't approved. That type of stuff. </p>
<p>Ultimately it tends to be an amalgamation of all three. Maybe some other stuff I haven't touched on. It is definitely a touchy subject, a lot of people have very strong feelings about it. And it's especially easy to decry when a team leave that city (hey St. Louis) because now there's just a big ol unoccupied stadium. Best case scenario it's a huge eyesore, worst case scenario vagrants and homeless people take over. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Big corporation comes in, ask 30 cities to bid on who's going to get a nice local football team. The local football team will create a tons of benefits for the local cities, but the more important one is that it will be a huge entertainment for the people and that's what people want.</p>
<p>The 30 cities start the bid war, and the highest bidder go as far as building the stadium for them, and giving it for free. The winning city of the bids lose money, but gains a local football team. </p>
<p>Voil√†. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The major reason boils down to Wealthy people being very good at convincing middle class and other people to do things that aren't in the middle class person's benefit, but are in the wealthy person's benefit.  There really is no good reason for most locality to be involved in stadium funding.  The economics are pretty clear, and it isn't worth to the community the amount spent on the stadium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
