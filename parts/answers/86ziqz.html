There is an automatic cycle you usually donâ€™t notice around breathing and swallowing.
The rabies infection of the neurones controlling that cause it to become unreliable.
An infected person starts to have trouble swallowing and the negative reinforcement of trying to swallow and choking causes an involuntary anxiety or fear around doing it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>[This thread] (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/28jff7/why_does_rabies_cause_a_fear_of_water/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/28jff7/why_does_rabies_cause_a_fear_of_water/</a>) answers this question.</p>
<p>It has not been shown in the literature that behavioral aversion to water in humans increases transmission of the virus. Humans are actually a dead-end host for rabies so this makes no sense in terms of natural selection. </p>
<p>Aggression in animals, however, does increase transmission, so this is more likely an evolutionary adaptation of the virus to influence behavior to increase the chance of transmission to another host. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
