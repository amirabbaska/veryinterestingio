		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastic containers are to various extents permeable. Spag sauce is oily and deeply pigmented.</p>
<p>Warming oils makes them less viscous, making them more easily penetrate the porous plastic, staining it. This process is enhanced by the significant volume of pigment.</p>
<p>Since the pigment is easily seen, even small amounts are visible. To shift the stain you'll need patience, washing soap and more heat.</p>
<p>Seal your spag sauce in glass containers and never have this problem again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most dishwasher manuals state not to rinse dishes with spaghetti sauce on them before washing as the water rinse will set the sauce in the pores of the dish, whereas the washing soda in the dishwasher would scrub it off before it can sink in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
