		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>my personal theory has always been related to melatonin and cortisol levels.</p>
<p>cortisol suppresses the immune system, melatonin stimulates it. this is why coughing, runny nose, inflammatory pains are worse at night when cortisol is low and melatonin is high.</p>
<p>however, cortisol normally peaks shortly after waking up(giving you energy and making you feel more alert) so you shouldn't have worse symptoms at that time.</p>
<p>cortisol makes you more alert and reduces runny nose because it increases the sensitivity of alpha receptors(alpha receptors in your brain keep you awake and alert, while alpha receptors in your submucosal glands(which make and release mucus) reduce mucus production)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possibly allergies.  I am allergic to dust and find my self more stuffed up when I wake up after sleeping in a bed probably covered in dust.  My allergy specialist (didn't know they existed til I saw the bill) said not to bother with hypoallergenic pillows because even though they can remove 90% or more of the allergens the 10% or less will still affect me in the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
