		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Egg is a viscous fluid, and when it moves, anything trapped inside it moves also. Your finger &quot;pushes&quot; the egg away from itself when you go to fish out the eggshell - however, the egg pushes the eggshell away from your finger because it is viscous. Think of how jello would behave if you pushed on it, egg is like a more watery jello.</p>
<p>If you use another eggshell piece to fish it out, you will have more success, the sharp edge of the other eggshell will &quot;cut&quot; through the egg and let you grab the other piece.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The initial resistance and avoidance of your touch by the surface of the yolk is due to high surface tension. This makes sure that minor disturbances dont cause the whole yolk to disintegrate and potentially threaten the embryo.</p>
<p>If you manage to pierce the outer 'skin' (in a fluid dynamical sense) of the yolk though, the high viscosity and low weight of the shell fragment will cause the shell fragment to be transported easily inside the protein liquid by said disturbances.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're getting shells in your eggs then you're cracking them wrong. Most people wrongly believe you should crack an egg on an edge (for example a bowl's edge). You should be cracking an egg on a flat surface like a counter or plate as this will avoid splintering the shell. <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5789402/crack-eggs-on-flat-surfaces-for-less-shell-and-better-safety" target="_blank">http://lifehacker.com/5789402/crack-eggs-on-flat-surfaces-for-less-shell-and-better-safety</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
