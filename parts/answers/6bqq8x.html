		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You brain will tend to 'zone out' on certain tasks that are done over and over again.  Basically it tries to minimize sensory over stimulation.</p>
<p>That's why you can remember an event (Omg a car just ran the stop sign and almost hit me), but you might not remember the make/model/LP unless you are trained or conditioned to force yourself to remember these details.</p>
<p>For someone who has been driving a lot, most of what you are doing is basic motor functions; scan the road, move the steering wheel left/right to keep inside the line, follow the speed of the car in front of you.   This is also why non aggressive driving people tend to run red lights.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>because YOU WERE driving normally; your brain just doesn't bother remembering the mundane, so it only seemed like you were half-awake. it doesn't take a lot of awareness to stay between the white lines and make sure no one swerves into you, so your brain wanders to things it finds more stimulating, like daydreaming about being rich so you could hire a driver to chauffeur you around.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just taking a shot at it here. Would love to see a more in depth explanation.</p>
<p>I think this would be impossible to someone new to driving. Because someone is familiar with the process the brain doesn't need to focus on it as much and simply defaults to that process. Allowing us to dedicate more resources to other thoughts. </p>
<p>It's like writing a big block of code every time you needed to use that code, or simply declaring a function, and then calling that function when you need it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember this from psych class</p>
<p>Sometimes when we perform a routine behavior our brain decides it doesn't need to commit the events to long term memory. </p>
<p>It's a fairly infrequent phenomenon but can be startling when you pull up to your driveway and suddenly realize you do not have any memory of getting home. You weren't necessarily zoned out, you probably reacted appropriately to traffic, it's just your brain decided to stop recording for a few minutes </p>
<p>Similar to getting black out drunk... It's not a failure to recall memories, it's that the memories were never recorded in the first place </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just saw something about this recently.  Your brain goes into &quot;auto pilot&quot; basically...</p>
<p>&quot;The researchers suspect this apparent paradox is likely a function performed by a specific part of the brain called the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC.</p>
<p>Pavlidis says that the ACC is compensating for our distractions, and it automatically kicks in when the need arises. In the case of driving, the ACC counterbalances a strong jitter to the left with an instant and equally strong jitter to the right, and vice versa. The ACC works to offset all this veering, resulting in exceptionally straight driving. Remarkably, weâ€™re largely unaware that this is even happening.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
