<p>Though I know most don't come here for a long read so here's the tl;dr:</p>
<p>The hole being discovered contributed greatly to its reversal. Had it not been, it would have been quite a catastrophe. It's expected to be completely healed by 2050.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two things:</p>
<p>The ozone hole has always been a temporary phenomenon. It occurs in early spring in the Southern hemisphere for a period of a few weeks to a few months depending on conditions. This is due to the dynamics of ozone creation/depletion and the buildup of ozone destroying chemicals in the upper atmosphere along with conditions that maximize ozone depletion (polar stratospheric clouds and, ironically, ultraviolet light from the Sun) overwhelming the rate of ozone creation.</p>
<p>Over the past few decades the acknowledgement of ozone depletion as a serious environmental problem led to international efforts to curb CFC production and emissions which has dramatically reduced CFC pollution and brought ozone depletion under control. CFCs are fairly long-lived in the atmosphere (which is why they were used and why they are problematic) so it will take decades for the ozone layer to fully &quot;heal&quot; but currently we're on track for that to happen within the next 25-40 years or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember Norwegian rivers and forests being damaged by acid rain on the prevailing westerly winds from the UK.
We had coal fired power and lots of factories then, I think it was the 70s.
These are now in China where pollution is a serious problem. Perhaps they ignore any acid rain there, though polluted air crosses the sea to southern Japan.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
