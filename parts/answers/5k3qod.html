But any realistic black hole will likely have <em>some</em> angular momentum. In that case, it's not longer spherically symmetric but rather axially symmetric about the axis of rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is almost no such thing as a non-rotating BH. In fact, there is almost no such thing as a non-rotating ANYTHING in the universe, although the universe itself is considered to not spin.</p>
<p>Non-rotating BH's are possible, just incredibly unlikely. Any time that two objects in space approach each other, they end up giving opposite angular momentums to each other as they collide, or near-miss, or go into orbit with each other. The reason for this is that it is so rare for two objects to approach each other in a perfect head-on collision. Just like when two cars hit in an off-center head-on collision, both cars spin around a time or two before coming to rest. Same thing happens in space, except no one hears the crash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how perfectly spherical the event horizon of a black hole is, but I do know that the most perfectly spherical object is a neutron star. I remember reading something along the lines of, 'if a neutron star was the size of Earth, the highest mountain would be 5cm tall'. Fascinating stuff in the most extreme circumstances. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
