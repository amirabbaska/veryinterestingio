I don't know about anyone else but I literally depend on my alarm to wake me up and sometimes I'll even sleep right through it.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So your brain has lots of nerves all smashed together in the center of you brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus. It's a very accurate clock inside your brain! We naturally look for patterns all the time and so does the nucleus. So when you get in a pattern of sleeping and waking up at the same time the nucleus at those times release a chemical called cortisol and a few others to wake you up! An alarm clock actually causes a lot of stress, so your brain pushes those chemicals out before it thinks it will go off! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body has an internal clock called the circadian rhythm, it's overseen by this part of your brain called the superchiasmatic nucleus. The SCN controls the biological rhythm based on a mix of internal and external cues. The external influencers like day light and the alarm clock you mention or any timed event are called zeitgebers. Pretty cool eh? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a simple case of confirmation bias. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias</a></p>
<p>Basically, you only notice when it happens and ignore all the times it doesn't happen to strengthen your preconceived belief. For instance, I am sure there have been times where you woke up in the middle of the night for no real reason, but because these events are meaningless to you, you ignore/ forget about them. When you wake up and it's 5 minutes till you wanted to wake up, you tend to remember that more because it's more interesting and appears to be rarer. Same goes for bus stops and what not. </p>
<p>This is also the reason why it may seem like stores never have your size of clothes. You only really notice when they don't and never when they do. </p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
