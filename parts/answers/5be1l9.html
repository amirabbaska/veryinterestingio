		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It takes a thousand years to generate 3 centimeters of top soil, so the damage is permanent. In fact, soil loss is a continuing problem. In the Midwest, famously known for its deep topsoil, some areas have lost up to half of their topsoil since the end of the dust bowl because of intensive industrial farming.</p>

<p>There are reports that the government's estimates of soil erosion are seriously off, by anywhere from 100% to 200%.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check out Ken Burns's <em>The Dust Bowl</em>.  Not only is it a great documentary that addresses the lead-up to and the development of the dust bowl, but how a government was able to rally and somewhat mitigate an environmental disaster for the national good (shocking, I know).</p>
<p>The end isn't exactly positive, as it indicates the region is still over-taxing the environment to this day through abuse of the Ogallala aquifer, and that farmers aren't getting any support to modernize their irrigation systems (which, by some estimates, can save up from 10%-30% of the water they normally use).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are still some lingering results from the dust bowl, at least in Oklahoma that I know of. Dune fields in northern Oklahoma were stabilized by vegetation that was lost during the dust bowl, and have not yet fully recovered, resulting in more sand moving around than before. Presumably this still results in dust storms and difficult agricultural conditions in parts of the state.</p>
<p>Though these are not likely permanent over a long enough time scale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
