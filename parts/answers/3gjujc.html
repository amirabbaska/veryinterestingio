		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, Calculus in its most basic form is the mathematics of change. So, if I'm in a car and I'm at a red light and it turns green, I change a whole bunch of things. Obviously, I start to move forward, so my location or position has changed. Also, I have increased my speed, because I was going 0mph at first and now I'm moving. In fact, you could keep going, and find that the rate of change of my speed is changing as well, and we could go on and on. One of the biggest reasons we have study physics is because we want to predict things, especially when it comes to motion. In order to understand motion, we need to understand how things change and use that to make predictions. Now, when things are constant, or unchanging, it is pretty easy to find things. However, when we start to study things that are not constant (which is more like the real world), it's not so easy. Look at the graphs <a href="http://imgur.com/I9Xnx2V" target="_blank">here</a>. Notice how easy it would be to predict the blue line. It increases at the same rate, which is why it is a straight line. Now, the orange graph is more complicated, and its hard to make predictions about it. I mean, it goes down pretty fast, then up, but then back down again. Without calculus, we wouldn't be able to find things about this graph, such as how fast it is changing <em>at one specific point</em>. This is easy for the line because it is the same all the time. Calculus gives us the tools to solve these problems.</p>
<p>Edit- Clarity  </p>
<p>Edit 2- Wow, obligatory &quot;this blew up&quot; and &quot;RIP my inbox&quot;. Thank you all so much! I typed this out last night pretty quickly, and I could go on and on about math and how beautiful and elegant it is. I don't have much time right now, but I promise that if you post any questions I'm more than happy to answer them, and I will deliver! And again, thank you all so much, I was originally a Physics education major but have since switched to just a Physics track, but I hope to teach someday. If there is interest, I'd certainly go into more depth into topics like Physics, from Newton's laws and maxwell's equations for E&amp;M or Calculus 1-3 concepts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A car doubles its speed from 1 mph every minute for 5 minutes, eventually going 32 miles per hour. </p>
<p>What was the average speed?</p>
<p>A rough (but not very good) estimate is that it was going 1 mph at the start and 32 at the end. Average of about 16 mph.</p>
<p>But wait, if it doubled every minute then it only got to 16 mph at the start of the last minute. For the other four minutes it was slower than that.</p>
<p>So let's add up the speed at the end each minute and divide by 5 to get a better estimate. 2+4+8+16+32 = 64 divided by five is 12.8 mph.</p>
<p>That's a better average speed estimate. Now we could do the same for seconds.... milliseconds.... and as we approach the smallest time value (aproaching zero) you get a very good average speed estimate. </p>
<p>That's a fairly roughshod intro to integral calculus. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Newton's primary motivation for inventing integral calculus was to prove the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_theorem" target="_blank">Shell Theorem</a> which was fundamental to his analysis of planetary motion. The shell theorem says that the gravitational attraction of a sphere (occupying a finite volume of space) is the same as that for a point mass located at the center of the sphere.</p>
<p>This is not obvious (other shapes do not have this property), and needed development of the integral calculus to  prove. Newtons Law of Gravitation applies to <em>point masses</em> and he needed to prove to himself that a spherical distributed mass behaves like a point mass (concentrated at the center) before he released his gravitational theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Inventing Calculus was almost a side effect.</p>
<p>He was interested in seeing the math behind the movement. He of course started with what was already possible in math. It simply was not sophisticated enough. </p>
<p>The movement of an object where only one gravitational force dominates the movement is relatively easy. The math before Calculus could be used to find that formula.</p>
<p>The problems arise when there are multiple bodies interacting with each other. The position of Mars influences the position of Earth, but Earth influences Mars. This moves both planets into new positions at the next instant, where they influence each other again. Before Calculus this could not be calculated.</p>
<p>In order to calculate this complex set of influences new techniques in math were necessary. </p>
<p>The new techniques are called Calculus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Calculus is used to determine things like the velocity of an object at a given time, when it is under acceleration so the velocity is not constant. The problem with trying to do that without calculus is that velocity is defined as &quot;rate of change of position&quot;. In order to calculate the rate of change in position (without calculus), you need two different locations and a known time interval between them, which makes calculating the velocity of an object at a single point impossible to calculate. </p>
<p>Enter calculus.</p>
<p>Using calculus, you can determine a <em>limit</em> value, meaning that you basically just keep moving to a cost and closer point in time until the two points are effectively on top of one another and determine what number is being approached. </p>
<p>Working from those limits, we can find derivative equations. A derivative of an equation that gives position of an object at time <em>t</em> will give the velocity of the object at time <em>t</em>, and the derivative of that equation will give an equation for the acceleration of that object at that time. This can also be done on reverse, and is called integration. Integration is useful when you know that something will be under constant acceleration and wish to find a formula for its velocity or position at any given time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
