		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're still in contact with both so if that ceased unexpectedly then we'd at least know something went wrong. More than likely it'd have been some kind of failure on one of the crafts but knowing it had crashed into something would be pretty difficult to figure out. Perhaps if part of a spaceship was hit and the trajectory changed or it went into some kind of tumble then we might be able to deduce that it was hit.</p>
<p>In the long term though, space is pretty empty of large things that it could crash into. Or rather, space is so large that the chances of hitting those few things are incredibly slim, which has been discussed in previous questions before. So could it crash into something in the distant future way out there? Sure, it could. However, shutdown of the instruments will be on the timescale of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voyager_1#Future_of_the_probe" target="_blank">decade</a>, so we wouldn't be able to tell after that anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Space is really, really empty. The probability to hit anything is negligible unless you aim for some target. While we have contact with the Voyager probes, you can ask the same about the Pioneer probes - launched 5 years earlier, a bit closer, and inactive now. We don't know if they are still on course, but the probability is something like &gt;99.999%.</p>
<p>All 5 probes that leave the solar system (2*Pioneer, 2*Voyager, New Horizons) will need hundreds of thousands of years to get close to other stars. Where &quot;close&quot; is something like a light year distance, or a few hundred times the current distance to the Voyager probes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To help illustrate the emptiness of space, read up on what asteroid fields/belts are really like inside. You might picture some incredibly dense cluster of rocks floating through space like in star wars, but this couldn't be further from the truth (that description is more fitting to a planetary ring system like Saturn's). If you were to enter an asteroid belt, you would most likely never know it, and would probably never see an asteroid the whole time. Similarly, asteroids within the belt are unlikely to collide except on a very large time scale (every few millions of years). If that's what an asteroid belt is like, just picture what interstellar space is like. There's practically nothing out there at all to crash into save from some very diffuse gas and dust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unlike sci-fi movies portray it space is mostly nothing. There's lots of stuff but the distances are so vast an object the size of one of our satellites is very unlikely to encounter anything. Imagine a dust particle passing through an empty room x10000000  or more - sure, there are walls and shelves but ...
Now a landfill we made of our near- Earth orbit is a different matter.
The fact that we're still receiving a signal from these man-made objects is nothing short of a miracle. And if we (the Human Kind) can do this we have a chance.
Otherwise, go Elon Musk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
