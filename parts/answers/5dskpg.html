		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Debunking a popular misunderstanding of DNA:</p>
<p>Your DNA does not contain enough information to describe every single cell and how they should be layed out.  What it contains are patterns.  So for instance, your skin is created by a pattern which says &quot;turn the outer layer of stem cells into skin cells and have them grow until they are so-and-so thick&quot;.  The cells themselves grow in semi-random ways as long as they obey the pattern.  The whorls and rings in your finger pads are an example of this.  The pattern of the finger pad is dictated by which cells divided when, and where they happened to be.  With the exact same DNA, you will end up with a different skin pattern every time.  This is true for identical twins, but it is also true for clones (assuming you had the technology to create them).  Even if you grew two clones in identical tanks, the small bits of random chance in the arrangement of cells during development would give them different fingerprints.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fingerprints are impressions of the collection of friction ridges (also called dermal ridges or dermal papillae) of the skin. We have these to help us grip things, especially when it's wet, and also to improve tactile sensations.</p>
<p>Fingerprints begin to develop about the 10th week of pregnancy and are largely complete by around the end of the 4th month. The ridge pattern is determined by the underlying interface between the dermal papillae of the dermis (the underlying layer of skin) and the interpapillary pegs of the epidermis (the outermost layer of skin).<br />
Its development is thought to be influenced by many different factors such as blood pressure, temperature, oxygen levels in the blood, both maternal and fetal, the position adopted in the womb by the fetus, the touching of fingers onto the sac and amniotic fluid, nutrition of the mother, hormone levels, etc.</p>
<p>That's a lot of different factors that all change frequently, by the minute or second in some casese. So it's almost impossible that any two fetuses would develop under identical conditions, even in the same uterus, thus the ridges all develop slightly differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Since both fetuses are not exposed to the <em>exact</em> same conditions, even though they're in close proximity, their fingerprints end up different. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The chance of two people having the same prints is about one in 64 million. So we know that two people may have the same fingerprints. The chances that these 2 people ever meet is relatively low, so it doesnt cause a problem....usually.</p>
