		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the PNW we very rarely use the seated back roll entry technique unless entering the water from a boat like a zodiac or similar. Usually we use a giant stride entry when entering from boats or docks. But the reason for the seated back roll is because when you're diving you have a lot of heavy and loose gear, and you want to be in control of it all and yourself the whole time. The seated back roll (SBR from now on) is really good for wrangling your hoses and accessories in front of you where it can all be held onto while at the same time holding the clasp of your weight belt. It also allows you to lead with the hardest heaviest and least fragile part of your body and gear: the tank. If say, a log floated up next to the boat while you were managing all your gear and getting ready to take a dip, and you didn't see it, when you roll backwards, your tank shields you from the blow of hitting the log from a small height with sometimes nearly 100 lbs of gear on top of you. It also serves to propeller you away from the boat quickly and with little effort. This way, you clear the boat, which may be bobbing up and down on rough seas, as well as allow someone else to enter behind you. It also serves to, usually, orient you facing the boat when you surface so you can signal the boat that you're OK and do not need assistance. Also, if the seas are you specially rough, your tank breaks the water for you so you don't get smacked in the face with an upswell right as the boat breaks the crest of the previous wave and you fall face first into it (no fun). </p>
<p>Tl;Dr - it's easier and safer than the alternatives sometimes.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If they don't go back first, they go feet first. Both for several reasons.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Out of the water, the tank is <strong>heavy</strong>. Imagine doing a belly flop while wearing a backpack full of cinder blocks. You hit the water, then the pack hits you. Ouch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hitting the water face first means you get the mask smacked into your face. Ouch again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some kinds of SCUBA gear will have bits extending behind your head. Going face first means you have a good chance of smacking the back of your head on them. Not fun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you hit the water, you are less concerned about landing on the guy that is already in the water than you are about the next guy in line landing on <em>you</em>. Going back first means you can see what's going on above you and move if needed.</p>
</li>
<li>Lastly, sometimes shit happens and you need to quickly ditch your gear. If you are face down, you have to get out from under the stuff after you undo the buckles, risking getting something getting caught in a stray loop. Face up means everything is below you, thus much less risk of getting snagged.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, divers have two main ways to ‘jump in’ from a scuba dive boat:</p>
<p>The Giant Stride Entry (requires a stable platform from where to step off; common in larger boats)</p>
<p>The Backward Roll Entry (preferred technique when the boat is smaller, less steady, and lacks a secure platform or ladder)</p>
<p>Plus, think about this: walking around in fins is difficult and you're carrying the weight of a scuba tank (not light)- it's easier to roll backwards off the boat than to walk to the edge and stride off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple explanation for a five year old:  </p>
<p>Because it's easier to sit on the side of the boat and fall backward into the water than it is to lift your feet with fins, stand on the narrow side wall of the boat, balance yourself for a second without falling back into the boat, and then jump forward into the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One method is to take a step off the boat into the water - this works well when your boat has a platform that you can step straight off of into the water. If you're trying to enter the water over a gunwale going forwards, your flippers will get in the way, making it difficult to smoothly enter the water. Instead, divers sit on the gunwale, which allows them to smoothly lean back into the water, rather than making an awkward forward step over the gunwale.</p>
<p>Sitting on the gunwhale also helps ensure you won't hit your tank or head against anything as you enter the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
