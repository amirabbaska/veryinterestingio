		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Multiple things can go wrong when beached. I think the biggest reasons are their own weight (for really large whales, they can crush organs) and heat exhaustion. However, they can get dehydrated or even suffocate/drown if their blowholes are covered.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what's already been said, most of the time when a Marine Mammal beaches itself there is something already wrong with it. It is very rare for a healthy whale or dolphin to end up beached. They are typically strong and smart enough to avoid getting caught in currents that leave them in the shallow Waters and low tides. Lots of times the whales and dolphins that end up beached are already dying and exhausted from something else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marine animals have evolved with the added effect of not having to support their own weight because of living in water. Take all that mass and put it on hard land and they don’t do so well. They can live for a bit but eventually they crush themselves</p>
<p>Edit: if you wanna kind of know what it’s like, lay down on the floor on your chest. At least for me, my chest/heart starts feeling uncomfortable and it feels harder to breathe.</p>
<p>Edit: guys it doesn’t start hurting immediately...if I lie on the floor on my chest for like 5 min it starts to get mildly uncomfortable...I’m fine relax</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their own weight is crushing them. Their bodies aren't made to sustain their structure on land. It's like suddenly something very heavy is sitting on you so you have trouble breathing and your organs and ribs might get damaged.</p>
<p>Also, their skin is surprisingly sensitive to sunlight. They can easily get sunburns. They also dry out if they stay on land. This is why people try to at least put wet blankets on them until it's possible to drag them back into the ocean. On a hot day whales on land might die from heatstrokes. Their skin isn't able to sweat. </p>
<p>Some whales (smaller ones) might also be unable to prevent falling over to the side when they are in shallow water. Which means their breathing hole might get under water and they drown. </p>
<p>Edit: Some words.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In order for them to be able to breathe, their ribcage would have to expand (as normally), but with it, it would have to lift their bodyweight. Their muscles in the ribcage are not made for this.</p>
<p>In the water, this wouldn't be a problem, because the bodyweight isn't pushing down on their lungs anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
