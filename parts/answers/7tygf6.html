One of those set pairs is the XY pair. During meiosis the chromosomes split up. 2 sperm cells get a X while 2 get a Y.  It's a 50/50 shot just which sperm cell fertilizes the egg.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The key to understanding this is to recall chromosome pairing. Normal cells have chromosomes that come in homologous pairs (i.e. two versions of DNA coding for basically the same genes, though with variations. Each chromosome has a version they inherited from their mother and father.). The 23rd chromosome, the sex chromosome, pair is where the X/Y come into play. Females have a paired set of X-chromomsomes, while males instead of an X paired with a Y. </p>
<p>Why does this matter? Well, when sperm are being produced, at one stage  a cell division occurs that splits the pairs apart. Every sperm gets only one version of each chromosome. For #23, that means each sperm has either the X or the Y. There are only two choices, so there's ~50% chance to have either. </p>
<p>Why does this result in ~50% males and females? When the sperm fertilizes the egg, and the chromosomes are paired up again, the maternal side only contributes an X 100% of the time. Whether the embryo will result in a male or female (in gross, simple terms), depends on whether the sperm has an X or Y, which was 50:50.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its not actually a 50/50 shot, its closer to 51/48 M/F split, this is due to another process which I am not qualified to speak on that evolved due to males' annoying habit of dying before they reach sexual maturity, the 51/49 split ensures that there's roughly a 50/50 split by the time they're mature</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
