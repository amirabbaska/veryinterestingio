		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>edit</em> I think [upinthecloudz answer] (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5ybbqj/is_there_a_word_similar_to_resolution_in/deorpdz/" target="_blank">https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5ybbqj/is_there_a_word_similar_to_resolution_in/deorpdz/</a>) might be more pertinent to the details/bonus of the original question</p>
<p>&quot;visual acuity&quot; is the catch-all term for ability to distinguish a spatial gradient in light quality. the visual system breaks retinal images into three 'opponent channels', including bright/dark, red/green, and blue/yellow, and each of these has separate associate acuities, deriving from the different sampling of requisite wavelengths by the types of photoreceptors that feed into each channel. human visual acuity is best for gradient in absolute luminance, i.e. bright-dark gradients - there we can distinguish (at best) no more than ~50 cycles per degree of visual angle. the 'chromatic' channels have much worse acuity, topping out at between 10-20 cycles per degree.</p>
<p>a basic reference on this:

<p>there are practical upshots to this, including that you can store the color components of compressed video at lower spatial resolution and the loss will not be noticed, but if you do the same with the luminance component the degradation will be much more visible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For artificial optical systems, resolution is the right term to use when determining the minimum distance where two points of different light intensity are distinguishable in the final image, but you aren't really concerned with that in the example of Cu2+ solution, because the photons at various wavelengths are passing through the solution at every point. There isn't just one part that's passing 400nm light and another that allows 450nm light and another that's letting 500nm light through, all parts are passing all wavelengths, so the distance between various color intensities is 0, and resolution is of no concern.</p>
<p>In terms of human color perception, what you need to keep in mind is that your eyes approximate color by combining signals defining the intensity of light in various spectra (RGB cones), and also that photons add to each other.</p>
<p>If you are thinking of all the colors in the rainbow combining together to black (or dark muddy brown, or whatever), then you are thinking of subtractive color mixing, which is what happens when using pigments or light filters. This is what the Cu2+ is doing in removing red (~600nm) light.  BUT, then the REST of the spectrum will add together, so your eyes will perceive the remaining spectrum as the color inverse of the color which is the lowest intensity among your photoreceptors. </p>
<p>For each color combination this works:</p>
<p>Red: Low intensity<br />
Green: Normal intensity<br />
Blue: Normal intensity<br />
Result: Cyan  </p>
<p>Red: Normal intensity<br />
Green: Low intensity<br />
Blue: Normal intensity<br />
Result: Magenta  </p>
<p>Red: Normal intensity<br />
Green: Normal intensity<br />
Blue: Low intensity<br />
Result: Yellow  </p>
<p>This is also why ink is CMY instead of RGB, as it allows us to remove the signal to each photoreceptor separately in a printed page. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a more general sense than most of the answers, this is effectively asking about the energy resolution of an experiment. As other answers have covered, colour is how the human eye interprets different frequencies of light. With light (and actually everything else, but let's focus on light for now), it's energy is directly proportional to its frequency. So we say that the energy resolution is how finely a detector can measure the difference in the frequencies of light. This is a common measurement stated for particle physics detectors, telescopes, and most relevantly spectrometers, which characterize light by its spectrum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would use the word 'discrimination.' As a similar example in biology, two point discrimination refers to the minimum diatance between two points touching the skin until the idividual can no longer feel two separate stimuli. Your fingertips have better discrimination and you can tell there are two points touchig when they are just 1-2mm apart. On the bottom of your feet however even if the two stimuli are 10mm apart they can still be felt as just one stimulus. The reason is due to the number, density and area of sensory neurons in the skin. You can try this yourself using an object like a compass used to draw circles  and touching the pensil tip and metal tip to your skin at different distances apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if a word exists, but intuitively I would expect the distance between the two points to be proportional to your distance to those points.</p>
<p>My reasoning is that colour is detected by a bunch of cones at the back of your eyes (which basically gives a maximum resolution) and despite the biological lens at the front we can only focus on a point so far away. This is actually similar to cameras, so you can think about not being able to see separate colours from super-close points in the same way a photo of Earth doesn't show what a specific tree looks like.</p>
<p>The choice of colours might also make an impact.</p>
<p>[edit]</p>
<p>Did some experimentation with an image I made, comparing the effects of a tiny checkerboard and a flat colour.</p>
<p>Note that this is inherently subject to bias because the image is displayed on a monitor instead of with paper, and I hand-picked the flat colour.</p>
<p>The effects are <em>extremely</em> interesting, moving your head up and down change their relative appearance.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/hft8fLc.png" target="_blank">Here's the image</a> (you should right-click and &quot;view image&quot;), but be aware that it hurts to look at.</p>
<p>More to the point, if you're close enough you can see the checkerboard but if you're far away it's a solid colour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
