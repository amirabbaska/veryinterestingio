Tea pots are designed to heat water to a specific temperature, where the microwave can produce irregular and inconsistent results. In reality, most people will never know a difference and most tea consumers can't taste the difference. If you are among the few that can taste the difference or can't take the mockery, a teapot may be good for you. Otherwise, enjoy that quick heat from the microwave-induced vibrating water molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh good lord. </p>
<p>Disclaimer: I am a tea snob.</p>
<p>I'll start by saying there's nothing <em>inherently</em> wrong with using a microwave, <em>so long as you're only using it to get the water to the correct temperature</em>. </p>
<p>Tea is a lot more delicate than most people think. You do not -- I repeat, <strong>not</strong> use boiling water for tea, and you never, <em>ever</em> boil the tea in the water! </p>
<p>You need very specific temperatures, and very specific steeping times for different kinds of tea. For example, green tea needs to be steeped for 1-2 minutes in water that is 80 degrees C (175F). That too is generalised - some green teas must only be steeped for 30 seconds! </p>
<p>Steeping the tea for too long will make it bitter. Same with the temperature being too high or too low! That's why people keep dumping sugar and milk in tea. If you make tea correctly, <em>you don't need to add anything to it</em> to make it delicious. </p>
<p>Now if you're using some, shall we say, non-delicate tea, like the kind that comes in tea bags, then it's not a big deal since that's not going to be delicious anyway. And there are more resilient teas that can handle a wider range (in fact, there are some Display Teas that are designed to have hot water added to them for an entire night). </p>
<p>As a sidenote: the people across the pond are in a glass house about tea. They know <em>nothing</em> about brewing. Unless &quot;the pond&quot; is the pacific ocean and you're going to China, and also 200+ years back in time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It doesn't.  </p>

<p>...you're just going to pour the heated water in a cup and add the tea bag so it's not like the actual tea is going in the microwave.</p>

<p>I always microwave the teabag in a cup of water; do it most every day, works just fine.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Microwaves don't heat evenly, and hence there are several possible results, none perfect: cold spots in the water, superheated water that boils vigorously on contact with the tea, or water that's been heated long enough in the microwave to come to a rolling boil, at which point there's a good chance that the oxygen has been boiled out.  All of these can affect the flavor of the tea.</p>
<p>Most people who are into tea agree that most black teas should be seeped with water at 212°F(100°C).  A tea kettle or hot pot, whether electric or stovetop, heats from the bottom, creating convection currents that stir the water, allowing the temperature to be uniform. Plus it's easier to know exactly when the water reaches the desired temperature. <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2013/06/04/microwaving_water_for_tea_why_are_the_results_so_lousy.html" target="_blank">Partial source</a></p>
<p>At the risk of being a tea snob, if you're adding a tea bag to a cup into which you've poured hot water, you're already compounding the problem. The water will cool off from the cup, so when you add the bag, you're dealing with water that's already colder than it should be. Whenever I use bagged tea (mostly just herbals), I always put the bag in first and then pour the water onto it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Different teas need to be brewed at different temperatures and for different lengths of time to get their proper flavor.</p>
<p>Black teas for example are usually steeped at higher temperatures (200-212F) for longer periods of time, whereas a white/green tea that is more delicate is generally steeped at 150-180F.</p>
<p>Different teas have different chemical makeups which greatly affect the flavor of the tea, and how long and hot it can be brewed at before it gets bitter and ruins the taste. Brew your jasmine needle at 212F and you're gonna burn the hell out of it, making it bitter and disgusting.</p>
<p>Many pre-packages teas that you would buy from the store (Lipton, store brands etc.) are very fine, sometimes powdery, and generally just low quality tea. The finer the particles are, the more surface area the water hits, and hence the faster the tannins and other flavors infuse into the water.</p>
<p>The proper way to get the best quality tea in terms of flavor would be to:</p>
<ul>
<li>use loose leaf teas (the higher the quality, the better the taste)</li>
<li>brew the tea at the proper temperature and length</li>
<li>use freshly brewed water, do not re-heat previously brewed water</li>
<li>use the highest quality water available to you (contaminants in the water can affect the taste)</li>
<li>store your tea in an air-tight storage container, away from other materials that may have a strong aroma (spices for example)</li>
<li>store your tea in a dark area (generally keeping it in a metal tin would do)</li>
</ul>
<p>Like /u/sterlingphoenix said, you want to avoid using boiling water, generally 205-210F at the hottest. If you are using a high quality loose leaf tea, and using water that isn't riddled with hard minerals, you should have a great tasting tea without any sweeteners.</p>
<p>You can of course add sugar, honey, etc. but depending on what kind of sweetener you use, this will greatly affect the flavor of the tea, and in most cases, will hide the true taste of the tea. Good tea does not need to be sweetened, and it's healthier to avoid sweeteners anyhow.</p>
<p>I HIGHLY suggest checking out Adagio Tea (www.adagio.com).</p>
<p>They have a large variety of high quality tea available at an affordable price, plus they don't charge shipping over certain amounts. They also have a rewards programs, clubs (subscriptions) and more. They do a lot of free samples, and limited time tea variants etc. Been buying from them for years now and I am very happy with their prices and quality. The shipping is quick too.</p>
<p>The reality is that there IS a proper way to get the BEST flavor out of the tea. If you are drinking tea to just have something hot to drink, that's fine, but you're really not getting the proper tea. It's kind of like playing your Skyrim on an Xbox instead of a PC :^)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
