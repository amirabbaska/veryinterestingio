		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone from outside the US (but I imagine it applies to many US citizens too!), where does being a &quot;scientist working in a congressional office&quot; place you within the government? Are you a government employee providing advice for the entirety of congress, or are you working more specifically for one group - or maybe even just advising a single member of congress?</p>
<p>(I appreciate it may be hard to answer with great detail given your position of anonymity!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Have their been any that surprisingly passed? (Bill No. would be appreciated.) Thank you for your civil service! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you talk to Congressmen who don't believe in science? Has anyone (lobbyists, special interests, etc) approached you because you are a scientist by training? I heard many researchers are funded by special interests to publish biased studies, not sure if it's effecting scientists working directly in the public sector</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
