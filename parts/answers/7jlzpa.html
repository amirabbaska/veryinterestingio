In this &quot;danger zone&quot; temperature, microorganisms can grow in it that can make you sick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ready meals are typically precooked or freeze dried. This kills bacteria and other things potentially harmful to your health.</p>
<p>It's absolutely fine to reheat rice at home if you freeze it right after you make it, but the longer it sits on the counter, the more bacteria grow. All food is this way.</p>
<p>To be frank, though, reheating the rice that you left in your rice cooker/pot all night isn't really an issue. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bacterium is called Baccillus Cereus and it secretes a toxin which makes you puke and have the shits for 3-7 days. Reheating rice properly will kill the bacteria but doesn't breakdown the toxin.</p>
