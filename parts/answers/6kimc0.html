		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5; TL;DR: Some drugs act directly, some indirectly. This one is more direct, and like what everybody said... <strong>there is just a lot more in your body than usual</strong> (making it harder to breakdown). I'm assuming DMT can just get to your brain without a problem.</p>
<hr />
<p>--less so ELI5... for just getting a base level understandign of how some stuff moves around If you want a scenario to something a little different (to compare to a more indirect action)... let's look at L-Dopa (a parkinson drug not meant to act directly but replenish Dopamine Levels in the Basal Ganglia of the Brain)
We cannot just give a patient Dopamine, because dopamine cannot cross the blood brain barrier.
Also... L-dopa itself can't really do anything, EXCEPT when L-dopa gets broken down into dopamine (which we already have) and that extra dopamine is used to help us out.
L-dopa won't function at all for parkinson's patients if it cannot cross the Blood Brain Barrier (or it is broken down into dopamine before crossing) so most patients receive C-dopa, which (for simplicity's sake) let's just say distracts the body from catching L-dopa so L-Dopa can sneak across the barrier to the brain. Although the actual mechanism is different, because we introduce dopamine in another form, the very general mechanism is the same, we overwhelm the body so it cannot break it down in the usal amount of time.</p>
<p>side note: i just learned ayuhuasca  contains it's own set chemicals that inhibit MAO from breaking down the DMT in ayuhuasca when taken orally</p>
<p>I'm sure i got something wrong somewhere, but i think it serves the purpose well enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DMT naturally occurs in the body in small amounts. DMT also naturally occurs in many species of plants in higher amounts. When people smoke DMT they are smoking the chemical, often extracted from plants, and getting a much larger quantity of DMT into the body than is present naturally.</p>
<p>Edit: /u/Skydvrr is also correct that DMT is not active orally because it quickly gets broken down by MAO enzymes. It can become active orally only if taken concurrently with an inhibitor of MAO enzymes. This is done as the traditional shamanic drink &quot;Ayahuasca.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I gather your body naturally produces DMT and you can consume DMT orally without getting high because of MAO enzymes that our body produces. When smoked you're inhaling the DMT and the enzymes in your tummy don't have time to negate the effects. I'm no scientition so take it for what it's worth. </p>
<p>Edit: To add yes, smoking does bypass the stomach and goes to the lungs and the blood much quicker. Just forgot to add that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter how you consume it, DMT by itself will never get you high. The MAO in the body instantly neutralise the DMT and restricts it's ability to act as a neurotransmitter. DMT is NOT a complex chemical, and is near identical to almost all neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine. DMT is one of the simpler ones, making it a common metabolite, and always present in the body in massive quantities. Monamine oxydase(MAO) is the only reason everybody isn't tripping every second of the day. None of this is simply unknown theory, it is a basic principal in all psychopharmachology. There is no debate about this in the scientific community. </p>
<p>This is also why monoamine oxidase inhibitors can dangerously interact with so many things like milk, soy sauce, and cured meats. The most common side effect of an interaction is serotonin syndrome, where the central nervous system can no longer regulate body temperature. Hyperthernia can take years to fully recover from. You know... if you don't die. This makes ayahuasca one of the most dangerous drugs, and should only be taken under supervision after 2 weeks of a carefully regulated diet.</p>
<p>Smoking DMT will have no effect at all. The only version of DMT that can be absorbed and used by the body immediately and unchanged is 5meo-DMT. It can ingested, insulflated, injected, or freebased. N,N DMT needs to be oxidized before it can be absorbed, and needs to be burned. </p>
<p>Edit: I could be confusing N,N DMT with 5meo-DMT. One of the two has to be oxidized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're ingesting it, when you inhale DMT vapour (or if it's injected) you flood your system with DMT so you send receptors sensitive to DMT into over-drive hence you blast into hyperspace. The trip is short because the body breaks DMT down to normal levels pretty quickly. </p>
<p>So the trip is your body's natural response to the flood of the chemical, which like you say is naturally produced by the brain. Hence the theories that spiritual experiences and such are related to the DMT produced naturally in the brain. </p>
<p>edit
Ayahuasca is a different way of consuming DMT, you drink it in a tea that contains other chemicals which allows your body to absorb the DMT orally and inhibits the breakdown of it, leading to a much longer experience </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
