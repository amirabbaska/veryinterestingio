		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm the guy from that article that went down inside the &quot;Doorway To Hell&quot; (Seriously). When I was there for the expedition, we had two local geologists with us from the oil and gas ministry. They said that there was a plan to drill at an angle from a spot nearby to try and tap into the gas reservoir that's feeding the flaming sinkhole. As far as I know, that plan has not been implemented yet.</p>
<p>Yes, it was an amazing experience being the first person to ever go to the bottom of that place!! Scary as Hell, but worth the effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really depends on how the gas is dispersed in the bedrock and the heat of the area. With continuous fire for such a long time, it might be hard to tell how hot the gas is. It's possible that the gas is already heating past its ignition temperature below the surface, and burns when exposed to oxygen. If that were the case, exposing large pockets of it to the atmosphere by drilling into it might be dangerous. Dealing with liquid and gaseous fuels bring different challenges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big difference is that oil Wells are artificial. One entry to them, and we have an estimate for how big it is. </p>
<p>The door  is a natural cave right? Unknown size and composition? Unknown number of entries, some of which could be small and far away. It might be making it's own fuel by boiling water from an underground source. Or a creek drains to it. Maybe just groundwater in general. We can cap oil Wells, or detonate them and let the resulting dirt smother the fire. We can't do that with a cave complex, not without a lot of work digging down and planting explosives. Doing that would be very dangerous, very expensive, have no positive benefit, and if successful would have far reaching impacts on the area.</p>
<p>We won't do it until the door is the last source of accessible gas/oil, or the location needs to be prepared as humanities last stand against annihilation that can't risk a burning underground cave. (Hyperbole)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First issue, I would think, would be snuffing the fire by denying it oxygen. This would be complicated by the high heat and continually expanding nature of hot gases. At a bare minimum, a wall would have to sunk deep into the ground all the way around the already huge hole in the ground, then some form of heat resistant textile would have to be run out over the hole <em>while</em> being sealed to that wall system to begin denying the flames any form of oxygen.</p>
<p>This is all predicated on the idea that the engineers would tell them that this is even remotely possible and that the fabric would not inflate to the point of rupture or rip the walls out of the ground or rip free of the walls itself.</p>
<p>Maybe it would be enough to deny the flames low-level oxygen and so the heat and gas could be allowed to vent from the top of the inflated baloon. Then again, as has been mentioned, the subsurface gas may, at this point, be so hot that it will combust just on contact with the air, so all you would do is move the location of the flame from inside the pit to the top of the balloon. Once more, that might be all that's required.</p>
<p>Might be possible to engineer a large, rigid dome just off the pit and then roll it over the pit and anchor it to a ready-built foundation on rails, not unlike how they built the current sarcophagus for the ruined Chernobyl reactor.</p>
<p>It's all a question of engineering and cost. What could the company doing it get for the gas they could extract from it on the open market versus what would be the cost of capping it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
