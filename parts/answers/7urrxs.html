		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! Geo-spatial information/mapping guy here.</p>
<p>Your question isn't that silly when you think about it and the answer is simple. It's as thick or thin as the issue it's dividing needs it to be. In theory the borders have no thickness however, if an issue needs to be arbitrated, typically a buffer zone is addressed in either case law or treaties/agreements. Most historical borders were biased on a natural reference (river's) or known physical datum (Markers at the location). It's easy to get a surveyor out and snap a line between two markers, it's only in recent times that our maps are hyper accurate and can easily cause border lines to drift slightly as data gets updated, new survey images get done, or rivers move over time.</p>
<p>So if the issue is over property that backs up to a state line and it's delineated by a fence that has been their since before any modern surveys, the fence will almost always be the deciding line. other deciding factors include local zoning laws regarding construction and what municipality services that location.</p>
<p>Lines between locations tend to be a &quot;If a tree falls on a line in the forest, dose a cartographer care?&quot; sort of situation. It's all down to what implications that border has and what disputes or interests that line is deciding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
