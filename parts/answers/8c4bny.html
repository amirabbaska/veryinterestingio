		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;flash&quot;. Before pushing in, you draw back on the plunger. If the needle or catheter is in a vein, blood will easily be drawn back into the tubing or syringe and then you can push the medication or fluid in once you see that. If you're not in a vein, you won't easily pull blood out when drawing back.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you pull the plunger back, it wont fill with anything and essentially snap back into place. So you pull back the plunger slightly while simultaneously pulling the needle out a little until you see the mushroom cloud of blood rush into the syringe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nurse here. The needle on an IV is covered with a plastic catheter. The needle slightly hangs out to pierce the skin. When I puncture the skin and hit the vein, you can see blood come up through the catheter and a small amount of blood will come into the part that we hold. That’s the flash. I insert IVs on babies and once this happens the IV is in the vein. the flash will happen and then I can advance the catheter fully in the vein and remove the needle and hook up the tubing. I was told in nursing school when you are in it will glide in smooth like butter. And this true. If it’s not in the vein, you won’t see the flash and it will be hard when trying to push the catheter. </p>
<p>Also we check placement by flushing a saline flush through the IV. If it’s in, you can push saline through it with no problems. If it’s not in the vein, it will not push through. If you went through the vein and punctured it, when you flush it, you will see the skin bubble up. We call this an infiltration and the vein is no good.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've only ever put IVs in premature babies and newborns. If a neonate is small enough with low enough blood pressure you get no flashback but you'll know by feel just tapping the end of the plunger... a successful flush has little resistance. The smallest baby i cannulated was 275 grams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
