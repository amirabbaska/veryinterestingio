		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Are you referring to the Venstre, Danmarks Liberale Parti? The word left is right there in the name (Venstre). It's also described as a conservative-liberal party which means they represent liberal values with conservative policies i.e. the right-wing of the liberal movement. The liberal part in the party's name refers to market liberalism which is also known as free market capitalism. This is a right-wing ideal as opposed to socialism. </p>
<p>Also bear in mind that American politics are so right-leaning that even our liberal party is right of center compared to the world's standards.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where does anarchy fall on the left/right divide? I've always seen the right wing as those that support violent, oppressive and authoritarian ideals. Strength is power and all that. Whereas the left, in my mind, I've always defined as most pacifistic,  striving to keep everyone on an equal footing.</p>
<p>My ideal society would have no government bodies, and a peace loving population willing to share what they have. Where would it fall on the left/right spectrum?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When Americans are talking about liberals, they are referring to social policies usually, (what is commonly referred to as &quot;the left&quot;) when Europeans use the term they are referring to economic policies (what is commonly referred to as the &quot;right&quot;).</p>
<p>In the US long gone is the time when there was any real challenge to liberal (i.e. free market) policies, whereas in Europe where socialist and even communist or anarchist parties continue to exist, the term defines where some parties lie not socially but economically. Whereas people on the &quot;left&quot; are simply called leftist.</p>
<p>Whether or not a real &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; still exists is debatable if you ask me, and these seem more like vestigial terms inherited from the early part of the 20th century when the divide was more evident, and when social liberalism was fundamentally anti-capitalist, unlike for example the CDU in Germany, which is relatively economically to the right, but socially still more to the left that even the most leftist of US Dems.</p>
<p>tl;dr - One refers to social policy. The other to economic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to post a quote that says it better than I can.</p>
<p>&quot;Words have a habit of changing their meaning, especially if those who adopt them are not careful students of the literature or avid users of dictionaries. Thus it happened that, particularly in the United States, the word 'liberalism' has been gradually appropriated by champions of collectivism who reject liberalism in its classical sense. (See my essay on “Liberalism and the Choice of Freedoms,” in Erich Streissler, et al., eds., Roads to Freedom, pp. 117-146.)    </p>
<p>Old liberals may go on calling themselves by this designation – which is rightfully theirs – but they do so at the risk of being confused with American liberals. To avoid such confusion, they may resort either to explanatory footnotes or to adopting a new appellation for themselves, such as 'libertarians.' &quot;    </p>
<p>(Essays on Hayek, forework, Milton Friedman, p. XIV*)</p>
<p>In short, many in America misunderstood the term, then misapplied it so much that it became the new truth in America.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
