		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, metals are an issue as the microwaves induce electrical currents in them. Same idea as an antenna. This means that any metal will get quite hot in a microwave. In addition, if there is any points to the metal the currents can build up high voltages that arc, and can start fires. </p>
<p>As for ceramics that aren't microwave safe, it has to do with the permittivity of the material. A lot of molecular structures are slightly polar, that is one side of the structure has more density of the electron cloud making it negatively charged. The other end positively charged. This makes a dipole. While this charge is bound together and not free to move as monopole charge carriers (like in metals), it can rotate. As an alternating electric field (microwaves) passes through, the dipole will rotate in response to it. The permittivity of the material, the dielectric, is how much the dipoles response to the external electric field being applied. The permittivity has both a real and imaginary strength, the real value is simply how much it responds but contributes back to the electric field. For example, in capacitors we want the dielectric to magnify the electric field strength, but not lose any energy. In a microwave oven, we care about the imaginary value which is how much of the response takes energy out of the electric field and converts to heat. </p>
<p>This effect is very similar to refraction with light, actually it's pretty much the same thing other than refraction is in terms of the speed it passed through rather than electric field strength. When light passes through water from air it bends according to the refractive index, which is due to the charge of the water molecules responding to the light's electric field. Part of the repsonce it returns as a slightly offset electric field. This returns the energy to the light while simply slowing it's passage. However, thats not the whole story. There's also an imaginary component to the refractive index too, this component represents the absorbion as light passes through. So the higher the imaginary part of the permittivity, the more the dipoles repaond to the electric field and steal energy from it. Some thing like glass isn't polar and as such has very little response to microwaves. It's permittivity is low, both real and imaginary parts. Some ceramics or glazes are polar, so they heat up a lot. A lot of molecules in food are polar, notably water, and will heat up. </p>
<p>Lastly, plastics. They themselves really don't absorb microwaves. However, they melt easily. If the temperature of the food rises high enough, the plastic will melt making it unsafe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the discussion, the theory behind the microwave was discovered by accident by a radar operator. He found his chocolate was melted by the equipment and was able to use it to pop popcorn. So the same electromagnetic waves that bounce off metal are able to heat food and is also how it derived the name &quot;radar range&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plastic containers have added compounds which stabilize the organic and inorganic compounds. Some of these compounds include BPA (bisphenol-A), phthalates (most commonly Dimethyl phthalate, and Diethyl phthalate). These compounds can leach from the plastic container into the food when in the microwave, and even if hot liquids are in the container. <del>The heat energy of liquids/food in the container, and vibrational/rotational energy of microwaves liberates certain compounds.</del> BPA is often a &quot;coating&quot;, which is why it is so easily liberated. The issue is BPA is an endocrine disrupter, and is thought to act as an estrogen derivative, increasing chances of breast cancer, and lowering sperm count. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Low melting plastics such as polyethylene and polystyrene are not suitable for microwave oven or conventional oven or stovetop. Otherwise, other vessels are 'safe' if unsuitable. Metals are not unsafe but are poorly suited to the purpose. They block the waves and bounce them back to magnetron tube.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
