<blockquote>
<p>A double-blind, prospective study during the fall of 1979 investigated
the association between the menstrual cycles of 305 Brooklyn College
undergraduates and their associates and the lunar cycles.</p>
<p>.... Approximately 1/3 of the subjects had lunar period cycles, <em>i.e.</em>
a mean cycle length of 29.5 Â± 1 day. Almost 2/3 of the subjects
started their October cycle in the light 1/2 of the lunar cycle,
significantly more than would be expected by random distribution. The
author concludes that there is a lunar influence on ovulation.</p>

<p><a href="http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/00016348609158228" target="_blank">Another source</a> supports this conclusion, finding that &quot;a large proportion of menstruations occurred around the new moon.&quot;</p>
<p>Somewhat related, <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1851732/?tool=pmcentrez" target="_blank">this study</a> found that light exposure shortened menstruation cycles.</p>
<p>In summary, there seems to be a good amount of data suggesting that lunar cycles do in fact calibrate the length of human menstrual cycles to some degree.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question is a bit wrong, they aren't really that similar. As noted by the first hit on Google:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The average menstrual cycle is 28 days long. Cycles can range anywhere from 21 to 35 days in adults and from 21 to 45 days in young teens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lunar 'cycle' isn't even really that easy to define, as I was surprised to find right now:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_month</a></p>
<p>But it's basically 27 days and change. Which for sure is close (sort of) to the average length, and is certainly a possible length for a menstrual cycle.</p>
<p>So it is a 'coincidence', but you could imagine if Homo sapiens lived on a planet with a lunar month of 25 or 35 days someone could have the same question and still be amazed at the 'coincidence'. Given how much variance there is in menstrual cycle length it is easy to have a hit. I mean if the lunar month randomly varied between 21 to 35 days, and sometimes lasted a couple years as it gestated and breastfed a baby moon, then you can talk about there being a coincidence. :D</p>
<p>An <em>actual</em> coincidence is that we have total solar eclipses on Earth since the moon and the sun are sometimes the same size in the sky. If we were a interstellar civilization people would travel to Earth to check that out, it's not a common thing. At least for the next so many million years until the moon's orbit changes enough to break the coincidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
