		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few different ways the flu can kill you.  </p>
<p>I think the most common/direct way the flu can kill you is something called a cytokine storm, you basically kill yourself with your immune system.  </p>
<p>Secondary things like pneumonia are more common causes of death, but I place them secondary because it's generally the secondary infection that gets you.  The cytokine storms are scarier for certain variations of influenza, such as the 1918 spanish flu that targeted young people due to their immune system being strong.  </p>
<p>I haven't been paying attention to the epidemiology of this strain, I think I heard it's H2N1, and I've heard of a few healthy individual deaths, so be wary.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can die from a variety of things. It is a common misconception that the flu alone cannot kill you if you are young and healthy but this is not true. The 5 year old answer is that the flu can make you stop breathing and you can die. The more detailed response is that even in healthy people the bodies own response to the virus can lead to a condition called ARDS (adult respiratory distress syndrome). The lungs are damaged by the immune response to the virus and are flooded with immune cells and cells that make scar tissue. Many young healthy people die from this way from the flu and even sometimes other cold viruses such as coronavirus and RSV.</p>
<p>It is also true that the flu also kills in other people by triggering heart attacks, asthma attacks, heart failure, and other problems in those already suffering from pre-existing conditions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctors who study the body’s immune response say that when people die from the flu, there are three main reasons: </p>
<ul>
<li>Co-infection with another germ, usually bacteria such as strep</li>
<li>Aggravation of existing conditions such as heart disease and asthma.</li>
<li>A cytokine storm, marked by an overwhelming immune system response to infection.</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m an ER doctor in the northeast US. I have literally seen hundreds of people with the flu this season. The flu syndrome itself is mostly cough, runny nose, sneezing, cough, fever, and muscle aches. </p>
<p>Here are some reasons I have seen people get very sick, even critically sick, from the flu.</p>
<p>When you have a viral respiratory syndrome like the flu, your body mounts a widespread inflammatory response to fight it, which basically manifests as a fever. Sometimes, the rate at which your temperature rises, or even extremely high temperatures can cause mental status changes, muscle breakdown, and a disruption of normal bodily functions. But usually the fever is just a normal part of the anti-inflammatory process. For the majority of times you have the fever, its safe and normal, but it will make you feel like crap.</p>
<p>A big reason people are dying is from the mucus production caused when you have a respiratory illness. From an evolutionary standpoint, our bodies generate mucus in our nose and throat to “block off” any further exposure to the viral/bacterial/fungal exposure. The mucus itself is also a byproduct of the body fighting an illness. Think of it like the waste left over from a big battle.</p>
<p>Now the mucus itself is what causes you to have the runny nose and sore throat and cough. But babies and old people may not be able to tolerate this. They might not be able to sniff and hack and cough out this gross stuff. They can very literally choke to death on all this mucus in their nasopharynx.</p>
<p>More severely, when the mucus is aspirated into the lungs, it gets caught in the lungs and can progress to bronchitis (inflammation of the lung airways from heavy coughing and irritation) and pneumonia (when the mucus caught in the lungs sit there and turn into a growing bacterial entity).</p>
<p>When you get to this stage, the flu itself isn’t the problem. That super-imposed pneumonia is a bacterial infection, created from the sitting mucus in the lungs. This is actually separate from the influenza virus. And thus, this is only real way to intervene as a doctor to make any difference. The flu will do its usual thing, regardless of what you do (Tamiflu helps very little), but if you can identify a super-imposed pneumonia, it will make a huge difference to get them started on antibiotics, especially with babies and old people.</p>
<p>One last thing is pulmonary edema. This is when fluid gets pulled into the lung airways when the inflammation from the respiratory symptoms overwhelm the lung tissue. This is basically only seen in people over 65 or people with chronic lung disease. All the cough and mucus just causes the lungs to be so inflammed and boggy, that fluid starts rushing into the airways, and people very litterally drown in fluid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
