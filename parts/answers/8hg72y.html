<p>Why does Lego not take down knock-off brands like Lepin?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>LEGO <em>can't</em> take them down, because Lepin isn't doing anything illegal.  LEGO's relevant patents have expired, so making knock-off brands is perfectly legal.  This is exactly how patents are supposed to work:  Give a company time-limited exclusivity for a novel invention that will eventually expire and allow anyone to make the item.  It encourages innovation without locking that innovation away from competitors forever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For years, Lego did fight competitors/knock-offs like Mega Bloks in court.  But Lego's patents have since expired in most countries, meaning that there is nothing Lego can legally do to have them taken off store shelves.</p>
<p>That's why so many Lego sets now are based on Star Wars, Batman and other franchises.  They can't stop people from making copies of generic Lego sets, but they <em>can</em> ensure that no one else can sell, say, a <em>Harry Potter</em> Lego-style set.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel a part of it is that they will never really be competition for Lego. Lego is THE brand when you think of building blocks. I didn't even know that Lepin was a thing until this post. In short they don't even need to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lego has tried to sue competitors who made copycat products in the past even before their patents went public domain and lost a good chunk of the time, such as when they lost case against Mega Bloks in Canada and against Nintendo over their N&amp;B Blocks in Japan. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lego’s unique selling point isn’t the bricks, it’s the designs and kits. </p>
<p>Lego hire top engineers to design their new kits, no other company can compete with the skill level that Lego has invested in. </p>
<p>Besides, they know that if a kid plays with the cheap stuff, they will want Lego eventually.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
