		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fission does not usually occur in significant amounts in stars, at least fission in the exothermal sense (releasing energy, like in a nuclear reactor for example).</p>
<p>However! In the death of very massive stars, rapid fission of the Iron core into Helium can occur in a process called <em>photodisintegration</em>. This process is however endothermic, requiring much more energy than it releases. Thus, it only occurs in situations where temperatures and pressures are very high (read: dying massive stars). This process makes the core pressure drop momentarily, causing the star to collapse and become a black hole rather than explode as a hypernova!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fission occurs of course -- but in comparatively microscopic amounts.  </p>
<p>Heavy elements get produced by endothermic fusion in supernovae.  Heavy elements also get produced by the &quot;slow process&quot; of neutron absorption in older metal-rich stars.  Those fossil components remain in second-generation stars like the Sun.  The Sun also produces tiny amounts of heavy elements itself from the slow process.  All these heavy elements can undergo fission, and do.  </p>
<p>But as others have pointed out, these fissions are a tiny, tiny fraction of the energy balance of the Sun.  Heavy metals are a tiny fraction of the solar material, and fissions only affect a tiny fraction of those.   Further, fissions are much <em>less</em> energetic on a per-nucleus basis than is hydrogen fusion.  So these reactions are negligible compared to the hydrogen fusions that are the main source of solar energy.</p>
<p>Incidentally, as rare as elements like uranium and thorium (and even gold) are on the surface of Earth, they're <em>very highly concentrated</em> compared to their abundance in the primordial nebula and in the Sun itself.  Planetary formation strongly differentiates heavy elements out of the primordial cloud, and terrestrial planet formation (inside the planetary &quot;snow line&quot; between the asteroids and Jupiter) also included a late-stage sweeping-away of light elements when the Sun began producing ultraviolet and the solar wind turned on.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-iarticle_query?bibcode=1969SoPh....6..381G&amp;db_key=AST&amp;page_ind=15&amp;plate_select=NO&amp;data_type=GIF&amp;type=SCREEN_GIF&amp;classic=YES" target="_blank">This article</a> gives the approximate solar abundance of uranium compared to that of silicon, with silicon being given as 1 million. Translating to this to ppb gives us a uranium abundance of 0.077 ppb.</p>
<p>Now, we find the approximate number of atoms in the sun. The mass of a hydrogen atom is 1.674e-27 kg and the mass of a helium atom is 6.6465e-27 kg. The relative abundance of hydrogen and helium are 0.75 and 0.25, respectively. So the average mass of an atom in the sun is 0.75 <em> 1.674e-27 + 0.25 </em> 6.6465e-27= 2.917e-27 kg. The mass of the sun is 1.98855e30 kg, so the total amount of atoms is approximately 1.98855e30 / 2.917e-27 = 6.817e56 atoms.</p>
<p>0.077 ppb of these are Uranium atoms, so 7.7e-9% (=0.077 ppb) of 6.817e56 is 5.249e46 uranium atoms. This is equal to 8.716e22 moles of uranium. The molar mass of uranium is 238.0289 g/mol, so the number of grams of uranium is 2.075e25 grams, or in kilograms: 2.075e22 kg.</p>
<p>This is about 28% of the moon's mass. It's more than 1.5 x the mass of Pluto. This is, of course, nothing compared to the sun's total mass, but it is definitely not negligible. It is nearly impossible that all these atoms go through the entire sun's lifetime without at least a part of them taking part in a fission reaction. And next to that, there are other fissile elements, like thorium, that can also be found in the sun.</p>
<p>So, to answer the question: yes, fission does take place in the sun.      </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(to my knowledge) fission doesn't occur in a star; fusion does.
The fusion reactions occuring in the star can lead to the formation of elements all the way down to tungsten (and maybe lower). Combine hydrogen over and over to make helium, and then keep going down the table.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it absolutely does if the star contains radioactive isotopes (Uranium for example), which it would unless it was an early generation star. It's not a dominant or even significant source of energy relative to fusion but it would happen</p>
<p>Edit: A star does not have to produce an element itself for it to be found there. Look up what a Pop I star is. Alternatively, ask yourself why the Sun doesn't just contain hydrogen and helium if it's just fusing hydrogen right now... </p>
