		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because the front wheels are single (like on your car), while all other wheels are dual. Because of this, the centers of the wheels extend past the edge of the rim. This means you can put two wheels face to face, and bolt them together to the hub. When you look at a set of dual wheels mounted, you see the concave side of the outer wheel, so you see the lugs as being recessed. Since the front wheels are single, they mount them the same way they do the inner wheels of each dual pair, meaning with the convex side facing out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey guys, first time commenting here on ELI5. Truck mechanic here and I wanted to take a chance to clear some misconceptions up that some people have as well as confirm others. The front (Steer) wheels are singular and are turned essentially the same way that any car or truck wheel faces with its concave facing outwards. The inner rear axle dual also faces this same direction if you look closely at a set. The second rear wheel on each hub is placed there because the axle is rated to hold a higher weight than that of single rear wheels. </p>
<p>If a vehicle has what is called a &quot;super single&quot; (A single overly large rear axle tire) it has the same weight capabilities as a axle with duals. The benefit to this is fuel economy which tires play a factor in. While at one time they were very expensive in there early years they have drastically come down in price to actually be cheaper than replace 2 tires in some areas of Canada and the US.   </p>
<p>I was reading some of the comments about interchangeability of the Steer tires vs the rear drive tires. To say that people are wrong and you cannot interchange wheels and tires would be incorrect. But to be clear though, most Highway tractors have different steer tires vs drives. Again fuel economy is a factor. The steer tires are generally smooth grooved with more of a streamlined pattern. At the end of the day they are there for just that. Steering. there is no driving force being applied to them so they are designed to provide minimum rolling resistance with optimal steering capabilities. The drives usually have a more aggressive tread pattern for a balance of grip, wear control and you guessed it fuel economy. Also side note here, retreaded tires are illegal as steer tires here in the great white north. Not sure but it is likely the same in the US.</p>
<p>Lastly as far as wheel torque goes this is something of a myths/legends vs science question. A lot of mechanics I knew of coming up in the trade believed that torquing a lug nut on a car was as easy as listening for a the right amount of bangs coming from their impact gun when tightening a set. Some believed in the &quot;hit em hard with you gun and then torque em after&quot; approach while others swore if they did not use a torque wrench on every lug nut a wheel was sure to come off. The correct answer is the last one but with a procedure of assuring each lug actually moves when torquing. If they do not and your torque still clicks you have torqued nothing. The lug nut is already over tight which can be as dangerous as under tightening. Over tightening stretches the wheel studs which the illustrious engineers worked so hard to design. This one of the big causes to wheel coming off on trucks and cars as the studs can shear or time allowing the wheel come loose. </p>
<p>TL:DR Amounts of tires and sizes are all put into the design of the vehicle when ordering it for maximum efficiency. In some cases the customer can go against recommendations due to cost or applications. As far as maintenance goes. If your the one working on it. Torque it. The cost and damage of a 150+ pound tire and wheel into someones windshield costs far more than the time it takes to use your torque wrench. As far as everyone else goes. choose a reputable dealer/shop for your tire needs.</p>
<p>p.s. Those shiny pointy things some drivers put on lugs are just for show. For show and for me to slice my leg on when servicing a truck... but they do look cool ;)         </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>the rears just have an extra set 'turned around'</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has already been answered a few times but I'll give it a go. </p>
<p>The rims on a semi truck, all ten of them, are the exact same wheel. Most standard is 22.5&quot; overall diameter and 8.25&quot; wide. These wheels can be run on any position on the trucks, even the trailers. </p>
<p>That means, that the rear wheels on a truck (known as the drive wheels) are mounted face to face. If you take the outer most wheel on a drive axle of a semi truck, and then turn it around, you could install it to the front (or steer) axle. </p>
<p>The same goes for 1 ton pickup trucks, cargo vans, anything with &quot;duallie&quot; applications. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
