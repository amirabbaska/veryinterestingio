		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello!</p>
<p>I'm a newly started Danish student from Aalborg on 1. semester in Medicine with Industrial Specialization. I wish you the best of luck with your project! I have a few questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What do you think the odds are, that this will end up as a major breakthrough? I'm curious about the odds of it working for humans, as I've heard it worked on mice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There's been tons of stuff like &quot;Cure for cancer found!&quot; in the news over the years which (obviously) haven't been true, and this has made most average people lower their expectations for anything alike. Specifically, it was easy to see all the hate and disappointment in the comment sections of the articles of your discovery, where most people believed it was a lie. Do you think anything needs to be done about this, and if yes, what? Additionally; Does the public's opinion on this even matter?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I'm fascinated by the work, but I'm curious what field it's in, as I have just started on my bachelor. For my candidate, I can choose between translational medicine and biomedicine, and I'm wondering which one of these best describes your work.</p>
</li>
<li>What does this discovery feel like for yourselves, personally? Pride, increased curiosity, happy, et cetera?</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the problems I've heard with &quot;Cancer Cures&quot; is that there are many different kinds of cancer with very different characteristics and different kinds of cells involved.</p>
<p>Are these targets you found present in all human cancer? Which types of cancer have you tested?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, first of all - I'm in awe of your work, and hearing that the placenta and cancer share similarities is one of the most curious things I've heard in a while.
Forgive the naivety in my question, but how would a treatment go about targetting the protein to the tumour? Wouldn't the immune system of the human body resist it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
