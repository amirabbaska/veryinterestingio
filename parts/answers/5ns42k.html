<p>Take abortion for instance. People who are pro-choice <em>should</em> be able to see the merits and value to a pro-life standpoint, <em>and understand why that standpoint seems right</em> to someone, even though they disagree with it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I agree with most of the &quot;open-mind&quot; and &quot;putting yourself in other shoes&quot; comments but I'd like to focus on a different aspect.   </p>
<p>It's about thinking about something without accepting it as true. What do I mean thinking about it?   </p>
<p>Well, let's suppose tigers are blue. Then what? Well, they wouldn't be very well camouflaged. They would probably have to radically change the way they get food or otherwise go extinct. Also, why would they be blue? Maybe a different environment could cause that, which would make the previous consideration irrelevant.   </p>
<p>What if God doesn't exist? Well, then God couldn't be the basis of morality. Is there any basis of morality at all? Would it be objective, something out in the world, or maybe the basis would have to be us as a society deciding what is right or wrong, or maybe it would have to be based on personal growth for each individual, or something else entirely.   </p>
<p>I know Tigers aren't blue, but I can still think about related issues. I, personally, don't care whether God exists or not, but there are implications and questions if God does exist, and different implications and questions if God doesn't. There is no such thing as an isolated &quot;fact;&quot; every fact is connected to many others. To be able to think about something is, in part, to be able to consider those connections. Whether you believe in God or not - heck, even if everyone in the world believed in God (and, thus, there are no actual shoes of the other to put yourself in) - you should still be able to consider what it would <em>mean</em> if God didn't exist.   </p>
<p>So, I think the quote is partly about the relationships between propositions, rather than fixating on the truth value of those propositions. After all, Aristotle is the father of category logic, which is all about those propositions and not, primarily, their truth. For instance:<br />
All X are Y<br />
Some X are Z<br />
Therefore Some Z are Y<br />
This is a valid argument - if the premises are true, the conclusion MUST be true, but we have no idea if the premises are true because it's just formal. If we fill it in:<br />
All dogs are rocket ships<br />
Some dogs are bars of soap<br />
Therefore, some bars of soap are rocket ships<br />
If the premises were true, the conclusion would have to be true: If it were the case that, in actuality, all dogs were rocket ships, and it really was the case that some dogs were bars of soap, then some bars of soap would HAVE TO BE rocket ships, namely, the bars of soaps that were also dogs (because all dogs are rocket ships). So, we looked at the implications of some claims, even though the claims are obviously false and absurd. Better yet, some claims are not obviously true or obviously false, but figuring out their implications can help us to solve the question of truth, and also to figure out all sorts of other things, too.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my opinion, it's similar to the idea of &quot;putting yourself in someone else's shoes&quot;. </p>
<p>I think the argument is that a wise person should be able to understand why someone else might adopt a belief or idea that they personally disagree with. Just take any controversial belief you may hold and compare yourself to others who would oppose that belief. If you're pro-LGBTQ, try to understand why someone might be anti-LGBTQ. If you're pro-choice, try to understand why someone might be pro-life. If you're pro-gun-control, try to understand why someone might be anti-gun-control. If you support prohibition of drugs, try to understand why someone might support legalization of drugs. </p>
<p>A huge amount of people take sides on any given issue and are either unable or unwilling to consider the perspective of people who oppose them- dismissing opposing arguments as senseless, stupid, pointless, misguided, etc... I think that Aristotle is saying, a wise person is able to take a side while actually understanding why the opposing side believes what they do and respecting them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
