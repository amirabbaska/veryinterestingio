		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends entirely on what type and species of animal, as well as on the individual in question. Sorry but your question, while interesting, seems way too vague for a satisfactory answer</p>
<p>Edit: but since we're here, did you know that dolphins go to sleep with only one brain hemisphere at a time?
This cycling mechanism helps them stay alert and keep swimming, which is useful in that it helps them find more pufferfish in order to get high. </p>
<p>No idea how long it takes the average dolphin to fall asleep. But if it helps, it takes me 5 min - 1 hour to fall asleep. I'm not a dolphin though. And I've never nibbled on a pufferfish for that sweet, sweet high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the animal.  For example, my cat can take your spot on the couch and fall asleep in the time it takes to get a drink from the kitchen.  She also has no respect for the rules of &quot;seat check.&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>In my case, I can fall sleep in 45 seconds flat (unless I had a bucket of icecream for dinner, then, 3 hours)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
