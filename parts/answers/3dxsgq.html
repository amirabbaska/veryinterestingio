		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, jury selection varies depending on the jurisdiction.  My experience is in New York, and the basis for my knowledge is having tried about 60 jury trials, and selected about another 20 or so juries that ended up not going to trial.</p>
<p>In New York, jurors are paid $40/day for their service, and if called, are exempted from service for 6 years.  If they serve more than 10 days, they get 8 years exemption.</p>
<p>During jury selection, most judges will go through questions concerning certain &quot;hardships&quot;, which are not necessarily automatic disqualifiers, but most judges will remove you if you fall into one of these categories.  The general categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Medical - scheduled medical procedure that either can't be rescheduled or would be a hardship to reschedule</li>
<li>Vacation - planned vacation with tickets/hotels/flights/etc PURCHASED (in other words, not just &quot;I was thinking of taking a trip&quot;)</li>
<li>Full time student with classes scheduled during the period of time the trial will occur</li>
<li>Sole caregiver for a minor or elderly individual where it would be a hardship or impossible to arrange for alternative assistance</li>
<li>EXTREME financial hardship.  This is where you are the sole proprietor of a business, work on commission, or otherwise wouldn't get paid if you don't go to work.  If you are an employee of a company that doesn't pay for jury duty (in my state, required to pay for three days, that's it - some companies cover more).  Key is &quot;EXTREME&quot;, jury duty is an inconvenience for everyone, we just want to make sure you aren't going to lose your home or starve because of jury duty</li>
</ul>
<p>I think those are the main ones, also there are a few automatic disqualifications - difficulty understanding the english language, medical issues that would prevent you from sitting on the case, blind/deaf, or difficulty seeing or hearing to the extent that you are missing stuff that's going on.  Felony convictions also disqualify you.</p>
<p>There are no automatic exemptions due to your profession.  Famously, Rudy Giuliani served on a jury when he was Mayor of NYC.  The Chief Judge of the NYS Court of Appeals was called and I believe she served.  I've been called a few times myself, never got picked though.</p>
<p>The types we get vary greatly - for very short trials almost everyone can serve.  For longer ones, of course we lose a lot of people.  I had one case that was expected to last for 4 months.  It took over two weeks to pick a jury, and we went through over a thousand jurors to get our panel.  I don't fault people for not serving when it will legitimately cause them an extreme hardship.  I do take issue with those who are able to serve but don't want to because it's an inconvenience.  Jury service is our civic duty, and without people willing to serve our system would collapse.</p>
<p>I try to speak with my jurors after trials and every single person who has ever served has told me they were glad they did it and that it was one of the most interesting things they've ever done.</p>
<p>I'll never forget one lady who served and told me after that it was an inconvenience to her, but she saw all the other prospective jurors giving excuses to get off and realized that it was an important obligation, so she stayed and she was glad that she did.  For anyone who gets called, I recommend serving if you are legitimately able to - it's your justice system, this is your opportunity to see how it works up close.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I served on a civil trial here in the United States for 6 months. We were told that we could not be fired due to serving on the jury and taking extended time away from work, and the courts would come down pretty hard on any employer who punished us in any way for serving. We were also paid but it was extremely minimal ($25 a day, IIRC + a little bit for transportation/parking). Employers did not, by law, have to pay us for jury duty but most did. I think only one person was not paid during that time and she ended up changing her shift around and working nights (which made staying awake during the trial very difficult, but she seemed to manage). </p>
<p>That said, the court did work hard to find a jury who could do 5-6 months duty without having a hugely detrimental impact on their lives (e.g. someone taking care of a parent with dementia was exempted etc..). </p>
<p>The whole experience was pretty interesting, and I'd server again if given the chance. Maybe not for 6 months, but I'd serve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that some people do endure financial hardship to serve on a jury in the USA.  Civil trials in particular can go on a long, long time.  Although judges can and do release people from serving due to financial hardship, they don't release everyone.  There are numerous articles from reliable sources about American jurors' financial hardships on the web.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the UK, there is a monetary allowance for jury duty, although it's not a huge amount.  I believe if you are required to serve for longer, you can claim a greater amount for subsistance.</p>
<p>Your employers are not allowed to discriminate against you for jury duty, and you can simply walk back into your job, when you are done.  Companies have experience doing this with people on maternity leave, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
