		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The country is divided into &quot;constituencies&quot;.</p>
<p>Each constituency elects a single representative, or MP. (Edit, as pointed out below): they do this by voting on the candidates, and the candidate with the most votes wins. The winner doesn't need a majority of votes, they just need more votes than anyone else.</p>
<p>Most MPs represent a party (although independent candidates are allowed to stand, and occasionally win). The party with more than 50% of MPs gets to form the government.</p>
<p>If no party has more than 50% of MPs, the party with the most MPs gets to try to form a government by going into coalition with other parties, so that the parties in the coalition have more than 50% of the MPs between them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, it's debatably a poor system. It suits the 2 bigger parties (Conservative and Labour) that win, and hinders the smaller parties that don't, so makes it almost impossible to get the voting system changed as those parties in power vote against the change. Bare this in mind, will explain more later.</p>
<p>There are 650 'seats' in the UK elections, literally meaning the number of seats up for grabs in the Houses of Parliament. So, there are 650 areas of the UK that vote for an individual to be their area's MP (Member of Parliament). The individual with the most votes wins. That individual can stand as a representative of a specific party (Conservative, Labour, Lib Dem, Green, UKIP, SNP, DUP, Monster Raving Looney Party, etc.) or run as an independent. For example, the MP for Birmingham Yardley is Labour's Jess Phillips as she received the most votes of all the candidates standing for election in that area, called a constituency. She therefore takes 1 seat in the Houses of Parliament. </p>
<p>The process of separate constituencies voting for an individual to represent their area happens 650 times across the country during 1 election day, typically in May, once every 5 years. For 1 party to win outright, they must win 50% of the seats +1 (326, this figure being the 'post' in the first past the post phrase). This gives them a majority and can govern alone, as happened in 2015 when the Conservatives won. However, if a party doesn't get 50% of seats, as in 2010, the party with the most seats has the opportunity to form a government with another party. This is not necessarily with the next most voted party. The top 2 are usually Labour and Conservative, Labour being much more left wing, Conservative much further right, making a coalition here effectively impossible. </p>
<p>For there to be a more effective working relationship between parties, the party with the most seats try to combine their total of seats with a smaller parties total of seats to then make the magic 326 seat figure. In 2010, the Conservatives combined their 306 seats with the Lib Dems 57 seats, creating a majority, and they worked together for the next 5 years. </p>
<p>Now, the reason the system is deemed unfair is that it disproportionately awards a high number of seats to the big parties in relation to number of votes and a disproportionally low number of seats to smaller parties. For example, the Conservatives got 330 seats from 11,000,000 votes in 2015. Whereas UKIP got 1 seat from 3,800,000 votes. This happens because the smaller parties can get a consistently solid number of votes across the country, but very rarely enough to come 1st in any given constituency. It can also be seen as unfair if a smaller party is very prevalent in a highly specific area, for example the SNP in Scotland (who only stand in Scotland and not the rest of the UK) got 59 seats from 1,500,000 votes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also called simple plurality. Basically whoever gets the most votes in the contest wins 100% of the win. So if there are 10 votes and A gets 3, B gets 4, C gets 1 and D gets 2 then B wins with 40% of the vote, not a majority but a plurality.</p>
<p>It's a very common form of democratic contest, also used in most US states for the electoral college votes (but not all) and pretty much all other US elections. It's more common in the older Anglo nations, less common in nations with newer constitutions because it's kinda shit and obsolete because it produces a lot of really dysfunctional behaviour like spoilers, tactical voting and gerrymandering.</p>
<p>In the UK we have constituency FPTP which means that the overall contest is made up of hundreds of small FPTP contests for individual seats, rather than it just being a nationwide vote and whoever wins that wins 100% of the power. So whoever wins a constituency wins 100% of that constituency but whoever gets a plurality of votes nationally does not win 100% of the nation. Similar to the US Houses in that regard.</p>
<p>This is worth watching</p>

<p>But yes, other posters are correct, it's a division of the electorate into areas, called constituencies in the UK, and a series of candidates run in each area. The one with the most votes (even if it's only 20% of those who voted) wins, and represents that area in parliament.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
