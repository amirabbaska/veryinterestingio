		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former Radiation Safety Officer (RSO) here.  The best way to find this dose would be with a Survey Meter at or near the locations of the patient/owner's hands, body, and eyes to get a good representation of the exposures commonly measured for the purposes of radiation safety per the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.  But even just a survey of the hands alone, assuming the beam of radiation is coming within the closest proximity to these extremities, would be enough to allow a very good representation of dosage.  Unfortunately, to estimate your machines output would require knowing the output plot of your specific machine at a controlled mAs setting, controlled distance, and across the range of kVp used, or at least having a survey at any distance from the machine while it is in normal (the kVp &amp; mAs setting you want the numbers for) usage.  But, I did find this study of situations like the one you are describing.</p>

<p>It's not much, but it does reiterate a very common theme amongst veterinary specific Radiation Safety documents: there is not much risk involved for customers/patients' owners in routine X-ray usage in veterinary medicine as long as the federally regulated safety requirements are met.  I do, however, think you should talk with your practice's RSO about it since they would have the best ability to provide you with actual dosage estimates based on the technique/rate chart for your machine's output and would have the survey equipment needed to calculate actual dosage rates at specific distances.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you mean to yourself or to your patients owners?</p>
<p>Patients owners: There are specific surgical gloves that block radiological x-rays. You can offer these to your patient's owners.</p>
<p>In addition, you can offer them a lead apron. We use these, as well as thyroid shields routinely in the OR (they are required by law actually).</p>
<p>For you, I would recommend the same. I would also consider leaded eye glasses as long term exposure can cause cataracts.</p>
<p>In addition, you should have a dosimeter for yourself and any staff that routinely assist you in x-ray procedures.</p>
<p>The dosimeter gets turned in to the company that checks them every month and after 12 months you get an assessment of yearly exposure.</p>
<p>The dosimeter is worn on the outside of the lead shielding.</p>
<p>This can be expensive but I think it's an OSHA requirement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Filtration, shielding, and thickness and length of tissue irradiated are also important parameters.</p>
<p>I don't think it would be a great idea to have people try and provide estimates over the internet for your decision making.  There are health physics and diagnostic medical physics consulting services which could help you out with this kind of thing, it's their specialty.</p>
<p>Another point is that if you or your staff are primarily having their hands irradiated, they should be wearing ring dosimeters in addition to their torso badges.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a medical physicist I would advise against having grneral public hold their pets. You shluld be monitoring dose to your xray staff (at least ones that are involved in your xray program)</p>
<p>But to estimate dose and exposure I require more information (energy, ma, exposure time). A conservative estimate would be 1R =1cGy=0.01Sv)</p>
<p>But if you are truly concerned reach out to a local mecical physicist. I can help you do do if you want. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also a veterinarian. The owner should not be holding the patient for radiographs! This is a huge liability! The most of obvious thing wrong with this is what if an owner was pregnant and didn't know yet?  Yes the exposure might be small but it puts you at a liability that you don't need. Also patients often freak out during rads... I've been bit (when I was an assistant years ago) by a cat that was calm and nice but either didn't like the way I was holding him or the sound of the machine. So that's another liability you don't need. (I also wonder what OSHA says about clients having unneeded exposure.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
