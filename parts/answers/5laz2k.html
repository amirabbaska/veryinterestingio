		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>tl;dr</strong> Google has a ton of data on you, and they are constantly gathering more.</p>
<p>Do you own an Android based smart phone that you carry around with you? The amount of information Google can (but not necessarily does) gather about you is astounding. </p>
<p>For starters, the phone knows where you go, how you get there, and even who you are with if they also have a device with them. It can hear everything you say and pick out important words to target advertising. Even without this, Google still knows an awful lot about you by your browsing habits, search queries, and even what times you are browsing the net. </p>
<p>The key to running a successful company is having a deep understanding of the product you are selling. In Google's case, you are that product. Google knows me better than any living person, including myself. They know what type of food I like to eat, where and when I work, what my hobbies are, and even my favorite types of porn. Google can quite accurately deduce what I'm searching for within a handful of keystrokes. It is borderline frightening how much information we freely hand over in exchange for access to their services. </p>
<p>This stuff is only going to get more sophisticated and accurate as time progresses. It is a side effect of the digital era we are living in. </p>
<p>It's also possible that it was just a coincidence. Those things are sure to happen from time to time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>facebook did this to me when i bought clarinet reeds from guitar center. There was no way it should have known that. Facebook would often pop up at the top of my phone with a blinking location that would tell me &quot;Facebook is currently using your location&quot;. I deleted the app off my phone and my phone would still display that notification. It went away after I turned my phone off and back on, but i never downloaded the facebook app again. I now only use facebook on computers. Fuck that shit. Fuck computers and the internet. I don't want to use them anymore. I only have a smart phone because i essentially ran out of options- i have to have my email and contacts and banking on my phone because of the life i live. Fuck phones man. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
