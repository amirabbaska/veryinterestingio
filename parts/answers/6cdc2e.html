<p>So when you start moving, inertia keeps the gas stationary until friction with the sides of the moving walls causes the gas to start moving along with the tire. Eventually it all comes up to the same rotational speed. When you start stopping, the gas keeps moving until friction with the slowing tire walls cause the gas to slow as well. Once stopped the gas continues to move until friction brings it all stationary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
