		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sweating is a means to cool the body temperature.  Your skin has a lot of surface area, and sweat acts as a medium that cools when in contact with (usually cooler) air.  Producing more sweat covers more surface area of the body, and therefore becomes more efficient at cooling.  Individuals who are physically fit typically produce sweat because their bodies need to cool more efficiently.  This doesn't exclude individuals who are overweight, however, because moving a lot of mass - whether it be muscle or fat - requires a lot of energy expenditure, produces heat, and requires more efficient cooling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really surprised no one has said this yet: genetics</p>
<p>I'm half Philipino and in good shape, similar to my teammates on my soccer and tennis teams, but I always sweat WAY more than them. It's just because I'm Philipino, and all of my Philipino relatives sweat a TON as well. My brother and sister sweat when meeting new people and I sweat in interviews. When I was a 4th grader, after basketball games my head would be drenched and my teammates' heads would by dry. We just sweat really easily, and it's not related to our fitness. Also, all of my white relatives don't sweat this easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
