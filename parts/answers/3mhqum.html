		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Lots of stars</p>
<p>The black hole isn't the cause of the light, but it is the reason it's so bright. It attracts a massive collection of stars, but most of them are in a stable orbit. Either way, it's all the stars near the 'hole that provides all this light. It's a sphere where the core is pitch black, but the shell provides tons of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer for why the center of the Milky Way being bright, despite a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supermassive_black_hole" target="_blank">Super Massive Black Hole</a>, has been already answered. But black holes can be seen when they are in a feeding stage. This is when matter is being sucked in, and the matter is rubbing against one another, heating up and glowing. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f6/Artist%E2%80%99s_impression_of_the_huge_outflow_ejected_from_the_quasar_SDSS_J1106%2B1939.jpg" target="_blank">They can get extremely bright</a>. </p>
<p>We have not really observed a black black hole. We only see their bright emissions. I think recently there has been photos of the event horizon of the massive black hole in the center of our galaxy, but that was with a very powerful telescope and a team who are specifically trying to catch the event horizon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The core of the Milky Way is about 30000 light years across, and contains a staggering number of stars at a higher destiny than the spiral arms. This is why it is relativily bright.</p>
<p>At galactic centre there is a supermassive black hole, but compared to the core it's a speck, and practically invisible since it's dormant.</p>
<p>As stellar objects go, black holes are tiny, dense objects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
