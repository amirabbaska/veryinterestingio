		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Clothing actually adapted pretty quickly to solve the Floppy Dong Conundrum (and be warmer, obviously).  Otzi the Iceman was wearing a loincloth that secured between his legs and is assumed to have died around 3300 BC.   Containing &quot;underwear&quot; long predates modern textile manufacturing.</p>
<p>Prior to clothing the pre-human body was far more ape-like.  It wasn't like one day a fully formed modern human popped into existence and said &quot;Shit, my hanging balls are all over the place.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Evolution (particularly non-random mating and medical advances) has caused humanity to skew away from being capable of surviving the elements. Longer scrotums, phalluses, etc, stopped becoming an fitness disadvantage with the advent of tight-fitting clothing, and other selective pressures may have encouraged genitals to become less “aerodynamic”.</p>
<p>The other part of the equation is that our bodies are conditioned and shaped by their environments and habits. If you spent your entire life running around naked in the elements, full-monty-ing it, your body would either find a way to deal with or avoid the pain you’re describing, or you would die from an accident or repeated trauma, and your genes would fail to be passed on to the next generation.</p>
<p>Genetics are complex and evolution even moreso, but homo sapiens of today are pretty different from our distant ancestors- I hate to say it but the tldr ELI5 is really just that your ancestors probably didn’t have a body that looked or functioned like yours.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's evidence for clothes even in Neanderthals - a bone tool from a site in France called Pech de l'Aze seems to have been used for smoothing and softening hides, around 51,000 years ago. Anatomically modern humans have been around since ~250,000 years depending on who you ask, but if Neanderthals were making clothes it suggests our common ancestor may have also had this ability, which takes us back to more like 600,000 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
