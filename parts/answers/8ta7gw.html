		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine is a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist, acting at A1, A2a, A2b, and A3 receptors (it also binds to a few other receptors, but we’ll ignore those for simplicity’s sake). From knockout studies in mice, it appears A2a is critical for the stimulating effect of caffeine. In the brain, Adenosine levels fluctuate as the day passes with the highest levels at night. Higher levels of adenosine produce a drowsiness effect. When you consistently apply an antagonist to a cell, a common response is the cell will upregulate the particular receptor that is being antagonized. As such, consistent caffeine intake can result in an upregulation of adenosine receptors [1]. When you do not intake caffeine, you thus experience a heightened response, or a sensitization, to adenosine, and thus feel an increase in drowsiness.       </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caffeine is an adenosine antagonist. Adenosine makes you feel tired and antagonists block receptors. It doesn't actually give you energy by stimulating excitatory receptors like an amphetamine. However, both changes cause the brain to counter-regulate the effects of the substance and result in long-lasting physiological accommodations. This causes withdrawals when you take the chemical away and they can potentially last YEARS depending on your personal genes and lifestyle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: it's the same mechanism that leads to tolerance and dependence on other addictive psychoactive drugs like nicotine, cocaine, heroine, etc. </p>
<p>Your brain synapses adapt to the presence of the drug, so the brain's baseline ”normal” state requires the drug to be present. And when the drug is removed you get essentially the opposite of the drug's effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several components in your question, which, require a minimal scientific understanding in order to understand the answer. Your title question asks about &ldquo;<em>the biochemical origin of caffeine dependence</em>&rdquo;, but your clarifying text actually focuses on just one component, namely, increased tolerance to a given dose of caffeine.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, let's consider two related, but somewhat orthogonal concepts and an oversimplification of what they really mean.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pharmacology: What does a drug do to the body?</p>
</li>
<li>Pharmacokinetics: What does the body do to a drug?</li>
</ol>
<p>Pharmacologists and pharmacokineticists often work together, but they are focused on different problems. While pharmacologists want to understand how a drug imparts a particular effect on the body, pharmacokineticists want to understand the answers to two primary questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What quantity of a drug needs to be administered to achieve a certain pharmacological effect?</p>
</li>
<li>How often does that quantity need to be administered?</li>
</ol>
<p>Other people ITT have focused on the pharmacological aspect of caffeine (<em>i.e.</em> <strong>WHY</strong> does it make you feel the way it does?), but they haven't focused on the tolerance aspect, wherein you need successively larger doses to achieve a certain effect. For this question, we turn to pharmacokinetics.</p>
<p>Caffeine is eliminated from the body via several mechanisms. However, for most people, approximately 70% of caffeine is eliminated from the body via metabolism by one particular family of enzymes in the liver called CYP1A2. ^1 Within the liver, there are different families of enzymes responsible for metabolism. These families have different specificities/affinities for different compounds in our body (AKA <em>substrates</em>). As the affinity between a substrate and an enzyme increases, the ability of the enzyme to transform that substrate increases.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, in the case of caffeine, CYP1A2 is the primary enzyme responsible for transforming caffeine as part of the process for eliminating it from the body. The interesting thing about many (but not all) liver enzymes is that they can be <em>inducible</em>, meaning that there are feedback loops in your body's biochemistry that instruct the body to <em>upregulate</em> (increase) or <em>downregulate</em> (decrease) the levels of these enzymes in response to a stimulus.</p>
<p>In the case of caffeine, CYP1A2 happens to be inducible.^2 As you consume more caffeine, various regulatory mechanisms sense this increased load and tell the body to increase the amount of CYP1A2 metabolising enzymes. Therefore, when you consume 10 mg of caffeine daily (<em>ie</em> the dose) for several weeks, the amount available in your bloodstream (<em>ie</em> the exposure ) is decreased for a given dose because your body is clearing the caffeine more quickly than it did originally (<em>ie</em> your baseline). If you stop consuming caffeine (and any other compounds that could induce CYP1A2), your body will sense the decrease and levels of CYP1A2 will be decreased.</p>

<p>Caffeine acts as an antagonist at adenosine receptors, thereby blocking endogenous adenosine.25,26 Functionally, caffeine produces a range of effects opposite those of adenosine, including the behavioral stimulant effects associated with the drug.27 Importantly, caffeine has been shown to stimulate dopaminergic activity by removing the negative modulatory effects of adenosine at dopamine receptors.28 Studies suggest that dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens shell may be a specific neuropharmacological mechanism underlying the addictive potential of caffeine.29–32 Notably, dopamine release in this brain region is also caused by other drugs of dependence, including amphetamines and cocaine.33,34 In addition to the direct effects of caffeine on adenosine receptors, a recent study has shown that paraxanthine, the primary metabolite of caffeine in humans, produces increased locomotor activity, as well as increases in extracellular levels of dopamine through a phosphodiesterase inhibitory mechanism.35</p>
<p>Up-regulation of the adenosine system after chronic caffeine administration appears to be a neurochemical mechanism underlying caffeine withdrawal syndrome.36 This mechanism results in increased functional sensitivity to adenosine during caffeine abstinence, and it likely plays an important role in the behavioral and physiological effects produced by caffeine withdrawal.</p>
