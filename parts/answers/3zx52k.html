		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually just wrote a research paper on this a bit ago. What lovely timing.</p>
<p>There are a number of theories and ideas. The main ones all focus around genetics. The idea is that the majority of genes that cause Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are located or heavily influenced by genes on the X chromosome <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20479760" target="_blank">(1)</a>. Because men only have one they are more at risk for developing ASD when they have the defective or ASD genes while women have a spare X chromosome that protects them from either getting the disorder or, if they do get the disorder, from being as greatly impacted by it. This theory is known as the female protective model <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24581740" target="_blank">(2)</a>.</p>
<p>The second main theory is that women just show less symptoms and signs of ASD then men do and because of that are under diagnosed. Some of this goes back to genetics saying that women require much more genetic damage or mutation before they show similar symptoms as men (back to the female protective model). Other theories go towards the social aspect of it saying that women tend to be better at the main skills that are deficient in ASD naturally so deficiencies are less prominent than in men. The final idea is that women are just misdiagnosed because they show less severe symptomology of ASD and because ASD almost always comes co-morbid with other disorders such as eating disorders and depression <a href="http://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/2040-2392-6-6" target="_blank">(3)</a>. A few studies have shown that girls with ASD are diagnosed later than boys by an average of 2 years<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23001766" target="_blank">(4)</a>. Also a recent study looking at siblings of children with ASD shows that the ratio of men to women is likely closer to 1.65 to 1 than the widely reported ~4 to 1 ratio <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22453928" target="_blank">(5)</a> which seems to support this under-diagnosed theory.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's okay to admit the real answer to your question: we don't know. There are many theories out there and many studies investigating these theories, but we just aren't able to answer this question yet. </p>
<p>Another interesting question is why has the rate of ASD diagnoses increased so precipitously over the past few decades? Better diagnostic criteria explains some of this increase but not all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is proposed that autism is more common in males because of exposure to testosterone during fetal development, this is known as the &quot;<a href="http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/men-and-women-with-autism-have-extreme-male-scores-on-the-eyes-test-of-mindreading" target="_blank">extreme male brain theory of autism</a>&quot;. This theory proposes that autism is a hormone related condition affecting fetal brain development. The theory was proposed by Simon Baron-Cohen of Cambridge university approx. 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Simon's team at Cambridge have found several lines of evidence in support of this theory. For example, there's evidence that children exposed to elevated levels of testosterone in the womb exhibit increased autistic traits at 18-24 months (Auyeung et al., 2010) and females on the autism spectrum have above average levels of testosterone (Ingudomnukul et al. 2007). Additionally, female to male transsexuals score higher on tests of autistic traits (Jones et al., 2012) and there also appears to be a relationship between <a href="http://image.slidesharecdn.com/imfarposter2011cdjbedits-13349143164731-phpapp01-120420043412-phpapp01/95/2d4d-digit-ratio-and-autism-severity-in-boys-imfar-2011-1-1024.jpg?cb=1334896492" target="_blank">finger length ratios</a> (influenced by prenatal testosterone) and severity of autistic traits (Teatero &amp; Netley, 2013).</p>
<p>Here's a Tedx talk by Simon Baron-Cohen about the extreme male brain theory of autism:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEYy1GXaNNY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eEYy1GXaNNY</a></p>
<p>However, it must be acknowledged that this theory <a href="https://spectrumnews.org/news/study-on-extreme-male-brain-theory-of-autism-draws-critics/" target="_blank">has vocal critics</a>, who disagree with its apparently sexist and generalist implications; that men are superior at systematizing while women are superior at empathizing. </p>
<p>The extreme male brain theory is often cited in the non-science press as a reason for a gender disparity in certain areas of study and work, why there's so few women studying computer science e.g. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/feb/26/computer-geeks-autism" target="_blank">Autism: how computers can help r</a>. Explanations that cite a biologically based explanation for gender disparities in certain areas of work or study are <a href="http://fortune.com/2015/04/20/the-pervasive-bias-against-female-computer-science-majors/" target="_blank">vigorously challenged by critics</a> who believe that academic culture and workplace bias influence women's career choices and opportunities than alleged biologically dictated differences.</p>
