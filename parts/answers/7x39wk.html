		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a normal functioning brain there are two factors that control sleep drive, the so-called &quot;C&quot; factor (Or Process C) and the &quot;S&quot; factor (or Process S).</p>
<p>The C factor is the Circadian rhythm, which is driven by day-night cycles. As bright lights such as the sun come and go, it increases and decreases your sleep drive over the course of the day. It's regulated in the brain by melatonin. In most people the C drive part is most pushing towards sleep around 10 PM though in some disorders it can move earlier or later, or move around randomly (this is a major problem in blind people who have no light cueing the brain to cycle with the proper time of day). It also changes through age, getting earlier into older age.</p>
<p>The S factor is the &quot;homeostatic&quot; sleep drive, driven by chemicals in the brain that accumulate while you are awake and then diminish while you sleep. So if you wake up at 7 AM these chemicals will start building up over the course of the day and eventually become so strong that you will want to go to bed, hopefully around the same time that your circadian rhythm sleep drive is peaking as well. One of these chemicals is adenosine, which is blocked by caffeine therefore mimicking the effects of getting enough sleep on your perceived level of alertness.</p>
<p>So you go to bed and fall asleep when the addition of your C and S factors make it too difficult or unpleasant to remain awake. As you sleep the S drive chemicals are reduced, and your Circadian rhythm drive falls as well, meaning that the drive for sleep reduces until eventually you wake up, either spontaneously or because your sleep is so light that some outside stimulus can awaken you pretty easily.</p>
<p>As you can see there are lots of ways that you can screw up one or both of these natural drives and therefore screw up a healthy sleep pattern. Too much napping in the day will reduce your S factor early and make it hard to fall asleep during the night. Drinking caffeine late in the day and blocking adenosine has the same effect chemically. Too much bright light like computer screens late in the evening reset your Circadian rhythms and trick your brain into thinking it's earlier than it is, making the C factor not push enough to let you fall asleep when you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Circadian rhythm is the brain's &quot;clock&quot; (which basically runs in a 24 hour time frame). It creates an ebb and flow to our energy levels (energy usually depletes closer to evening and starts / increasing in the morning hours). This clock can adjust to flipped schedules (working at night and sleeping during the day) but other adjustments like blackout curtains during the day (sunlight is at least a part of the circadian rhythm) may have to be used. </p>
<p>There are a number of abnormal circadian rhythms disorders that cause a host of problems. ADHD can cause insomnia (staying awake when you should be able to fall asleep for example) but most disorders aren't as pronounced as never being able to fall asleep or wake up (short of head trauma).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I use to have a friend who would basically hibernate every year, and go through an opposite process sometime afterward. Basically, she would at some point, almost always in the winter, sleep for several days. She'd wake up once a day to get a drink or use the bathroom, and then return to sleep. I think she said it was usually 1-2 weeks that she did this. Sometime afterwards, in the summer or something, she'd go through an opposite process of sleeping at most 1-2 hours for several weeks. Last I heard she stopped going through this process a few years ago, and the process started in her teens (she's now mid twenties)</p>
<p>I don't have any explanation for it, but I've always been curious what kind of thing causes such a weird sleep process and if anyone else has had something similar. So, anyone else ever had this or heard of such a thing? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have no idea what the feeling of having enough sleep is, at least not a feeling that wakes me up.  In my early 20's I once went to bed on a Friday evening, no alcohol or funny business involved.  Woke up at what I thought was like noon Saturday.  It was noon Sunday.  I never have woken up in middle of night to relieve myself.  Have slept through things that wake everyone else up, like gunshots just outside bedroom window and minor earthquake tremors..... Never happened again.  But 12+ hours is a regular occurrence on weekends usually. I know as a young child my mother used to get really angry and throw a huge mixing bowl full of ice onto my head to make me get up..... Lol  She and I just figured, because lazy teenager.  There was truth in that but that one epic sleep event makes me wonder.  I've always told people I am a breath away from death when I sleep... because I don't recollect dreams.... I lay down, go out and it's many hours later (or the alarm is going off and I force myself to get up after snoozing it a few times..) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe it mostly has to do with circadian rhythm and how cortisol is released early in the morning. And because the body works on a negative and positive feedback mechanism. Therefore increase in cortisol will result in a decrease of melatonin. Here is a good map of this:
