		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Standing in place is actually way harder for your body. The muscles in your lower back are always tense when you stand. Where as when walking, they get relaxed and then tense up again.
Imagine doing 20 pushups in 5 minutes. Now imagine doing 1 pushup in 5 minutes (staying low)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Standing still causes all of the pressure to be applied to the same region and the same structures, same goes for muscle activity.  When standing still we tend to search for energy conservation and our muscles stop being active, transferring all of the pressure/stress to the passive structures such as ligaments, joint capsules, intervertabrel discs, etc.  </p>
<p>Gait is a complex system of different muscles that continiously work in sequence, therefor we stay active and we don't transfer the load to our passive structures and we continiously shift the load to different places.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Doctor of physical therapy here, top answer has this partially correct. Standing requires constant contraction of musculature that is required to keep us upright whereas walking is an innately efficient means of movement that stores potential energy and releasing kinetic energy with every step. Additionally standing still keeps constant pressure on our spines which does not allow synovial fluid (the joints lubrication) to flow as freely. It also hinders the pizioelectric effect of our spinal discs (think fluid moving in and out). This is why we say motion is lotion!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
