		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The end of phone scams begins with the fact that you own the phone and are in no way obligated to even answer it much less be polite to someone who calls it.
Someone calls about your credit card, hang up without an explanation and call the number printed on the back of your card.
Someone &quot;from the IRS&quot; calls you, hang up the IRS doesn't call you.
If the utility is threatening your service unless you pay up immediately, hang up and look up the number for the utility and call directly.
If you are actually in trouble with local law enforcement they'll be at your door not on your phone. Hung up.
Anybody spot a theme here?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unfortunately it's because telescammers are now very mobile and use technology to both hinder people from identifying the caller and keep law enforcement from using methods to track and prosecute them.</p>
<p>They use techniques like spoofing unknowing peoples phone numbers, or using disposable phone numbers through less than reputable dealers that can be quickly and easily disconnected before moving to the next victim number.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>best way to deal with the MS callers, is to pretend your doing what they ask. pretend to be completly inept at using the computer. then after about 10-15 mins, reveal that you are actively wasting their time. you know what they want, and you actually just sat on the toilet. they will call you names, and say they will kill you, then they will hang up. and the calls stop. or at least they did for me. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had my number spoofed about a month ago (people from my area code texting me or leaving voicemails saying &quot;who is this?&quot; or &quot;take me off your call list&quot;) I contacted authorities and such just to find out if there was a resource for reporting this and was basically told there was nothing to be done and to change the # that I had for years.</p>
<p>Also checked with several representatives of the service provider to see if they was any resource for noting the assigned phone # as being associated with fraudulent activity and found that every person I spoke with barely seemed to care.</p>
<p>It's curious that companies wouldn't take the same approach with phone fraud as credit companies do with fraud in their industry.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
