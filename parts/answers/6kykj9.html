		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several possible reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Timing. It may be a medicine you have to take throughout the day (like every 8 hours for example) rather than all at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Unusual use. Some medicines can be used to treat problems they weren't originally developed for. This may require an uncommon dosage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insurance. Insurance is <em>really weird</em> and may only pay for a certain size of pill. They may agree to pay for 10mg pills but not 20mg pills, so if you need 20mg a day, the fastest and easiest way to get around insurance shenanigans is instructing you to take 2 10mg pills instead of 1 20mg pill. Otherwise, your doctor will have to write your insurance a letter explaining that yes you need this and they should cover it or you'll have to pay out of pocket for it. Usually the pharmacy will contact the doctor and ask for permission to substitute.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pharmacy is out of the larger size. This happens from time to time. Again, they'll clear this with the doctor first.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It just doesn't exist in a bigger size. Drug companies make their medicines in commonly used dosage types. Smaller is generally better. You can usually just take more pills if you need a bigger dosage, with some exceptions, but it's harder when you need a smaller dosage and only bigger pills exist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bigger pill sizes may be available only with a prescription, but the smaller ones can be bought over the counter. Ibuprofen (Advil) is an example of this. You can buy 200mg pills over the counter, but 600mg and up require prescriptions. In this case, the pharmacist can't give you the bigger pill unless you have a prescription from your doctor saying you need it. But giving you smaller ones is a-ok.</p>
</li>
<li>Bigger pills can be a pain to swallow. Going back to the ibuprofen example, if you've seen the larger sizes, they're huge. Swallowing them can be difficult, especially if the patient is a child or elderly, so going with smaller pill sizes or the medicine in a liquid form would be better for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>There's probably more that I didn't think of, but these are really the most common.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If most people need 100mg of something, and you need 200mg, it's easier to give you two of the 100mg and keep ordering the same size pill like they usually do, rather than order a 200mg pill just for you. </p>
<p>Possible reasons why different people might need different doses: weight, size, severity of issue, etc. </p>
<p>Another reason is that some pills can just become uncomfortable to swallow/digest. Think of NyQuil pills. You're supposed to take 2. Imagine that, in one giant pill - hardly comfortable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the pills are mass produced in a standard size, and it's much faster for the pharmicist to grab a box from the draw and say &quot;take 2&quot; than it is to carefully make up a batch of the drug, then weigh it, then press it into individual pills.</p>
<p>In theory they can (a compounding pharmacist is the specialization), and they can also change the drugs into other forms (eg a liquid), but it's slow and hence expensive, so they only do it if you actually need it</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd just want to add one point to these good answers.</p>
<p>Making different dose sizes costs more money. There is no cost increase in having some patient take 2 tablets/caps rather than making a whole new line of product aimed at the few that take a bigger dose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacists don't create the pills. So, no, they can't give you one pill for the exact dosage that you need. Your doctor determines the dosage you need. Pill size is determined long before this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
