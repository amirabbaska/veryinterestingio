		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because we have so much access to knowledge and experiences through media that we would probably would not in a more &quot;natural&quot; environment, freeze is not as prevalent. We can recognize many things in the environment and instinctively ignore them because they are both familiar and identifiable. </p>
<p>Freeze is definitely a common response to almost anything unfamiliar, particularly when noticed in normal routine. Most people who notice do a freeze to better ascertain both its characteristics, point of origin, and other beings reactions to it.</p>
<p>Slam the door, yell and scream, or watch a movie with explosions and guns and my cat wouldn't stir or flinch. Her reaction when ice machine quietly dropps its load of ice in the freezer would be a great startled cat gif. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People tend to think of &quot;either/or&quot; in situations. Programmers know about the &quot;if/then/else&quot; way of processing a situation. Freezing may be the &quot;else&quot;. Thinking about sexual assault crimes makes me wonder if the &quot;freeze&quot; reaction is a form of mental flight. Imagine being in a situation where you cannot flee, and fighting may get you killed. Freezing may be the best route to survival.</p>
<p>Is there a psychologist out there who would care to weigh in on this discussion?</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fight or Flight response is just a name given to the physiological response under threat. Pupils dilate, blood is rushed to central organs from our exteremities, etc. It's basically describing what the BODY does to get ready to 'fight or flee' to deal with the threat. Whether we choose to fight or flee is a cognitive process. I believe it's the same thing for freezing, where it is more of a cognitive response than a bodily (physiological) response. I think that is why freezing is not talked about when talking about the 'fight or flight response' because really, this is just talking about what happens in the body, and thus comes before whether the person ends up fighting, fleeing, or freezing. The question of why we sometimes freeze is a separate topic to the physiological respons, but an interesting one for sure</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we encounter frightening situations, we either engage in a fight response, flight response, or freezing response. </p>
<p>The fight or flight response (in its original form) is about survival. It's about hope. We activate it when we believe there's a chance we can outrun or outfight our attackers. The freeze response however, gets activated when's there's no hope (usually). </p>
<p>The freeze response works differently. You can view it as an &quot;energy conservation&quot; mechanism, basically to just brace yourself up and prepare to endure the impending ordeal. This response is the most adaptive of the three.</p>
<p>The fight or flight response, on the other hand, tells the heart to beat faster, the muscles to tense, the eyes to dilate and the mucous membranes to dry up. As a result of which, you can fight harder, run faster, see better and breathe easier than you would without this response. This response kicks in for real threats and imagined ones in as little as mere fractions of a second: much less than the amount of time between two beats of the heart.</p>
<hr />
<p>That's why the fight or flight response is now called the fight, flight or freeze response. Because, sometimes, when the odds are overwhelming we neither fight nor flee but simply freeze.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fight or flight response is a sympathetic nervous system cascade that evolved to aid certain beneficial behaviors in challenging circumstances eg fight, fleet, sex. It does nothing, physiologically, that would aid freezing. Humans sometimes freeze in situations where the fight or flight response has  activated because of other—higher level—cognitive processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
