		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Belfort did many illegal things but I think most people here are missing the big one. This was a 3 part process:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>He had several of his wealthiest, most trust-worthy clients buy large amounts of new stock issues (IPO) from his firm. These were his &quot;rat-holes.&quot; He would guarantee them a certain return on their investment, say 10%.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He would then push these stocks on his other, less affluent clients. As this second wave of buying progressed it drove the price of the stock higher. For arguments sake, lets say the price goes up 50%.</p>
</li>
<li>He would instruct the rat-holes to sell. They would get their 10% cut and he would pocket the difference of 40%. Scale that up by considering that he was doing this with tens of millions of dollars.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>These numbers are for illustration. The actual numbers were likely much larger.</strong></p>
<p>The end result: His rat-holes made 10% essentially risk free. He made tens of millions in profit, and the vast majority of his &quot;average joe&quot; clients lost most of their investment.</p>
<p>EDIT: People have pointed out that this just details what Jordan's process was, but not what laws were being broken. Copied from my reply buried in this thread: </p>
<p>Belfort was brilliant because the rules surrounding this type of trading were, at the time, very vague. The SEC had to create new rules to catch him.</p>
<p>A few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guaranteeing a return on a stock transaction is illegal.</li>
<li>Owning stock on behalf of someone else is illegal (without doing it properly and disclosing ownership).</li>
<li>The types of sales practices they used were illegal.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem the SEC had was that these violations are relatively minor and they would not have been able to recoup investor losses.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Commenting here as a former broker who worked at the firm directly next door to Stratton:</p>
<p>To expand on a lot the comments below, there are some other aspects that while may not have technically been &quot;illegal&quot; per say, were frowned upon from a regulatory compliance point of view. A couple of very specific things we used to do as examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Churning - This is the act of making multiple trades in a customer's account which had the effect of a) creating more revenue for the firm, and b) creating more activity in the stock in question. This was fairly common practice in the firms which operated in the vicinity.</p>
</li>
<li>Stock Lock In - On many many occasions we (I say we, but I was simply a cold caller\account opener with zero financial savvy) would lock customers' stocks up and not allow them to sell or trade off shares until the firm had realized the price-points they were looking for. It worked like this: Joe Blow is sold 30,000 shares of ASDF, and he is not necessarily a degenerate-gambler-type investor just yet, matter of fact he is the father of some other loser who went in large a few days before and simply engaged us based on this conversation during a round of golf with loser A. Anyway, he watches the stock closely, and sees it start trending up, up and up. On day 4, he notices a large drop-off, and using his infinite wisdom and gut instinct, he nervously decides to call our &quot;trading desk&quot; and sell his $10k worth of shares (which by the way, are now worth $2k). Well, Joe calls and calls, but he simply cannot get anyone on the phone. This is part of the design - you see <em>we</em> already know aint nobody calling in to buy stock, and if they are calling to buy then they have a direct line to the broker. If they happen to catch the broker two things happen - A) The broker usually gets the &quot;investor&quot; to effectively double-down and dump his kids college fund into whatever  or B) hangs up on the customer. The underlying theme here is that the firm has a large interest in the same stock, and keeping their customers locked-in, guarantees that they can control the movement of the  stock. Once the firm &quot;dumps&quot; its own shares, the stock spirals down, and customers call. Full circle fuck-ery.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have a ton of personal experiences and stories from that time, and looking back on that (when I was like 20) I can't believe I was even involved. This is really just two examples. Ask me about the 19 year old kid who drove a brand spanking new Viper to work... that was mind-blowing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Securities/Stock Fraud. The brokers tell people that certain stocks are &quot;really hot&quot; and that if they invest they will make a bunch of money. This is bullshit and the brokers know it. Sometimes the brokers even artificially increase the value of the stock by buying many shares for themselves, in order to convince clueless investors. Also getting high risk investments out of people who don't understand the risks (aka Taking advantage of people) qualifies as stock fraud. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea is that you own a lot of worthless stock. So you use pressure and lies to try and sell as much of the stock for that company as possible without declaring your own holdings of it; once the increased demand has resulted in a higher market price, you dump your stock at the going rate, and it quickly goes back to being worthless. Ultimately the only person who has benefited from the whole operation is you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are great explanations but wikipedia has a lot of good information about this.  There are also many books which can be referenced from wiki or on the net.  Some terms of interest, among many, are:</p>
<p>George Soros.  British Pound manipulation.<br />
Market Manipulation.<br />
Greenmailing.<br />
Hostile Takeover.<br />
Arbitrage (which was the title of a movie IIRC)  Not specifically illegal in a very, very restricted legal sense.<br />
T. Boone Pickens.<br />
Michael Milkin.<br />
Junk Bonds.<br />
Leverage.<br />
Margin.  </p>
<p>And you've heard these terms but look them up:  </p>
<p>Derivatives.<br />
CDO.<br />
Security Underwriting.  </p>
<p>In essence, 'the market', by which I mean the three main financial markets people are familiar with, called Stocks, Bonds, and Money or Currency Trading, depend on timing and knowledge to be profitable.</p>
<p>If everyone everywhere knew exactly what every company was doing every single time, none of these markets would exist.  You could buy and sell stocks, but no one would want that job because you would just get a flat percentage everyone knew about.  You'd essentially be a retail worker selling things, or a warehouse worker storing data.</p>
<p>The profitability of pure market trading has to do with information access and timing.</p>
<p>Big investors like the famous Soros and Buffett market manipulate.  They do this in sometimes unethical ways, and sometimes in ways that people can't see and which aren't illegal but are the same thing.  Warren Buffet specifically manipulates in a very long-term way.  If he buys railroads and says railroads will be the wave of the future, and all of his Berkshire Hathaway minions fall all over themselves in ecstasy at the next meeting in Omaha, you can rest assured that <em>associated</em> properties are involved.  If Buffet buys railroads and holds (and that is his charm, he's not whipping out trades by the 10 billion a day), you <em>know</em> it's not about railroads.  It's about real estate, oil, food, roads, or something else which railroads are associated with.  If you are determined to know, you can investigate all of his holdings and understand what he's doing.  But no one can do this, or no one I've heard of can do it.  And if they do, they are brought into the fold.</p>
<p>T. Boone Pickens made his fortune greemailing oil-services and oil-production companies.  Then he moved on to Mom and Pop businesses.  Mid-sized manufacturers which had prudent, home-spun practices like Don't Have Debt, Save Cash, Own don't Finance, and other 'common sense' type practices.  That meant this mid-sized companies are like fat strawberries waiting to be plucked.</p>
<p>He used Junk Bonds from Michael Milkin to leverage big buys of very healthy firms.  Then he would take those firms and liquidate the cash, sell the assets, fire everyone, and break the company up into profitable chunks to be sold at auction.  This has been associated with Hostile Takeovers and in fact is a legitimate business tactic, one from which a famous Presidential candidate derived his family wealth, Mitt Romney.  In the ecosystem, there is a place for vultures.</p>
<p>But when T. Boone Pickens gets on TV and announces he is starting a movement for Green Energy, and there are windmills churning behind him in the scene, you <em>know</em> it's not about green energy.  </p>
<p>What these people do is manipulate large numbers of people into an action, and then there are consequences to those actions, and the profit is made on the consequence.  Some people liken it to Chess (which I find boring), but you also know this if you play a good-enough video game.</p>
<p>Guys on the level of the WOWS guys just don't have enough cash to do the things I've described.</p>
<p>What they do is harvest large numbers of fairly wealthy and/or foolhardy people by bald-faced lying.  They get them to finance a stock which is worthless (or not, doesn't matter), inflating the price.  Beforehand, they and their friends had bought all of the premium shares and agreed upon a sales schedule which would allow them to sell the now-inflated stock at a big profit.  Once the selling is known, the 'common people' realize the stock price is falling and try to sell. This causes a panic or sell-off, and the stock is worthless.  By the time you hear about it, the WOWS guys are already on their yacht snorting coke off of... well you know.</p>
<p>Pump and Dump.</p>
<p>Final note.  One of the most storied methods ever used was when the British Government agreed to support the price of the Pound against the Euro using British public bonds.  Every day they had a formalized meeting to buy or sell bonds, using the credit of the British people, to keep the price steady.</p>
<p>That is like blood in the water.  That is just plain announcing that you are going to allow people to take advantage of timing and make money.</p>
<p>One of the sharks that assembled was George Soros.  He would buy pounds at a low price during the trading day.  Large large numbers of them.  Then he would sell pounds at the inflated price once the British government had inflated the price again.  This means he had to buy and sell in blocks, carefully timed not to upset the 'elasticity' in the market.</p>
<p>The British government kept financing this activity mainly to save face.  A single private investor, some dude, was forcing the United Kingdom, the Realm, to finance his profits.  They finally gave up after it became apparent that their stated model, their sterling word, meant that Soros could manipulate them into bankruptcy.  They let the Pound float and it of course dropped in value and caused a ripple effect through the British economy which took years to overcome.</p>
<p>And that is how you can be a single man in an office and force a powerful nation-state to it's knees with about 7 phone calls and two meetings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
