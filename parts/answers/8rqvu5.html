<p>Thus Tesla actually designed two &quot;first responder cut loops&quot; into their cars--one in the front trunk, one in the back--and each year releases Emergency Response Guides for first responders instructing them on how to fight a Tesla fire.</p>
<p>Cutting either of the loops &quot;shuts down the high voltage system outside of the high voltage battery and disables the SRS and airbag components,&quot; reducing the risk of explosion.</p>
<p>They also have to show firefighters where not to cut during rescue/firefighting efforts. </p>
<p>Additionally, information is included in Tesla's guide warning of the toxic vapors released by a burning battery.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the battery packs in these cars are made up of thousands of smaller batteries.  Not just one or 2 huge ass LI-Ion cells.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a firefighter in Washington DC here are the special precautions/items we take into consideration when fighting an electrical vehicle fire/cut</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>During a fire involving a Electric Vehicle, shock should not occur because the Hugh voltage of a electric vehicle does not use the earth as a ground. A f/f standing on the ground does not complete a circuit when a stream of water hits he electric vehicle. There is still a possibility though if you touch an electrical component of electrical shock</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will be common fluid leaks to look for with an electrical vehicle KOH-potassium hydroxide, marlotherm, sulfuric acid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A telltale sign of a EV is the international orange color associated with the wiring system that provides power. The wiring usually runs beneath the floorboards and along the cars lower frame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As with any electrical system, try and dump the electricity first and wait for 5-10 minutes if possible to let the electricity drain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Always check disconnect switch before rescue operations (most of time located under back seat)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before any cutting operations, make a spy cut first or peel back any insulation to check for wires (edited a word, autocorrect)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The battery pack and cables remain hot for several minutes after power is shut off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Capacitors may still work after main power is shut off</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Never cut directly into the battery pack</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Large EV fires can be controlled with water. If the fire is small in nature and involves just the batteries, consider using the type D extinguisher or a type BC extinguisher</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Safety devices should automatically open circuits close to the traction battery in a EV</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a fog stream to dilute toxic gases from a burning EV car battery (try to control the spread of toxic fumes basically with a fog stream)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the NAERG for info on exposure to subsantes on a EV...(use the guide in the 140s I think 147 maybe? I don’t have a NAERG readily available at this second)</p>
</li>
<li>As with any vehicle fire, park the wagon at least 50 feet+ away from burning car, secure a water supply, use 2 handlines, approach the car at a 45 degree angle from the front bumper of the car, douse the passenger compartment first, then engine compartment, and finally ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS pop open the trunk and check for a body in there before you leave the scene of ANY vehicle fire </li>
</ol>
<p>As for #14 this happens more often then you think. It happened just this year here a company put out a car fire in an alley off Texas avenue and left the scene, cops showed up, trunk was locked, called FD back to scene, popped open the trunk, voila one body with multiple GSW wounds. It happened a few more times in the years past as well. So many times in fact, it’s now EXPRESSLY written in our standing orders.</p>
<p>Edit: people Messaged me asking what a NAERG is...here is a copy of the North American Emergency Response Guidebook - NAERG...published every 3 or 4 years. Every fire truck in the country carries this book.
So you know the placards you see on trucks that are inside those diamonds? 1993 for example with a flammable designation. Look up the name of the chemical (the blue section everything is in alphabetical order there, or by number in the yellow section, ascending order) then refer to the GUIDE NUMBER it tells you (the orange section) so if a chemical says refer to guide #147, turn to guide number 147 in the orange section and follow what it says</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. The DOT publishes an emergency response guidebook for many different chemicals and situations. <a href="https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/sites/phmsa.dot.gov/files/docs/ERG2016.pdf" target="_blank">PDF Link Here</a>. In this guide, section 147 should be used for batteries (and electric + hybrid vehicles). This directs first responders to evacuate the area up to 25 meters in all directions, to wear respirators, and what methods can be used to fight the fire (dry chemical, CO2, foam). The section for gasoline fires is 128.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The HV batteries will have a few different isolation systems to help with this issue built in. First they will have big relays that will open the connections outside of the battery pack in the event of a crash or other failure. Second there will be a manual disconnect that is fused which will also open circuit the battery pack to the rest of the car. </p>
<p>Ideally if a fire starts anywhere not in the battery pack it should be safer than a combustion engine fire as the HV system is disconnected from the HV batteries. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on if you can get to it or not, most EVs come with an emergency disconnect, so the first option would be to disconnect from there. On most traffic accidents most first responders are trained to disconnect the battery first. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
