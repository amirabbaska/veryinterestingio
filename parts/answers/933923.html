		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many ways to take photographs of a nuclear explosion without damaging the camera.</p>
<p>You can, at a minimum, use a zoom lens, with your camera at an appropriate distance. The &quot;manned&quot; cameras involved this approach, of course.</p>
<p>Should you need a camera closer, you can put them into concrete bunkers. At the Trinity test, they had cameras in concrete bunkers, pointing <em>up</em>, with mirrors on top. So even if the mirrors/glass got messed up, the blast wave would be moving at an angle perpendicular to the well-shielded camera. <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dbf6-CeU0AAzdAS.jpg" target="_blank">Mirrors</a>; <a href="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dbf61edU8AAvvyc.jpg" target="_blank">overall setup</a> (the cameras were set up to be pulled out on a &quot;sled&quot; by a tank after the fact); a <a href="https://www.atomicheritage.org/sites/default/files/Camera%20installations%2C%20photo%20shelter%20%2810%2C000%20N%29.jpg" target="_blank">photo shelter 10,000 yards North of the Trinity test</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
