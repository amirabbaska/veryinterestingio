		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studies have shown females as a whole have better fine motor skills where as males as a whole have better large motor skills. This can be somewhat attributed to genetics as men where expected to hunt while women would go pick berries. As these differences became expected in society they would get reinforced by expecting, for example women to sew and men to lift heavy things. In addition when a female is bad at handwriting society will harp on them to make it better because they expect it to be better, whereas if a male has bad handwriting they'll say &quot;well boys are just bad at it&quot;. The reverse is true for sports in many cases.</p>
<p>Basically it's nature that gets extra reinforced by nurture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>TL;DR - Motor skills, gender stereotypes, and language literacy contribute to handwriting skill development</p>
<p>And then the other study: <a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/psychology/jrb/PDFs/Beech%20&%20Mackintosh%202005.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.le.ac.uk/psychology/jrb/PDFs/Beech%20&%20Mackintosh%202005.pdf</a></p>
<p>TL;DR - Your sex hormones have a meaningful impact on your handwriting style (a little better than ~two thirds of the time, the sex of the writer could be determined by handwriting)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One theory is that men and women are taught to handwrite at the same time, which is the best time for women but a bad time for men. Thus men learn to handwrite too late/early for them to learn it effectively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Confirming psychology, based on personal experience. I used to crave any affirmation or attention from my dad and I remember he once commented on my good handwriting as a child. I soaked it up so much that I became obsessed with perfecting it. If I started a book report and it wasn't perfect, I'd rewrite the whole thing again. </p>
<p>Edit: Upon further thought, I think social expectations coupled with fine motor skills played a part. I do remember my brother always got outside toys and I seemed to like activities where I could make bracelets, write and color. However, the desire to please my parents and teachers really played a big part. Would like to take the time to also mention my superb typing skills. Shout out to the home row keys! :) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
