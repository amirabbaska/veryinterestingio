		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excellent question. A bunch of people want to communicate at the same time. Since other people make a lot of noise, you have to speak louder. Everyone else speaks louder too and eventually you are shouting as hard as you can and nobody can hear you since everyone is shouting. To make this work, you need a system.</p>
<p>First comes FDMA (Frequency division multiple access) which is basically giving everyone their own frequency. This is analogous to putting everyone in different rooms so they do not have to shout due to lack of interference. We quickly ran out of rooms to use once we got more users so we abandoned the idea.</p>
<p>Then comes TDMA (Time division multiple access) which is basically giving everyone a short time slot to transmit their message. This is analogous to giving people turns to speak so they won't interfere with each other. This is how GSM network works.</p>
<p>CDMA (Code division multiple access) is when you encode your data into the white noise and then run the decoding algorithm to get it back. This is analogous to everyone speaking at the same time but in different languages. This helps to separate different people speaking, but when there are a lot of users, the speech still becomes impossible to differentiate from the noise. This is how 3G works.</p>
<p>OFDMA (orthogonal frequency division multiple access) is what LTE uses and is quite more complicated but is basically separating users by time AND frequency thus increasing capacity by a lot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cell towers do in fact transmit the same information to every cellphone in range. However, the data is encrypted, so that only the correct phone can understand the information meant for that particular phone. </p>
<p>Each phone gets a time slot where the data sent is for that phone, and each phone gets a time slot where it can send data back. The data the phone sends back can also be heard by other phones in range, but again, the data is encrypted so that only the cell tower understands it.</p>
<p>Wi-fi routers work the same way, and this is one of the reasons the speeds decrease the more people on a tower/router, even if the signal strength seems fine. Every device needs to take its turn to send and receive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically all modern systems work by sending all the data out at the same frequency and getting the phone to only see the part of the data that is meant for it. Encryption means that you can't (maliciously or accidentally) overhear someone else's data.</p>
<p>The fundamental way this works is by having the phone and tower agree on some scheme by which the data will be split up or mixed. In 2G technology, the phone and tower agree to only listen/transmit at certain times. In 3G, the phone listens all the time, but it uses a pseudo-random sequence to filter the signal it receives. The tower is using the same sequence to perform the opposite filter on the data to turn it into the signal. You can think of this as similar to the 2G technology; the tower switches extremely fast between transmitting different phones' data - faster than it takes to transmit a single bit of data. It's a little more complicated than that, but it ends up with all the data being transmitted at once, and each phone extracts the data that is meant for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are good explanations here to people with high technical understanding.</p>
<p>I am going to shoot for the 5.</p>
<p>Antennas emit radiation that we can't see, light is radiation we can see.</p>
<p>There are different patterns that exist in light and radiation. For example, the different colors you see are different patternS of  radiation.</p>
<p>to take this further, you can visualize these patterns as waves in the ocean. Some are longer, some are taller. Some have waves on top of waves.</p>
<p>Multiplexing is like having multiple waves on the same wave. We have mastered the abilitiy to Make tierred waves and constantly get better at it.</p>
<p>Understanding that. You can explore the other answers that give detail about the various forms of mutliplexing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
