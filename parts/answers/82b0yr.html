		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, yeah.</p>
<p>Longer answer:</p>
<p>BPA (Bisphenol-A) is a monomer used in making a polycarbonate plastic with excellent thermal and mechanical stability. It’s the thermal stability that made it a popular material for use in baby bottles, as it could stand up to the heat of hot water without deforming. The reaction used to make it combines bisphenol-A with phosgene to make the polymer. Though the carbonate (if you’re looking at the structure, the -O-(C=O)-O part) is very stable and strong, it still is polar enough to interact with water on a molecular level and, over time, hydrolyze, releasing BPA and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>PET (poly(ethylene terephthalate)), what you see in water and soda bottles (recycle number 1) is similar in that it’s a plastic with desirable physical and optical properties, though not as strong and robust at high temperatures as BPA polycarbonate.  This plastic is made by a couple of routes, the one i’m most familiar with being the condensation of ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid. Again, much like BPA polycarbonate, PET is very stable but over time the ester functionality (-(C=O)-O-) is polar and can be hydrolyzed, the byproducts being the monomers: terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol.  I think terephthalic acid has been identified as a problematic chemical much like BPA, but for whatever reason (maybe not as bad? Maybe because it’s not directly associated with babies? Maybe coca cola has a lot more riding on being able to package their products in PET?) I don’t feel like it’s gotten the same level of attention.</p>
<p>So, answering the actual question, yeah just about anything will degrade and release some sort of constituent chemical over time. Polymers typically degrade into some form of the monomers used to make them, so it’s very important in designing plastics to select your monomers to form polymers that degrade into non-toxic, non-harmful chemicals.</p>
<p>As an example of a more palatable plastic for food/drink applications: a lot of places use silverware/cups made from poly(lactic acid) (you might see these advertised as “made from plants”, or something similar). The reason you usually only see those cups at soda fountains in restaurants is because they melt at something like 90F, making them pretty useless for hot liquids.  So while they have somewhat limited use, they are biodegradable and when they do slowly release a chemical, it’s only lactic acid, which occurs naturally in your body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most plastic bottles leach some chemicals into the water or other food/liquid in them. This is why there was a big uproar to replace BPA in plastic bottles since it was found to leach chemicals which mimic estrogen. The new BPA-free plastics don't seem to be much better.  Here is a story from NPR - &gt; <a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/03/02/134196209/study-most-plastics-leach-hormone-like-chemicals" target="_blank">https://www.npr.org/2011/03/02/134196209/study-most-plastics-leach-hormone-like-chemicals</a></p>
<p>There was a similar problem with the linings put into some metal water bottles a few years ago. I am not aware of any recent studies on that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common plastic used in bottles is Polyethylene:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyethylene</a></p>
<p>Which is made up of very basic hydrocarbons and can be made with with catalysts rather than needing lots of chemical reagents so there really isn't that much opportunity for impurities.</p>
<p>Other plastics are more complex to synthesize and can potentially harbor harmful molecules. I don't know a ton about more complex plastics but given water is something plastics need to be able to interact with inertly I'd wager that manufacturers are pretty good at keeping the impurities low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
