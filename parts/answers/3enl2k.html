		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is &quot;because the only examples of life we have ever seen require this sort of setup.&quot; It's what we know so, based upon that, if we are going to go searching that's where we are statistically more likely to find life. If all our evidence of our local system shows that only one type of planetary body is capable of supporting life then you look for that type of planetary body.</p>
<p>The long answer is a bit more complex.</p>
<p>First of all, you have to remember space is huge. Too big to comprehend. You cannot look everywhere. It's too big, there is too much data, and we don't have enough equipment. It's impossible.</p>
<p>So you want to narrow your focus to high probabilities.</p>
<p>Especially as the most common life form out there we probably wouldn't be able to detect.</p>
<p>Microbial life has a very high probability of being, well, all over the place. A lot of scientists still think the idea of panspermia has merit. This theory (okay, really more of a hypothesis if you want to get technical about it) states that life didn't spontaneously evolve on Earth at all. Microbes attached to meteors or comets landed on primordial Earth when it was rich in the right setup to create lots of amino acids and it got the ball rolling. In which case all life is the descendants of an invasive species.</p>
<p>Wheeeee!</p>
<p>But, that's beside the point. Microbes may be everywhere. They can be really hardy things. But one or two dormant microbes clutching to a comet somewhere in deep space is going the be nearly impossible to detect from Earth. We're looking for more complex organisms. That's what most people think of when they talk about &quot;life&quot; which, you know, is sort of ironic as bacterial cells outnumber your own cells in your own body. </p>
<p>Before I go on, I need to first introduce this acronym to you. N-CHOPS. That is short for Nitrogen, Carbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, Phosphorus, and Sulfur. Those are the six elements that form the basic building blocks of all life we know of no matter where we find it. (Before anyone points it out, yes, there were some extremeophile simple organisms that were coaxed to swap out a few of those for something else. Cyanide for Phosphorus, if I remember correctly. But that's not how we typically find it and it normally follows the N-CHOPS recipe just like everything else).</p>
<p>There is a reason all life we know of is organic. By that I mean it is built off carbon chains. Carbon atoms (and those that are organized in the periodic table in that same column) can form the most bonds to other atoms. Hydrogen? That can really only bond to one other atom. It has a single electron to share. That's it. Most of the others can bond to two or three. Carbon can bond to four other atoms. It can also form two bonds with one atom, making a really strong bond, and still have two slots open. </p>
<p>Carbon gives us the possibility of ridiculously complex chains of atoms. These are where your basic proteins come along. Those other elements in the N-CHOPS recipe fill out those slots as carbon atoms bond to other carbon atoms and form chains, branching chains, and other complex shapes.</p>
<p>Complex life forms need complex structures. For that organic molecules offer your best bets.</p>
<p>Is it possible to do it without carbon? Oh sure! Silicon and the others in the column should react similarly. However those chains are going to be weaker. Why?  Um.</p>
<p>Okay, this is an outdated model of how atoms work and it is more complex than this but - just for the moment - let's pretend the satellite model of atomic structure is how it works.</p>
<p>You have a nucleus of an atom and you have electrons orbiting around it. The rows on the periodic table line up with the orbits of these electrons. Carbon has four free slots in a low orbit near the nucleus. Silicon, on the other hand, has all those slots filled and the four free slots are in a higher orbit. Since this orbit is further away from the nucleus the bonding is weaker. It takes less energy to break this bond than a carbon bond.</p>
<p>Ever head that diamonds are harder than quartz? There you go. Almost the exact same structure but one is made from carbon bonds and the other is made from silicon bonds.</p>
<p>So, while it is possible to have that same sort of complexity without carbon the chains will probably be a lot weaker. This is bad as the chains we already have are pretty weak.</p>
<p>Let's step back for a second and look around at all the mammals. Ah, mammals. Big, fast moving animals. They burn a lot of energy and, in return, they are less affected by ambient temperatures in regards to how energetic they are. Really, a mammal is an animal where the metabolic throttle is held firmly to the floorboards. We go full speed all the time. </p>
<p>To go full speed we need a lot of heat. Human body temperature is usually given as 98.7 F or 37 C, depending on which country you live in. That number is really, really interesting. The chemical reactions that drive life occur faster and more often as heat is added. This makes sense. The more heat, the more energy you have. The more these chemicals move around, bump into each other, and collide with force. That makes sense.</p>
<p>But it only works up to a certain point. After you go past human body temperature a weird thing starts happening. Those proteins start breaking apart. It's a process called denaturing.</p>
<p>Those complex shapes that I mentioned earlier? They normally don't happen by random chance alone. These chains have to be built a bit at a time. These amazingly fantastical shapes can continue to hold their shapes as long as the electostatic forces in play holding them together aren't broken. Once they are broken there really is no getting them back.</p>
<p>So if you heat up a protein too much that energy and vibration causes some of those fragile bonds to break. Even if you allow it to cool they don't go back to the way they were. Instead they form more stable &quot;normal&quot; bonds.</p>
<p>They congeal.</p>
<p>Why do I bring this up?  Well, this goes right back to your habitable zone question. </p>
<p>Earth is in a good spot relative to the sun. If we go much closer the planet would be boiling hot. Too much energy would be present to keep those carbon chains we expect. They would break apart and denature too quickly for life to stick around.  If Earth was a bit further out it'd be too cold. Too cold means there isn't enough energy to get these carbon chains to start building in the first place.</p>
<p>It takes energy for life. A lot of it.</p>
<p>Ever notice that all complex animals breathe oxygen? There's a reason. Oxygen packs a lot of energy in it. It tends to react a very volatile manner. It's why fire is even a thing. </p>
<p>All animals need this constant source of energy just to keep moving. </p>
<p>So, as far as we know, a world probably needs oxygen to support animal life because they need that energy to come from some where.</p>
<p>Water is probably also necessary. Why?  Well, for life to form you need these single cells to start coming together and working as a unit. I just mentioned how much energy it takes to move around and how all known animals need to constantly take in a highly combustible element to keep moving. It takes a lot less energy to drift in the sea.</p>
<p>So, without a motivation to move (how do you know there are other cells out there anyway) there is no pressure to &quot;evolve&quot; such a high energy system. However, if things are in water they can be brought together by random chance. Plus water has some interesting properties that help out in other ways. It permits some degree of ionization which allow electrical currents to form. That in of itself can help pull simple cells together and allow them to align. It also grows less dense as it freezes. This is important because in cool periods the ice goes to the top and traps water below. This protects simple life from the damages of freezing and gives it a (relatively speaking) warmer place to keep growing and developing.</p>
<p>Also, in the early formation of a solar system there is a period of a few million years where rocky debris is raining down on the newly formed planets pretty often. Water, particularly large bodies of water like oceans, would give primitive life a place where it is reasonably protected from impacts.</p>
<p>There are a lot of interesting properties of water that are useful for building the structures we associate with life. So, looking for water is a good thing.</p>
<p>But let's ignore all this!  Is it possible that, hypothetically speaking, there is life out there that follows none of these rules? That is so alien to our expectations that we may not even recognize it as life?</p>
<p>Sure! It's a big universe!</p>
<p>So why don't we look for them?</p>
<p>Okay. Where? What do you want us to look for? What are some definite signs we can look for that indicates this is &quot;life&quot;?</p>
<p>Big questions. Big questions that are hard to answer. On the other hand, looking for the telltale signs of life we are more familiar with that follows the rules we understand? It's not easy but it is much, much easier in that we can at least define some parameters.</p>
<p>So that's what we look for. Looking for a needle in a haystack is hard. Looking for a particular piece of straw in a haystack is almost impossible. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question, and one that has been nicely addressed by many top comments. I agree with all the ideas presented there. I also want to discuss a valuable idea I don't see discussed often... or ever. I like to call it the <em>kissing cousins hypothesis</em>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drake_equation" target="_blank">Drake Equation</a> (which underlies the <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html" target="_blank">Fermi Paradox</a>) is typically applied with the approximation that 1% of planets capable of sustaining life <strong>will</strong> have given rise to life (via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abiogenesis" target="_blank">abiogenesis</a>) by now. It then applies much more reliable estimates to that number (things like how many galaxies, stars, and planets in the observable universe) to tell us that our galaxy must be teeming with life. <strong>But the likelihood of abiogenesis is probably much, much rarer than typically estimated.</strong>  </p>
<p>I'm an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_world" target="_blank">RNA</a> biochemist, and I have a good sense of what Earth's first replicators probably looked like. The first replicating molecules on Earth were likely incredibly fragile, so it feels miraculous to me that they managed to pull their power of regenerating information together into the first living cells at all. I'm also familiar with modern attempts to recreate the conditions that initially gave rise to Earth life. It's telling that none of these attempts have come close to generating the full complement of biomolecules necessary to constitute a primordial cell. Finally, even with our ability to guide a deliberate effort to effect  abiogenesis on Earth, no progress has been made. Life is incredibly fragile and necessarily quite complex. The &quot;1%&quot; estimate for biogenesis on a suitable planet is likely a massive overestimate; I'd put it at something like 0.00001% or lower. I know the universe has been around a really long time, but if you toss all the right ingredients for a cake into an abandoned kitchen and simply wait, would you really expect to end up with any sort of cake? Ever? (I'm not suggesting a <em>creator</em> is needed; I believe we are the cake. A very rare cake.)</p>
<p>Even though a much lower likelihood of biogenesis feels bleak, it still leaves us with an estimate of <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/fermi-paradox.html" target="_blank">10,000 life-bearing planets and 1 intelligent civilization in our galaxy.</a> (and that 1 intelligent civilization might be us!). <strong>But</strong> if abiogenesis occurs on a planet and that seed is able to travel to another planet, the odds can be tipped back towards a more populated galaxy via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia" target="_blank">Panspermia</a>. And if this is the case, we are <strong>much</strong> more likely to be close neighbors (in the cosmic sense) with a distant relative (in the biological sense), one that is water-dependent and based on cells and DNA/RNA. Hence the <em>kissing cousins hypothesis</em>: if one instance of abiogenesis is likely to have given rise to all life in a given corner of the universe, then it's reasonable that one planet would search on physically similar planets for its relatives. </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Since life arising from nothing is an extremely rare event, it makes sense to look for extraterrestrial life on Earth-like planets since any other life near us probably shares a common, distant ancestor and accordingly would be likely to thrive in a similar environment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not that life different from the life that we see around us on Earth couldn't exist, it's that the only examples of life that we have to go on require certain conditions like liquid water. So, we're focusing our efforts on finding the conditions that we already know support life instead of just blindly searching everywhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I get that part of our search is for finding an inhabitable planet for our own survivals sake</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also, this part isn't necessarily true. The search isn't primarily focused on finding another planet for humanity to move to. Simply finding another planet that supports life, even if we could never get there, would be one of the biggest scientific discoveries ever made.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aliens may exist outside our understanding of life, but since we have no idea what that could be, our best guess is to look for life similar to what we observe on Earth. That way, we know what signs to look for in other planets and our search can have a 'checklist' of sorts to guessing where life can develop.</p>
<p>We would probably consider an autonomous form 'living' if it possessed the characteristics of life. These include, movement, energy production, growth and reproduction, ability to react to the outside world, etc. In the far future advanced self-replicating robots may be able to do all of these things independent of human input, and would probably be considered alive.</p>
<p>From wondering whether we are alone, again we cannot know if Earth life is like all or most life in the universe, if it exists at all. But what we do know is that life exists or can exist in the environment of Earth, so it is a good starting point to search for Earth-like planets. We do not yet know of any life that exists outside of Earth, so it would be searching blind. Given the variety of extremities that different bacteria can survive in, it wouldn't be that surprising if we found even stranger forms of life in the universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know that cows eat grass. Why are we looking at grass when trying to find cows? Why not look at cupcakes?</p>
<p>Well, I've never seen a cow eat a cupcake. That doesn't necessarily mean cows don't eat cupcakes. But from what I've seen, I'd be better off looking for cows in a pasture than a bakery. </p>
<p>So we look in the pasture. Sure there may be cows in bakeries, but we don't have enough people to check all the pastures AND all the bakeries, and no one has ever seen a cow in a bakery, so we will look in places we KNOW cows can live.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
