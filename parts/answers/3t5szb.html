		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Considering that the hum goes away when you touch the computer, this suggests that its origin is improper grounding. All the appliances in your home, including your computer when it is charging, are hooked up to the grid, which feeds in an alternating current at a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_frequency" target="_blank">specific frequency</a> (most commonly 50Hz or 60Hz depending on your location). For many types of electrical equipment to work properly, their components need to be maintained at the same electrical potential, which is obtained by connecting them to a common electrical reservoir, called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_%28electricity%29" target="_blank">electrical ground</a> (e.g. the Earth). When this grounding is done improperly, you can get a potential difference between the different parts of the system, which allows a current to flow in what is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_loop_%28electricity%29" target="_blank">ground loop</a>. </p>
<p>This ground loop in turn allows the oscillations of the external current to couple to certain parts of your equipment. In your case, this low frequency signal is picked up by your head phones and become amplified, which produces the hum that you hear. However, when you touch the computer your body is acting as a big reservoir and effectively becomes the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground_%28electricity%29" target="_blank">electrical ground</a>. By now properly grounding the system, you are no longer allowing the grid oscillation to feed into your headphones and the humming stops.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I bet the laptop is plugged into a charger?</p>
<p>If so it is the 50Hz hum being generated by your house wiring through the charger. Try it when it is on batteries. </p>
<p>It might mean your house wiring earth is not bonded correctly, or you might just have a poor quality charger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP stroke the exterior of your plugged in device lightly with a finger. You should be able to actually feel the hum. (If the surface is conductive)</p>
<p>If your charger has a two point plug, the hum comes from not being grounded, if it has 3 points either your cable or your ac/dc converter is faulty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
