		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you seen the Jersey Devil yet, and is there evidence that he likes cranberries? And also, have you seen any detrimental effects to the pinelands ecosystem from cranberry agriculture? Traditional forms of agriculture cause issues with habitat fragmentation and pesticides entering the environment, so I'm curious if cranberry bogs had similar problems or did their own forms of damage. Thanks for taking the time to do this! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
