Even if they are created somewhere outside of the earth, there is no way that they make it to earth and then stay intact long enough for us to identify them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's fairly likely. There are certain astronomical events which involve intense neutron flux that result in production of super heavy elements. These include things Plutonium, Nobelium, even up to the 110s and beyond most likely. Those elements decay rapidly however so they don't stick around long enough to be studied.</p>
<p>There are a couple core problems in studying such things, however. One is that those elements would make up only a tiny, tiny minority of the mass of the debris from such events, so the signal in the spectral data would be almost impossible to detect. The other is that the elements would decay so rapidly (in the case of 119 and 120 likely in a matter of milliseconds or less) that there's almost no way to be lucky enough to study them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Having searched for super heavy's I would bet my life they are made plentifully after super nova events especially. Like you said, they'll decay immediately. I'm confident we'll see evidence of plenty of new elements made in particle accelerators here within the next decade, I've heard of work that could be much much sooner. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really simplified: There is a theoretical island of stability for heavy elements on the periodic table. Some believe element 120 exists here. If it does, the orbit may be geometrically stable. There is a slight possibility if a few theories are correct.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow-up question: what might the periodic table look like if 119 and 120 (and subsequent elements) are discovered? Would we need a new block for the g-electron-orbital elements like we do the f-orbital elements? I suppose that 119 and 120 would fall under the s-block, but after that is what my question mainly pertains to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
