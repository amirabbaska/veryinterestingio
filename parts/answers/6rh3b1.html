		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to live next door to an Oscar winning make-up artist.  She had character books (polaroids when I first met her, but she switched to digital).  The books cataloged everything in close-up, hair, brusies, tattoos, scars...whatever she had to reporduce over several days of shooting.  You didn't need to have any extensive tattoos or marks to get a book, even basic make-up needs to be photographed so it can be reliably reproduced.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to /u/aroundlsu's definitive answer, sometimes people do goof, leading to continuity errors. It's not just tattoos, but cuts, bruises, clothing, hairstyle and pretty much everything. You may have seen those videos where people delightedly point out these continuity errors -- &quot;In this shot, the cut is above his right eye, but in the next shot it's moved to his left eye... and in the next scene it's disappeared completely, only to reappear two minutes later!&quot;</p>
<p>Most of these errors actually go unnoticed by audiences, so they're rarely a big deal. But some people will watch the movie or show several times, begin to notice these little details, then talk about them on YouTube so we all get to know about them.</p>
<p>To try to keep this down to a minimum, there may be people on set whose job it is to take photos of the actors to help with the continuity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many methods to get it right depending on how much money is being thrown around.</p>
<p>If it's a single color, you can just stencil it on.</p>
<p>If it's a colorful design you have a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Do it once, film all of the scenes that contain shots of it, and then stop worrying about it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Print multiple temporary tattoo versions of it and just make sure they're close enough to the proper position. Apply, film, remove, repeat.</p>
</li>
<li>&quot;Paint&quot; the areas where they're supposed to have tattoos green and add them in digitally... or just add them in digitally if they're full-body.</li>
</ol>
<p>OH. There is one last option. If the actor really loves the character (as Johnny Depp loves Jack Sparrow) they'll just get the tattoo anyway.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I make movies in the $1m-$50m range. I've made lots of movies involving tattoos. I made one where the star had a huge full body tattoo that took several hours to apply by a specialized make up artist. </p>
<p>The short answer is if it's not planned to be seen in any shots today then we don't apply the tattoo. For example, if we aren't planning to have the actor remove his shirt for any scenes today then we aren't going to bother applying any tattoos. If you pay attention, you'll notice the shots where you see complete tattoos are carefully placed in movies to &quot;sell&quot; the idea that the character has tattoos. It only takes one of two of these shots in an entire movie to make you believe his entire body is covered in ink. </p>
<p>I call these kinds of things movie magic as making a movie is just a bunch of magic tricks and illusions. Sure you might believe you saw Keanu with a cool back tattoo but did you really? Or did you see a doubles back? Or did you see some clever computer effects? Hard to say unless you are the magician.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
