		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If most body parts are disproportionate, they fuck up your ability to do stuff like throw a spear or run from a predator. Stuff that would be important for early humans trying to stay alive and prove their worth as mates. If your dick is disproportionate, it doesn't impact those functions (unless it's just absurdly long, which is why there is an upper limit to what's possible), and for over 90% of human existence it didn't make a difference in your ability to have kids because it was the dudes who were the best at surviving who passed on their genes. Not the dudes who were the best at sex. Thus, we got a lot more variety in dicks than we got with most other body parts, because they didn't affect a dude's ability to not die or his ability to get laid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The variation is probably not as great as you may think, at least if you compare penis size to body mass, volume, or height. But aside from that, one of the biggest reasons for the variation of some traits - perhaps penis size, for instance - is a lack of, or very weak selection pressures. Although you may find some people to whom it matters, penis size really doesn't play a significant role at all when it comes to fitness. Evolutionarily speaking, fitness is defined as the ability of an organism to grow to maturity, reproduce, and have viable offspring. Penis size variation simply doesn't lead to that much variation in fitness. Even if there is a small number of annual births that occurred <em>only</em> because of penis size, the other factors affecting any one individual's reproductive fitness are likely making any selection for penis size rather insignificant.</p>
<p>This is why there seems to be such variation in height for modern males, particularly when compared globally. Male-female dichotomy for body size and canine size used to be significant, i.e. men used to be consistently significantly bigger than females, and had larger canines. This was when there was more male-male competition for mates, and more polygynous mating. You can still see this dichotomy in Gorillas and other of our ape relatives. After the move into modern times, selection pressures for large male body size and canine size were relaxed as things like weapons were invented and brain power became more important. As a result, the variation in male body size is quite large now, since the selection pressure has been relaxed, yet the genes for large bodies still exist in the population. Different ancestral human populations relaxed this selection pressure at different times, and so you can see more male-female dichotomy in certain groups of people than in others. Like how you see more variation in male body size in Northern Europeans than you do in East Asians. The Northern Europeans likely had to rely on larger bodies up until a more recent point in history.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't that much variation. Or not as much as you'd think. From top Google result (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bju.13010/full" target="_blank">from a study of 15,000 men</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Average erect penis length was 5.17 inches, or 13.12 centimeters. SD was 0.65 inches or 1.66 centimeters</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This translates to ~68% of men have length in the area of 4.52 to 5.82 inches.  ~16% are bigger than that, and ~16% are smaller than that. They created an <a href="http://i.imgur.com/PHDnkcN.png" target="_blank">Nomogram </a> with their data. Other interesting findings were weak to inconsistent correlation with height, weight/BMI, finger length, foot size, age or testicular volume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Penises are a battleground. Just not for humans.</strong> tl;dr</p>
<p>Today I saw a math question tagged NSFW and a penis size question that is apparently family-friendly.</p>
<p>Kidding aside, I'd like to add a few notes to the excellent points raised by other posters. It's true that penis size in <em>humans</em> has not been selected for strongly, both because the size does not confer advantage, and because across its normal size range it does not confer a disadvantage.</p>
<p><em>But sex is what organisms live for</em>. Seriously. A living organism &quot;wants&quot; to spend the least amount of energy while passing along its genes most successfully.</p>
<p>So a lot of species out there <em>do</em> select for penises. Not just size but also function.</p>
<p>You hypothetical five-year-olds are in for a treat.</p>
<p><strong>Ducks</strong> [Slow-motion of duck penis](<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch</a>? v=qwjEeI2SmiU) It's fast, it's corkscrewed, and it presented a <a href="http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2009/12/22/ballistic-penises-and-corkscrew-vaginas-the-sexual-battles-of-ducks/#.WGaD5RsrJEY" target="_blank">problem to researchers</a>. IIRC Dr. Brennan said that they switched to silicone fake vaginas because the glass vaginas would sometimes shatter.</p>
<p>And because ducks also need to fly, a lot of ducks lose weight after mating season by losing their penises. I lost my car keys this morning but it's hard to misplace a penis.</p>
<p><strong>Marine flatworms</strong> <em>Pseudobiceros bedfordi</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wn3xluIRh1Y" target="_blank">Penis fencing. En garde!</a> I love these guys. Hermaphrodites, chemosensing, lots of ovaries and a pair of penis-structures (stylets.) Making babies carries a necessary energy cost. Being a dad generally costs less, because dad can leave. Even in species that don't have parental care, laying eggs can be expensive. (Yes, this is a generalization, kids. You're five, I'm going to wave my hands a bit.)</p>
<p>When P. bedfordi meet, they rear up and each attempts to poke the other with a penis in a behavior termed &quot;fencing.&quot; If they make contact they will ejaculate onto the other's skin (syncytium, integument.) The ejaculator is male for today, the ejaculee is female. Sometimes they both hit home and play both roles.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter where the semen hits, because it will eat its way through the skin and the sperm will move toward one of the ovaries scattered throughout the body. These flatworms regenerate so the holes will be closed, but you can spot a newly expectant mom by her tattered appearance. Mom will soon lay fertile eggs.</p>
<p>But she has one more trick up her very strange sleeve. The ovaries are placed along her digestive canal. She recoups some of the energy cost by eating most of the semen.</p>
<p><strong>Cephalophods</strong> deserve special mention. These are squid, octopus, cuttlefish, argonaut, chambered nautilus. Their sperm are packaged into motile and mobile packets called &quot;spermatophores&quot; which burrow and move about like worms. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21834723" target="_blank">It can be a sushi hazard.</a> IIRC they're still not well understood. And anyhow they're delivered by a modified tentacle (hectocotylus) which, depending on the species, can be anything from an arm with a scoop shape and fewer suckers, all the way through a highly specialized bit that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argonaut_\(animal\)?oldformat=true#Sexual_dimorphism_and_reproduction" target="_blank">detached and plugs the female's cavity.</a></p>
<p><strong>Speaking of plugs,</strong> there's a huge lot of adaptations designed to prevent sperm from leaking out of a female, or to prevent competitors from fertilizing a female, or to scrape out sperm deposited by a competitor who got there first.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of sneaky sex out there like the Midshipman fish type II male, and other kinds of reproductive strategies to make someone else bear the cost, like the varied shells of cuckoo eggs. There are also lots of other factors, such as how often do members of the species meet, like the angler fish, or whether their food supply has a boom and bust cycle.</p>
<p>I have to get some work done, but after a few beers I can go on for hours. It's even better with dry erase markers and a whiteboard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd bet most are within that same type of normal range, comparable to the distribution of height (not saying they're related, just similarly distributed). Majority of guys are 5'7&quot;-5'11&quot;, majority of penises probably within 5&quot;-6&quot; range, with both having some one side or the other. Remember some dudes are like 7'6&quot;, outliers the same as your big hogs. </p>
