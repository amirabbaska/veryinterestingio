<p>Personally, I never click popups.  You can easily get rid of them by:</p>
<ul>
<li>F12 (open devtools)</li>
<li>click the &quot;Select Element&quot; button (top left of devtools, looks like a mouse cursor)</li>
<li>mouse over the popup so it is highlighted and click (won't trigger a normal click)</li>
<li>adjust if the popup is inside an iFrame or similar</li>
<li>right click the element and &quot;delete&quot;</li>
<li>profit.</li>
</ul>
<p>(With practice, this takes me ~1-2 seconds)</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>Apparently this can be brought down to about 15ns using /u/ajgz 's shortcuts below :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Below is one reason why they can't do this. There may be workarounds or other methods I'm not aware of. </p>
<p>To hijack your browser and prevent you from closing the tab most of these companies use an alert window which is different from a regular popup. This window is a terminal event you must interact with it before you can do anything else. </p>
<p>This window is actually generated by the browser not the website you're visiting. So the website can launch the window but can't really control what happenes if you press cancel (the browser handles that)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
