		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interestingly, yes - and some of them are the same diseases, too! Malaria-infected mosquitoes actually suffer fitness costs from carrying the malaria parasite, which would mean that we could consider malaria to be a disease of mosquitoes as well as a disease of humans (or rather, that <em>Plasmodium</em> is a disease-causing pathogen in both animals). <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07924259.1999.9652703" target="_blank">This study</a> showed that infected mosquitoes had about half as many offspring as noninfected mosquitoes, and <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/13/5580.short" target="_blank">this study</a> showed that mosquitoes genetically manipulated to be resistant to the parasite performed <em>better than normal mosquitoes</em> when feeding on infected prey. (Which, by the way, is potentially good news if we want to control malaria through this increasingly talked-about method.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parasites probably exert the most harm on mosquitoes, malaria (already posted) and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep36319" target="_blank">filarial worms</a> are probably the best examples. </p>
<p>But the path to understand why mosquitoes <em>don't</em> get sick has been very fascinating and though not mosquitoes per se the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded for figuring out a main mechanism.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA_interference" target="_blank">RNA interference</a> is very basically an innate way cells can silence genes they don't like. In the case of <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1000299" target="_blank">dengue</a> <em>Aedes</em> mosquitoes do just that and can transmit dengue without suffering any costs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What a coincidence! I just read a story this very day about a wild hedgehog with a streptococcus group A infection. This was most likely a reverse zoonosis, human to animal transmission.</p>
<p>Oh... just re-read the title and this thread is only about mosquitoes getting diseases. Still, I like the hedgehog story so I am leaving it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's important to note that humans don't get diseases from mosquitos directly, those would be classified as zoonotic diseases that affect both humans and non-humans. Mosquitos are a transmission vector between humans. We don't get infected by diseases that started from mosquitos, so it's not really a proper basis for the original question. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
