		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fruit does &quot;want&quot; to be eaten as you say, but sometimes not by just anything. Not all animals are equally good at spreading seeds, so some plants have defenses that are only effective against certain animals as a way of reserving their fruit. For example, capsaicin, which is what makes spicy food spicy, doesn't affect birds. Land based animals are thus discouraged from eating peppers, leaving them all for birds, who spread them over a much wider range. Pineapples may be the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The pineapples we get from the store don't have many seeds, but you will sometimes find small brown seeds in the flesh of the fruit. Unfortunately, these seeds rarely germinate.</p>
<p>Wild pineapples, which are much smaller than the ones we eat,  contain many more seeds. When they ripen, they are soft and sweet and would encourage animals to come along and eat them, their seeds would be eaten with the fruit and spread by animal droppings.</p>
<p>However, commercial pineapples are cultivated either from suckers sent out from the parent plant, or by cutting the top of a pineapple with the spiky crown and getting that to root. </p>
<p>By breeding generation after generation of bigger fruit, we've selected pineapple plants that put most of their energy into creating big, juicy, sweet pineapples rather than viable seeds. If we were to stop growing pineapples tomorrow, these plants would struggle to survive without us. So think of them as delicious, juicy pets.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have already mentioned that fruits evolve a symbiotic relationship with specific animals, rather than all of them generally.</p>
<p>In general, plants that get eaten by microbes and insects don't do so hot; they mostly don't spread their seeds well and so are outcompeted. And that's exactly why so many plants are pharmacologically active: caffeine, nicotine, cocaine, opium, even cannabinoids, these all kill microbes and insects that eat parts of the plant. It's pretty adaptive, since a little more juice will also stop smaller rodents and such, meaning it's the larger animals with larger ranges that will eat more, eg, coffee berries.</p>
<p>Pineapples go with bromelain and raphides to stop insects and microbes, but they use physical deterrents—a cluster of sharp and spikey leaves around the base, akin to thorns—to stop your ground animals from getting at them easily.</p>
<p>They also grow a nice tuft when they're ready and ripe to make a perfect foothold for fruit bats to hang from while eating (at least, I assume they eat in situ, maybe they carry them off). Guano is such a rich fertilizer people used to collect it from caves, so the pineapple-bat symbiosis was a pretty good deal for both of them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being eaten isn't the only way to have seed spread. Some fruit rots/ferments to activate the seed. Some require fire; some (like tumbleweeds) have structures that propel them in some way. Sycamore seeds spin and ride the air for example. Pineapples tend to clump; producing pups which are identical to the mother plant. Another version of this is suckering plants like raspberries or willows. All of these methods are different ways to propagate and continue. </p>
<p>Since being eaten helps some seeds propagate by virtue of the acid in the stomach it would seem unlikely that being eaten would help a pineapples seeds sprout given the flesh already contains enzymes that break down proteins as well as being acidic. Perhaps the plants that produced heavy fruit on a stalk were more likely to spread if they lived on a hill and the fruit could fall and roll downwards. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
