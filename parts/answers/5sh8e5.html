		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of good responses here, but there is one important factor I haven't seen addressed.</p>
<p>Input lag is greater at lower framerates. When you press a button on your input method of choice, the time it takes for the display to reflect that input is determined almost entirely by how long the interval between frames it, because it's usually the slowest thing going on in the computer. At 60FPS, input lag is around 16ms, at 24FPS, input lag jumps to about 42ms, which is definitely noticeable. Your eyes can't detect things changing that fast, but your brain can easily measure the time between your finger moving and the screen updating down to the low tens of milliseconds. It makes you feel like you're moving through water, the lag feels like resistance, and that's annoying as fuck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>About half due to motion blur, the other half because we've been conditioned since birth to regard 24fps as the natural look for media.  Higher framerates <em>are</em> superior for media - Peter Jackson and James Cameron know this - but it's going to be a long time before general audiences embrace them.</p>
<p>Two experiments to try:</p>
<p>1: Next time you're watching a movie at a genuine 24fps (in a theater or on a TV that is displaying a multiple of said), watch for scenes where the motion is faster than normal, such as fast pans or action.  The limitations of such a low framerate start to stand out as the judder becomes hard to ignore.</p>
<p>2: Play Doom while artificially limiting the framerate to 24.  Doom has the best motion blur ever achieved in a video game, so that is a non-issue.  It should look decidedly cinematic.  (Actually just check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5rOnVCtwouc" target="_blank">this video</a>.)  Just more evidence that 24fps sucks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Film frames can capture motion blur of fast moving objects, essentially the object is appearing in several places at once.</p>
<p>Video games render a series of still images of objects in a single location at any point in time (for the most part).</p>
<p>When viewed at full speed, the motion blur captured on film is much more pleasing to the eye than a bunch of sharply rendered video game frames.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A whole slew of reasons. </p>
<p>1) Movies rarely move the camera. The camera is a fixed point and the actors move. Computer games you are moving the camera. People go to great lengths to plan out how this is going to work. The bullet time for the matrix was conceptualised as a camera on a rocket sled, but in reality was a few hundred still cameras on precise timers. </p>
<p>2) Fixed frame rate. The frame rate on movies is low, but rock steady. Calculations in games are run based on how long the last frame took to render. When frame rate varies those calculations go astray very quickly, especially when physics is involved. </p>
<p>3) Perfect motion blur. Thanks to the fixed frame rate every frame of film is perfectly motion blurred and naturally. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
