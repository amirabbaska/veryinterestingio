		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asparagus contains a chemical called asparagusic acid (to my knowledge it's only found in asparagus). When we digest asparagusic acid, it's broken up into several sulfur containing compounds. These compounds are volatile and have low boiling points, so they can enter the gas phase at room temp and make their way to your nose.</p>
<p>It doesn't happen to everyone though, and there's debate as to whether those people don't produce these compounds in their urine, or if they are just unable to smell them (although I think most recent research points to the latter).</p>
<p>Other vegetables like brussel sprouts, cabbage, turnips, and cauliflower contain methyl-mercaptan, which is another sulfur containing compound with similar effects.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
