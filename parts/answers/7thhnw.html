		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, the text lines are blue so that they aren't as obvious but still provide guidance, and if you write over them your text will still be legible.
From my understanding, the margin line is red because you're supposed to notice it and not go beyond it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue lines are not reproducible. You can not copy them on a xerox machine.</p>
<p>Two reasons for this.</p>
<p>The first reason is that the sellers do not want you to make lots of copies of lined paper, they want to sell you more paper, but consider the other thing of having your well done handwriting reproduced without the lines showing how much you relied on them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When printing machines make copies, they use filters of different colors to reproduce different colors. In a black and white photocopy, you can tweak the settings to filter out specific colors. </p>
<p>The blue is called &quot;non-photo blue&quot;. It is removed by copiers to allow you to appear as though you have great straight line handwriting. The red line is a separate &quot;channel&quot; that can be removed as well independent of the blue lines. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
