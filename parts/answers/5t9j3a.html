		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many people have made the point that stimulant medications can be abused, so I'm not going to labor over it. I just wanted to point out that a lot of people are heading towards non-stimulant ADHD medications like atomoxetine to get around some of the issues of giving kids stimulants.</p>
<p>There have been many cases of people abusing stimulants like coke as a sort of self-treatment for ADHD. Giving someone access to regulated medications is always the healthier and less risky option. (Not that cocaine and Adderall are exactly the same, to be clear.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of information on this topic. Adderall, Vyvanse, etc. are amphetamine derivatives. They are not pure Meth (N-methylamphetamine), although there is still a possibility for abuse.</p>
<p>Vyvanse is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisdexamfetamine" target="_blank">Lisdexamfetamine</a> which is a class of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substituted_amphetamine" target="_blank">amphetamines</a>.
