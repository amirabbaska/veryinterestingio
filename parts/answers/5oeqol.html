		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Solar System will die when the Sun becomes a red giant star whose outer envelope reaches as far out as Venus, or perhaps even the Earth. Even if the envelope doesn't reach the Earth, the immense radiation given off by the Sun in this phase will eliminate all life on the planet. The Sun will then transition to a white dwarf star and slowly cool for the rest of time. Interactions with the material given off by the Sun during the red giant to white dwarf transformation may disrupt the outer planets as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a very tiny (extremely tiny) chance that the planets in our solar system will be flung out of orbit due to the gravity of stars passing by us when the Milky Way collides with Andromeda in a few billion years. </p>
<p>Others have already brought up the sun turning into a red giant but I dont consider that the death of the solar system. That's just a problem for the inner planets. In fact, places like Europa will start to thaw out and conditions might be even more suitable for life.  The orbits might still be screwed up though and a star passing nearby might be enough to fling the planet out of the solar system but as long as there are some planets, moons, dwarf planets, and other bodies remaining. I still consider it a solar system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the sun goes through the main sequence part of its lifecycle, it's slowly getting hotter. We have about a billion years before it gets too hot for life as we know it to persist on Earth, about 10% more luminous than it is now. The sun will turn into a red giant in about 5 billion years, but even though it will expand out to past Earth's current orbit, it will also lose a lot of its mass by then - right now, about 600 million tons of matter in the sun's core is converted to energy every second. On top of that, lots more of the sun's mass will be thrown off in solar wind when it becomes a red giant, so it will only have about 2/3 its current mass when it expands to the Earth's current orbit, which means the earth will spiral outward and orbit farther away, so it will be spared being swallowed by the sun, at least at first, though it will long since have become a charred dry rock, with all of the water in the atmosphere boiled away. Eventually, even though the Earth's orbit will be about 1.5 times as big as it is now, the sun will overtake it and the drag of the sun's atmosphere will slow the Earth down, causing it to spiral inward as the sun continues to grow until it is eaten by the sun. The sun will continue to grow until it's almost twice the size of the Earth's current orbit, then shrink and heat up, then expand again in pulses until it runs out of fuel, at which point it will be a white dwarf roughly the size of the Earth's current orbit. It will then slowly cool to black over trillions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
