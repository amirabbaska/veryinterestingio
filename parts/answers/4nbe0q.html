		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On Mythbusters the bullet resistant material we used was called Lexguard. Lexguard is an inch-and-a-quarter thick and is comprised of two layers of 1/2&quot; thick acrylic, laminated together and laminated between two 1/8&quot; thick layers of polycarbonate, or Lexan. </p>
<p>I have a beautiful 6&quot; square of the stuff on my desk, with a .45 caliber slug in it. From what I see the properties of both plastics are used in concert to stop the bullet by spreading it's energy as widely as possible. The acrylic layers shatter, they spread a lot of energy. I can see the widest shockwave from my slug is in the centermost layer. But the polycarb layers don't shatter, they streeetch, (and I think) harnessing the energy spreading outwards from the acrylic layers. The shockrings produced by the stretching laminate layers is super cool. I've got a photo somewhere...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Basically what is going on is the force of the bullet is distributed along the surface of the material. Usually there are several layers, compounding the affect. Really there are two ingredients in bulletproof glass, glass and plastic. I think I can explain the physics using an example. Imagine that the glass is a ceramic tile, and the plastic is a trampoline surface. Imagine you're standing above the trampoline with a brick in your hand.   </p>
<p>First throw the brick at the trampoline with no tile in the way, the trampoline will go down from the force. Let's say 10 units.<br />
Now put a tile on the surface of the trampoline. When the brick contacts the tile, the tile breaks along its surface. It takes a lot of energy to break the tiles surface, so the brick is slowed down and the trampoline moves less than before. Lets say 5 units.<br />
If you throw a brick at a tile on the ground, some energy is absorbed by the tile, but much of it goes into the ground beneath the tile.<br />
Now, stack layers of tile and trampoline and what you get is a strong, shock absorbing surface. The glass in bulletproof glass is what is breaking to absorb energy along its face, and the plastic is stretched to absorb the impact<br />
This shock absorbing can be seen in this video.<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work with ballistic-grade ceramics, so not all of this necessarily applies to glass, but mostly its the same.</p>
<p>Bulletproof glass is usually made with alternating layers of hard glass and tough plastic.</p>
<p>First the bullet hits the hard glass layer. It's hard, so the soft lead of the bullet is deformed by the impact. That's energy loss number 1. Then the glass starts to break; as the bullet is being slowed down by the glass, it transfers energy into the glass and the glass reacts by breaking up into pieces. Energy loss number 2. Now the bullet is passing through hot broken glass shards that chew it up along the way and now we're taking away energy a third time. Finally, the bullet impacts the plastic layer behind the glass, which stretches like rubber as it deforms, slowing down the bullet again.</p>
<p>Even if the glass is already broken (i.e. the bullet is no longer losing energy from having to break up the glass) you still have all those glass shards to chew it up along the way, and the springy plastic layers to absorb the impact.</p>
<p>Repeat for each layer of glass and plastic and you have a composite that is extremely resistant to gunfire.</p>
<p>EDIT: BTW, hardened armor-piercing bullets are usually not made of soft lead and copper, which is why they pass through &quot;bulletproof&quot; materials more easily. If the bullet is hardened carbide, it doesn't deform as much on impact and loses a little less energy there. It doesn't get torn up by the glass shards and loses a little less energy there too. And to top it all off, a hardened AP bullet is usually much heavier than lead, which means the bullet is already coming in with much more energy to begin with.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the posts below have good information in regards to spreading out the energy from the bullet along a wider area. </p>
<p>But one of the keys is that as a material, glass is rather strong in compression, meaning it can bear a lot of weight on top of it without collapsing. But it's rather weak in tension, which means if it a force causes it to stretch, it breaks pretty easily. </p>
<p>So when a bullet strikes a pane of glass, it causes the pane to flex a bit, and when you push on something like that and it bends, the side that you're pushing on goes into compression, and the other side goes into tension. Since glass is very weak in tension, the back side of the pane cracks almost immediately and cracks spread very quickly in glass and the whole pane fails. </p>
<p>So what they do with bulletproof glass is they add in layers of plastic, and some kinds of plastic are pretty darn strong against tension forces. The addition of the plastic helps the glass assembly resist the tension forces and not flex as much. It's also adhered to the glass surface in a way that helps prevent cracks in the glass from spreading as readily as it would otherwise. </p>
<p>The distinction between compression and tension forces is a huge part of designing objects that have to withstand significant forces. It's the reason why concrete structures need to have steel reinforcing in them. Concrete is great at resisting compression, but sucks at resisting tension. Without reinforcing, concrete beams would mostly be useless. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you think of as &quot;a piece of bulletproof glass&quot; is actually a sandwich made of many layers of glass and fancy plastics, with various characteristics. Standing alone, each piece of this sandwich would not stop the bullet. But together, they break in expected ways, while slowing the bullet for the next layer and distributing the force of the impact over a larger area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
