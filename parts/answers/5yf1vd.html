		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seems like most of these answers are just reiterating why oral or IV antibiotics alone don't solve abscesses, while you're asking why we can just put a needle into the cavity and push the drug in.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Abscesses are often acidic to a point where their pH would change the composition of the antibiotic to the point where it would not be effective in killing the bacteria. Medications are made so that they work in specific areas of the body under certain conditions, including at physiological pH ranges seen in a human. The pH of the inside of an abscess can vary from the normal range and thus, delivering the medication bolus directly into the center of the thing would be kinda like putting a plastic brush into a pot of molten lead and then trying to scrub the inside of the container with it; the brush isn't gonna get the job done anymore. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Draining the abscess is usually the most effective thing to do because, like everybody said, IV antibiotics don't really get in deep enough to do what you need on their own.</p>
</li>
<li>After the abscess has been drained, we often put in something called Iodoform gauze, which is like a long strand of cloth with &quot;medicine&quot; on it, so essentially kill whatever is left in there while the tissue heals. Why is this medicine effective? Because it's really just an iodine compound, it still works at whatever pH the abscess now is. </li>
</ol>
<p>Apparently there's some disagreement on whether or not the iodine gauze is good or bad or necessary, I've usually seen it and it's always worked from my short experience.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If an abscess has formed that's generally because the immune system is successfully trying to contain the infection to a closed area. Any injection runs the risk of breaking the barrier between circulation and the infection because injections generally break tissue. You do that, and then you can go from an abscess to a systemic infection where the disease is in your blood and therefore affects everything possible instead of that tiny region of the abscess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well normally you want to drain an abscess, so if you were to put anything into it it'll just come back out. IV antibiotics work fine to help prevent an infection as a result of an abscess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have many experiences as a suffer of staph abscesses. I've been hospitalized twice for severe abscesses and most of mine are MRSA. </p>
<p>For the most part my infections are in areas of high heat, sweat and friction. Waistband, groin, feet and armpits.
Usually I these are hard, hot masses under the skin sizes from a golf ball to a large cucumber size area. </p>
<p>Treatment is usually oral antibiotics first. There isn't usually a head or thin skin area on these and after a few days of antibiotics a head might form and rupture (the pressure release reduces the pain so much). </p>
<p>I have had a few lanced or sliced and packed. It is usually depends on the doctor, location on my body and other factors.
The packing is gauze usually with iodine or some other medication soaked into the gauze.  This causes a wicking action and I would pull out 3-6&quot; and cut off the crusty nasty end.
My last one was on my foot and extremely bad. It required 2 surgeries for cleaning and debridement. A wound vac was placed (a hard foam was cut to fit in the hole in my foot, a vacuum tube is placed over it and it's all sealed to my foot. This allows a constant negative pressure on the wound drawing puss and blood from the wound).</p>
<p>This stay had me on several IV antibiotics over a week as well as take home meds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
