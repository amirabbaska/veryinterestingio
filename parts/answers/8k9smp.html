		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is possible to demagnetize a ferromagnetic material with high pressure or force but for iron the stress needs to be similar to hearing to 1000 Kelvin. </p>
<p>A way easier way to do it is using electricity  specifically high frequency alternating current. The magnet will try to align with the direction of the field but if the frequency is high enough it will be switching faster than the material can align so when the current is turned off everything will end up aligned randomly, making it non magnetic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism#Magnetized_materials" target="_blank">subjecting it to vibration by hammering it, ... tends to release the domain walls from their pinned state, and the domain boundaries tend to move back to a lower energy configuration with less external magnetic field, thus demagnetizing the material.</a></p>

<p>However, <a href="https://van.physics.illinois.edu/qa/listing.php?id=436" target="_blank">some items <strong>become magnetized</strong></a> when repeatedly shocked. The Earth's magnetic field limits how demagnetized a magnet will become, but it can be made very weak. Cutting tools sometimes need to be demagnetized. My steel calipers developed magnetism when I used them to scribe lines. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
