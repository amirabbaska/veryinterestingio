		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UHD is a standard resolution of 3840x2160 pixels. This is the next step up from FHD (Full HD) which has a resolution of 1920x1080 pixels and HD which has a resolution of 1280x720 pixels.</p>
<p>UHD has exactly four times the pixels per field as FHD and maintains the same 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>UHD 4K is a marketing term used to distinguish the display from other &quot;4K&quot; display formats that use different field sizes and aspect ratios.</p>
<p>HDR is a term used in video processing that has different meanings based on context but all relate to contrast. <strong>High Dynamic Range Rendering</strong> has been used in video games for more than a decade to more accurately reproduce reflections of bright lights without artificially brightening the whole scene.</p>
<p><strong>High Dynamic Range Video</strong> is a two part display requirement. First, the display must exceed specific peak brightness, darkness, and peak contrast ratio values. Second, the display must be capable of processing 10 bit per sample colour values.</p>
<p>HDRR and HDRV are entirely distinct technologies. HDRR does not require an HDRV display and a standard display will look much better when HDRR is enabled. On the other hand, HDRV is useless if the source material is restricted to a standard dynamic range.</p>
<p>Plasma Display Panels long ago met the darkness and contrast requirements but fell behind in peak brightness. LCDs met the brightness requirement but had terrible darkness and contrast. Only in recent years have LCDs been able to match the colour reproduction of PDPs that are considered obsolete. Moreover, 10 bit sampling was foreign to consumer devices until very recently. Historically, it's use has been restricted to professional devices.</p>
<p>Dolby Vision is a mastering format designed to facilitate accurate encoding and reproduction of colour and brightness by the display. Dolby Vision compatible displays have greater knowledge of how the master was <em>intended</em> to look and can use that information to reproduce it as accurately as possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One distinction missing in this thread so far is that Dolby Vision uses dynamic metadata whereas HDR10 uses static metadata.  Metadata refers to information carried with the video stream to indicate (for example) the maximum light level of any single pixel and the maximum average light level of all 8 megapixels in a complete frame of UHD video.  These values are used by the display when decoding the video stream and rendering the frame images.  Dynamic metadata (Dolby Vision) means that you can have different light parameters for different scenes within the program, whereas static metadata (HDR10) means you need a single set of parameters that will be used for the entire program. You should get greater dynamic range in Dolby Vision if the program includes both dark scenes and bright scenes.  But it is more difficult to decode (requires Dolby proprietary chip set) so HDR10 is more commonly available.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UHD - means &quot;ultra HD&quot;  its a nonsense marketing term for 4K and pretty antiquated.</p>
<p>4K means 4K resolution</p>
<p>Super UHD - is a nonsense term, the &quot;super&quot; doesn't mean anything its just a tv line, like a Toyota &quot;Corolla&quot;. These aren't even the top end TVs they make. Complete non-meaning in any way.</p>
<p>HDR: this is an image format. Its somewhat complimentary to 4K. 4K is all about resolution, HDR is saying it has a better way to display colors.  HDR makes stuff really pop, and will kinda be a bigger deal than 4K, but adoption is even slower in content as you need an HDR tv to see HDR, and its really just starting to be put into mass market tv sets.</p>
<p>Dolby Vision: There are a few different ways to implement HDR, Dolby vision is the newest one being widely adopted and seems to be becoming an industry standard going forward.</p>
<p>Further, if you're buying a TV now, and can afford it, buying a 4K HDR TV capable of Dolby Vision is pretty much the baseline standard.</p>
<p>Edit: To the people complaining that UHD has technical meaning, thats not wrong, but you're getting sold on what it means for tv. Its specifically written into TV names as marketing jargon (not technical jargon) to confuse consumers. Again, its complete nonsense... the marketing departments at Samsung, etc. are clearing doing their job well to draw such a response.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dolby Vision content is mastered in up to 12-bit colour depth, compared to 10-bit of HDR10. 12-bit color depth allows for over 68 billion colors, compared to just 1 billion with 10-bit. Dolby vision reads metadata embedded in the frames to adjust other display options such as brightness on the fly the way the director intended. </p>
<p>Some additional somewhat unrelated info on resolutions:</p>
<ul>
<li>UHD 4k: 3840x2160 @30fps 4:2:2 or 4:2:0</li>
<li>
<p>True 4k: 4096x2160 @60fps 4:4:4</p>
</li>
<li>4:4:4 no color subsampling, full color</li>
<li>4:2:2 or 4:2:0 colors aren't as rich</li>
<li>30 frames per second will make movement more blurred, keep in mind most movies are shot at 24fps</li>
<li>60 frames per second is good for gaming or sports, and movement is smoother and crisp</li>
