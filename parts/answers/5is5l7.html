		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My daughter has a nature book we read to her that describes how one of the first thing a baby spider does is climb as high as they can go in order to release a little bit of webbing. The wind catches the web like a little parachute and blows them to kingdom come. This increases the chances of them surviving, spreads the species, keeps them from competing for the same resources or mates, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
