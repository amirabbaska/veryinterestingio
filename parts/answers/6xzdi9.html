<p>Think of it like a welding torch. The spot of the weld is hit enough to melt the metal, but the rest of the object being welded stays solid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hope is to create our own fusion reactor one day, and to do that we need to learn how to model plasma behavior better.</p>
<p>In terms of danger, such a hot plasma won't stay hot for very long, I suspect it only persists for microseconds in the Z machine. If those conditions were present indefinitely then it would represent a serious amount of heat to deal with, but in that machine it simply heats it up by a few degrees Celsius. Remember that they are only raising a tiny milligram of gas to billions K, so when that splashes against hundreds of kg of steel it only slightly warms it. The tough part is the plasma facing surface, which does tend to get a bit beat up and melty over time. It is often a refractory metal like Tungsten or Molybdenum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because what really matters is energy being radiated and if you create that type of temperature over small enough mass, it isn't enough energy flux radiating that it can't be controlled with shielding.</p>
<p>For example, the Sun radiates 3.86X10^26 watts continuously, while the Z Pulsed Power facility radiated 350X10^12 watts for 95 nanoseconds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Z Machine is in essence just a huge bank of high voltage capacitors, and special high speed electronic switches. This directs an extremely high current through a small target assembly, converting the target into a high temperature plasma that gives off powerful x-rays.</p>
<p>The high temperature only occurs in a fairly small volume inside a vacuum chamber. The test assembly is completely atomized and kind of sprays the inside of the test chamber with metal dust, <a href="http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2016/11/11/19/3A47620B00000578-0-image-a-36_1478890805020.jpg" target="_blank">as seen in this photo.</a> It's a bit of a dirty process.</p>
<p>This also causes substantial damage to the hardware supporting the test assembly, and that's usually replaced every shot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
