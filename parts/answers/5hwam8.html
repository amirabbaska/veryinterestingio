		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The factorial function only strictly works for natural numbers ({0, 1, 2, ... }). What you see plotted there is actually a way to extend the factorial function to real or even complex numbers (although it's singular at negative integers). It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_function" target="_blank">gamma function</a>.</p>
<p>You can take the derivative of the gamma function, and <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=derivative+of+gamma+function" target="_blank">here is is</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of functions aren't differentiable.  Absolute value functions, factorial, and anything with a jump are a few examples that you run into in basic calculus courses.  The derivative is just the slope at a certain point, so anything that has a point with undefined slope in not a differentiable function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>to answer the second part of your question, there are plenty of functions that are not differentiable.  a simple example is f(x)=|x| which is not differentiable at x=0.  </p>
<p>there are also functions that are not differentiable anywhere. for example, f(x)=1 if x is rational and 0 if x is irrational. use the limit definition of the derivative to see why this function cannot be differentiable anywhere. (fun fact, this function is also not Riemann integrable, but it is Lebesgue integrable)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To offer a different perspective, if we restrict the domain to integers we can consider this to be a discrete function of n:</p>
<p>f[n] = n!</p>
<p>In discrete math, the &quot;derivative&quot; is the first difference ie:</p>
<p>f'[n] = f[n+1] - f[n]</p>
<p>Or in our case:</p>
<p>f'[n] = (n+1)! - n!</p>
<p>While not exactly answering your question this does provide a way to suss out the behavior of the factorial function.  I think the above equation is actually called the first forward difference or something but I am an engineer not a mathematician. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
