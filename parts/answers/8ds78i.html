		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those are Yamahas. Almost all engines are water cooled, as in use water to absorb heat from the engine while running. Boats and personal water craft (jet ski is a brand name from Kawasaki) suck up the water from the lake/ocean to cool the engines so they don't need radiators. Yamaha brand just like to point the exit nozzle up and out the rear because it looks cool. Other brands just have it exit parallel to the water out the back.</p>
<p>Yamaha does this for brand recognition, serves no better purpose.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
