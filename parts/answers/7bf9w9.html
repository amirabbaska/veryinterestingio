		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Optometrist here. It should cause no permanent damage to vision in an adult. Many elderly people have dense cataracts (which, if left long enough, would act pretty much the same as covering the eye). When these cataracts are removed, vision goes back to normal, assuming that no other diseases are present. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m on mobile, not sure how to cite but Hubel and Wiesel actually won a Nobel Prize for answering that question in cats. No permanent effects would be apparent in adults, they would just have a hard time adjusting to light at first. However, if a newborn child (in this case kitten) were to have its eyes sewn shut for a year, the visual system would not develop correctly and they would basically be blind</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: No unless the brain is still developing.</p>
<p>I just got my degree in Psychology and can answer this in terms of brain development.
Permanent loss of vision has not been observed in adults, as u/Moorgan17 stated earlier. Permanent loss of vision has been seen however in young animals. A study was conducted years ago where one of a kitten's eyes was stitched up pretty much right from birth. I believe the eye was kept closed for about a year (at least a couple of months, but I'll double check that). When the eye was opened back up again, the kitten was permanently blind in that eye. I'll try find then start and link it. I'm on mobile right now.</p>
<p>This has to do with the Occam's razor effect that developing brains have. This behaviour transcends species and basically means &quot;If you're not using it, get rid of it&quot;. It's a way of the brain not putting effort into something that doesn't work anymore. It's even been shown that the part of the brain associated with the loss of sight ends up working on some other part of the body (kind of like how blind people have slightly heightened other senses). This is known as brain plasticity.</p>
<p>Side note: brain plasticity also works in the opposite way. A young girl had half of her brain removed in an attempt to relieve her of her constant seizures. This left the young girl paralyzed on one half of her body and with several cognitive difficulties too. Over time, however, the half of the brain that was left began to compensate for the lack of brain mass and she began to regain movement in the side of her body affected by the surgery, her language and other cognitive skills. </p>
<p>Basically brains are cool. </p>
<p>Edit: a video on Jody, the girl with half a brain <a href="https://youtu.be/VaDlLD97CLM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/VaDlLD97CLM</a></p>
<p>Edit 2: for those interested in the kitten study, see Hubel, D. H. &amp; Wiesel, T. N. (1964). Effects of Monocular Deprivation in Kittens</p>
<p>As it turns out, the kittens' eyes were sutured for only a few weeks, not even months.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though there would be no permanent visual damage, some studies suggest that this may promote the entanglement of other sensory nerves with the visual cortex. The blind have been proven to develop some form of echo location with practice, and further study has shown that the visual cortex is partially activated during such exercises. So in not seeing for a year, your vision won’t change when you go back to it, you may just build neural pathways to “see” sound in some capacity as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a book you might find interesting, by neuropsychologist Oliver Sacks.
It's the one about hallucinations, I don't have the title at hand, I'll edit it in. Many people whose vision becomes impaired, experience visual hallucinations. Didn't answer your question directly, but you already have plenty of answers and I thought this might be interesting to you, as it's kind of a related topic.</p>
<p>Edit: The English title is, in fact, 'hallucinations'.
The German title is 'Drachen, Doppelgänger und Dämonen. Über Menschen mit Halluzinationen.'</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
