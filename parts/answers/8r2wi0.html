		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually takes a person who learns two languages from birth some time to differentiate the languages from each other. This is evident from an incredibly early age: babies learning two languages babble using sounds from both languages regardless of who they're interacting with as they practice learning how to create different sounds necessary for the languages they're being exposed to.</p>
<p>Later in development, from about 10 months to 36 months, most bilingual children slowly learn to separate the languages. This includes creating separate language pathways that correspond to the syntax (grammar) and semantic (word meaning) of the two languages. You can think of these pathways sort of like two highways running side-by-side with interchanges: they perform the same function (communication using language) but do so using different languages that can interact with each other. </p>
<p>However, getting to this point is not a smooth process. Children learning two languages at this age will often speak with a mix of grammar and words from both languages, often regardless of to whom they are speaking. It takes some time for them to be able to recognize what belongs to which language, and which language should be used with which conversational partners.</p>
<p>The ability to recognize what language should be used in a given situation is part of a separate area of language called pragmatics, which is the social aspect of language. Once this ability has developed (often by 24 months), the child is able to codeswitch, the term used for the ability to switch between languages or dialects depending on the social needs of the interaction.</p>
<p>So, to answer your fundamental question, you were unlikely to always &quot;just know&quot; which words to use, but it was a skill developed before you have any conscious memory. Now that the languages are firmly established and use slightly different neuronal pathways, and you have the pragmatic ability to determine which language to use when, this ability likely seems like second nature even though it is actually a learned skill that is part of typical bilingual language development.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the first few years of your life your brain is writing all the rules and grammar for language. As you grew up, Spanish words were only spoken with Spanish. We can think of this as a type of grammar, just like you only say &quot;I am&quot; and not &quot;I are&quot;, the rules you learned were that all the English words go together, and all the Spanish words go together. So you don't mix them up for the same reason you don't make simple grammar mistakes.</p>
<p>Now, this only happens with your L1, or native language. Note that even though this is called L1, it doesn't mean only one language, but rather languages you learned before certain cut off ages, usually about 4-6 years old. There are also different developmental cut offs at other intervals like 8, 10, 12 years old. </p>
<p>After around 12 years old any language you study will be called your L2 (or L3 L4 etc), and is literally stored in a different part of your brain, and if you study more than 1 L2, you can easily confuse words when trying to recall them. It happens to me all the time.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
