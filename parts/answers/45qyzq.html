		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the theories behind humor is that it's the body's way of signaling that something is no longer threatening.  It has to do with cognitive dissonance - the mental stress or discomfort experienced by an individual who holds two or more contradictory beliefs, ideas, or values at the same time or is confronted by new information that conflicts with existing beliefs, ideas, or values.&quot; So we developed a sense of humor by perceiving a danger and later finding out that the threat was a misunderstanding. An example of this would be our ancestors being afraid of a loud noise in the woods and then discovering that it was caused by a tiny squirrel. Humor is a way in which the mind reconciles reality with its imagination, and thus closes the gap that is cognitive dissonance. This has evolved to include not just danger but other inconsistencies in reality. Most jokes have two story lines, a set up and a punchline. The set up leads you down one train of thought and plays to your sense of reality. The punchline creates a second parallel train of thought that reconciles your reality to your imagination. (It also works if the roles are reversed.) You are lead to believe one thought in the set up, then you find out that there is also a second hidden thought that you didn't think of that you also believe to be true.    </p>
<p>Update: I found a great joke to demonstrate a two story line joke, more commonly known as a one-liner. One-liners are the most efficient means of conveying a two story line joke. This joke is from the onion. &quot;Justice Scalia Dead Following 30-Year Battle With Social Progress.&quot; The first story line is the reality of the cause of Justice Scalia's death. We are led to believe that he fought a physical ailment for 30 years. There really isn't anything funny about that and it seems unlikely that there could be anything funny about it. Then it is revealed that the true cause of his death was the burden of being a stuffy conservative for such a long time. The punch shifts the point of the story from the reality of his death to the imaginative cause of his death. While we know that one can't actually die from being too socially conservative, it does reconcile the potential discomfort one might feel after being on seemingly the wrong side of so many social issues for such a long time. The punch is really clever and a great example of a hidden story line that you didn't think of that you could also believe to be true.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can try to address a more ultimate theory of humor (evolutionary, not mechanistic). Humor and creativity are kind of weird aspects of human nature because they're very difficult to account for under Darwin's Natural Selection theory. Why are we creative? Why do we make jokes?</p>
<p>There have been a lot of different theories of this. Some people think they are mere side effects of human intellect (exaptations) and others think that they serve some sort of adaptive function (Social Brain hypothesis).</p>
<p>Geoffrey Miller has proposed that many of our cognitive functions are the result of sexual selection (another of Darwin's theories, explored in <em>The Descent of Man</em>). This would propose that humor and creativity serve as honest indicators of quality in potential mates. For example, humor, creativity, and intelligence are all highly correlated. Or potential mates with less parasite resistance may not have the excess energy to expend on creative behaviors. Under this theory, creativity and humor would be displays, advertisements for mates.</p>
<p>It's pretty interesting stuff. Ultimately it can be difficult to apply evolutionary theory to human culture and behavior rigorously. But if you're interested in reading more about it Karmihalev's (2013) review &quot;Why Creativity is Sexy&quot; is readily available online and unites a lot of the evidence in favor of Miller's theory.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>Sorry, ignored your specific questions originally. Let me take a stab at them under Miller's hypothesis. This is just my own theorizing of course.</p>
<p>Some research has suggested that while females generally prefer a mate with a good sense of humor, males tend to prefer a mate that is receptive to humor (Bressler et al., 2006; Bressler and Balshine, 2006; Clegg et al., 2011). So uncontrollable bouts of laughter may be the appropriate response, advertising a preference for humor, which may make a mate more desirable. There's no need for this to be restricted by sex, though, as humans are FAIRLY monogamous and have likely been acted upon by sexual selection for both sexes, given our high parental investment. Or perhaps it's a bit more Fisherian, with a correlated sex-limited trait and preference for humor that might lead to an expression of that trait in both sexes dependent on certain steroid and hormone levels.</p>
<p>As far as other animals go, there seems to be a correlation between intelligence and practically useless cognitive feats like humor and creativity. So I would guess there may be a threshold of intelligence that must be crossed for the expression of humor. There's some evidence of a threshold for creativity around 100-120 IQ points (Jauk et al., 2013). I would guess that if humor is present in animals, it would be in social animals with high intelligence and high parental investment. Great apes are obvious, our closest ancestors. Might try dolphins and whales, too, though. But I don't know what the literature says.</p>
<p>EDIT:</p>
<p>FAIRLY monogamous. Thanks for keeping me honest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what you mean by &quot;explanation&quot;. If you mean fully understood, then no. If you me plausible hypotheses and some supporting evidence, then yes, there are multiple hypotheses.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, all hypotheses seem to think the original purpose was hi-jacked as a social communication device, even including <a href="http://psp.sagepub.com/content/35/7/923.abstract" target="_blank">sexual selection</a>. That is, given an initial value to humor in terms of surviving or prospering in a group setting -- regardless of what the actual source was -- the resulting talent of a male to perform it became a means by which females selected males, much like a peacocks tails. That is, the ability of males to perform it and the ability of females to judge and differentiate on it would have co-evolved. This explanation comes from the sexually dimorphic status of humor. Across cultures and time, it is males who statistically perform more humor and females who judge it, seek it, and find it attractive. (Again, that's statistical, like height. There are funny women and unfunny men, men who find it attractive in women, etc. But there is a significant statistical difference in how men and women approach it.)</p>
<p>One of the origins theories separates two types of humor: the &quot;funny&quot; kind (Duchene) and the &quot;awkward&quot; kind (non-Duchene). <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16519138" target="_blank">Gervais and Wilson suggest</a> that the funny kind may have evolved as a social signal that some specific novelty was not a danger, but was an opportunity to explore it and learn. This would correspond to why humor is typically about some sort of novelty or something unexpected, like a new way of looking at things. </p>
<p>Under their work, the &quot;awkward&quot; kind (non-Duchene) appears to have evolved later as an attempt to mimic the <em>appearance</em> of humor and laughter, but in a forced way like responding to a surprise/prank or a social response to somebody telling a cute story without any actual humor in it per se. (For a layman's discussion, see <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/features/2014/the_humor_code/why_do_humans_laugh_the_evolutionary_biology_of_laughter.html" target="_blank">here</a>.)</p>
<p>There are variety of other theories. For a review, try <a href="http://evp.sagepub.com/content/4/1/147470490600400129.full.pdf" target="_blank">Polimeni and Reiss, 2006</a>. They are categorized as incongruity theories, expression of sexual or aggressive feelings, and demonstration of superiority. Others (see <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2011/05/13/5_leading_theories_for_why_we_laugh_and_the_jokes_that_prove_them_wrong.html" target="_blank">here</a>) include benign violation theory, the mechanical theory, and release theory. I find these latter hypotheses are more about categorizing <em>types</em> of humor and may propose a value with that given type. But they don't seem to describe the <em>existence</em> of humor. </p>
<p>The Gervais and Wilson hypothesis does have a plausible explanation of the origins in terms of natural selection value, and sexual selection and cultural hi-jacking hypotheses also fit available data. But, I would not say these are anywhere near clearly demonstrated or sufficiently detailed. Plausible, yes, but not even close to a done deal.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Daniel Dennet and two collaborators developed a hypothesis that Dennet described (briefly) in a TEDtalk. The basic idea is that the bit of joy that your brain gets for spotting the &quot;twist&quot; that makes something funny is &quot;the joy of debugging&quot;, and this could be evolutionarily advantageous. They wrote a book on this topic, but I don't know how well received their contribution has been by the scientific community:  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Jokes-Using-Humor-Reverse-Engineer/dp/0262518694" target="_blank">http://www.amazon.com/Inside-Jokes-Using-Humor-Reverse-Engineer/dp/0262518694</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
