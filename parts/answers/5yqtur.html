		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a good explanation from a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/37z7lq/eli5_why_is_23976_fps_the_standard_on_film/" target="_blank">previous ELI5 thread</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Film standard is actually 24.0 frames per second. The 23.976 is the framerate in digital cinema cameras. The reason it isn't pure 24 is pretty stupid. Basically, our video system in America is called NTSC. It set the standard for video signals back in the infancy of video. In black and white everything worked nicely at pure frame rates. However, when color was introduced to videoall of the broadcasters suddenly had to be transmitting color information in addition to greyscale information. Technology already in place couldn't handle this, so the engineers for NTSC devised a trick where video would now be at a slightly lower framerate, and the extra bandwidth in the signal freed up by this would be used for color information. Today, this is no longer necessary as technology has grown beyond the need for such a gimmick. However, thousands of studios across the NTSC world still have some if not all equipment that can only handle the old NTSC standard. It would be too costly to update every piece of equipment, so we're stuck with this standard for at least another decade or two.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is actually is determined by physics and it dates back to cathode ray TV's. The electron beam is scanned across the screen in two passes. It first scans the odd pixels and then the even pixels. In North America TV was broadcast with 525 horizontal rows. Which means each scan did 262.5 rows. </p>
<p>In North America each TV channel was given 6 MHz to broadcast it's programs, of which about 4.5 MHz was usable. Picture was sent, and then a small gap and then audio was sent. When color programming came out, they had to somehow fit the color data in between the picture and audio.</p>
<p>The color signal was interfering with the normal picture. Using some complicated physics, you can get rid of the interference if the gap between the picture and color and the gap between color and sound are both odd integer multiples of the horizontal frequency divided by 2. Simplifying the expressions, you can find that you need an integer multiple time the horizontal frequency to equal 4.5MHz. </p>
<p>So, going back to our 525 rows. Your horizontal frame rate is the number of rows times the frame rate. So, we need a number that when multiplied by 525 becomes divisible into 4,500,000 (4.5 MHz). That number turns out to be 29.97. This is why TV is broadcast at 29.97 FPS.</p>
<p>Okay, now with that out of the way. The 23.976 comes into play when converting from the 24FPS that film cameras use to broadcast rates. 24x29.97/30=23.976. This is called a three-two pull down. Basically they are manipulating the frames in a way that is undetectable to the human eye so that they can match the frame rate of your TV.  </p>
<p>ETA: This might seem like it doesn't add up so I'll add one last step. 23.976 happens to be exactly 4/5 of 29.97. These 4 frames can be stretched into 5 frames because of the way TV images are produced, and that is what allows the movie to be broadcast in 29.97. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Short version: its to encode the color in the video.</p>
<p>EDIT: woops, i linked the wrong thing. Should be the right video now!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll piggyback on this. When a movie is shot at 24.000 fps (and presumably edited at 24.000 too) and then broadcasted at 23.976 fps, does the TV station go through the trouble of re-encoding the video to 23.976 (like they definitely would do with 30 to 24, for example), or do they simply slow it down 1.001 times to avoid frame interpolation issues?   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>23.976 is what's used on TVs, because TVs aren't actually 30 FPS - they're 29.97 (and we use that because adding color to 30FPS TV changed the time base). When playing 23.976 FPS on a TV, you map 4 film frames to 5 video frames. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
