<p>Is it possible that the cells of larger mammals have some sort of awareness, maybe through cell signaling, of the size of the tissue they're a part of and are more willing to enter apoptosis since they're more replaceable?</p>
<p>Has there been any study in vitro on cultured tissues? For instance, would 1,000 cells on media have the same cancer rate as 1,000,000 cells or does this phenomenon only occur in the larger context of the animal?</p>
<p>I am a senior Biology major currently taking Biology of Cancer so this is particularly interesting to me. Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What are the current ideas on why larger mammals don't have higher cancer rates and which idea do you think makes the most sense? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Is the paradox that larger mammals have many more cells, but similar cancer rates to smaller mammals with many less cells? More cells could obviously mean more chances to develop cancer, so would that mean larger mammals need better regulatory/recognition of tumor cells?</p>
<p>I know that our immune system has pathways to kill cancerous cells,  the danger is that when the cells evolve to hide from our immune system. So my question is: Do larger mammals immune systems recognize cancerous cells better than smaller mammals, and if so, would that potentially cause more sever auto immune disorders?</p>
<p>Again, thank you for the AMA!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Does it have anything to do with basal metabolic rate and its relationship to mass?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
