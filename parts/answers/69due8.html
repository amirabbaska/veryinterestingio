<p>but even then clients would still be able to connect to the internet, it would just be a huge mess because noone would know where to find servers.</p>
<p>the internet itself is defined by its protocols. as long as there are other computers in the same network using the same protocol, internet would work.</p>
<p>compare it to a spoken language like english. as long as there are other people around that speak english you are able to exchange information with them. it stops working as soon as you are the only one left or are not in range to speak to another person(pc disconnected from network).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everybody else is correct that DNS servers are the main point of failure. For normal consumers using normal software, you need the DNS to locate and access other websites. </p>
<p>Thing is, there are 3rd party DNS servers. Many institutions maintain them as a way to block access to malicious or inappropriate websites for their employees or students. Google maintains some of them... for troubleshooting, security, or to bypass restrictions like I mentioned before, many people use Google's 3rd party servers already.</p>
<p>This makes it incredibly unlikely that the entire world could lose access to the entire internet. </p>
<p>But a power outage or natural disaster in exactly the right location could take out a large number of websites. We've seen this before, when Amazon web services went down and damn near everything slowed down or stopped working. Most small sites have a company like Amazon do the physical hosting of their websites. Most large sites distribute the hosting across multiple companies for redundancy. So if a giant company like AWS has a big outage, it will have at least a minor impact on a LOT of websites, and a major impact on some. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR The initial Internet development was supported and contributed by the USA military exactly because is a very clever idea to withstand even nuclear strikes.</p>
<p>The service that allows you to pick stuff from the www just by using website names (like www.reddit.com) instead of the IP address is a critical point because it relies in a small group of servers in its core. But all the other millions of servers could still be accessed if you know their IP addresses. This is what is called the Deep Web, millions of websites whose names are not recorded in the &quot;city phone directory&quot;, only people who know their &quot;phone numbers&quot; (IP addresses) can phone call them.</p>
<p>So, in short, you can make very annoying and difficult for people to access the www temporarily but to really knock it down would require widespread destruction at planetary level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the internet was developed to be pretty much resistant against what you're suggesting.  </p>
<p>IIRC the story is that it was initially a military thing and the setup being that it's a giant web of connections would mean the communication network couldn't be completely destroyed.  Certain parts of it would be disrupted and inaccessible but overall it would still function and be able to relay information from one place to another (aside from the affected areas of course).  So if a nuke hit Boston for example, well you aren't talking to Boston anymore but info sent from DC to California would still be able to be transmitted. . . it would just have to ping off any of the servers that were still alive instead of passing through Boston.</p>
<p>So, I guess it COULD happen but it's very unlikely.  It would take a cataclysmic event to completely take down the entire internet. . . and at that point it probably means the human race is going to end fairly soon.  Pretty much every server on the planet would have to be either destroyed or cut off from anything else.</p>
<p>TLDR:  You could break parts of it but probably never the whole thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been several different problems affecting the entire Internet or just a part of it. Most of these are being solved one step at a time and some is not as easy. All the ISPs are constantly communicating with each other though automatic systems to determine how the traffic should be sent around the world. One of the earliest global outages were a technical problem with the protocol they used at the time which caused a packet to flood the entire network which meant that all the routers had to be restarted at once, however there were only a handful of routers worldwide at that point. But there is also lots of different outages related to this system. Some is down to mistakes by technical personnel and some are down to management decisions. For example if Hurricane Electric and Sprint is not willing to work together on an issue then  they may cause half of the Internet to be disconnected from the other half. It is also possible to publish a path to addresses you do not own and therefore make a network unavailable. This have happened to Youtube at no fault of their own. This last part is seeing technical solutions being implemented currently but it is slow going when you need to replace a lot of big expensive hardware to make use of the new features.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
