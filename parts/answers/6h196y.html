		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Supposedly there's a quote (although I can't find it) about one of the scientists who was asked to check the calculations to verify that the nuclear bomb wouldn't ignite the atmosphere.  He expressed his concern to another scientist as to the dreadful burden of his task, and the terrible consequences if he were wrong.  The other scientist (Maybe Richard Feynman, it sounds clever enough for him) said something to the effect of  &quot;Don't worry about it, if it does ignite the atmosphere, no one will blame you.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Best I understand it, they were worried about chain-reaction fusion of low-weight atoms, like oxygen or nitrogen.</p>
<p>We know now it's impossible.  Not nearly dense enough, not enough pressure or energy, etc etc.  But keep in mind, the Manhattan Project spanned across World War II, and ended before 1945.</p>
<p>Fission [of heavy elements] was only discovered in 1938.  They were literally discovering and making stuff up as they went.  So the idea that the energies necessary weren't there wasn't something they could know until after they ran the numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also mentioned in passing the Dan Carlin's Hardcore History (concerns that the atomic bomb could ignite the entire atmosphere), might where you heard it! </p>
<p>Otherwise I recommend Countdown to Armageddon and The Destroyer of Worlds, great history podcasts!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
