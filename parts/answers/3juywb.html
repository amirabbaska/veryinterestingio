		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They certainly do have a sense of time, but not necessarily in the way you mean.</p>
<p>Animals, including humans, almost all have a sense of time that is described in three scales: millisecond timing, which is largely controlled by the cerebellum and mostly concerned with coordinating movement; interval timing, on the scale of seconds to minutes to hours, distributed throughout the brain (and especially the striatum) and concerned with determining the typical duration between two events; and circadian timing, the 24-hour internal clock coordinated by the suprachiasmatic nucleus and adjusted based on solar cues (and, to a lesser extent, cues like eating times).</p>
<p>See, for example, the excellent timing review by Buhusi &amp; Meck, 2006: <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16163383" target="_blank">&quot;What makes us tick? Functional and neural mechanisms of interval timing&quot;.</a></p>
<p>What you're talking about is circannual timing, meaning the timing of yearly (or thereabout) events. This almost certainly is largely controlled by instinct, or at best by other cues (e.g., shortened days and colder temperatures). Read more in my previous AskScience AMA <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/39kl55/askscience_ama_series_i_am_ratwhowouldbeking_and/cs4f4xs" target="_blank">here</a>. It's sometimes hard to disentangle learning and cognition from instinct, but consider how <em>fucked</em> most animals would be if they didn't intuitively know what to do as their first winter approached. </p>
<p>How animals subjectively experience time is a very difficult question to answer, but it's just one of many stimuli that govern animal behaviour. Whether they <em>anticipate</em> the future or merely react to things that previously have been associated with what they should plan for is contentious, and I will quote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/39kl55/askscience_ama_series_i_am_ratwhowouldbeking_and/cs4mcqp" target="_blank">myself from an earlier question</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Future anticipation and future-planning in nonhuman animals is a really interesting, difficult-to-measure thing. First, &quot;future prediction&quot; mostly isn't necessary - we can usually predict the future pretty well based just on what has worked in the past (i.e., reinforcement learning). This complicates figuring out if an animal is deliberately planning, because you need to study it in circumstances that the animal isn't totally familiar with (or else they'll just respond in ways that have previously worked well), and then that seems a little unfair to expect the animal to cope with. There have, however, been some pretty successful studies of future anticipation in rats and monkeys. I've also found that pigeons start responding on options that currently aren't paying off but will soon (even at the expense of missing out on current food). Whether these are the same as what humans experience (and whether what humans experience is real, or just the way we interpret our decisions!) isn't currently answerable. In short, your dog probably lives mostly in the present and that works for it, but that doesn't stop it from doing things that work in the future (and it might even think about it, but we don't know!). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question is actually rather nuanced and no answer can be applied universally to all species. Saying that, all species do possess a primitive 'sense' of time; a biological clock that governs many aspects of their lives including breeding, feeding, and migration. However, the more interesting question is whether certain animals are <em>aware</em> of the passage of time.</p>
<p>An interesting study that can shed some light onto this topic deals with the concept of episodic memory, also known as 'what, where, when' memory. Obviously in this case the 'when' is of the most interest. If an animal was able to demonstrate an awareness of when a particular event occurred, then it follows that the animal has a 'conscious' sense of time. The study used a species of bird, closely related to crows and ravens, known as the Florida Scrub Jay. The birds had two different food items to store for a later time. The first was the bird's preferred food of wax worms that would spoil after a short time. The second was the less tasty, but more durable peanut. After a brief acclimation period where the perishable nature of the was worms was learnt, the birds started to display some interesting behaviours.</p>
<p>If the birds were given the opportunity to retrieve the stored food after a short period of time they were much more likely to search for the yummy wax worms. However, if the time period was much longer, the birds searched for the peanuts and ignored the spoilt wax worms (note, there was no way of telling the worms had spoilt accept the passage of time alone). </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v395/n6699/abs/395272a0.html" target="_blank">This study</a> shows that some species are able to remember when an event happened and alter their behaviour accordingly. Therefore, we can conclude that certain animals do have the capacity to understand time on a more conscious level, whereas to others, time remains purely instinctive. </p>
