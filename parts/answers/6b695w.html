		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Teeth actually do work to heal themselves.  In the center of the tooth there are cells that try to protect the pulp, live tissue, from the material that cause cavities.  </p>
<p>The teeth are fromed in two directions at the same time.  From the middle to the outside, which is the enamel, and from the middle to the inside, which is the dentin.  Once the outside is formed the tooth begins to erupt. Once it erupts there are no longer any cells to form the crystaline structure of enamel. </p>
<p>The saliva does have healing properties, and can help with minor repairs, or remineralization.  </p>
<p>Cavities occur because our mouths are hosts to millions of bacteria. Since bacteria are alive, and everything that lives eats, they have to eat something.  But what? The bacteria eat whatever we eat; the remnants of food left on the teeth.  And since everything that eats poops, the bacteria eliminate their waste, poop, on our teeth.  The bacterial waste is an acid.  Since acids desolve things, the acids desolve the enamel and dentin of the teeth. </p>
<p>The chemical nature of the enamel's crystaline structure makes it susseptible to the acids.  Interestingly enough, the fluoride in tooth paste, and drinking water replaces a chemical group of the enamel and make the teeth more resistant to the bacterial acids. </p>
<p>And that is why, once a tooth has erupted, it cannot fix itself, and how a cavity is made. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I went back to my dentist to check after 6 months and she said to give it time, the small crack would eventually repair itself.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Really short answer, the teeth doesn't have any cells in it, so it can't repair itself. So, if you chip your teeth, it can't repair itself because there are no blood cells/stem cells in your teeth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adapted from something I wrote for a similar eli5:</p>
<p>Some parts of your teeth can and do heal themselves, just slowly. </p>
<p>The greatest part your teeth are made up of dentine, which can in fact heal and regenerate over time. like bone, it can resorb and be re-laid, but to a much lesser extent, and unlike bone (which is dynamic and remodelled constantly), it only occurs after significant trauma. The layer covering the roots of your teeth, called cementum, can heal in a similar manner. </p>
<p>Enamel, the layer covering the visible portion (crown) of your teeth, doesnt really regenerate in this manner though. I suppose because it's in the outside, not in contact with the cells/blood supply that can do the repairing....I think it can absorb some minerals from saliva though? </p>
<p>There's a limit to how much/how quickly that regeneration can happen, so for larger chips you might need to fix them, but for small fractures on the roots of your teeth, it can be enough to stabilise the injury so it heals on its own (kind of like having a cast for a bone)</p>
<p>(Got most of this from my sister who is a dentist, I can ask her to double check later ...if you have any questions I'm sure she'd be happy to explain and I can pass the answers along)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's no real evolutionary imperative to repair your teeth. Baby teeth keep you eating through childhood. Adult teeth keep you eating through your prime child-bearing years. Throughout the vast majority of human history most people died after thatâ€”at which point they'd already passed on their non-tooth-repairing genes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
