		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, temperature is one of the things that affects sound attenuation in air. ISO 9613-1 provides a standard method of estimating this. Generally sound attenuation is lower in cold air.</p>
<p>Sound will also curve away or towards the ground due to a temperature gradient since the speed of sound is dependent air density. This can cause sound shadows where the receiver cannot hear a sound despite being &quot;close&quot; to the source.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun related data point, Not sound, but radio, which I am sure on some level is affected by air temperature in a similar manner because:</p>
<p>The system: a UHF RFID reader (yes they exist) in control of timekeeping and physical access.</p>
<p>The issue: In the winter time people walking by the gates were being read as far away as 50ft, but typically 40ft. The normal range was 15-20ft (High gain directional antennas, the design specs called for this and needed it)</p>
<p>Once the temperature was taken into account the cause of errant reads became apparent and a process was put in place to turn the transmit power down when cold weather arrived.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature will definitely affect how far distance the sound can travel but sound often travel farther in cold weather due to reflections between cooler air close to the ground and warmer air higher up. The main factor of how far sound can travel is the distance though as it obeys the inverse square law. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With no temperature gradient ( so a large hall where all air is the same temperature) sound would travel a shorter distance if the air is coolder. It actually depends on the density of air. Density can be expresed as a function of temperature. More dense gases require more energy to be compressed/displaced and therefore  energy of the sound waves in denser gases dissipates in a shorter distance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it does. When it comes to the propagation of sound there are a few variables that are critical in how it travels. Density (temperature falls under this), reflective properties, material makeup, and frequency. As sounds travels it’s constantly needing to transfer energy (a sound wave is a variance in pressure after all), so the medium it travels through largely affects it (is the medium solid/liquid, very dense/malleable) hence why you can hear things better in open air 15ft away compared to 10 ft away through 2ft of solid steel. We know that the lower the temperature something is the more static and resistant to movement molecules are due to a lack of energy (ice vs boiling water). So when sound travels through cold air vs hot air there’s more energy that will be lost (resulting in it not traveling as far) because because the sound waves are having to drive more static molecules to move compared to very easily moveable ones in hot air. But obviously there are variances and exceptions. Low frequency waves carry a lot more energy compared to high frequency waves (why you can easily hear a sub in a car from far away and not the song) so although it may be more dense a low frequency wave in theory can be heard more easily in a colder environment compared to a high frequency wave. These are things that are all factored in especially with concerts (being aware of speaker placement and humidity cause by a crowd) and general acoustics.</p>
