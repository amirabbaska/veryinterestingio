		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, humans are not the only the only animals that use ketone bodies.</p>
<p>Ketone bodies are a normal metabolite within lipolysis, ketogenesis and ketosis (burning fats from your fat tissue) and a great deal of what we know about lipid (fat) metabolism was derived from rat and mouse experiments. So at the very least ketones as fuel existed in the joint ancestor of all mammals, millions and millions of years before the first primates existed.</p>
<p>But it likely goes back much further.</p>
<p>Consider also that when many animals sleep they make use of their fat stores to maintain energy homeostasis. Pretty much all animals with nervous systems engage in sleep or a sleep-like process. So lipolysis and ketone utilisation likely goes back at least as far as the joint ancestor of all chordate animals. And it likely goes back even further than that as lipid metabolism <em>in toto</em> is a key pillar of keeping cells functioning</p>
<p>Here's a paper from 1979 on ketone body metabolism in fish</p>

<p>Here's one from 2006 on ketone and glucose metabolism in the honey bee vs fruit flies and mosquitos</p>

<p>Edit:
As I'd not previously considered animals other than the ones I covered in my undergraduate degree, here are some other references I've found for other animals</p>
<p>2015: Fruitfly brains can metabolise fatty acids directly (where ketones would be a metabolic intermediate)

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this rumor comes from human brains being able to adapt the largest percent of brain tissue to using ketones when in a state of ketosis. This probably has less to do with ketosis being more appropriate for humans than other animals and more to do with the unique makeup of our brains and unusually large cerebral cortex. I'm not aware of any research, but I'd be willing to bet dolphin brains use more ketones than ours. Other hunting carnivores that can't use ketones as well have to shift their brains and metabolism in general to a low energy state called hibernation to survive the winter. Whereas humans and some others can maintain a high energy state via ketones and continue to hunt through the winter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My thirteen year old daughter has been running on ketones all her life. She has a rare neurological condition called Glucose Transporter Deficiency Syndrome - which means Glucose cannot pass through her brain barrier. She's been in ketosis for 12 years now. Ketones are the business for some - a far better option then a multitude of epilepsy drugs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FYI, under normal conditions the brain almost exclusively uses glucose for energy</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Glucose is the only fuel normally used by brain cells. Because neurons cannot store glucose, they depend on the bloodstream to deliver a constant supply of this fuel. Fatty acids do not serve as fuel for the brain, because they are bound to albumin in plasma and so do not traverse the blood-brain barrier. In starvation, ketone bodies generated by the liver partly replace glucose as fuel for the brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All cells in the human body can use glucose, FFA and ketones for energy, the brain however almost exclusively uses glucose.  During a fed state the brain will use 20-25% of total body glucose </p>
<p>During starvation and ketosis that number will jump up to 70% of total body glucose is used by the brain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have my bachelors degree in neuroscience and I'm working on my PhD studying medical potential of snake venom proteins (I enjoy working with the animals so I've shied away from a neuro only degree).  I have always been taught that the human brain can only use glucose as an energy source, hence the rapid brain death when deprived of oxygen.  I thought this also meant gluconeogenesis did not occur in neurons.  Also that ketones could not be used as an energy source in the brain as in other tissues.  Do you happen to have the source for the research showing neural tissue using ketones as an energy source?  I'm very curious as I've been taught otherwise for years.  Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
