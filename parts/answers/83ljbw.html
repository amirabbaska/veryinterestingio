		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really, but she’s not feeling the contractions anymore. </p>
<p>More info:
C-sections happen for a variety of reasons at several stages of labor. Some women come in not even contracting to have a scheduled c-section. Others labor and due to a variety of factors need a C-section either semi-urgently or emergently. </p>
<p>Anesthesia is generally down one of three ways. </p>
<p>First and most common is the labor epidural. This helps numb up the contractions during labor. Many women can still feel a contraction but their pain level is very low. </p>
<p>Second, spinal anesthesia. Like an epidural but more powerful and fire and forget. </p>
<p>Third, general anesthesia with a breathing tube - generally reserved for emergencies or if lady can’t have spinal/epidural anesthesia</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Contractions work off of a positive feedback loop. </p>
<p>Most things in our body work off a negative feedback loop, meaning when we make enough end product it goes back to the source and says “stop, we’re good”. With labor and contractions, it’s the opposite. The baby has gotten bigger and in the right position so it starts pushing on the cervix. So the cervix relays to the brain to release oxytocin to help contractions even more creating a greater contraction the next time. And that cycle continues until delivery of the baby and the placenta. </p>
<p>So with a c section, you’re removing a huge part of that positive feedback loop, so labor itself doesn’t actually occur for that much longer. But like others have mentioned, you will still have some contractions during/after Caesarian. </p>
<p>TLDR: yeah, labor turns off because the baby isn’t trying to move down and out of the moth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Labor goes off a positive feedback loop. As the baby pushes on the uterus walls, the mind releases oxytocin. This causes contractions, leading to more pushing, leading to more oxytocin. As soon as the pressure is removed the contractions stop because the body does not release any more oxytocin because there is no pressure </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
