		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taking the example of silver and copper, both of these metals have fairly reactive oxygen atoms on their surface at ordinary conditions.  </p>
<p>These oxygen surface-species are used in <a href="http://www.silverinstitute.org/site/silver-in-industry/catalysts/" target="_blank">oxidation catalysts</a>  that are used to either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethylene_oxide" target="_blank">make chemicals</a>, or <a href="http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:8922/FULLTEXT01.pdf" target="_blank">decompose chemicals (pdf warning)</a>.  </p>
<p>A catalyst is something that speeds up a chemical reaction, or enables a chemical reaction to occur at lower temperature than would otherwise be possible.</p>
<p>Since both metals form oxides naturally, and the oxygen can participate in chemical reactions, on a small (bacterial) scale there can be similar oxidation reactivity going on that just so happens to kill bacteria.  </p>
<p>In other metals, the oxygen atoms are more tightly bound to the metal atoms, so they are not as reactive.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each metal has its own chemical properties. The way metals kill bacteria are unfortunately not yet fully understood, and are still being studied, as described <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimicrobial_properties_of_copper" target="_blank">here.</a></p>
<p>Brass is made largely of copper, so it's the same issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Silver, copper and other metals create what is known as the oligodynamic effect which results in the death of the bacteria - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJbDPD_17bw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pJbDPD_17bw</a></p>
<p>However the process isn't rapid it takes 4- 24 hours for the bacteria to die basically as a result of toxic poisoning. Just like some substances like lead in large enough quantities are toxic to humans so are some metals toxic to bacteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I did some research on this (even did some lab work testing the potency of different oligodynamic compounds) the leading theories so far seemed to suggest that oligodynamic materials have free ions that are attracted to the membranes and organelles of bacteria and certain cells, and some mechanism allows them to either rupture the membrane and/or destabilize critical organelle functions, thus killing the cell.</p>
<p>It's a really neat topic because it's really easy to study, but it's extremely difficult to test for the actual mechanism through which it functions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay, so these responses are all great but they really aren't ELI5 quality, so ELI5 explanation:</p>
<p>You're a little bacteria crawling along a copper door handle. The copper handle has ridges and grooves, mountains and valleys that are all too tiny to see but they exist. Some copper atoms on the surface are not as held on as the rest, and as the bacteria crawls over it it can act like a bear trap and hurt a small chunk of the bacteria. Over the course of the whole handle, all these bear traps slowly hurt all the bacteria until they (mostly all) die. RIP little bacterium. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
