		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There really isn't a set way this is done.  Sometimes the franchisee is expected to absorb the cost, sometimes they are given free product for the day, sometimes they are allowed to deduct the costs from their franchise fees, sometimes they can straight up opt out, etc.  There is no universal standard.</p>
<p>That said, even if they are expected to absorb the costs, the executives come up with those promotions in order to get more people in the door and sell more food - they are not done for the good of the consumer.  A free Slurpy probably costs the store a couple of cents worth of product (drinks and fries are <strong>very</strong> high margin items) so if it gets someone to come in and order something else, the restaurant ends up turning a profit despite the free item.  If I have to give away $100 worth of free product, but it boosted my sales by $1,000 that day at a 50% profit margin, then I have no issue giving away $100 worth of free product...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My sister owns two 7-11s in Virginia.
As franchisees, they get to choose whether or not to participate in promotions, but she always does. As she’s been saying for years, “You get customers in the door &amp; it’s pure profit.”
Both her stores are clean, efficient, &amp; in busy areas. She has tons of regular customers who buy early morning coffee, others who buy lunch, etc. They don’t make much on gas. Bonus-she’s on great terms with her beer vendors &amp; they give her free Williamsburg Busch Gardens tickets! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ben &amp; Jerry's Ice Cream does free cone days once a year. It started as a thank you to the citizens of Burlington, Vermont where they started, and to celebrate the businesses's first year anniversary. It eventually became a yearly tradition for all of their stores.</p>
<p>When Unilever bought the company in 2000, it was apparently part of the contract that Unilever continue the tradition indefinitely, for as long as the Ben &amp; Jerry's brand exists.</p>
<p>Today, franchise owners must participate in this tradition as well. Normally each store buys their own ice cream from the main company, getting to choose roughly which flavors and the amounts (with some promotional flavors being required), but on free cone day the main company sends all of the stores ice cream of a limited set of flavors for free, with the only stipulation that they must give it away for free on free cone day. If they run out of the free ice cream they do not have to stay open, or give away ice cream they've personally bought. As far as I know the franchise still has to pay for the employees, but the product is free.</p>
<p>Also, while many stores have &quot;1 cone per person&quot; signs, many interpret that as &quot;at a time&quot; and welcome repeat customers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
