		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Calories in calories out (cico) is like a budgetary point: losing weight means burning more calories than you consume.</p>
<p>Burning fat after x minutes of exercise is just a comment on your body switching from primarily carb power (glycogen) to primarily burning fat (ketones) for fuel.  This distinction is not really relevant to casual exercisers or dieters.</p>
<p>To illustrate: A lb of fat is 3500 calories. So to lose a lb of fat a week you need a calorie deficit of 500/calories a day.  You can have a 500/cal deficit without any exercise or without exercising for greater than 30 minutes. In other words, your body also burns fat stores when you eat at a caloric deficit, otherwise no one would lose weight from starvation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your immediate energy reserves consist of a bit of glucose, phosphocreatine etc. while glycogen is the medium-term energy reserve that provides more glucose when needed. Only once that's more or less exhausted will the muscles be burning fat directly. That's what hitting the wall is in a marathon or similar endurance event.</p>
<p>But it doesn't really matter to the overall balance whether your muscles are burning fat directly during exercise. What matters in the long run is the energy balance. If your body is in energy starvation more often (and/or more intensely) than it's in energy surplus, the insulin-glucagon balance will favor net breakdown of fat from adipocytes.</p>
<p>The thing is, different parts of the body use different energy sources in different situations. The brain is one of the less flexible organs - it uses glucose exclusively if at all possible, only under severe conditions (starvation or extreme carbohydrate restriction) will it start to use ketone bodies, derived from fat. So it's not so important whether the muscles are actually burning fat or glucose during exercise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isn't the simplest answer that the latter statement is incorrect? Or at least phrased poorly - maybe he meant to say that during exercise we won't burn fat until 30 mins in.</p>
<p>You could sit on your ass and do nothing. If you ate less than you needed, your body would eventually start breaking down fat for energy. That's what it is there for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your blood sugar is consumed as you exercise.</p>
<p>The pancreas will try to regulate this level by emitting glucagon, which stimulates cells into releasing trapped glucose into the bloodstream.  This is a finite, short term resource.</p>
<p>Fat cells store far more energy.  While we regularly break down amino acids for various reasons, this happens more frequently approaching ketogenic states (low blood sugar).</p>
<p>By this method, fat burns more easily after exercise.  BUT calories-in must remain unchanged or lower to avoid replenishing those stores.</p>
<p>Carb loading raises blood sugar above normal levels temporarily.  Doing so prior to or during exercise allows this fuel to be available to muscles promptly without being stored first.  The body stores what it doesn't need immediately over several hours.  It works to keep blood sugar levels at a &quot;middle range&quot;.</p>
<p>If you normally eat 2000 calories a day and don't exercise, your body will seek an equilibrium baseline at this caloric level.  It's easy to raise this baseline (the body doesn't resist calories beyond present stomach capacity) but it takes several months to shift this preferred state downward sustainably.  That's why dietitians will often describe weight loss being 20% exercise and 80% diet... to describe where the focus should be.  (Although you can achieve weight loss with 0% exercise, this breaks down more muscle you don't want to lose.  And less muscle means lower caloric needs, which makes rebounding easier.)</p>
<p>Now, imagine you start burning 500 extra calories daily during exercise.  Picture how much effort that takes.  It's a lot for many.  And then realize how little food that is: a moderate hamburger.  Or a small milkshake.</p>
<p>The body will release hormones to make you hungry.  After burning 500 calories during exercise, do you think you sustainably keep your increased hunger at bay with just a small milkshake? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been many lengthy responses so I'll just give you the TL;DR: The rule that you have to work out for enough time (or that walking is better if you want to burn fat for that matter) is bogus. If fact, the energy expended during a normal workout is small compared to the basic upkeep, so the thing that really matters for losing weight is intake.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
