		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It goes into a duct that funnels into your nasopharangeal tract. Basically when you blink, your eyes push any kind of foreign objects to the corner where they pass through a duct and ultimately either run out your nose in the form of snot, or it goes down your throat when you swallow saliva.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually when you blink and that gets an eyelash out of your eye the eyelash was still anchored to your eyelid.  The far end is what gets in your eye and irritates it, and a blink or a rub snaps it back into its usual place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've had many contact lenses get lost in what seems like &quot;the back of my eye.&quot; If I rub my eyes too hard, I'll see my lens drift to the side of my eye and in a desperate attempt to get it back, I end up pushing it back further. Believe me, I'd know if those lenses came out of the corner of my eye. They don't. Where do they go? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
