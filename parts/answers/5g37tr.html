		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The average annual income of the 1% is about 1 million.  That's a general, rough metric people use. </p>
<p>But it really has broader implications.  The &quot;1%&quot; is less about raw income per annum, and more about ideology and mindset.  1% are <em>not</em> the &quot;working class.&quot;  </p>
<p>At a certain point, when you have enough money, either inherited or otherwise, your money becomes like a self-sustaining star.  Where compound interest on debts works <em>against</em> most Americans, compound interest on savings &amp; investments works <em>for</em> the 1%. </p>
<p>When you have something like $1 million to invest when you're in your teens or twentites, its hard to overstate how enormous of an advantage this is. </p>
<p>The 99% will have to either take out loans, or have their parents take out loans to go to school.  That's 30k - 100k of debt.  They'll take out credit cards to deal with daily expenses.  They'll work 40+hr/week jobs on top of school, just to deal with living expenses.  They'll rent apartments that represent sunk costs, with no equity gain.  Now they have compound interest working <em>against</em> them, and it will be working against them for most of their lives. </p>
<p>Now take someone in the 1%.  If his parents have an annual income of $1m, its not unreasonable that he has a trustfund for somewhere around that amount when he's 18. </p>
<p>That means college is 100% paid for.  Living expenses are completely covered.  He doesn't have to worry about working during college - he can focus on his studies and still have plenty of time to have fun. </p>
<p>He can buy a house - maybe even outright - right out of college, and let the value climb. </p>
<p>He can invest 200k in index funds in an IRA or other fund, and just let the market make him a millionaire by virtue of compound interest in 10 years. </p>
<p>That's the difference, in reality, between the 99% and the 1%.  It is more about the financial and material effort to begin one's professional life.  A (relatively) small head start very early on translates to a MASSIVE lead decades later in life. </p>
<p>The trust fund kid and the the 99%er, with the same work ethic, and even the same career path, will have vastly different financial situations at 40.  The 99%er may always walk semi-precariously, fretting over his retirement, whether he'll have enough for his family, paying off his debts. </p>
<p>The trust fund kid, on the other hand, is already a millionaire (provided even basic fiscal sense), probably a multiple-property owner, and as such has far more free time to devote to work or play.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>:  Some people have been meticulously pointing out exceptions to the above hypothetical scenarios.  This is true.  Someone making 50k/year <em>could</em> stay out of debt and have a great retirement.  Someone with a trustfund <em>could</em> disastrously mismanage their money. </p>
<p>Please keep in mind these aren't deterministic.  The two scenarios represent average trends.  Some 1%ers make 300/k year.  Some make 1billion a year.  There's a lot of diversity in that %.  Some of them are working people that just make great wages.  High-level blue color.  Etc. </p>
<p>What I'm giving is a very broad-stroke difference in the population between &quot;99%ers&quot; and &quot;1%ers&quot;.  I wanted to illustrate that it isn't raw annual salary that differentiates these people.  It is their susceptibility to debt traps.  Or their <em>proximity</em> to debt traps.  We are all equally capable of falling into one; but <em>some people with never need to</em>.  Someone whose parents make upwards of 300k/year are far less likely to need to fall back on pay-day loans.  Some do, true, <em>but most do not</em>.  On the other hand, many 99%ers <em>will</em> need to take out loans, <em>will</em> accumulate credit card debt, <em>may</em> need to take out a payday loan or two. </p>
<p>With careful, patient fiscal-mindedness, even people of moderate means can avoid all this.  Avoid student loans, avoid credit cards, avoid debt spirals.  <em>I know this</em>. </p>
<p>But clearly, based on thousands of years of human civilization, <em>the average trend of society is LESS fiscal-mindedness</em>.  </p>
<p>Based on these inherent trends within society and human nature, I use a hypothetical scenario between a hypothetical, center-bell-curve &quot;1%er&quot; and a hypothetical, center-bell-curve &quot;99%er&quot; to illustrate what leads to the massive disparity between the two.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT the Second.. bah bah da daaa!</strong>:  Some people are missing the concept of an &quot;average.&quot;  Several have reported that some definitions have the formal categorization of a &quot;1%er&quot; as only making ~300k/year. </p>
<p>Remember two things:  <em>that is the barest minimum for someone to qualify as the top 1% of earners.</em>  I set up my scenario as an <em>average 1%er.</em>  The individuals in the 1% range from earning 300k per year to 1 billion.  They are a very diverse fraction.  ~1 million is an average. </p>
<p>I am talking about an average <em>for a household</em>.  Some households include two breadwinners.  This may be two executives or high-earners earning 300k each, or 300k and 700k, or some other combination totalling approximately 1 million per year. </p>
<p>And lastly, some seem to be under the impression that I have some animosity for the 1%.  I do not.  They are just people living their lives the best they can.  Some 1%ers do actively lobby or push for legislature that makes the world better for them, and worse for most, but most do not.  They're just people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The 1%&quot; are simply the 1% top earners. As of 2016, that's people earning $300k/year, or above. That's all there is to it.</p>
<p>The reason why &quot;the 1%&quot; cause such an outrage is how quickly income grows at the top of the scale: take a look at <a href="https://dqydj.com/income-percentile-calculator/" target="_blank">this calculator</a> â€” Uncheck the &quot;use logarithmic scale in graph&quot; box and press calculate.</p>
<p>The way you read this is, if you have 100 people, 10 make $10k/year or below, 50 are below $37k/year (so 40 of those 50 are between $10k and $37k a year), then the next 40 are between $37k and $100k a year, etc.</p>
<p>It's a pretty gently sloping curve until around the 90% mark, then it shoots up <em>very</em> fast. The top of the poorest 90% is at $100k/year, but at the 98% mark you're making double that at $200k/year. At the 99% mark, you're making $300k/year.</p>
<p>This inequality between top earners and everybody else has been growing bigger, rather than smaller, over the last few decades, and ties to a lot of social issues that people are very angry about in general.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of ways to measure what puts you in the top 1%. One is income (how much money you make each year from all sources, like your job, savings account interest and capital gains), and the other is net assets (the value of everything you own, like your house, car, stock and bonds, etc... minus all debt that you owe). </p>
<p>A few yeas ago, the New York Times determined that on an income basis, a household earning around $380,000 per year in income is in the top 1% of the US. But on a net worth basis, a household would need to own about $8.4 million in net assets to be in the top 1%. Given the increase in both income and not worth for the upper percentage of wealthy people relative to the lower economic classes in the US, both of those numbers have likely increased since that story was published. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the 1% still still work because they need to. They could be some dual-income families of doctors, lawyers, and other professionals and CEOs, CFOs, or general managers or VPs of large companies.  It could also be a lot of entrepreneurs who own multiple franchises or other businesses. Cost of entry is a $450k.  And it might not be every year.  </p>
<p>Your &quot;really wealthy&quot; individual doesn't need to work, but might because it's so lucrative.  These people would be the 0.1%.  They might include Wall Street types, hedge fund managers, or some top CEOs and extreme inherited wealth.  They're reliably in the top 1% with incomes in excess of $1M.  At this level, it's their assets that are making the money for them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;1%&quot; is a colloquial term that basically means &quot;extremely wealthy person.&quot;</p>
<p>It literally refers to people in the top 1% of income, but the term has shifted pretty rapidly to refer to anyone of extraordinary wealth.</p>
<p>You'd differentiate them from the average wealthy individual pretty much by scale. Nice house? Average. Mansion on a private estate? 1%. Nice portfolio? Average. Portfolio earns enough that they don't have to work and they're <em>still</em> making more than you? 1%. Likes  to take first class when they travel? Average. Private jet? 1%. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
