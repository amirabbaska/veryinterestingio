		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Formers Competitive Powerlifter here- As far as performing a &quot;big lift&quot; goes, i.e. benchpress, deadlift, squat, etc: These movements, more when they are performed with heavy weight for either one or a few reps, require body stability, or &quot;tightness&quot;. When you breathe during a lift, your body shifts, however slightly. This is bad for the end goal of moving the weight.
So for example, the benchpress. A tense body, especially including the core, legs and shoulders, is extremely helpful in moving the weight. A breath will cause these muscles to temporarily loosen, which can be detrimental to the performer being stable. The slightest shift can cause leverages and the lifter's &quot;base&quot; to be much less strong. I myself was taught to take a big gulp of air and hold my breath until the lift was completed.
It should be known, however, that while this method is effective for moving a weight, it is not healthy in the long-run.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Using the valsalva maneuver increases intra-abdominal pressure, stabilizing your core and protecting your spine. This is another major benefit of this technique, especially as you advance in weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yep- a valsava will close the vocal folds, therefore giving you your pelvic floor, diaphragm, and vocal folds for a closed system to increase pressure and therefore build postural stability.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holding the breath braces your body by creating intrabdominal pressure.  The diagram contracts, moving slightly into the abdominal space.  The organs there are shifted and pressed against the lower back and abs.  The abs and lower back contract to counter this pressure.  This creates a sort of hydraulic support inside you.</p>
<p>On a squat, I inhale deeply and start the negative as I begin the hold.  I hit the bottom of the movement and push off.  I then exhale through the &quot;sticking point,&quot; that point where the work begins to get difficult.  I exhale fully and evenly as I push hard.  Exhaling like this adds more tension to the areas that holding the breath tensed and the exhalation increases output.</p>
<p>You need that hold because there gets a point where your body can't support the weight well because the weight is too heavy unless you do.  After a while you'll find you need a belt for very heavy lifts.  A good belt increases the intrabdominal pressure by giving the abs and back something to press against during the hold.</p>
<p>I can do about 50% more reps at higher weights (80% 1RM) with a belt than without the belt.  This is because my primary movers for the squat are outpacing my ability to support the weight in terms of strength.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
