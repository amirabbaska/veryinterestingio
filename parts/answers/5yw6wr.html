		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paramedic here.  In the unfortunate event this happens, we are trained to handle it.</p>
<p>Firstly, remember what most people call &quot;an ambulance driver&quot; is actually a trained medical professional, and in some districts, as trained as the Paramedic in the back of the ambulance. </p>
<p>Secondly, we are trained for the care of more than one critical patient at a time (Mass Casualties, First on scene, etc...). So we can prioritize, multi-task, while waiting on additional resources. </p>
<p>Thirdly, &quot;Protocol&quot; is what tells us how to handle situations. Some services, its strict as hell and says &quot;If <this>, then you have to <do this>&quot; and some services it will say along the lines of &quot;If <This>, consider &lt;this, this, this, or this 'within your scope of practice&gt;&quot;</p>
<p>Now, if I was transporting a critical patient, and we hit a pedestrian while transporting &quot;hot&quot;, we would immediately notify dispatch and local 911 dispatch. If neither my partner, patient, or me were injured... then my partner would initiate care to the wounded pedestrian while I made sure the original patient remained stable, we would have also requested mores units to turn care over to.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two additional ambulances are dispatched, one for each patient. The original ambulance and crew are taken out of service and remain on the scene of the accident pending a police investigation. </p>
<p>Of note... (in most US states) they are also responsible for treating both patients until they are relieved by other arriving medical personnel.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One time I saw an ambulance T-bone another ambulance in the middle of Manhattan, I couldn't believe my eyes. We stood there watching the situation and in this particular case, a third ambulance showed up fairly quickly because the intersection was only a few blocks away from a major hospital (14th st. and 1st ave. for any local readers)</p>
<p>In this case only one of the original ambulances had a patient in it, and it seemed really low-key because he was sitting up and joking with the paramedics as they transferred him to the new ambulance. </p>
<p>Adding a special NYC touch, while this was going on a city bus attempted to steer around the accident scene, hitting and dragging a massive piece of debris down the street for at least a block. The whole scene was a mess, but since no one was in serious danger, it was pretty goddamn hilarious. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know this is totally anecdotal but I was watching one of those Cops-style ride along shows where this exact thing happened. One car crashed into another while trying to clear way for the ambulance and some guy got seriously hurt and they had to stay and help all victims while calling in backup. Dude was freaking out because he had a compound fracture in his arm (totally understandable) and I'll never forget that scene in the show. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
