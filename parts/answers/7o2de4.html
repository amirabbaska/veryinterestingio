		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The nitrogen <em>molecule</em> (N2) is unreactive. Nitrogen compounds can be as reactive as their weakest bonds. A molecule is highly reactive if its bonds can be easily broken and recombined to a more stable molecule. When this happens, this generally liberates energy (heat in most cases). For example, when you burn methane, it combines with oxygen (a highly reactive compound) from air to form water and carbon dioxide.</p>
<p>CH4 + 2 O2 -&gt; 2 H2O + CO2 + heat</p>
<p>Both products are very stable in normal conditions. In specific conditions, however, you may be able to turn carbon dioxide and water back into methane and oxygen, if you provide sufficient energy.</p>
<p>Molecular nitrogen is an extremely stable molecule and you need to spend a considerable amount of energy to break it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>N2 is unreactive, thanks to its triple bond. This means that a lot of energy has to be put in in order to break that bond. Conversely, when that very stable bond is formed, a lot of energy is released. Many explosive compounds involve several double or single bonded nitrogen molecules, because when the compound breaks down and the nitrogen reforms as N2, a bunch of energy is released.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine pushing a ball of a cliff. As it falls, it looses potential energy, and gains momentum as a result of the force of gravity. When it hits the ground, that momentum is converted into other forma of energy, such as a splat sound, or throwing earth around.</p>
<p>Chemical changes work in a very similar way. Only the 'hight' is measured in stability. Because N2 is a very stable molecule where electrons are pretty happy in triple bonds, the 'floor' is very low. If we poke an explosive salt so it starts 'falling' down to N2, it looses chemical potential energy, and gains heat and momentum in the same way, as a result of the electrostatic forces between the atoms.</p>
<p>When something is reactive, its electrons are simply not as happy as they could be. And by happy, we mean unable to move and tied up in bonds, the masochists. </p>
<p>For this reason, anything can be reactive, if it's electrons are made unhappy enough.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason. Di-nitrogen is an extremely stable molecule due to its triple bond. That means it sits at a very low level in terms of the potential energy curve of molecules. Which also means, if you have some other molecule which can undergo a chemical reaction to end up with N2 as a product then you have a much longer way to go from the high energy state (Nitrogen containing molecules) to the low energy state (N2). Additionally, Nitrogen quite readily bonds with Oxygen to form nitrate groups, which also will quite readily bond to the Carbon backbone of organic molecules. This means you can use simple chemical reactions to add nitrate groups (a double potent oxidizer) to organic molecules (the &quot;fuel&quot;) and in that way end up with potent explosives (because they have oxidizer and fuel mixed together at the molecular level, combining them and reacting them might take only femtoseconds).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little off topic but nitrogen is also a very important part of plant chemistry, using its bonds in molecules to get energy. Most plants can't actually &quot;fix&quot; the nitrogen and use a symbiotic relationship the bacteria that can. Nitrogen can make some pretty cool bonds(yes pun intended).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
