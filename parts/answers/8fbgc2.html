		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Family doctor here. We get exposed to all the same stuff anyone who works in customer service does on a daily basis. But unlike a cashier who is having people breathe in their face and hand them germy money, I wash my hands before and after every patient and we wipe the room down between patients, plus we make obviously sick patients wear masks. </p>
<p>Also, most people come to the doctors with a cold when their symptoms are at their peak, which is also around the time that contagiousness is dropping. So by the time I see them, they’ve just finished spreading it around. </p>
<p>Most of the time when I get sick, it’s from my girlfriend who has a kid or one of my coworkers who has kids, because kids are the most efficient ways to spread viruses around. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the nurses and doctors get all the good press, I’d like to share my perspective as a hospital cleaner. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We wash and sanitize constantly. 50 times a day is a reasonable estimate. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use tons of disposable gloves. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hospital rooms get cleaned every day. Nothing has a chance to fester. </p>
</li>
<li>In cases where the patient has a particularly nasty illness there are various levels of protection. </li>
</ol>
<p>For example:
Contact isolation—everyone who comes into the room dons a disposable gown, upon exit the gown is thrown away and you wash your hands before leaving the room.
Contact plus—same as above, except things are cleaned with bleach.
Droplet—gotta wear a mask to enter the room.
Airborne—these ones are intense, for illnesses like tuberculosis. Patient is in a negative pressure room so that when the door opens no illness gets out. To enter need heavy duty mask or powered respirator (you feel like Darth Vader a bit).</p>
<p>But anyway. We really put a whole lot of effort to keeping things clean and protecting both patients and staff.</p>
<p>Edit: thank you for all the Environmental Services love! &lt;3</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>They wash their hands... a lot.</li>
<li>They don't touch people unless they have to. If they do have to, they often wear gloves. Then they wash their hands.</li>
<li>They wear masks when necessary.</li>
<li>They don't touch their face at work.</li>
<li>They get flu shots and other immunizations/vaccines. More than you.</li>
<li>Did I mention they wash their hands a lot?</li>
<li>They change clothes/scrubs if needed during the day.</li>
<li>Most health professionals care about their own health, so they exercise and take care of themselves which boosts their immune system.</li>
<li>They <strong>do</strong> get sick, and that helps them build an immunity to certain infections in the future.</li>
<li>Hospitals/clinics are regularly cleaned to certain standards.</li>
<li>They wash their hands.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been a nurse for 9 years now, and I hardly ever get sick. I wash my hands of course, but when I get home, I take off my shoes at the door and throw my scrubs in the hamper/washer and take a shower before sitting down on furniture. So far it's been working and I've been around all sorts of cooties. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Med student here. I went down with terrible colds on three separate occasions during my pediatrics rotation alone. </p>
<p>Bacterial infections are less probable though because as others have already mentioned, we wash our hands. A lot. There's antiseptic gel dispensers in every corner.  My infectious diseases professor had a small bottle attached to her white coat at all times. I wouldn't be surprised if I found out I have developed a dependency of the smell of Purell. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
