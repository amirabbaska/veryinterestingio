		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the pressure drops, the equilibrium of CO2 dissolved in liquid should favor the atmosphere. That's the opposite of what you are experiencing.</p>
<p>When you moved, is it significantly hotter? Or are your drinks not staying as cool as they were? Higher temps would also make the CO2 favor the atmosphere over being in solution. </p>
<p>Another thing you might consider is that your sense of smell and taste vary, given humidity and altitude. I grew up in high altitude Albuquerque NM, and currently live in Austin TX, which is about sea level. I always feel like soda is &quot;crisper&quot; when I'm in Albuquerque, compared to when I'm in Austin. Same with water. I'd guess it probably has something to do with the difference in humidity, at least in my case.</p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> /u/fraghawk points out that it may be mineral/contamination from water. If you get soda from fountains or use ice, this may be the difference as well. There is a limited amount of stuff you can dissolve in water, so if there are a lot of minerals in the water, it can make the CO2 less soluble as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of a gas that will dissolve can be calculated using henry's law,</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry%27s_law</a></p>
<p>When you open a carbonated beverage it starts to come back to equilibrium, that's why there are bubbles.
Increasing the atmospheric pressure will increase the amount of a gas that will dissolve, decreasing the rate that bubbles form. Decreasing the temperature will also increase the amount of a gas that will dissolve.</p>
<p>This is how carbonated beverages are made, the beverage is passed through an atmosphere of pure CO2 under pressure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since the air pressure things been touched on already by the top comment, wanted to explore another avenue. While pressure might be higher at lower altitudes and theoretically your soda should take longer to go flat, another factor to consider is temperature! For gasses, the solubility actually decreases at higher temperatures! So another thing you might want to look at is purely if where are living now is generally warmer than where you were before. Maybe you are comparing your sodas summer fizz vs your usual winter fizz. Just a thought :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Differential Cola bottlers in different regions will bottle their drinks in different weight packages, you might be in a region where the standard for shelf life is lower thus bottlers will use lighter packaging. Even a couple grams in bottle weight (given the same shape bottle) will have a strong impact to CO2 retention, (and big cost savings for packaging)</p>
<p>Ask a friend in your old area to weigh an empty bottle and compare with the new area, bottle shape/volume has to be the same though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astronaut and general scientific role model Chris Hadfield in fact posted a video that may interest you on this subject. He shook up a can of soda while inhabiting a pressurized chamber on the ocean floor. He approximated the pressure as 2.5 atmospheres. After shaking the can of soda, it did not overflow its can upon opening. The ambient pressure prevented the soda from fizzing vigorously after being violently agitated.</p>
