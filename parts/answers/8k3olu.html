		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;who&quot; has been answered, while the &quot;why&quot; is not entirely answered.</p>
<p>The fact is that the vast majority of photos online are <em>not</em> owned by Getty and do not have their watermarks on them.  However, Getty employs strong techniques to manipulate search engines, making their images appear more often on web searches.  They have also partnered with Google in a licensing agreement starting this year.  They show up disproportionately in web searches, so it can seem like they own almost every photo online.</p>
<p>Getty wants their images to show up frequently in searches because that increases the chances that someone will pay to use the non-watermarked version.</p>
