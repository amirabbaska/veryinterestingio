One interesting thing about evolution, a trait doesn't strictly need to have an evolutionary advantage as long as it doesn't interfere with survival or reproduction. Some traits may just be &quot;harmless accidents&quot; that stuck around because why not? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an advantage to having a standard. That means it gets easier to share tools and cooperate. There is speculation that left handedness evolved for combat, as lefties has an advantage over righties. This is because they will get more experience fighting left vs right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you look at a population there can be traits that stabilise at a ratio of one trait to another. These are called evolutionarily stable strategies. These are easiest to describe and see with things that influence reproduction directly but the principle can apply to less obvious cases.
Let's pick monogamy vs cheating behaviours in males. In a world that was purely monogamous a single cheater would have an enormous evolutionary advantage by impregnating multiple females and never having to bear the costs of raising the offspring, but the offspring would survive because they would be cared for by their partner's mates. In the next generation, the cheaters genes spread faster than the monogamous genes.
In a world full of cheaters, a single monogamous male can guarantee his offspring's survival by helping to raise them in a world where most children are left to fend for themselves. In this case the monogamous genes spread faster than the cheater genes.
These competing pressures mean that it's not possible to have a population of purely monogamous or purely cheating males and the population settles on a relatively stable ratio of the two. Different species will have different ratios based on their particular lifestyle. Some environments favour many offspring, most of which will die, some favour fewer well cared for offspring most of which will survive.</p>
<p>In humans, there seems to be an evolutionarily stable strategy  around handedness that is around 10 righties to 1 lefty. The fact that right is more common is likely a fluke, but now that it is more common, cooperation is easier with others that have the same handedness. Competition is easier if you have the rare handedness. Humans are a social species that, compared to many other animals, value cooperation over competition, and the stable strategy is to have most people right handed, but there are still advantages to be had to being a rare lefty and therefore left handers exist, and will continue to exist, as long as there is occasional physical competition between humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not every trait that appears needs to be advantageous, if it doesn't reduce fitness, and some traits appear because they're connected to other, advantageous ones.</p>
<p>I've heard it postulated that right-handedness' prevalence is related to our very developed speech centers (Broca's area) which is on the left hemisphere, and since the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, humans are predisposed to favor that side.</p>
<p>I don't know how much evidence there is for that hypothesis, though, but it does seem to make sense.  Someone with a deeper knowledge of neuroscience could shed more light, hopefully.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There doesn't seem to be a concrete advantage to &quot;Right handedness&quot; per se, but it does seem that there are some benefits to lateralization. I.e., having portions of your brain specialized for specific tasks in a non-symmetrical way.</p>
<p>Some areas where lateralization are commonly observed include language and tool-use, so it's quite likely there are some important advantages conferred by it.</p>
<p>Interestingly some evidence has suggested that because right-handedness is the default, left-handers have a slight frequency dependent advantage. Basically, as long as left-handers are uncommon, being left-handed can confer a slight advantage in a fight because fighting southpaw would be surprising. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
