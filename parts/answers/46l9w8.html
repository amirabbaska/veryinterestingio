Getting a floppy body to have its weight distributed to your core muscles is hard and this makes balancing difficult and causes you to engage relatively weak muscles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Speaking as a funeral director who has moved 1000s of dead bodies this is my take on it.</p>
<p>The biggest problem with a dead body is the centre of gravity is always changing and as well the weight of the human body is not distributed evenly. This makes it difficult for the average person to move a body.</p>
<p>A body has arms, legs and a head that will constantly move when the body is moved and this changes the centre of gravity. Even on a stretcher there are small movements that you notice. When you move a body on a two man stretcher part of the effort is simply keeping the stretcher level when you move.</p>
<p>With the right equipment it can make the task easier. Stretchers, backboards, straps and sheets are quite handy for moving bodies.</p>
<p>One of the things I observed about homicides is bodies are almost never moved by the person responsible (unlike Hollywood movies). Most bodies are left where they fell. I think this goes to show how difficult it can be to move a dead body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Retired ballet dancer who lifted (living) girls as a career here.</p>
<p>The metaphor I used when working with beginning partners is this:</p>
<p>Imagine picking up a 40 pound dumbell.  Pretty easy.  </p>
<p>Now imagine picking up a 40 pound bag of water.</p>
<p>When you lift the dumbell, you can find the center and lift it from the center.  When you lift the bag of water, the center keeps shifting.  It's also much harder to hold on to.</p>
<p>Same with human bodies.  A partner who is holding her center is easy to lift.  A partner who relaxes shifts around, and is extremely hard to lift.</p>
<p>It's not the weight that changes, it's the leverage.  You get better leverage when working with a rigid body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In wrestling you learn this pretty quickly. When a person is trying to keep their balance (say, 100% of the time when they're awake) they're always trying to keep their hips underneath them, or an arm, or a leg, etc. The effort of trying to keep yourself erect actually stacks your balance vertically on one or two balance points. The person trying to lift simply need get under one or both of the balance points to assume most of the other person's weight rather quickly... over the lifter's own point of balance. Hence why in wrestling if you want to avoid being lifted, you drop your hips out like dead weight. When they're sleepy and floppy, most of the weight stays under you or too far away from you for you to get your balance under the majority of it. That's why it's easiest to stack that person up to a kneeling position and grab under one shoulder for a fireman's carry or something of the like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
