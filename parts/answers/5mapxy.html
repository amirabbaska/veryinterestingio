		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Superconductors do expel magnetic fields, but they distort the outside field in the process (see the middle image in <a href="http://images.iop.org/objects/phw/news/16/3/21/antimagnet1.jpg" target="_blank">this figure</a>). So since the magnetic field is still distorted, I would imagine that the metal detector would go off with just superconductor. However, if you were to put a <a href="http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2012/mar/22/how-to-hide-from-a-magnetic-field" target="_blank">magnetic cloak</a> through a metal detector (in which the 'pushing out' effect of the superconductor is perfectly cancelled out by a ferromagnetic material 'pulling in' the field) you could pass through undetected. However, airport security might still flag you for additional screening if you carry a box of liquid nitrogen through the metal detector.</p>
<p>Edit: As I understand it, the perfect cancellation also assumes a static magnetic field, and I'm not sure how a time dependent field (as is present in many metal detectors) would effect it. <a href="http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9931" target="_blank">This article</a> suggests that its possible in a dynamic field however, you may just have to tweak your cloak to fit the field and frequency range that the metal detector operates at.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, it'd depend on the container. As SC materials require in most cases liquid helium, getting something of that size, shape &amp; composition thru AF security would be a real problem. Likely, have to get some sort of security clearance ahead of time so the point would be moot, in a practical sense.</p>
<p>Otherwise, a simple experiment would settle the question, rather than all of the words being expounded here.</p>
<p>Try it and see using an intact metal detector someplace with the owner's permission, or in a lab which has normally metal detectors in operation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
