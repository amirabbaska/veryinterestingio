		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oncologist here and I'm a bit ashamed I'm not exactly sure off the top of my head but I'm pretty sure the answer is yes.</p>
<p>Main component of blood would be red blood cells (RBC's) (besides you know, water). The amount of RBC production is determined by a lot of things but one of the main ones is oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide from the body. If you need more oxygen, you produce more RBC's. It's one of the ways people adapt to higher altitudes and actually helps compensate for reduced oxygenation in smokers too. </p>
<p>You lose a limb and you lose a whole lot of cells that take up oxygen and release carbon dioxide. Therefore your need for RBC's is diminished. Another way of thinking about it is that when you lose that arm, you also lose all the blood that was in that arm. The rest of your body, with that arm removed is still in balance in terms of oxygenation so it wouldn't see a need to change the amount of RBC's in the body and would keep things as they are. The body doesn't really sense total volumes much. It's not going around saying &quot;this body needs 5L of blood&quot;. All the parameters are concentration gradients, blood pressure, etc. If it made the same amount of blood as it did before, those parameters would be out of wack.  </p>
<p>Your body adjusts the amount of RBC's you need as you grow up and change body size. I would think it'd do the same for amputees.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone else already said, your body has no way of knowing how much blood it has, it just produces enough to reach a required blood pressure and oxygen level for all your organs, so on a basic level the answer would be you would have less blood than before. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The blood is produced to regulate blood pressure. Without a limb the amount of blood to achieve the right pressure is lower, so less blood will be produced. But keep in mind this process take time and might not be perfect so an amputee might have blood pressure problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;The body&quot; only &quot;knows&quot; about its blood through local measures, such as of its composition (e.g. how much/is enough oxygen carried?) or pressure. It has no way of knowing the total volume that there is, or that would be necessary.</p>
<p>So yes, if someone were to loose a limb, the body would adjust... by keeping doing the same thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blood volume is controlled by the kidneys for the most part - the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). It works based on blood’s osmolarity (concentration of fluid/electrolytes in the blood). It’s a little more complex than this, but the RAAS will either lead to holding onto fluid (if there is fluid loss, like with ongoing bleeding) or will excrete more fluid (if there is too much, like immediately after an amputation if no blood was lost). Blood pressure may be elevated at first until the kidneys catch on to the fluid volume overload. At that point, they would increase urination until fluid (blood) volume was back to its normal physiological levels/concentration with respect to the missing limb. </p>
<p>TL;DR: yes, the body will adjust to a new blood volume after an amputation. </p>
<p>Edit: I’m sure there is a more comprehensive way to explain this. But I’m a nurse who works with patients in physical rehab - knee/hip replacements sometimes but many that have had either one or both legs amputated. Typically, they show some signs of fluid volume overload in the day or 2 after surgery (mild edema, increased BP) that gradually go back to their normals within a few days. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
