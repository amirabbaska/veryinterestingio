		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So believe it or not, overall science funding really isn't a major target for cuts.</p>
<p>Science funding as a percentage of discretionary spending in the U.S. Federal government has been pretty stable since the mid 1970s. It's fluctuated a little bit, but has <a href="http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/BudgetDISC%3B.jpg" target="_blank">consistently stayed between about 9 and 13 percent of the federal discretionary budget</a>.</p>
<p>When one sees <a href="http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/DefNon%3B.jpg" target="_blank">declines in real dollars in Federal R&amp;D spending</a> that's really more reflective of declines in the overall federal discretionary budget, or more specifically the military budget. Non-defense R&amp;D  funding has stayed pretty consistent at roughly $70 billion in adjusted 2016 dollars over the last 15 years.</p>
<p>Really the biggest changes you see over the years <a href="http://www.aaas.org/sites/default/files/Disc-1.jpg" target="_blank">are which disciplines get more funding priority</a> rather than more or less science funding overall.</p>
<p>And to everyone who says that science doesn't drive votes, that's not entirely accurate. Some of the staunchest supporters of science funding in congress are the legislators who have national laboratories or spaceflight centers etc. in their districts. All politics is local, even science politics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some pretty good comments here regarding how tangible money spent on science is and the lack of political will to put more money into science.</p>
<p>Another aspect is that science is really expensive. Depending on the level of research being done and the area, projects can cost from thousands of dollars to millions of dollars. A lot of the expense in procuring equipment and materials for labs is the certainty of quality and consistency. From the equipment end of it, even simple things like scales are expensive. This is because while scales are inexpensive, there is a need for a scales to be accurate and reliable. Then on the other end of the scale a project may involve building for example a nuclear reactor. Even buying relatively common chemicals is expensive. While the chemical you need is the same as what could be in a brand of drain cleaner, you are paying for the certainty of purity. All of this is because any uncertainties can sway results quite far and thus make it useless. This expense is very hard to justify when the person pulling the strings has not actually worked in a lab environment. </p>
<p>Not to mention the ethical question of private funding of research and its impact on results. Leading to a preference of academic researchers seeking impartial funding, which usually comes from government bodies but can also come from sources such as charities.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Funding seems to be fodder for political attacks. For example, in the past you may have heard that the federal government spends 2 million dollars studying the sex life of fruit flies. You won't hear that the citrus fruit industry saved billions a year because now sterile male fruit flies are being released and since they only reproduce once in their short lives this has led to a reduction in fruit flies.</p>
<p>More about this here <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_insect_technique?wprov=sfla1" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sterile_insect_technique?wprov=sfla1</a></p>
<p>I'm not saying this is the only reason budgets are cut but it sure doesn't help.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science wins you no votes (at least not many since the biggest part of humanity is stupid and has other priorities like cheaper gas or less taxes on alcohol) or prestige. If you want to lower taxes to please your voters you need the money to come from somewhere so you cut expenses that only affects a minority of your voters. Thus science funding is cut.
The sad reality is, governments do not want, whats best for the people, they want to be voted again and again and again. So they do whatever is best to win voters. Where i live a party actually won 15% with a slogan against science and academics because stupid people liked that they want to cut funding to things they don't understand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a lot easier to cut because the benefits of science (and the arts, and various other things) are much less tangible. Roads are tangible, schools are tangible, national defense is tangible, government jobs are tangible. Research into climate change isn't tangible, space travel itself is tangible but the benefits are much less so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
