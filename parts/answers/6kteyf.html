		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Bretton Woods System. After WWII, at a conference in NH, the US surprised the world by not proclaiming an empire, but instead agreeing to provide free trade, protection, and safe deep water navigation. Understand at the time the US was the only world power. </p>
<p>Perhaps no country has benefited more from the Bretton Woods System than China, but nearly every country that is a part of the system has and continues to benefit in meaningful ways. The US has been required to engage in fruitless wars (e.g. Vietnam) as a result of holding up its end of the agreement. The Persian Gulf wars were derided as the US protecting its oil needs, but in reality this protected the needs of oversees allies. Maintaining this system costs the US dearly, while reducing the costs incurred by other countries.</p>
<p>Without perspective, it seems like the US is overly involved and imperialist, which draws criticism and pleas for the US to reduce its influence and presence. This needs to be filed in the &quot;be careful what you wish for&quot; category.</p>
<p>The US will likely start to withdraw, and no country will benefit more from this than the US. It is likely many other countries will revert to their pre WWII military, political, and trade squabbles with neighboring states and ethnic groups. The US will be a global power without global interests. It is the most defensible land, and most other countries will be too busy with regional fighting. Really, no country in the foreseeable future will have an ability to invade the US. Advances in 3D printing helps to reduce supply chain logistics, and Mexican labor is becoming as cheap as any overseas.</p>
<p>The US dominance in such a scenario doesn't emanate from any superiority of its people, rather its unmatched and unbelievable natural resources. More navigable rivers than the rest of the world combined, more contiguous arable land, more fossil fuels than the rest of the world with fracking, best positioned to withstand even the most dramatic global warming scenarios. These attributes are often overlooked, but their importance cannot be overstated.</p>
<p>Until I researched Bretton Woods, and geopolitics before, during, and after WWII, I vehemently critiqued the US as a global empire, a hegemony, a nefarious, smothering power. Like most opinions I've ever had, the more I research, the more I have to adjust, and, frankly, the more questions and less certainty I walk away with. </p>
<p>A great book on this topic is the Accidental Superpower.</p>
<p>Edit: Thank you for the gold, undeserved. It's a fascinating topic and it's fun to consider different thoughts and perspectives, so thanks to everyone for taking time to share theirs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people are posting various reasons, but I feel it is important to examine the numbers. When you say &quot;such a large amount of its budget on defence and military in relation to other countries in contrast to other departments&quot; - I think you might have been given a misleading set of facts regarding actual military spending by the US.</p>
<p>First of all, despite what all the political memes and 'facts' you hear about on military spending in the US, the reality is this: <a href="http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/year_spending_2016USbn_17bs2n_1000304020#usgs302" target="_blank">in the year 2016</a>, the US government spent $829.7 billion total on defense which includes the Department of Defense and defense-related Department of Energy activities ($604.5 Billion), Department of Veteran's Affairs ($178.8 Billion), foreign aid ($33.3 billion), and so on.</p>
<p>The US Federal Budget, as a whole, was $3,951 billion. Thus, total defense spending was 21.0% of the total US federal budget.</p>
<p>BUT, one big part that the US differs from other countries in the world is that state and local governments have a lot of power, and take in a lot of tax revenue. When we consider TOTAL US Government spending, which totaled $6,773 billion for 2016, that number falls to 12.3%.</p>
<p>In fact, military spending isn't even in the top 3 of total US government spending:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Healthcare - $1,534 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Pensions - $1,388 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Education - $956.7 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Defense - $829.7 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Welfare - $440.9 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How does this compare to other nations? Well, let's compare this to the <a href="http://www.ukpublicspending.co.uk/numbers" target="_blank">UK in 2016</a> where central + local government spending totaled:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Pensions - £158.6 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Healthcare - £146.4 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Welfare - £111.6 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Education - £86.2 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Defense - £47.0 Billion</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As you see, the US and UK aren't far off in the order of priority of government spending. However, as a % of the TOTAL UK budget (£796.7 billion), defense at 6% is half of what the US commits as a total of its budget - which, by the way, is a contentious point in the UK, since critics say their spending cuts have gone too far on defense, to the point where the UK embarrassingly had to call in the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/french-patrol-plane-aids-uk-search-for-russian-submarine-detected-off-scottish-coast-a6744171.html" target="_blank">French</a> and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/mod-asks-for-american-help-in-searching-for-russian-submarine-near-scotland-9966080.html" target="_blank">Americans</a> to help find a Russian submarine in British waters - the very definition of not being able to defend one's own territory!</p>
<p>There's also a catch: the UK is primarily focused on European affairs. The US has <em>simultaneous</em> commitments to both Europe and Asia/Pacific.</p>
<p>In fact here are the <a href="https://www.state.gov/s/l/treaty/collectivedefense/" target="_blank">mutual defense treaties the US is a part of</a> per the State Department:</p>
<ul>
<li>North Atlantic Treaty (NATO) - signed 1949</li>
<li>Agreement Between the United States and Australia and New Zealand (Australia, New Zealand) - signed 1951</li>
<li>Philippine Treaty (Philippines) - signed 1951</li>
<li>Southeast Treaty (Thailand) - signed 1954</li>
<li>Japanese Treaty (Japan) - signed 1960</li>
<li>Republic of Korea Treaty (South Korea) - signed 1953</li>
<li>Rio Treaty (nations in the Americas) - signed 1947</li>
</ul>
<p>And I do mean <strong>simultaneous</strong> treaties - a war between North Korea and South Korea doesn't mean the US is no longer obligated to defend European countries if Russia were to attempt to take advantage of that situation.</p>
<p>As thus, the US has a two-ocean Navy. The US also has to have the means (the aircraft and ships) to actually make good on its commitments across the two vast oceans: after all, what good is a treaty if your forces are stuck at home with no way to get them overseas? If Europe were committed to Japan too, you bet they'd need a larger Navy to make good on that commitment.</p>
<p>Also, when one compares % of military spending by GDP, <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/MS.MIL.XPND.GD.ZS" target="_blank">per the World Bank</a>, the US was at 3.3% of GDP. NATO, meanwhile, recommends its members spend 2.0% of its GDP on defense. So when one considers that the majority of European nations are only focused on Europe only (and occasionally neighboring issues in the Mediterranean), while the US is focused both on Europe and the Pacific and the Americas and yes, the Middle East - suddenly, the US being only 3.3% of GDP (65% more than the 2%) isn't so crazy.</p>
<p>As a side note, before people say &quot;but that's still such a big chunk of the US spending! That's ruining our advances/progress elsewhere!&quot; </p>
<p>I say, take a look at <a href="http://www.usgovernmentspending.com/year_spending_1969USbn_17bs2n_1000304020#usgs302" target="_blank">US spending in 1969</a>, the same year we were knee deep in Vietnam, went to the Moon, had just vastly expanded welfare under the Great Society programs, and even launched ARPAnet - the predecessor of the Internet: defense spending was $94.7 billion of the $183.6 billion federal budget, a giant <strong>51.5%</strong> of US federal spending! (From 1950 to 1970 or so, it was roughly 9-13% of GDP any given year).</p>
<p>Clearly, we've been able to accomplish great things in the past despite spending a magnitude more on defense. In fact, right now, per the <a href="http://www.cfr.org/defense-budget/trends-us-military-spending/p28855" target="_blank">Council on Foreign Relations</a>, US defense spending as a % of its GDP is at its lowest since pre-World War II - i.e., since before the US became a superpower.</p>
<p>Now, the part people say is:</p>
<p><strong>&quot;But the US spends more than the next 7 nation combined! Isn't that outrageous?!&quot;</strong></p>
<p>Except, we need to examine who we are actually spending against and what that money is being spent on.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="http://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/fy2018/fy2018_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf" target="_blank">US DOD Budget Request</a>, roughly 25% of the US base defense budget is spent on JUST personnel wages. When one adds in benefits (like healthcare for active duty members and their families) and what not, the total comes out to close to 50% of the budget.</p>
<p>Why is this a matter?</p>
<p>Well, consider if the US started paying its soldiers Chinese wages - roughly an eighth to a tenth. The US would save $130 billion overnight!</p>
<p>But that tells us little about actual comparative power between the US and China, other than that China doesn't need to spend much on wages.</p>
<p>Also, compare this to developed nations with conscription: <a href="http://www.brownpoliticalreview.org/2013/12/a-dreaded-rite-of-passage-koreas-mandatory-military-service/" target="_blank">South Korean conscripts are paid less than $100 a month</a>.</p>
<p>This difference in wages goes throughout all facets of military spending. For instance, the US primarily buys weapons and arms from domestic manufacturers or nations that are close allies, like Belgium and Germany. China is barred from buying weapons from the US and Europe, for obvious reasons - so they build their own weapons or buy them from nations that will sell to them, like Russia.</p>
<p>End result? US weapons are made in US factories at US wages. Does an F-15E Strike Eagle fighter jet, which was recently sold to the Saudis at $120+ million a jet, mean it is four times better than the Russian equivalent Su-34 which sells around $30 million?</p>
<p>No, you can't use the nominal costs only to compare actual performance and capability.</p>
<p>Cost of living is thus a huge factor in why nominal spending doesn't mean anything when we compare the US to the next highest spending nations.</p>
<p>In fact, that's why when people say &quot;well China only spends about $200 billion on defense&quot; that instead of dismissing China, we should all be concerned: they're getting a LOT more with $200 billion than we do.  And the military and analysts agree: China has rapidly modernized their forces and are far stronger than they appear if one only does a cursory examination of personnel numbers and spending. (On the flip side, Western European nations aren't anywhere near as powerful as what their nominal spending suggests)</p>
<p>The final piece of the puzzle to tie this all together is this:</p>
<p><a href="http://nssarchive.us/" target="_blank">The National Security Strategy</a> of the United States.</p>
<p>Since the Cold War, each successive presidential administration has penned its own National Security Strategy detailing the goals and objectives of its foreign and defense policy. This has a huge weight on the sizing (and thus spending) of the US military.</p>
<p>During the Cold War, the US policy was &quot;win two major wars at the same time&quot; - widely believed to mean beating the Soviet Union in Europe and China/North Korea in Asia.</p>
<p>When the Cold War ended, Clinton revised this to &quot;win-hold-win&quot; - win one major war while holding the line in another war and winning that one decisively after the first war concludes. As a result, the US military downsized rapidly: from 3 million active duty + reserve personnel to 2.25 million. Even its equipment shrank: the US aircraft carrier fleet went from 15 or more any year of the Cold War to retiring carriers which has resulted in the 11 we have today.</p>
<p>Even with changes by W and Obama, the military size has stayed relatively constant, with only changes in focus: the <a href="https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/docs/2015_national_security_strategy.pdf" target="_blank">2015 revision by Obama</a> refocused on Russia and kept the 2009 refocus on China. </p>
<p>In other words? High tech foes were once again the focus, hence the <em>increase</em> in spending on weapons like the F-35, the new Ford-class aircraft carrier, etc. </p>
<p>I can go all day explaining exactly the details on where/why we size our military the way it is (like why the US has exactly 11 aircraft carriers), but I think it's important that people get a context/perspective for our spending, how it reflects our own role/responsibility in the world, and the where/why this spending happens - it certainly isn't randomly put together!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially the United States Military and the attendant industrial complex attached to it has become a giant works program that's basically impossible to dislodge. </p>
<p>Military procurement has led to industries servicing said procurement horizontally spreading their production across as many districts as humanly possible, which means that to ice any program, you'll have a roomful of different representatives/senators screaming about jobs that their districts/states are going to lose.  </p>
<p>And they're not wrong to scream about it, in a way.  The largess that these programs have grown to occupy really do provide higher paying skilled work, many times providing the sole main employer of a geographic area which means that if one were to shut it down it would be catastrophic to that area's economy.  </p>
<p>That's before we start talking about actual military personnel.   The number of people that are actually directly on the DoD payroll is staggering...again, because it is essentially a works program with the patina of patriotism surrounding it.</p>
<p>Our military complex is of a scope that makes the Works Progress Administration from the New Deal look quaint in comparison. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember that money spent on defense isn't being poured down a hole, it provides jobs for people both directly (in the military) and indirectly (contractors etc.). There's Politics involved e.g. congressmen lobby to have military projects in their districts (&quot;pork barrel spending&quot;), since it provides jobs and thus increases their chances of re-election. They wouldn't like to approve anything that would cause a loss of jobs in their districts. So when the White House presents a Federal Budget to Congress for approval, you can bet that every line has been examined for its impact on every Congressional district.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are really a lot of factors involved here.  But first, let me point out: military spending varies from year but is generally less than some other domestic programs, particularly Social Security.</p>
<p>As to the reasons why spending is as high as it is, however:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The US military is actively engaged in warfare in multiple countries on a significant scale, unlike most others.  Saudi Arabia, whose military forces are also engaged in combat, has even higher military spending, as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US military is on the cutting edge of military research and development, meaning it pays much higher development costs than other nations--our allies often receive our technology and hardware at a later date, while our enemies have sometimes managed to steal it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US and its military, through the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and other alliances gurantee and protect the independence and security of much of Europe, allowing European nations in particular to spend less money on defense because the US more than takes up the slack.  While it's true that some allied nations (namely the UK and France) have their own potent nuclear deterrents, and the US could theoretically rely primarily on its nuclear weapons as well, that kind of situation severely limits flexibility.  If one nation were to invade another (such as how Saddam's Iraq invaded Kuwait), the US (and by extension the rest of the world) would be left with the uneviable choice of starting a nuclear war or doing nothing at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The US has global interests, more so than most other nations, both in terms of allied nations as well as citizens and investments in foreign nations, and having the military force to protect these interests is expensive.</p>
</li>
<li>It has been said that you fight a war with the army you have, not the army you want.  As weapon systems become increasing complex and expensive, the development time and expense has skyrocketed.  Ensuring that weapon systems are numerous, up to date, and ready enough to fight a war successfully requires a large military budget.  In WW2, the US was largely unarmed at the outset and was not prepared to fight.  As a result, it took years to defeat the Axis, years during which millions of lives were lost by US friends and allies.  As the pace of warfare has continued to get faster, it is more essential than ever that militaries be ready at a moment's notice.  In combination with the previous points, this results in significant military expense for the US.</li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, in answer to your question about whether the money could be better spent:</p>
<p>I don't think it can be.  The US military safeguards the world's peace.  The fact that there has not been another world war since WW2 is evidence of that, among other things.  All great powers throughout history have had strong militaries to protect their citizens' lives and property.  The minute their militaries fell into decline (for any reason) their neighbors and enemies started to try to figure out ways to take what was theirs.  As the richest nation on earth, the US has much to protect.  Without a strong military and an emphasis on defense, none of the other benefits of civilization can be enjoyed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
