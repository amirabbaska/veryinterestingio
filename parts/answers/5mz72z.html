		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I watched it and figured it out. At 50 second mark he fans through the deck, he's looking at the top cards. He even slows down so he can see the top 3 cards. He then does a few semi false shuffles. The top of the deck is never mixed with the rest and always remains on top. When he splits the deck into 3 piles, the top is put in the middle and that is where he directs the other guy to take his card from. </p>
<p>He already knows he is picking the Ace of hearts, the rest is just showmanship and entertainment. Shuffling doesn't change anything.</p>
<p>After Chris looks through the deck to find the Ace, he moves it to the near bottom of the deck. Probably an even position such as 6th from the bottom. Take note of the card burning. He reveals a card, it's not correct do he deals it to the table and burns a card. The burning is to hind the fact that the card dealt to the table at least once didn't come from the bottom of the deck so the A is now on the table. </p>
<p>The showing of the 4 cards on the table, he shows a card, the 3 of clubs, false deals the Ace onto the table again, and burns the 3 back to the top of the deck. He shows another card. Then the last 2 cards at the same time to help hide that we already saw that 3 earlier. </p>
<p>The last bit is him placing the bottom card firmly in his hand with the top 3 cards loose on top. Slap away the 3 cards and look cool. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is basically the only trick I know :)</p>
<p>He knows by looking through the deck that the ace is Will's card (3rd from top). Where he places it doesn't matter. By fanning though the deck he places the ace at position 3 from bottom</p>
<p>Show bottom card. Deposit shown card to new pile. Burn card to top of deck.
Now ace is position 2. Show card
Using slight of hand slide back position 1 to pull from position 2. Deposit ace from position 2 to the pile (now position 2 on pile)
Burn shown card. </p>
<p>Repeat the sleight of hand on the smaller pile to move ace from position 2 to 1. </p>
<p>Place in hand and hold bottom card (ace). And slap!</p>
