		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as the bullet is concerned, this scenario would be effectively identical to a person standing still (with respect to the ground) and simply dropping the bullet. This example is a straightforward application of the principle of relativity (specifically <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galilean_invariance" target="_blank">Galilean relativity</a>). This principle tells us that in order to calculate the velocity of the bullet relative to the ground (v'), we just need to add up the velocity of the car relative the ground (vi) the velocity of the bullet relative to the gun. We then get v' = vi + -vi = 0, just as we expected. </p>
<p>Therefore, as the bullet exits the barrel it will at first be at complete standstill relative to the ground but then will start falling under the influence of gravity as a body in free-fall. This means that it will stay in the air for t = (2h/g)^(1/2) (where h is the height and g is the gravity of Earth) before it will hit the ground. For example for a starting height of 1m, the bullet would fall for ~0.5s. </p>
<p>Anyway, even if the science in this case is fairly straightforward, I like this example as a way of getting some physical intuition for how kinematics works. Moreover, it makes for a cool demonstration, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLuI118nhzc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=26s" target="_blank">as you can see in this clip from Mythbusters</a>.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bullets don't hang in the air. As soon as they exit the barrel, they are falling to the ground at the same rate as if you just dropped it. If you shot a gun perfectly parallel to a perfectly flat surface at the same time you dropped a bullet, they would hit the ground at the same time. The bullet in your scenario would be spinning like a motherfucker, but it wouldn't hang in air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Picture it this way: instead of the bullet leaving, the gun leaves. The gun is travelling the same speed as the bullet would have. The bullet falls vertically to the ground just like how a gun would if you dropped it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Crnaruka have a good answer and I think answered the question you intended to ask, but in a real-world scenario there are some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/External_ballistics" target="_blank">additional effects</a> you will need to consider once the bullet has left the muzzle of the gun.</p>
<p>The most persuasive of these effects to me is the most obvious:  You're shooting out of the back of a car.  Car's have a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slipstream" target="_blank">slipstream</a> behind them.  This is an area of low pressure that will almost immediately, from the bullet's perspective, become a strong headwind.  Since, relative to the ground, the bullet has no forward momentum, it will actually be swept <em>backwards</em> towards the car before it hits the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
