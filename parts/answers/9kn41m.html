		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although there are plenty of examples of the &quot;nocebo&quot; effect causing adverse events in patients in this thread, I believe what you are interested in is examples where there is a drop in efficacy.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of research recently into the nocebo effect potentially leading to a reduction in efficacy when a patient is switched from a biologic medicine to a biosimilar. There is still some debate as to whether or not this effect actually exists, however there are now a fair few clinical trials for biosimilars which appear to observe a drop in efficacy if a patient thinks they are switching to a potentially inferior medicine in a blinded trial, even if they are kept on the same drug.</p>
<p>This article is a good starting point for reference:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a great question.  Some of the &quot;nocebo&quot; responses are also interesting, but what you are describing is called &quot;expectancy&quot;.  Expectancy is studied in some psychotherapies but is also the basis for &quot;blinding&quot; in studies. Not only do we give you a sugar pill randomly vs the real pill, for example, we don't tell you which is which. The placebo aspect addresses the placebo effect, which is specifically a type of expectancy in doing an action. But the blinding addresses other types of expectancy, positive or negative.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-expectancy_effect" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subject-expectancy_effect</a></p>
<p>We have ample evidence that expectancy, negative or positive, can influence results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting question! I think this is part of the reason why drug studies are usually performed double-blind. Not only does that rule out the placebo effects, but also potential negative effects of making someone think they have a fake medicine are ruled out. </p>
<p>When it comes to psychological disorders, blind treatment is much, much more complicated. Your question reminds me of a friend of mine. She has been battling psychologisch problems for quite some time (including spending four months in a clinic). She has studied psychology and has serious doubts about the effectiveness of some therapies, and - as was to be expected - some of these therapies that she does not believe in were included in her program. She tried to discuss the usefulness of the therapies with her therapists, but according to her, her therapists mostly refused to engage in meta-conversations. The therapies definitely did not have the expected or hoped results. Was that due to her not believing they could work? I don't know. I feel like it definitely does not help if you are unwilling to participate in your own therapy, but who knows... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I often wonder about the inverse of the placebo effect, eg putting dire warnings on cigarette packaging - if the baseline effect of a sugar pill is 30% in a test, does that equate to a similar effect when being constantly told of a risk of a repeated habit in the long term?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
