		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>240 C (464 F).  Match heads are made from red phosphorus and potassium chlorate. When struck, they form a mixture that explodes/ignites.  The red phosphorus will ignite at 260 on its own.  Some other match heads use white phosphorus, which will ignite at room temperature, but they are covered with some material to prevent exposure to water or oxygen.  In that case, the ignition temperature would depend greatly on the specific material used to cover the matchhead</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
