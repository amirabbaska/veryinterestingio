		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're in luck - this year's Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews has a special issue on <a href="http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/vol_12/" target="_blank">animal music perception</a> just for you! All these articles are free, though they are written for a scientific audience so YMMV.</p>
<p>I'll nutshell just a little: different species have different demonstrated abilities for discriminating between different parts of music. For example, songbirds have near-&quot;perfect pitch&quot; when it comes to tone frequency - however, they don't seem to pay attention to relative pitch in the way humans do. Non-songbird species, like pigeons, tend not to do very well on auditory perception tasks, but can be taught to discriminate between chords. There are lots of anecdotes about animals liking music, but few of these withstand scrutiny - one exception being Snowball the parakeet, well-known for his superb sense of rhythm, which is impressive but difficult to reproduce. All of this ends up raising the question, &quot;Why should animals care about music?&quot;</p>
<p>Because what we mean by &quot;music&quot; is &quot;human music&quot;. It's noises made by humans to entertain or otherwise interact with other humans. It has a certain amount of intrinsic value to us, but should that carry over to other animals? And if it has little value, should we expect other animals to react to it similarly or at all?</p>
<p>A colleague of mine did a study with orangutans at a prominent zoo, whose zookeepers insisted on playing loud music because the &quot;orangutans liked it&quot;. My colleague demonstrated that if orangutans were given a choice between different kinds of music or just silence, they chose silence. Of course, the zookeepers still play the music - it was never about the orangs and only about making the humans feel better. This is at the heart of our anthropomorphism of studying nonhuman animals - we are always going to carry our human baggage with us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>More or less related is the study of dance. Cockatoos for example are well-known for moving to the rhythm of music. Here is a paper about it with some discussion on dancing in animals: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215014256" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982215014256</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
