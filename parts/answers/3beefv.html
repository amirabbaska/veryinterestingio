		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As /u/cockOfGibraltar said, our planets formed from a disk of dust. That, however, only <del>begs</del> raises the question why a cloud of dust collapsed into a disk in the first place. The answer to that question is as follows:</p>
<p>Basically, the fact that a bunch of particles held together by gravity form a two dimensional disc is a specialty of three dimensional space.</p>
<p>In 3D, a bunch of molecules has a net angular momentum that is perpendicular to one plane. That means, the cloud - taken as a whole - is spinning in one direction, around one axis. Thus, there has to be one plane to which this axis is perpendicular. This will be our Orbital Plane. Over time, the momentum perpendicular to this plane cancels out, leaving a flat disk behind. As the particles fly around in the cloud, they bump into each other in so called inelastic collisions. When two particles that are flying parallel to the axis of rotation bump into each other, they lose their momentum in this direction. Since the cloud as a whole is spinning, however, it has to keep spinning, since angular momentum is conserved in our universe. That is why, over time, movement along the axis of rotation cancels out, but movement on the plane of rotation is conserved. Hence we end up with a flat, spinning disc. </p>
<p>This is a good thing too, since the solar system and with it the sun and all the planets could not have formed if matter were not condensed into this two dimensional disk.</p>

<p>EDIT: To all the people stating that a five year old wouldn't understand this answer: Please read the side bar. Responses should not be aimed at literal five year olds. I still added a little more text in order to make in more readable, so I hope this clears things up a bit.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: English is not my first language, so please excuse my misuse of the phrase &quot;begging the question&quot;.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
