		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mangoes can cause specific problems, re: developing allergies, because their skins contain urushiol - the same oily substance that causes the hives and rash in poison ivy, oak, and sumac. Mangoes are in the Anacardiaceae family, which is known as the cashew or sumac family. </p>
<p>So when you're getting the chapped lips, it's contact dermatitis. Some of the urushiol has gotten on your lips and they're reacting like you've rubbed poison ivy on them. Urushiol-related contact dermatitis gets worse over time. You might have a very minor reaction at first, but more exposure will lead to greater problems. Some people have greater genetic resistance, but anyone who rubbed mango skins on their lips every day will eventually get this reaction. (If you can't live without mango, you might eventually try small amounts that have been carefully washed and avoid touching the skin. It's possible this can take care of things, but do be careful.)</p>
<p>Other reactions can work in a similar way. Constant exposure to cockroaches - saliva, feces, and shed skin - will lead to an allergic reaction eventually. Cockroach researchers will eventually become allergic to their subjects. They also will become unable to consume pre-ground coffee, since it has offending cockroach particles in it (but too minuscule of an amount to harm the non-triggered).</p>
<p>While it's possible to develop allergies to other foods, such as peanuts and shellfish, it's highly unlikely that you'll do so as an adult. These allergies almost always show up in childhood. (Ways of getting these allergies to lessen in adulthood are being explored, with some initially promising results!)</p>
<p>Tl;dr: It's super unlikely that you'll develop any additional allergy to foods in adulthood. Mangoes and cockroaches are a special case, due to how they trigger the immune system response (which activates every time our bodies see the substances and the response will get more severe upon each exposure). Other allergens could trigger the immune response on accident, but that rarely happens.</p>
<p>Happy new year and happy eating of the other foods!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oral allergy syndrome can be because of pollens or proteins. An allergist can do a skin test to find out what it is that is causing the reaction. I've been developing worsening OAS the last 10 years and can only eat a few fruits without a reaction and that's with taking 4 fexofenafine per day. According to my allergist it's common for adults to develop varying degrees of it usually due to hay fever and the cross-contamination of pollens. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question. After a heart attack, my husband developed a major allergy to anything with potato or anything derived from potato. In our search to understand, we have learned that medications can cause reactions to foods, appearing to be an allergy, or even a major stress on the body like a heart attack can cause your body to start acting differently and react to things like an allergy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
