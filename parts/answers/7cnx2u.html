		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nothing we know <em>needs</em> to be on the list of fundamental laws. The image you posted, by Sean Carroll, is a compact writing of the theories that so far describe just about every observation we've ever made. But this is only an <em>effective theory</em>, meaning it only works below some energy scale. That's the meaning of the &quot;k &lt; Λ&quot; in the integral at the very beginning of the equation - this is only supposed to work for energies (roughly, k) below some &quot;cutoff scale&quot; (Λ) where our laws of physics break down and need to be replaced by something more fundamental. This Λ is probably no larger than the Planck scale, and can potentially be quite a bit smaller. We have, almost by definition, no firm idea of which principles in physics are going to hold at energies far above Λ. It's all open for now, as it should be.</p>
<p>But what if we ignore that point, and just ask about the most fundamental physics that we know of? Then the answer, which is meant to be summed up compactly in that equation, includes a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quantum mechanics</li>
<li>Spacetime and Lorentz invariance</li>
<li>The Standard Model</li>
<li>General relativity</li>
</ul>
<p>The Standard Model can be written in many ways, and the second line of that equation is about as compact a way as you can do it.</p>
<p>You should definitely check out Sean Carroll's discussion of that equation, and how it's meant to summarize all of known physics, <a href="http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/01/04/the-world-of-everyday-experience-in-one-equation/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, your question was:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If I were making a list of the fundamental laws of the universe, what equations, constants, and background knowledge would need to be on it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I think you're missing the point just a little bit. Before we can talk about specific equations and constants, we need an organizing principle for our investigation.</p>
<p>The universal principle that holds for all physical investigations is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action" target="_blank">the principle of stationary action</a>. Wikipedia has a nice single-sentence statement of the principle: &quot;The path taken by the system between times t1 and t2 and configurations q1 and q2 is the one for which the action is stationary (no change) to first order.&quot;</p>
<p>Other laws that seem fundamental (e.g. conservation of energy, thermodynamic laws, etc.) can actually be derived from this.</p>
<p>Things like Planck's constant, the speed of light, Einstein's field equations, and the standard model enter the picture when we consider &quot;configurations q1 and q2&quot;. Those configurations include the positions, momenta, and forces in the system. The full list of all constants and equations necessary for a fully general system is not something I have looked into in any depth, but the equation you included in your question is as good as any that I've seen (even if it does assume a wealth of knowledge about the meanings of those symbols.)</p>
<p>(Note that the principle of stationary action is not a <em>unique</em> foundation for physics. For example, within the domain of classical physics, the principle of stationary action is equivalent to Newton's laws. I prefer the principle of stationary action as a foundation because it is a single statement that is general enough to include everything and specific enough to make useful predictions, but it would be irresponsible to claim that it is the only perspective that we can take.)</p>
<p>TL;DR: If there is a single organizing principle to all of physics, it is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_action" target="_blank">the principle of stationary action</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, you are right.</p>
<p>One needs both general relativity and the standard model to explain things in physics, but a unifying theory is still lacking. As you may know, these theories are not integrated, and some believes that the standard model has to be modified or even replaced by something new in order to explain general relativity from first principles.</p>
<p>The problem with this reasoning (what is fundamental) is that you may never stop. There will always be a new why question. Feynman has already discussed about this problem in here: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp4dpeJVDxs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp4dpeJVDxs</a></p>
<p>But yes, almost everything we know today can be traced back to the standard model and general relativity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Every physical law we have can be reduced to geometrical notions and concepts. We live in a universe that's coherently geometric, which implies we can describe it with simple mathematical relations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One misunderstanding of theoretical physics is that we are working on discovering the 'true fundamental principals' that the universe is built on. On the contrary, theoretical physicists are developing theories that describes the universe in the best way we can.</p>
<p>For example, classical physics theories, Newton, Galileo, etc., work very well in the scale when v &lt;&lt; c (non-relativistic) and x or p &gt;&gt; h (non-quantum). </p>
<p>When the energy/speed scale goes up, special/general relativity are needed to describe the physics better, this involves the <em>Lorentz invariance</em> and <em>General relativity</em> that /u/adamsolomon mentioned. For example, space and time start to 'mess up' with each other and the effect of mass, i.e. gravity, can be equivalently described as the curvature of the space.</p>
<p>When the scale goes down, the <em>uncertainty principal</em> becomes more and more important, conclusions from classical physics views almost completely fail, except for a couple laws of conservation (momentum, energy, angular momentum, etc.). We start to describe the space in complex spaces (Hilbert space) and the particles are described by wavefunctions (the square of which is the probability of the prescence of the particle) instead of tiny solid balls.</p>
<p>But, so far, if I may say there are any principals that feels 'fundamental', they may be the conservation laws, which includes but not just:</p>
<ul>
<li>momentum</li>
<li>energy</li>
<li>angular momentum</li>
<li>charge</li>
</ul>
<p>I never worked in the standard model, so I will not talk too much about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
