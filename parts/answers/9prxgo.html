		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in my Texas County's Elections dept.</p>
<p>Purging of the voter roll is intended to clear out registration accounts for people who have passed/moved away or otherwise become ineligible to vote while still legally residing in the County (felony conviction, usually).</p>
<p>This process is routine by every elections department in the country, and the world if logic prevails.</p>
<p>The problem arises in verifying those various statuses and the mistakes that can arise - or the deliberate manipulation of the process to sway election results, of course.</p>
<p>For deaths, the county coroner's office sends us a list of decedents every month.  When we have a voter match, a letter is sent to the voter's address asking for verification of death by a relative.  If that comes back signed by a close-family member that dead voter is purged from the voter roll.</p>
<p>If the letter comes back to us unopened or otherwise unverified, the letter is sent again and then a third time.  If all 3 letters come back or disappear into the postal aether the voter is purged from the roll as deceased.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Jury Department sends a monthly email of jury service deniers who say they can't serve as they've moved.  The Courts do the same for vote-disqualifying convictions.</p>
<p>All these people are sent an Address Confirmation request where we ask if they've indeed moved.  If voters have moved elsewhere in the County we update their address to keep their ballot relevant to where they're paying their taxes, or purge them from the voter roll if they've indeed moved away or convicted.</p>
<p>If there's no answer to these requests and their successors the voter's account is 'Suspended'.  The voter is still on the roll but we want him/her to verify their residence address at first opportunity, which usually happens the next time the voter votes.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Texas Legislature meets every 2 years, and we send out updated Voter Registration cards to everyone to show any precinct boundary changes that may have occured and to 'ping' the voter they're still on the roll.</p>
<p>If those cards are returned Undeliverable, the voter is Suspended.</p>
<p>Once in Suspense, if there's no further interaction with the voter in any capacity the account is purged from the roll under the assumption the voter's moved away from the County.  This happens 2 Federal-level elections after the Suspension date.</p>
<p>Voters recently purged due to Suspension had to have been put into that state prior to the Congressional election of 2014 <em>and</em> to have had zero interaction whatsoever with their Elections Dept in the meantime.</p>
<p>This is my understanding of how it is done in my County and what TX State law requires of us to comply with Federal law.  I believe this is more-or-less true nationally.</p>
<p>I've been working in my Dept right about 2years now (my first day was 4 days prior to Trump's election) and I do basic data entry of new/updated registrations and front desk CSR, so I may be wrong on some of the details of what coworkers do and I offer up my apologies for any errors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Voter Purge means the Government removes names from the list of eligible voters.</p>
<p>This is necessary in America for a few reasons. First, like other countries, death of a voter means their name should be removed. </p>
<p>Next, moving. In the US each state holds its own elections and since a citizen of the US isn't required to tell a state they moved (only required to tell the new state you moved there), this means if you move and register to vote in the new state you are technically registered to vote twice. This is an artifact of America requiring citizens to register to vote themselves instead of having all citizens registered automatically. So States need to check their voter records against other states to makes sure someone doesn't vote in two states.</p>
<p>Lastly there is Felony Disenfranchisement. In the US if you are convicted of a felony you lose some of your rights. Depending on the State, voting can be one of them and the lose of the right to vote can extend even after you have served your sentence. </p>
<p>The reason Voter Purges have been in the news about America recently is because of a push to combat Voter Fraud. While studies show there is almost no instances of voter fraud, a number of states are trying to add new laws to combat voter fraud. One proposed law is to purge voter records of people who did not vote in the last election or in the last few elections. The counter argument to this is that since in America voting is always held on a Tuesday, during normal work hours, and isn't a holiday, anybody that can't get time off has a hard time voting. So purging the voter registration of someone who has a hard time being able to vote is seen as an attack on those people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;Purging&quot; a voter roll means taking some names off of it because you don't think they belong there. </p>
<p>Some reasons a name might not belong on a voter roll are: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The person moved to another state and you want to make sure they can't vote twice. (Every state has it's own voter roll, so if you were on the rolls for two states you might vote in both of them! Not good.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person has passed away and you want to make sure people can't impersonate the dead to vote twice. </p>
</li>
<li>Someone made a mistake putting the person in the rolls in the first place, and it's a duplicate or a typo or other error. </li>
</ol>
<p>Basically, &quot;purging&quot; the rolls is meant to clean them up and ensure that people can't be sneaky and cast multiple votes. Unfortunately, if you do this very arbitrarily and purge people based on shaky reasoning like saying that a name isn't the same because of a missing hyphen, that can remove people from the voting rolls who really should be on the rolls and make a lot of people angry. Right now, some people are being accused of purging a lot of legitimate voters who would have voted for the party the purgers don't support. This is obviously not how the system is supposed to work and hopefully we can make sure everyone who should be on the rolls is on the rolls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
