		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of theories I've heard. </p>
<p>First violent crime rates in general were much higher back then. </p>
<p>There's a theory that lead based gas in the 40's-50's lead to more cases where children would get lead poisoning and be more violent in the 60's, 70's, and 80's. </p>
<p>Gay sex was much more of a taboo and lead to some violent gay serial killers who didn't have an outlet. John Wayne Gacy and Jeffry Dahmer may have managed a normal life if being gay was more accepted, probably not, but it may have contributed to them becoming killers.</p>
<p>In general it was easier to get away with several murders before you got caught. A lot of serial killer stories you can read about how much the police botch their investigation into these guys. Also it was hard for different law enforcement agencies to communicate, so traveling from state to state killing people made it easy to get away with it. </p>
<p>People were more trusting, hitch hiking was considered a normal form of travel for many years, and often a way serial killers got their victims. Other times serial killers would ask for help moving furniture or something and trap people. Ted Bundy would pretend to have a broken arm and ask women for help moving things. Ed Kemper practiced picking up hitch hikers for months before he actually killed anyone. </p>
<p>There's probably even more factors than that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in those days, the world was far less connected, which made it a lot easier for serial killers to strike and continue killing without people connecting their crimes. DNA was not available yet. We had fingerprints, but there were no connected databases.</p>
<p>In fact, without computers, it was a lot harder for law enforcement to share information between different districts, so it was harder to figure out which crimes were connected to each other. Nowadays, you collect fingerprints at a crime scene, you upload them IAFIS and within half an hour, you know if those fingerprints have ever been entered by any other law enforcement agency in the country either related to an unsolved crime or to a known perpetrator. That sort of thing just... didn't exist at all back in those days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, first of all There ARE serial killers around America nowadays but the media tends to be hush about them. The most recent I can think of is LISK/Gilgo Beach killer (Long Island Serial Killer) who operates in the Long Island/New York area, there hasn't been anything discovered in a few years but police found 10+ bodies in the same dumping grounds killed with similar MO's, he targeted prostitutes in the area. </p>
<p>The other reason is that the world has simply changed. With the internet and telecommunications, gps tracking and forensics and vast databases of criminals it's simply harder to get away with it for long periods of time, which is why we are seeing this turn from &quot;serial killing&quot; to mass shootings, people that may have had their homicidal urges satiated by killing a single person and getting away with in the past now realize the chances of them getting away with even a single murder aren't great, rather than rotting away in prison they commit a mass shooting, lots of serial killers in the past were often obsessed with their own public media image and nowadays a single mass shooting will take up 24 hour news stations for days, making the shooter forever infamous, while a killing of a few prositutes or taxi drivers over the course of months most likely won't even make local news.</p>
<p>There has also been a shift in culture and thinking where &quot;serial killer&quot; has become a bit of an older vague term, is a gang member or drug dealer who kills rivals a serial killer? How about a mujahideen who slaughters villagers and millitary personnel? Or a rapist or burglar who kills victims so they can't speak to the police? Cartel hitmen? People with mental disorders? Paranoid schizophrenics who snap? Religious terrorists? The word &quot;serial killer&quot; has become sort of an outdated term after the whole 60's-80's &quot;serial killer&quot; fad where every news organization wanted their own villian, and even a lot of serial killers of the past would probably lumped into rapists or terrorists nowadays.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I watched a documentary that said it was due to parents having PTSD from war and/or poverty which prevented them teaching things like emotional regulation and empathy properly.</p>
<p>The other theory was that these children were born to parents who did not want them. As abortions were not readily available/socially acceptable they ended up having children who they resented and mistreated in some form.</p>
<p>Mix this with a traumatic event and a genetic predisposition to have mental health problems and you have the perfect recipe for a serial killer (and a criminal in general). </p>
<p>I want to add that there is a heated debate in criminology as to whether or not this is true. Some say that it was simply due to the crimes being reported in a different way compared to today and that there are just as many killers today as there was back then. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also really not glorified in mainstream media the way it once was. I remember as a child you could buy a pack of serial killer cards and it would have a drawing with a brief description. </p>
<p>For a young impressionable mind to see this right next to a pack of baseball cards would definitely send mixed messages. Especially for someone seeking fame without the attributes of a professional sports player or movie star. </p>
<p>There are plenty of other factors that play into the declining rate (mostly security measures plus communication) but this one just kinda sticks in my head because it was geared towards children. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
