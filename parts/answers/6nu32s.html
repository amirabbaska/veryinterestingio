		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a reason  many drugs have such high relapse rates with some, like methamphetamine, having over 90% relapse rates.  The memory of the drug is very powerful.  Not only do you have the reward associated with the drug itself, and its effects on dopamine, but you also have a myriad of &quot;cues&quot; that act as part of the reinforcement of the memory. For instance, drinking alcohol in the bar with your friends can create a reinforcing cue that means watching a TV show (like &quot;How I met your mother&quot; where basically the whole show takes place in a bar) can flood the brain with cues that trigger craving.  This phenomenon is consistent across drugs (e.g. cocaine, opiates, nicotine...) and is known to be mediated by interactions between two specific brain regions (the ventral hippocampus and the nucleus accumbens). In animals cue-induced reinstatement of drug seeking behavior can be manipulated by stimulating or blocking these specific regions.  There are many other brain regions involved, but this is a simple breakdown.  Further, there is good evidence for relatively long-term changes in many brain regions using techniques like functional connectivity analysis with fMRI.  There is also evidence for permanent changes in brain volumes with some drugs like cocaine.   In short, there is quite a bit of evidence for long-term changes in brain structures and networks.  Some of these changes may abate with time but this aspect (i.e. how long it might take) is not as well studied, but in the case of smoking anecdotal evidence suggests that the urge for cigarettes does abate over time.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Something that might help is to drink a shot of grapefruit juice to kinda reset the taste in your mouth and might break the urge/bell. </p>
<p>Also drink tons of or take tons of vitamin c. it scrubs nicotine out of the system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
