Get a bucket fill it half way with water , now spin it around from floor to over head to floor quite fast , as if it was connected to the big hand of a clock ,. The force /speed pushers the water to the bottom of the bucket , no matter if it's upsidedown or not , </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That is exactly how artificial gravity works. When you are going around in a circle, you are constantly wanting to keep going straight. That creates a force which pushes you away from the center of the circle, making it so the outside of that circle is effectively down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you are revolving in a circle you are constantly being forced out of that circle because of the way you are moving.</p>
<p>This pushes you against the whatever surface is outward from the center of the circle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>The reason you are having trouble grasping it is because I don't see anyone describing the required contact with the spinning surface to make it work.  If you were in space, and at the center of that spinning thing, nothing would drag you down to the &quot;floor&quot;.  However, if you had contact with the capsule, that's where the force is imparted on you.  You need to also be moving in that spin to feel the force being imparted.  Size of the spinning room will also matter.  Too small and it would feel awkward because the angle of the spin would be too high to feel comfortable.  It would also need to be under zero acceleration so that wasn't added as a different angle force.  </p>
<p>So the real takeaway is, it isn't artificial gravity like the movies.  There they flip a switch and you are dragged to the floor.  But for this to work, you need contact with whatever is spinning to feel it.  And then the other examples make sense.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
