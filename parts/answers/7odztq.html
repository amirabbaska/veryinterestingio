		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Courts:</p>
<p>In many courts they are not permitted. This is true in the U.S. It's not so much that they &quot;don't work&quot; as they are not reliable enough to constitute &quot;evidence&quot;.</p>
<hr />
<p>Law Enforcement:</p>
<p>Many people don't know that they are unreliable. So they are used to &quot;raise the stakes&quot; on a suspect being questioned. They are more likely to answer truthfully if they believe their lies will be identified by the machine.</p>
<p>They can also use it to question your answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Was Steve there with you?</li>
<li>No.</li>
<li>
<Looks at polygraph analyst>
</li>
<li>
<Analyst shakes his head disapprovingly>
</li>
<li>Are you sure? Because if you lie to us that's falsifying information? I'll ask one more time, was Steve there with you?</li>
<li>I don't know, I think I saw him, yeah I must have. Yes.</li>
</ul>
<p>And human memory is a funny thing. You never remember events. you remember the last time you remembered that event. And each time it may distort just a little bit.</p>
<p>Also it's used in hiring decisions. &quot;We don't have a good reason to deny this candidate but he's giving off bad vibes. Let's just say we didn't like his polygraph.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They aren’t typically used in criminal cases, because they are not effective.  They are still popular during the hiring process for government and law enforcement jobs but it’s more so to trick applicants into not sticking to their story, catch them in inconsistencies and lies.  Understanding and preparing for the test can be more effective than telling the truth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're typically not admissible in court (at least in Canada and the US), as it is up to the trier of fact (e.g. the judge or jury) to ultimately decide whether a person is telling the truth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They aren't universally accepted in courts (which courts? There are lots of courts in the world, and even in a single country like the US, there can be a wide variety of laws and accepted applications), or universally used by law enforcement.</p>
<p>However, even If you accept that they don't work, not everyone is aware of this, and they can serve (as an example), as a useful bluff in interrogation. A nervous criminal is not necessarily a good liar. A fearful one may not stick to a story. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
