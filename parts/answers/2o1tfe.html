		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer as a former RA (resident assistant).  As an RA the university wanted us to act as a liaison between the students and the university.  Thus if a student came to us reported that they were sexually assaulted, we were required to allow the student to determine the course of action, BUT we were required to report that an assault had occurred.  </p>
<p>Basically, we were required to leave it up to the student.  &quot;Do you want to report this to the police?&quot;  &quot;Do you want to report this to university authorities?&quot;  &quot;Do you not want to report and need someone to talk to?&quot;  We wanted to leave the power in the students hands as to whether they wanted to pursue the matter legally.  When a student is sexually assaulted, their decision process was taken away in the assault.  We needed to let the victims choose the course of action.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm from Sweden. I sincerely experience anguish everytime people belittle and mock the US and americans in particular, unable too see all the things silly about our country. This occurs rather often btw. People love to do it. (On a side note this goes both ways btw, uninformed or even disinformed americans making fun of socialist countries are also in the wrong)</p>
<p>Yet I am apaulled by some of the things going on over there. Although we are just about the most infected country in the world by the feminazi movement, people would never accept it should we step away from innocent until proven guilty, by reasonable doubt. I hope. I realize as I'm writing this that there's actually lots government officials saying it needs to be easier to prosecute rapists etc.</p>
<p>As a disclaimer I want to add that I, of course, as much as the next guy don't want sex offenders to go unpunished. It's a sad truth that it's a difficult crime to prove a lot of times, but it CAN NEVER BE at the expense of legal security.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work as a faculty member in a large state University system, but not at the flagship. This is beginning to cause a real problem on campuses. </p>
<p>Basically, being accused of sexual assault is a violation of student handbook of conduct as well as Federal Regulations. Under the second term of President Obama, the Justice Department began closely monitoring how universities deal with accusations of sexual assault on campus. They also implied that federal loan funds could be banned from campuses that don't take accusations seriously. I am aware of several schools where this was a problem, but by and large, the two universities I have worked at did not have these problems. If an accusation was made officials gave a good faith effort to gather as much information as possible and make tough decisions regarding discipline. </p>
<p>However, at both universities, violations of the student handbook and federal regulations are heard by a university hearing officer. At my current university, a university hearing officer can be a tenured or tenure track faculty or certain administrative staff. If it is administrative staff they have to work for the university for a length of time at a certain level. So, a departmental secretary would never become a university hearing officer, but Director of the office of continuing education would be appropriate. </p>
<p>As a university hearing officer, you have no real formal training regarding evidence or other legal doctrines. So for the most part, we feel unprepared. But, because of privacy concerns the university hearing officer may not or cannot discuss anything about the case. Undoubtedly, no matter what gender or discipline or life experiences saddle us with biases; some known and some unknown. </p>
<p>The problem is that in the cases I was involved in, there was little clarity about the events. Usually, both parties scenarios are absolutely plausible. Credible witnesses are scarce and the participants testimony is sometimes foggy because the alleged actions occur late at night and usually with consumption of alcohol. </p>
<p>But, the gravity of the decision reached is staggering. If you reach the conclusion that nothing improper occurred and you are wrong, you have crushed confidence in the university believing sexual misconduct allegations. Additionally, if someone at DOJ thinks you didn't take enough time or effort in reaching a conclusion, bad things may happen to the university. But, if you reach the conclusion that there was sexual misconduct and there wasn't, you have probably ended a student's academic career unfairly and unjustly. But more than that, probably put the university in the sights of a multimillion dollar lawsuit. Even more, as much as I like the University I teach at, I am unsure the university system lawyers would protect me. </p>
<p>I understand that some will say that there are few cases of false accusations. As an empirical matter this may be true, but I can't say well in the large majority it doesn't happen, so in this case it couldn't happen. My personal beliefs about false accusations can't be a determining factor in the individual cases. </p>
<p>It is a horrible situation to be in and I don't know what can be done to fix it. </p>
<p>Sorry for the wall of text. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They typically are handled by both. </p>
<p>If someone reports a rape to the police, and the suspect is a student, there will usually be two separate investigations or trials.  One will be done by the police, go through the criminal courts....etc.</p>
<p>During the same time, the university may also run an investigation into any &quot;honor code&quot; or student conduct violations.  Most universities have some sort of a student code of conduct that you agree to.  So maybe the court will find you not guilty, but the school will.  Or vice-versa.  Same with punishments, the school may be more or less harsh than the courts (expulsion from the school vs probation by the courts).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
