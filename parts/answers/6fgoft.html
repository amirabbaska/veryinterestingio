		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What makes profanity different is that it invokes a different part of our brain than our normal speech uses. The part of the brain that controls aggression is called the amygdala which also controls other emotions. So one theory is that profanity is a type of verbal aggression, and our brain recognizes them as such, causing us to feel differently when we hear or think them. There's nothing about the words themselves that makes them different, it's how we associate these words as being aggressive or in some other ways taboo.</p>
<p>This can explain why certain illnesses that affect the brain can cause some individuals to swear more than they would if they didn't have the illness. Invoking this part of our brain can be done with profanity. For example when he hurt ourselves, we often yell profanity as an outlet of aggression which has pain-reliving applications. This is probably due to an evolutionary benefit of being in an aggressive state of mind when you feel pain, as it will help empower you to defend yourself if you are under attack.</p>
<p>That's not to say profanity is always used as aggression, such as the way we use it to emphasize things. Since these words can invoke the amygdala, it can alter how we perceive a statement when he hear it with profanity that causes us to emphasize the meaning of that statement. This is probably why the F-Word is used so often in casual speech, it literally alters the way our brain handles words. Also the more you use profanity, the more your brain will be comfortable with profanity, and will invoke less emotion when you say or hear it than you would if you don't speak with profanity on a regular basis.</p>
<p>The tabooness of the profanity is due to the emotional charge these words are associated with. Our societies decided to make these emotionally charged words taboo as to avoid invoking negative feelings. Once a word becomes taboo, there's societal pressure to avoid using the word, so really it's compounding our instinct to avoid using profanity in certain situations where you would normally avoid taboo subjects. This explains why we might refrain from using profanity at work, but might use it a lot when we are with our personal friends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bad words are bad on purpose, by design.</p>
<p>Since humans sometimes want to offend others, it's useful to have words that have the offensiveness built into the word itself.</p>
<p>Why is &quot;poop&quot; not a bad word but &quot;shit&quot; is?  They both have the same denotation, but different connotations.  That's on purpose.  We may need to talk about the subject with a child (&quot;poop&quot;) or a doctor (&quot;feces,&quot; &quot;stool&quot;) or I may want to compare someone to something disgusting in which case I use the word &quot;shit&quot; because that way it's obvious I'm being crude.</p>
<p>Naturally the bad words tend to refer to things that are disgusting (bodily functions), or formerly considered extremely private (sex), or else something someone should be respectful about (religion).</p>
<p>If you have used classic swears so much they seems just like normal words to you, then perhaps you understand racial epithets better?</p>
<p>Can I talk about &quot;Former President Barack Obama, our first nigger President&quot; without being offensive?  &quot;Oh, I wasn't <em>trying</em> to be offensive&quot; I could claim.</p>
<p>A. you don't have to intend it, the offense is part of the word itself (not the sounds, but the definition in common English</p>
<p>B. Since you <em>KNOW</em> (or should know) point A, you're lying or stupid if you say such a thing and act like people shouldn't have been offended because you &quot;didn't mean it.&quot;</p>
<p>What do you think the word &quot;nigger&quot; means?  It does not mean &quot;black person.&quot;  It means something more like &quot;offensive word used to dehumanize black people.&quot;</p>
<p>Racists that use the word know what they're doing.  Why are they using that word instead of &quot;black&quot; or &quot;African American&quot; or something else?  Because it means something else.  It's not a synonym for &quot;black.&quot;</p>
<p>Likewise, &quot;shit&quot; is not a synonym for &quot;poop.&quot;  They're not the same thing, even though they both refer to the same physical substance.</p>
<p>By the way, many adults consider swearing to be quite rude regardless of whether there are children present.  The number of them have gone down, I'm sure, or at least the ones that will speak up has gone down.</p>
<p>But if you swear in public in front of people you don't know approve of swearing, that makes you a dick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not so much that they &quot;developed&quot; a taboo, as that they were intended from the outset to be crude, vulgar, shocking, or offensive. This has probably been the case throughout human language history;  linguistic studies of ancient cultures shows that they had these types of words and expressions </p>
<p>These words have always referred to things that were considered taboo, private, or not usually discussed in polite company: religious blasphemy, sex and sexual organs, bodily waste, etc. In olden times, it was likely that the blasphemy/religious swearing was considered more &quot;shocking', as you were literally damning God or calling a curse down on someone. Nowadays, this stuff is much less offensive, so it tends to be the sexual-based terms that are considered the 'worst'.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The modern version of English swear words, the ones where some words are taboo while others with similar meanings are not, developed during the middle ages (IIRC).  It had to do with the nobility/commoner divide.  Words like &quot;defecate&quot; have latin origins - the nobility and clergy were generally educated in latin.  Words like &quot;shit&quot; have germanic origins, spoken by the commoners.  </p>
<p>So the words the nobility used inherited the sense of being proper/polite/pious, while the commoner versions inherited the sense of being rude/vulgar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Swear words reflect our culture's values. They make light of things we consider precious. </p>
<p>Right now, the words that will make people cringe the most are going to be words mocking the disabled and non-whites. Since the civil rights era, we place way more value on diversity and inclusion than before.</p>
<p>Recently, words that alluded to bodily functions (sex, going to the bathroom) were the most taboo. Early 20th century America was kind of obsessed with hygiene and purity (Victorian morals, naturalist ideals).</p>
<p>A while ago, talking about bodily functions was totally ok, but saying something like &quot;zounds&quot; (short for &quot;god's wounds&quot;) was totally taboo, because blasphemy was a bigger deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
