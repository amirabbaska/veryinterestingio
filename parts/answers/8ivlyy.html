		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The above explanations are very good, and so to add an interesting example of where pi appears in interesting places, one of the earliest forms of the Monte Carlo method, which is a VERY popular method of numerical approximation using computers, was an experiment ran by Pierre Simon Laplace.</p>
<p>He used a version of an earlier experiment by George Louis Leclerc and by dropping needles at ruled paper he found that the total needles thrown divided by the number of needles intersecting the ruled lines was a multiple of pi ( he predicted this would happen based on the equation, but it was still an interesting discovery).</p>
<p>I believe there was a semi-famous soldier who conducted this experiment while he was injured during the war, but I don't remember the exact details, this is based on an undergrad presentation I did a while ago and I already forget the details.</p>
<p>Try it yourself: Use ruled paper and a needle where the length of the needle is half (or as close to half as possible) of the distance between the ruled lines on the paper, and then start dropping the needle on the paper and keeping track of the total number of drops and the number of times it intersected. After a while, grab a calculator and divide the total drops by the number of intersections. The longer you do this the closer to pi you'll get.</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
<p>Alot of people asked for the GitHub repository, here it is:</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/pnadon/PresentationExamples" target="_blank">https://github.com/pnadon/PresentationExamples</a></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the actual methods are in the PresentationExamples file, the first being the standard buffon's needle simulation, the second being the same with the exception of not using cos or pi, and the third is an example of Monte Carlo integration.</p>
</li>
<li>main basically gives you the option of which to run, and then automatically prints out the time taken to run the simulations, the result, and the standard deviation.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pi represents the ratio between the length around a circle and the length across it (circumference = pi x diameter). It is a fundamental property of all circles in Euclidean or flat geometry.</p>
<p><em>I.e. if you walk all the way around a circle, you have to go pi times as far as if you walked straight across it, for any and all circles.</em></p>
<p>As for why it appears so often all over maths and physics; it is to do with circles, and circles appear all over the place. Anything cyclical (that loops), anything that rotates. That then gets us into exponentials (particularly complex exponentials) so anything relating to them may have a pi cropping up every so often.</p>
<p>Pretty much wherever it does appear you can trace it back to circles.</p>
<p>In decimal notation pi happens to be 3 and a bit. It is irrational (cannot be written as a fraction) and transcendental (cannot be written as the solution to an integer algebraic expression). But there's no particular reason why those should be special. Pi could be 3, or 4, or any number - it just happens to be 3 and a bit in our universe.</p>
<p>As for it being special, it is worth noting that pi itself isn't the only option. There is a <a href="https://tauday.com/tau-manifesto" target="_blank">movement to replace pi with tau</a>, where tau = 2 x pi.</p>
<p>Tau is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its <em>radius</em>, rather than its diameter. And there are some reasonable justifications for preferring it (although personally I remain unconvinced; I think the factor of 2 is fairly important in some places, particularly in Euler's identity).</p>
<p>Historically the concept of pi (or the idea that there is a relationship between circles' circumferences and diameters) has been around for a very long time. Probably older than we have records for. Calculating its value is a bit trickier, as our modern decimal system is relatively recent; pre-medieval mathematicians didn't have the tools to express pi in detail.</p>
<p>Notably the Bible appears to claim that Pi is 3 (indirectly) in 1 Kings 7:23 (although understandable in context; it does prove that the Bible isn't 100% literally true). Also worth noting is an infamous Bill put to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana_Pi_Bill" target="_blank">Indiana General Assembly in 1897</a> - while its aim was to put into law a (flawed) mathematical proof, it would have had the effect of legally defining Pi to be something other than it is (such as 3.2). The bill passed the Indiana House of Representatives (who seem not to have understood it), but was narrowly rejected by the Senate due to the intervention of a mathematics professor who happened to be there to help with an annual science funding matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see everyone getting fixated on circles but Pi is really the relationship between linear and angular space. </p>
<p>It just turns out that these different spatial concepts are related by an irrational number!  </p>
<p>More importantly, 3.14 is not particularly special either, as we see different ratios of Pi in all sorts of physics and math, and we could have defined Pi to equal any of those instead. </p>
<p>So sure, 3.14 relates circles and diameters, but 12.56 (4Pi) shows up in forces (Electromagnetic and Gravity), 6.14 in pendulum dynamics, and 1.57 (1/2 Pi) in complex (imaginary) maths, as well as many other forms (sqrt(Pi), Pi*Pi, etc).  </p>
<p>My point is that none of the numbers themselves are special, but that this specific irrationalness ratio is what is special. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
