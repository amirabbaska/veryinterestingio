<p>The point being they are all written documentation of a crime. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>i am a lawyer and will take a stab at this (although i am not a criminal lawyer or even a litigator). everyone let me know if i get something wrong.</p>
<p>a written document (such as a diary) written voluntarily is not &quot;testimony&quot;, it's &quot;evidence&quot;. testimony is when you talk in court or to the authorities, and are cross-examined. if you are forced to do this, they are forcing you to testify against yourself.</p>
<p>a diary is evidence just as much as a gun they found in your house. the right not to be forced to testify against yourself is more usefully understood as a &quot;right to silence&quot;. otherwise, would the court not be able to consider your bank records or phone records or a tape recording of you talking to an undercover agent?</p>
<p>the admission of a diary DOES potentially violate the rule against &quot;hearsay&quot; which states that out of court statements (whether oral or written) are not admissible for the truth of their contents.</p>
<p>generally speaking, statements made by the defendant ARE admissible for the truth of their contents. they fall into an exception to the hearsay rule. if the statements are not true, the defendant can waive his right to silence and tell the truth.</p>

<p>If you've already written it down, voluntarily, then you weren't forced to testify against yourself. At that point it's just evidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
