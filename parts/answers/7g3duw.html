<p>If you mean element, probably not, as the majority of elements have been discovered and those that haven't have been theorised (i.e the periodic table). </p>
<p>However a unique alloy or composition of elements with a unique structure that we haven't seen before is definitely possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are incredibly scarce elements on Earth, like Iridium, that are more common in meteors/asteroids.  </p>
<p>Fun (not so fun) fact.  Iridium rich (relatively) layers of clay are geological &quot;boundaries&quot;.  They are maker beds that denote theoretical asteroid impacts, like those that caused massive species extinctions.  One you may have heard of is the K-Pg (Cretaceous–Paleogene) boundary, formerly known as K-T (Cretaceous–Tertiary), and is the hypothetical marker of the &quot;dinosaur killer&quot; asteroid that smashed into the Yucatan Peninsula ~66 million years ago.</p>
<p>Edit: I should correct myself and stipulate &quot;scarce elements on the Earth's <strong>crust</strong>,&quot;.  We have a good idea of the composition of the mantle and core, but for such small trace elements I wouldn't want to speculate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other people have said, it would be more likely to find new materials as in alloys or crystalline structures or molecules that can occur under conditions not seen on earth than to discover a new element. Since elements are defined by the number of protons and we do not currently have any gaps in out list of elements, and all elements created in labs with higher atomic numbers than those elements found naturally are unstable and decay very quickly it's unlikely we would find these on Asteroids. There is, however, and theoretical 'Island of Stability' that exist beyond the elements we've created in the lab. As of now it's only a theory, and there is no known mechanism in the universe that could create them. But it's at least <em>theoretically</em> possible that some unknown cosmological event created them and they are floating around on an asteroid somewhere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really.
The reason being that we know pretty much all the chemical elements.
There cannot be any unknown elements in between.
Since the solar system all came from the same dust cloud it is also very unlikely that there would be an asteroid with an element we have not yet seen.
There could, however, be asteroids from other solar systems that we come across (there just was some media attention about such an object).
We could expect this asteroid to have a different composition from our native ones, but it wouldn't have any unknown elements.</p>
<p>Edit: Sure we could find alloys that are not present on our asteroids. The ratio of Iron to Nickel (just something i made up) would be different, but that's not in my book a new unknown material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Elements are defined as atomic level substances. Example: Hydrogen is a single atom with a single electron. We've mapped out the possible atomic combinations in the periodic table which lists elements by electron count. So while anything is possible, it is highly unlikely. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
