		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oil doesn't exist underground in caverns that would otherwise be empty if it wasn't for the oil. Instead of thinking of large empty pockets, think of a wet sponge, where the sponge is rock and it's &quot;wet&quot; with oil. </p>
<p>But also remember that the oil and gas held underground is under great pressure. It is this pressure that allows the oil to be extracted, but when the pressure is relieved by removing the oil these smaller pockets don't necessarily remain empty, as they're often filled water seeping in from the surrounding rock. And even when they are not filled back in with water from surrounding rock, oil extraction often leaves about 13% porosity, which is about the same as modern concrete. </p>
<p>And it's not just water that can remain in the well: when an oil well is considered spent, and no more oil can be extracted (using traditional techniques), there may remain as much as 90% of the original deposit left in the ground. Because of the large amount of oil that can be left in an otherwise &quot;spent&quot; well, there are techniques for getting out more of the oil, which involves pumping fluids (mostly water) into the well, increasing the pressure and allowing more oil to be extracted. But this obviously displaces oil with water, and so the &quot;wet sponge&quot; never really dries out. </p>
<p>So while oil extraction often leaves a well less dense than it was to begin with, it's not a whole lot less dense...it's still mostly rock all the way down!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A different view point is that your reservoir is made of sand between 2 clay layers (impermeable). The gas/oil fills the pore space in between the sand. But if you look at what is holding the top clay layer up it is a combination of the sand particles and the pressure from the gas/oil.</p>
<p>As you produce gas/oil the stress to support the top layer of clay shifts over more and more to just the sand. Sometimes the sand cannot support this stress and starts to fracture at the individual particle level and compact.</p>
<p>You can have subsidence because your jar of marbles becomes a jar of crushed marbles.</p>
<p>Recovery % and other factors vary wildly. Some reservoirs do have meaningful aquifer support but because of the size, you may not know for 10+ years - and can crush the matrix during the time in between.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An &quot;oil well&quot; is the hole we drill into the ground. The actual area underground with oil in it is called &quot;reservoir&quot;.</p>
<p>In reservoir engineering, there is a concept called &quot;material balance&quot;. The space that the extracted oil took up has to be replaced by something else. This can include</p>
<ul>
<li>the remaining oil in the reservoir expanding</li>
<li>the gas in the reservoir expanding</li>
<li>the actual rock holding the oil to expand</li>
<li>water in the reservoir expanding</li>
<li>water from outside entering the reservoir</li>
<li>or even water/gas you inject into the reservoir yourself (this essentially forces oil out of the reservoir)</li>
</ul>
<p>Voids are never created when producing oil from the ground.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different methods in place to make sure this doesn't  happen. So sometimes what happens is that you have injection wells located a bit aways from your producing well (oil) that will inject water to help push the oil out easier and the water will prevent any overburden pressure from collapsing. Essentially you're just replacing the oil with water to try and preserve the rock. Also once your oil well starts producing all water, you know you've basically gotten all of the oil. </p>
