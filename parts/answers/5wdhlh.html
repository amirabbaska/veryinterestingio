		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you're 'overriding' the automatic system in your brains that regulates your breathing pattern. Breathing has 2 components: autonomic control and plain physics. The autonomic control center regulates your breathing frequency/intensity depending on CO2 levels in your blood by stimulating your breathing muscles in a very efficient way, taking maximum advantage of the physics of airflow. When you're breathing manually, you interrupt the respiratory center and you have to force the breathing muscles to contract by yourself</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can split up all the things a person can do in to two groups, things that happen unconsciously no matter what, and thing you can <a href="http://www.definitionmining.com/2017/01/probable-facts-about-human-consciousness.html" target="_blank">choose to override consciously</a>. Things like your heart beat, your internal temp and dozens of other things are always out of conscious control, they're going to happen no matter what. Then there's things that you can do - walk, talk, even drive a car, that you mostly do without thinking about it, but you can override by consciously thinking about it. Breathing is one of these things, it'll happen unconsciously if you don't think about it, but it's technically possible to stop yourself breathing long enough to pass out. Of course you'll start breathing again as soon as you're unconscious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
