		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One risk of sending letters through paper envelopes is that someone could hold the letter to a bright light to decipher what is written on the letter inside. By introducing a pattern of darker lines (the diamonds), most of the light that would pass through is absorbed, and helps obscure the contents of the envelope, meaning it can't be snooped on without some indication that the envelope was opened. Besides just obscuring lettering, it can help obscure the contents, such as if there is cash or some important card inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

There have been several cases of thieving neighbours and even postal workers who have stolen cash and cheques because they could see it through the envelopes. The new envelopes prevent most of the risks associated with that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
