		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best source I've ever been able to track down on this question is <a href="http://www.sae.org/events/aars/presentations/2004-hill.pdf" target="_blank">this powerpoint presentation</a> that was made by the Society of Automotive Engineers and GM. It isn't exactly publication quality (note the affect/effect mistake right in the title), but they actually tested various speeds and temperatures on 2 real vehicles, an SUV and a car.</p>
<p>The counterintuitive result is that AC is <strong>always worse</strong> than rolling down your windows, no matter the speed. This is summarized in the two figures at the end of the presentation, which show measurements on a racetrack at speeds of 50, 80, and 110 kph (31, 50, and 68 mph). This was true for both the SUV and the sedan. In fact, for the SUV, the penalty for using AC was higher at highway speeds.</p>
<p>There are plenty of people on the internet making the intuitive argument you made - that at low speeds windows win but at high speeds AC wins. I used to believe that too. What is wrong with the argument? Here we have to make some guesses because the report only gives the measurements. For a car we would expect drag to increase roughly with the square of velocity, but roughly is key here. The change in drag for moving from closed to open windows will be sensitive to any deviations from that, and the measurement suggests it creates something like a flat increase in drag over the range of speeds tested. Also, keep in mind engine efficiency isn't linear either - it tends to <a href="http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/sites/www.nrcan.gc.ca/files/oee/images/ecoenergy/driving/avoid_high_speed.jpg" target="_blank">peak at moderate speeds and decrease at highway speeds</a>. Adding the strain of powering the AC to an engine moving at highway speeds can push the engine into an even less efficient regime, amplifying the cost. That seems to be the case for the SUV.</p>
<p>It would be great to find a better source with a clearer explanation of methods in it. And the numbers might be different for hybrid or electric vehicles. But for now, this is the best source I am aware of. And the SAE is a professional organization that produces many of the standards used in the automotive industry, so we can be reasonably sure they know how to set up these tests.</p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> u/ron_leflore flagged <a href="http://papers.sae.org/2013-01-0551/" target="_blank">this study</a>, also by the SAE. I can't get access to the data, but according to the abstract they found the same result as the other study for a 2009 Ford Explorer (AC is worse at all speeds tested). But they also found that a 2009 Toyota Corolla had an inversion point at 75 mph. So for some cars there apparently is a region where AC wins, though only at very high speeds.</p>
<p><strong>edit 2:</strong> Just to flesh out the argument above a bit, we expect AC to require a constant amount of power from the engine per unit time. So if we look at the energy needed per mile, the faster we go the less time a mile takes. Therefore we naively expect the AC to cost fewer gallons of gasoline per mile the faster we go. But the data shows either a flat offset or an increasing offset with speed, so our assumptions must be wrong. The decrease in engine efficiency might explain that, but it is a really counterintuitive result. On the flip side, we expect the drag force to scale with velocity squared. The extra work needed per mile (force times distance) should also go up with the square of velocity the faster we go. But instead the data show something like a constant offset in gallons per mile for both vehicles. So again, our assumptions are off. This result doesn't surprise me as much though, because fluid dynamics is often messy in real world applications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It really does depend on quite a few factors, but considering air drag is usually modeled as relative to the velocity squared, any changes to the drag coefficient would rapidly become noticeable, while the A/C's energy &quot;leech&quot; would be constant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
