		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure you could actually explain this to a 5 year old. Starting with the type of people that settled there (Puritans on the east coast vs more adventurous explorers out west, etc), weather, economic differences, political, religious, social beliefs, lifestyles, it goes on. </p>
<p>There's a great book called American Nations by Colin Woodward that theorizes &quot;North America can be broken neatly into 11 separate nation-states, where dominant cultures explain our  attitudes toward everything from social issues to the role of government.&quot; It has some really interesting information if you're willing to dive into a long read!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've lived both in California on the central coast as well as the DC metro area for the last two years. I can say for me the west coast is more about who you are and less about what you do. The first questions when meeting someone on the east coast is always what do you do for a living. Its healthier I think to not let work define you. And the other factor for sure is weather. I'm going stir crazy here in the DC area without the ability to leave my windows open year round. You don't realize how calming the sounds of the outside world are until you are locked in a sealed apartment with just the buzz of electronics and heater/AC. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, some of it is stereotype, and some of it is based on what you see in other comments.</p>
<p>East coast - finance, big biz, Wall Street, people dress more formally for work, people talk faster</p>
<p>West coast - software, entertainment industry, work dress is more casual, people speak more slowly</p>
<p>Weather -- beach culture, plays into the surf/fun perception.</p>
<p>History -- SF summer of love, LA being seen as a chill place (though people are hustling just as much in entertainment and software as they do in finance jobs, working long hours, etc.) But of course the East has hippies too...Woodstock! Vacation spots like the Hamptons and Jersey shore communities and Martha's Vineyard, etc.</p>
<p>So some is stereotype and some of it is people who buy in to the stereotype living up to it, and some is marketing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have an untested hypothesis that basically says that the longer a society has been established in a given place, the more social control it will exert over its populace.  This is obviously a gross generalization, but it seems like the &quot;old world&quot; shows this pattern as well.  The middle east has a society that is many millennia old, and the social controls there are quite strong.  Western Europe likewise has stronger social expectations than he US, and is a place that has ancient roots.  The euro-american society in North America is only a few hundred years old by comparison.  The west coast did not have american cities established with significant population until the industrial age.  Therefore the founding principles of these places are newer, and based more on innovation and ingenuity than on religious conformity or political fealty.  Likewise, as a geographically remote part of the continent, it required a certain adventure seeking mentality to get out here for a very long time.  And even in the 20th century, it was often a risky economic proposition to relocate to California when the east coast and upper mid-west were still economically strong.  Therefore California has been populated by folks seeking a new life far from the restrictions of their more conservative eastern hometowns.  I think, given enough time however, California will begin to show more of an East-coast style unfriendliness and work-ethic.  But it'll probably be another few generations.  Like I said however, this stuff is pretty much speculation and observation, I'm no PhD.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would gather it has more to do with the cultural differences than anything.  Weather, though some may argue that it isn't cultural, leads to a more laid back environment due to less strain on the body to adapt to varying temperatures and weather patterns.  People spend more time away from their immediate stressors (e.g. Bills, broken pipes, etc.) by going out into the fair weather.  They aren't restricted to their homes, which may cause them to go &quot;stir crazy&quot;.  Another may be a &quot;perceived&quot; laid back environment do to mass media.  A lot of the movies made make California more fun, while making New York more stressful.
In my experience, there are two immediately noticeable factors in the east that aren't as prevalent in the west.  One, the weather is unpredictable and quite miserable sometimes.  The winters are generally very cold, and the summers are extremely humid and hot.  This causes people to stay at home, away from external stimulation, which causes increasing stress.  The second cause could be a heavy presence of religion in the east (especially the southeast).  Religion requires people to constantly restrain themselves from some of the joys in life.  I am not speaking of immoral things (like sexual deviance), but more like enjoying a beer with a friend, or going to a rock concert, or even enjoying an occasional &quot;R&quot; rated movie.  I am sure there are other factors I am missing, but from my perspective, those seem to be some of the glaring differences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
