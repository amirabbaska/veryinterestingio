		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are indicators of fertility and so we are biologically programmed to be attracted to them. The same is true of having wide hips, and having shiny hair indicates good health. Breast firmness indicate age, so having developed and firm breasts indicates you are still young so potentially able to have more children, and having larger breasts indicates you have access to a stable food source so are a good potential mate. </p>
<p>But these biological indicators are just starting points to things. Most of our infatuation is socially developed and due to a myriad of social factors including how taboo sex is or is not, and how taboo nudity is or is not. The more taboo something is, the more attractive we tend to find the things that skirt the limits of that taboo, or the violate it completely. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human breasts are unique among mammals with no other mammals having permanently swollen breasts. For other mammals their breasts are only engorged when nursing. Some anthropologists believe this is an adaptation to bipedalism, a frontal display of virility to supplement the view of gluts from behind. You'll notice the cleavage of breasts and the cleavage of butts are indistinguishable.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><del>The thing is breast size and fertility aren't particularly related. However,</del> breast symmetry and fertility are. Women with symmetrical breast are more fertile than those asymmetrical breasts. An evolutionary theory is that, since it's easier to tell symmetry from bigger breasts, men gravitated towards that.</p>
<p>As a side note, evolutionary psychology has found some pretty amazing things. For example, men are more attractive when they're surrounding by other women but women are more attractive when they're not with a man. (This applies to long-term heterosexual relationships)</p>
<p>Edit: As promised, references.
As I was rereading <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233285975_A_Brief_History_of_the_Theory_of_Evolution" target="_blank">the chapter</a>, I realised I misread a word: breast size is not associated to milk production but it is to fertility. Sorry for the mistake. Here's the link to the original study, if you're interested
Edit 2: the second link has a parenthesis so I have to post it directly: <a href="http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S0162-3095(97)00002-0/abstract" target="_blank">http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S0162-3095(97)00002-0/abstract</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't want to discount any of the opinions offered, but the answer lies somewhere in the middle. There is an instinctual response as the shape and movement of a woman's breasts CAN indicate perceivable fertility and likelihood of successful child rearing.</p>
<p>Humans vary, so hormonal variances, social stressers, and biological influence can factor into the level of sexuality breasts are designated. There are also psychological elements, experiences, and fetishes that can complicate matters further.</p>
<p>Based on anecdotal evidence, anything more than a handful is just asking for a thumb sprain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check this out: <a href="http://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/neoteny2.html" target="_blank">http://www.davidbrin.com/nonfiction/neoteny2.html</a></p>
<p>Brin speculates that attraction to breasts is an evolved pedophilia-avoidance behavior: he writes that most of the common desirability signals for women are youth indicators, so attraction to boobs is your genes' way of distinguishing 'young and fertile' from 'way too young dude'. </p>
<p>No idea if there's any verified science in the theory but it's an interesting read. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
