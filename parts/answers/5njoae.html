		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, an important thing to be noted is you are probably flexing a muscle called the tensor tympani. It is a tiny muscle in your ear that holds onto the bones in your ear which conduct sound. The ear drum kind of works like a hammer beating on a drum and the tensor tympani muscle is like attaching a string to the hammer, which only allows it to hit the drum so hard. The entire purpose of this muscle is to tense up before loud sounds in order to protect the inner workings of your ear. </p>
<p>When you stretch in the morning, this inadvertently tenses this muscle, which you can &quot;hear&quot; as a woosh, or it may just be quieting all other outside sounds. This muscle is usually under involuntary control, however some people can also do it voluntarily. Just like blinking is automatic, but you can also do it if you think about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I realized that I could voluntarily do this as a young kid by yawning. I would yawn and feel it in my ears and just taught me self I could do it anytime. I would do it if I didn't want to hear something and it wasn't polite to cover my ears and I'm mind blown that it's actually a thing other people can do </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
