		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a researcher/doctor you get (apply and pay a fee) for a DEA registration number. The number allows you to research/prescribe/dispense medications. It is very common for medical doctors/dentists/veterinarians to be registered to dispense/prescribe class 2-5 narcotics. Class 2 are highly addictive medications with often a narrow therapeutic index (easy to kill something) like morphine, cocaine, pentobarbital, hydromorphone, fentanyl. Class 2 is a pain in the ass and there is a high level of paperwork and conditions in the management. Class 3-5 and more loosely regulated, but still controlled. Think ketamine, butorphenol, phenobarbital, tramadol. </p>
<p>Class 1 narcotics are highly addictive and &quot;no therapeutic use&quot;. In this group is heroin, mescaline, LSD, PCP, ectacy, and marijuana (for some fucking reason. Class 1 is only available to researchers and in insanely controlled situations.   There is not much research in this area as it is a massive pain in the ass. </p>
<p>Edit: The classifications of narcotics in the United States are often political. Marijuana, LSD and Heroin were classified for political reasons (keeping down blacks, Mexicans, hippies) according to some sources (Adam ruins everything: drugs).  Heroin is not really any worse as far as I can tell than OxyContin, but Bayer lost their patent almost 100 years ago (never taken either drug).</p>
<p>Edit 2: Here is the DEA list with schedule and to far right &quot;other names&quot;. They often use the Chemical names.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't address your first question, but as to your second, use of controlled substances has to be logged, and the materials themselves are kept under lock and key. If I need ketamine, I have to record in my lab notebook how much I need and why I need that much, then I have to record how much I'm taking and how much remains. Not everyone in the lab has access to the lockbox either, so most people have to go through a senior member of the lab who has access to the key.</p>
<p>It might be even more stringent for more highly-restricted drugs like cocaine, but I hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemical supply companies can get a license to sell controlled substances for research purposes, so you can just order it from the same companies that you buy your hydrochloric acid or whatever other chemicals from.  They won't let just anyone order from them, of course, and your lab has to follow standard handling protocols to reduce the chance that they get abused or stolen, but laboratory-grade supplies of controlled products are literally just ordered from a catalog by the people that need them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cocaine is used legally by doctors, particularly in the sinus surgery field, because it's an unsurpassed anesthetic and vasoconstrictor.  Doctors, after doing loads of paperwork, can get it through legal channels.  One would presume lab scientists would do the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The government sanctions one or more companies to produce the drug for research purposes, and any scientist wanting to research with a drug has to buy it from that one company.</p>
<p>For instance, the University of Mississippi is the only federally sanctioned source of Marijuana in the US for research purposes, and CocaCola corporation is the only source of Cocaine for medical and research purposes (being the only company legally allowed to import coca leaves to the US)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
