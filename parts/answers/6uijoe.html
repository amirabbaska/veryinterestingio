		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, this will likely get buried, but I'll give an explanation.</p>
<p>After you ingest (swallow) water, it goes to your stomach. There, it is slowly released to your small intestine to be absorbed and pass to your bloodstream.
It takes water between 10 and 40 minutes to pass to your small intestine and be absorbed. The speed of this depends on how much water, the temperature (cold water will be released slower), if there is something else in the stomach, etc.
But, in general, it doesn't matter whether you chug a bottle of water down in 10 seconds or slowly sip it in 10 minutes. It will all end up in your bloodstream in about the same time.</p>
<p>The only thing that can make a difference is whether you vomit the water that you are ingesting. You stomach vomits its contents in response to a series of things (whether it senses that something you ate may be rotten or dangerous, whether there is a bad smell, etc), and one of those things that the stomach takes into account is how full it is. So ingesting water in small sips can help avoid vomiting, and that is what's recommended when for example children have gastroenteritis. But if you don't vomit the water that you swallow, it doesn't matter whether you swallowed it in 10 seconds or 10 minutes.</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, thanks for all the upvotes. Turns out it didn't get buried after all! This is 1/4 of my total karma right there! Glad you liked it!</p>
<p>Edit2: it's actually not clear whether cold water will be released (and thus absorbed) slower. As someone pointed out below, studies on this seem to be contradictory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your stomach gets emptied at a certain rate that depends partly on how distended it is and stimulation of the first and ends of the small intestine. So the rate is controlled mostly to the same degree in either situation. Once absorbed, the body will regulate fluid excretion in the kidneys so that you don't over hydrate (and dilute all your electrolytes and other things).  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking off this question: </p>
<p>How much water does someone REALLY need? Drinking the &quot;8-10 glasses&quot; a day gives me clear urine and over 25 trips to the bathroom, whereas if I drink 5+ glasses a day, my urine is still clear and I feel hydrated without the bladder pains/constant bathroom trips. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer, yes. </p>
<p>Long answer, plasma osmolality and volume of ECF are the characteristics your body uses when it is regulating diuresis. If you sip two liters of water over two hours your body will lower production of vasopressin/ADH to allow excess water to clear as required. </p>
<p>If you chug that same quantity in one minute your body will shut down production of antidiuretic hormones all together as plasma concentration drops through the floor. You will then overshoot ideal osmolality and become slightly dehydrated, because your kidneys can make very dilute urine astoundingly fast.</p>
<p>It's the same concept as eating a lot of sugar, your body can create the hormones to bring you back to &quot;normal&quot; but resources are wasted in the process and extremes are not fully accounted for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
