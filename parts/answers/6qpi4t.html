		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are talking about inhaling through the nose, there is a nasal structure that affects this.</p>
<p>Deep within the nose there are a pair of spiral structures that are <em>explicitly designed</em> to introduce a special type of turbulence. This turbulence can dramatically reduce the effort needed to draw air through the nose. When you have strong gusts of wind impact your nose, it can overwhelm the effect that these structures have, causing your nose to become far less efficient in passing air.</p>
<p>This is why rhinoplasty that affects these structures can be so dangerous - if something is done to disrupt the ability of these structures to channel air properly, <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/health/2016-07-22/empty-nose-syndrome-when-routine-nasal-surgery-goes-wrong/7652696" target="_blank">it can cause a “suffocating” feeling</a> that can cause sufferers all sorts of discomfort, to the point of committing suicide just to obtain relief.</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/joeloliphint/is-empty-nose-syndrome-real-and-if-not-why-are-people-killin" target="_blank">A bit of a better article</a>.</p>
<p>Edit2: Ow, my inbox.</p>
<p>Edit3: To head people off at the pass: This is <em>NOT</em> a promotion of Intelligent Design - exactly the opposite, in fact. When I am talking about things being “explicitly designed”, I am talking about evolution creating a structure for a specific purpose or extremely limited range of purposes, not a general structure that can do many different things. General structures are “easier” because they come about from many different evolutionary pressures working in concert, so these pressures on an individual level can be much lower. A very specific structure with a single or very narrow range of purposes point to an evolutionary pressure or range of pressures that are highly specific and very precise, and which are either very strong or exist over very long evolutionary periods. The fact that turbinates can be found in mammalian, avian and saurian species (and in a primitive form in reptiles) indicaties that they had a very important use early on in the history of air-breathing animals, and that persistently strong evolutionary pressures have kept them for many hundreds of millions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many have addressed the biological issues at play, but there are basic physics too.</p>
<p>Your lungs work by expanding, creating a lower pressure inside the lungs.  Air pressure moves from high to low.  The low pressure draws air into the lungs.</p>
<p>Fast moving air also creates low pressure.  When your lungs expand to produce the low pressure, but there is low pressure outside the lungs, less or no air will be drawn into the lungs.  High to low, not low to low.</p>
<p>TL;DR lungs work via low pressure.  Fast air also creates low pressure, making lungs not work.</p>
<p>Edit: There's a lot of misunderstanding of Bernoulli's principle and aerodynamics here.  I think this video will help: <a href="https://youtu.be/5zD7Le2mGFg?t=34s" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/5zD7Le2mGFg?t=34s</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mammalian Dive Reflex. It's a reflex that keeps us from accidentally breathing in while underwater, but cold air or wind can sometimes imitate the sensation of water well enough that it triggers the reflex, making it difficult to inhale.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lets say you're sticking your head out a car window while it's going down the highway (I assume this is the sensation you're referring to).  The wind creates an area of low pressure around the sides of your face, and when you open your mouth to try to breath, a slight vacuum is created as it attempts to fill the void of low pressure, making it slightly difficult to breathe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since i do not see anyone else answering this, it might not be correct but i was tought that the berboulli effect plays its part here. Fast moving air creates less pressure on its surroundings than unmoving air. This creates a negative pressure difference between the surrounding air and the unmoving air in your mouth and lungs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
