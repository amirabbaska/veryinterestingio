		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been depressed and at times suicidal for the past eleven years, since I was 8. The self harm started a year later. The thing is, my first attempt on my life was in the fifth grade. Of course, being my incredibly logical fifth grade self, I ended up using a belt that broke. And again with the child logic, this told me only that I couldn't even kill myself right. I sank further and further into the throes of depression over the next three years before finally deciding to try again. This time, I thought, I'll do it right. So, I downed an entire bottle of pain pills and waited for the inevitable. Of course, my stomach didn't agree with this train of thought, and after about an hour or two, decided to reject my plan by completely turning itself inside out. My parents were alerted to the problem by my uncontrollable vomiting, and upon seeing the pills in the toilet immediately rushed me to the hospital. At the hospital, they pumped something into me that made me regurgitate every meal I'd eaten in the past ten years. Have you ever felt your organs start to shut down? I gotta tell you, it's the worst pain I'd ever felt in my life. There's very little that anyone else can do to me that I haven't already done to myself- cutting, burning, branding, beating, poisoning, and now even killing. This pain was beyond any of that combined. I'm not quite sure if they were affecting my kidneys or my liver, since it's been quite some time since this incident, but I remember lying in a hospital bed begging them to let me die, just to make that pain stop. Keep in mind, I was a very melodramatic teenager, and everything felt like the end of the world to me at that point. </p>
<p>Not long after this, I started on Prozac. Prozac is an SSRI that regulates your neurotransmitters, particularly serotonin. The first thing I noticed was the numbness. All those bad thoughts were fading, but at this point I had been so depressed for so long that there wasn't much left of me when you took that away. Or rather, there was but it was buried so deep down that I didn't know how to access it at that point in time. After a solid year of numbness, my personality started to come back. The music I listened to shifted from depressed emo to raucous punk, to classic rock, psychedelic rock, pop punk- things that made me feel something. I started to read again. (As a kid I was an avid reader, and during the worst of my depression I started to lose that). I started spending time outside, and even made my first friends since elementary school (when your parents basically make your friends for you). I started wearing colors again, finding empowerment in rusty reds and olive greens, (not together of course), and began to form my own identity separate from the depression and the emo phase. </p>
<p>The real change though came early tenth grade when I simply decided I didn't want to feel that way anymore. Of course, things are never so simple as just a declaration. I had to work for it, doing an intensive outpatient program and group therapy. Slowly but surely though, I started to work through the issues I had suppressed and made my first steps to recovery. I probably wouldn't have been capable of taking that first step without the antidepressants. They cleared my mind of this dark fog enough to let me claw my way back into the light. These days, the suicidal ideation is still there. A part of me thinks it always will be. I've got the note on standby, along with a list of methods including the statistic likelihood of success, as well as the pros and cons of each method. The urge to kill myself probably comes maybe once every other month, lasts for about eight hours, and then fades again. I've learned to recognize the symptoms when I show them, how the meds affect my serotonin reuptake, how my own thoughts can spiral down into this pattern of self loathing and self destruction, and how to stop that spiral before it gets out of control. </p>
<p>The biggest change I had to make, though, was the decision not to live for myself. I had no self worth, and as such didn't see a reason to live just for me. By changing that to refusing to hurt the people I hold dear to me in that way, and by dedicating my life to supporting others and seeing as much of the world as possible in the process, I've come to a point where no matter how much I want to die, I can't. I can't hurt the people I love like that, or end things before I've helped- and hopefully even saved- as many people as humanly possible. </p>
<p>I don't think I would have been capable of coming this far without the antidepressants to clear that fog of apathy away. I'm not even sure that I would have been able to take that first step without them. </p>
<p>Fast forward to today. I've come so far, finding a solid group of friends that are basically family at this point. I've built my support system from the ground up. These days, I am a living testament to the statement that IT GETS BETTER. It takes time, effort, and rarely gets better when you first start expecting it to, but it will get better. It might be halfway through high school, when you make your first real friends. It might be in college, when you can get away from your family. It might not be for another ten years, when you meet the love of your life. Maybe, one day you'll be traveling and come across a sight so profound or beautiful that it brings you to tears, and you want to fall to your knees in gratitude. Things do get better, even if not immediately or even quickly for that matter.</p>
<p>Nothing is worth taking your life over. </p>
<p>Nothing. </p>
<p>You have so much to live for- flowers you've never smelled, songs yet to be written, countries you haven't yet traveled to, books you haven't read, instruments you've never played, bands you haven't seen live, art you haven't yet created, stories you haven't yet told, people you haven't made smile. You never know just how much you'll be missing. Even if at the time it might seem pointless to wait for such trivial things, it's these things that make life worth living. </p>
<p>Suicide is never beautiful.
Suicide is never easy.
Suicide is an ugly act that rips someone precious away from those that care for them.
It will always hurt, it will always be the wrong choice. </p>
<p>Take the steps towards recovery, make a conscious decision to battle this monster inside you, and take charge of your life. If I could do it after fighting a losing battle for ten years, so can you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's &quot;suicidal ideation,&quot; the medical term for &quot;suicidal thoughts.&quot;</p>
<p>Basically, if you have depression, you have three sets of symptoms: (1) your &quot;primary psychological&quot; ones, aka &quot;the ones in your head,&quot; like negative thoughts (feelings of sadness, hopelessness, shame, etc), (2) your &quot;physiological&quot; symptoms, &quot;the ones in your body,&quot; like low energy, aches and pains, fatigue, etc, and then (3) a set of &quot;secondary psychological&quot; symptoms that kind of come along for the ride, like feelings of apathy or lack of motivation or interest in activities.</p>
<p>Suicidal ideation falls in the first category - basically &quot;bad thoughts.&quot; The danger with antidepressants is that for some people, the medicine will improve the second and third categories before it improves the first. So you will start physically feeling better and more motivated, but your mood is still low and you have negative thoughts. Also, for some people, especially if they have been depressed for a long time or if their depression was triggered by a traumatic event (death of a loved one, an accident, etc), an antidepressant alone might not be enough to counter the bad thoughts. Often you need to &quot;retrain your brain&quot; to learn how to not let yourself dwell and how to think more positively; this is why counseling or therapy is also a treatment for depression.</p>
<p>Basically, a medicine can change how your brain works but it's harder to change what you think about. And if you suddenly start feeling more energy and motivation but still think you are worthless and life is hopeless and all that, now you have someone who maybe thinks about or wishes they would die and actually has the physical strength and focus to take action.</p>
<p>Story time: When I was in the worst depressive episode of my life, I thought about dying, but I never wanted to kill myself. It was more &quot;everyone would be better off if I were dead because I am so pathetic.&quot; Now, the thing about suicide is, it seems that oftentimes it is an impulsive decision. When electric stoves were introduced in the U.K., the suicide rate dropped because people couldn't kill themselves easily with gas ovens anymore, but the numbers for other methods didn't rise, suggesting if it were more difficult, less people would do it. Likewise, putting up guardrails on bridges that prevent jumpers has reduced overall suicide rates. I also recall seeing a study that said that the vast majority of people who attempt suicide and fail <em>never try again.</em> So I see suicide not so much as a conscious decision of a rational mind (though it can be, for instance for the terminally ill) but as an impulse, a reflex almost, caused by depression the same way a cold makes you cough. So although I had no desire to kill myself, and was very aware of how painful that would have been for my family, I can definitely see how someone in the depths of that darkness could actually conclude that death would be preferable to carrying on with such a &quot;broken&quot; mind, and how suddenly having energy and a desire to &quot;do something&quot; could allow that person to act on their twisted thoughts. I mean, feeling physically better could even make the bad thoughts worse because it reinforces that &quot;it's all in your head,&quot; you start thinking what if there's nothing physically wrong with me, I'm worthless, I will never be happy, etc. Honestly, it terrifies me to think of suicide that way, but those are the conclusions I've drawn, and it makes me stay much more &quot;aware&quot; of my mood and be more open with my loved ones when I do feel down so they know to keep an eye on me. If you know someone who is depressed, they probably don't want to tell you if they are having those thoughts because they know it upsets people, but tell them you want to hear it and need them to help you protect them. You gotta work together, no one can battle depression alone. </p>
<p>Sorry for the soapbox, saw a couple clinical answers and thought you might appreciate a more personal take. </p>
<p>tl;dr: Antidepressants are unpredictable and affect everyone in different ways. If your body feels better but you still have bad thoughts, you are better able to act on them. That's why antidepressants carry that warning. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>None of the comments here seem to address the lag effect of how SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors e.g. Prozac, Zoloft) actually work and why mood gets worse in the first 2 weeks after starting an SSRI</p>
<p>Neurons (brain nerve cells) release serotonin into the synapse (gap between two nerve cells) and the next neuron reacts to that. That's a basic signal transmission from one neuron to the next in (certain parts of) the brain and low serotonin levels here is closely linked with depression. The amount of serotonin released depends on the signal moving along the neuron as well as the neuron's autoregulation which is based on the amount of serotonin already in the synapse. </p>
<p>Here's a basic diagram of a synapse <a href="http://institute.progress.im/sites/default/files/styles/content_full/public/depression_-_moa_of_ssris.jpg?itok=bt7Fr77R" target="_blank">http://institute.progress.im/sites/default/files/styles/content_full/public/depression_-_moa_of_ssris.jpg?itok=bt7Fr77R</a> </p>
<p>When you start an SSRI, you inhibit the reuptake of serotonin from the synapse, which means the serotonin level in the synapse remains high after a signal. This is good, and this is the aim of SSRIs. However, high serotonin levels mean that the autoreceptors on the pre-synaptic neuron tell the neuron that serotonin levels are good and you don't need to release any more. This is bad, and drives serotonin release down. </p>
<p>Eventually after ~2 weeks, the increased base level of serotonin in the synapse after a signal as a result of the reuptake inhibition causes the auto-regulators to involute (be absorbed back into the neuron/stop being expressed on the surface) because they are being activated too often. This means the auto-inhibition falls, and serotonin levels rise properly and reach a &quot;normal&quot; level of functioning again</p>
<p>The 2 week lag period where auto-inhibition is high, before the auto-regulators can involute causes reduced serotonin levels and in some people can worsen symptoms of depression. This should be and is often not explained when people are started on SSRI anti-depressants </p>
<p>Hopefully this reply won't be buried/missed by OP I know I got here pretty late sorry my bad</p>

<p>Edit: as u/earf pointed out below, the auto-regulatory receptors (5-HT1A) are in the somatodendritic (start of the neuron) area of the pre-synaptic neuron. SSRIs increase the level of serotonin in this area (at the receptor area of the neuron). The increased level of serotonin in this area slowly (as the receptors turn over and get renewed) cause a decrease in the number of 5-HT1A receptors. These receptors normally inhibit the amount of serotonin released (from the end of the neuron), so as they are reduced, the amount of serotonin release at the other end of the neuron goes up. This slow decrease in the number of inhibitory auto-regulatory receptors (at the start of the neuron) is what causes the lag effect </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a researcher here, but a counselor - this us a common question, and applicable to list of the SSRIs and common meds. The ELI5 answer I use...</p>
<p>Depression tends more to such emotional distress that you're numb and sluggish, rather than just &quot;I'm always crying.&quot; Meds are always a primarily physiological tool for managing moods. Since one if the positive affects of the meds is increasing your energy levels, you tend to have more energy to act on negative thoughts and feelings before the chemical changes physically start helping you mange your mood on your own and feel better.</p>
<p>The best analogy I've found- Meds in general aren't a mood fix, they're a tool to help you manage your own moods better. Imagine you are a piano, just one that's out stressed, abused, and out of tune. All the music you play is sour and you either stop practicing or just pound harder. Meds are like tuning the piano - your music can sound a lot better, but if you only pay death metal, that's gonna come in clearer. If you're out of practice and don't try to feel better regularly, you still won't be playing beautiful feel good music. And, if you only rely on piano tuning, it still won't tell you what music to pay when. You still can use the meds to make all the music you play better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're depressed, you don't feel like doing anything. </p>
<p>To simplify, antidepressants work in two phases. Phase 1 mates you more motivated. Phase 2 makes you happy. </p>
<p>The problem is you become motivated first, but you're still sad, so now you're more likely to follow through with suicide thoughts you used to not be motivated to follow through with. </p>
<p>This is all very simplified, but it's as ELI5 as I can think </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
