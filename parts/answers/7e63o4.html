		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. A concussion is caused by <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/concussion/symptoms-causes/syc-20355594" target="_blank">trauma to the cranium</a> that causes the brain to contact the inside of the skull with enough force to cause an injury. Since insects lack <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insect_morphology" target="_blank">endoskeletons and dedicated brain cases</a>, any trauma that may be sufficient to cause a concussion will simply kill the insect outright.</p>
<p>In addition, since insects often <em>don't</em> have dedicated cerebral ganglia (present in the diagram above), trauma to their nervous systems are not as debilitating since their nervous system isn't centralized.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
