		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually used to work at an AV company!</p>
<p>As others have said, there are mechanisms in place to ensure that infected file samples are only opened in a &quot;sandbox&quot; environment. </p>
<p>Basically these are entirely virtual labs which are being emulated, and set up on virtual networks which are separate from the physical interfaces.</p>
<p>With this structure, they can activate a virus sample and see how it affects the sandbox system. Its behaviors (how it loads into memory, what files it writes, etc) are then compiled into prototype virus definition files.</p>
<p>The sandbox is reset, and they test again seeing if the new definition files successfully stop the computer virus. Provided it works, these prototype definitions are then put through a general QA cycle to ensure it doesn't break common windows installations out of the box, and is then finalized into part of your daily virus def downloads.</p>
<p>If a customer attempts to send infected samples to customer support instead of the secure submission portal, there's a protocol we followed which involved politely reprimanding the customer and having them resubmit, as well as contacting our server department to make sure the contaminated sample is scrubbed. Employees are trained not to open any potentially infected files from customers, and we run with a rather strict anti-virus policy on our work machines. The closer the technician is to the public, the tighter the security controls. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Layers upon layers of security protocols and locked down network environments to make sure hostile code is segregated from the rest of the business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have dedicated computers for this that <em>do</em> get infected so they can monitor the software's activities.</p>
<p>As long as that sacrificial computer isn't networked to others there's no way for even the most devious virus to spread to other machines.</p>
<p>Once they're done that machine is reset to factory settings and the operating system is reinstalled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To analyze a virus behavior they <em>do</em> get themselves &quot;infected&quot;. But they obviously do so in a controlled manner.</p>
<p>Unlike biological viruses, you wouldn't get infected just by manipulating and storing them. Viruses, as any computer program, have to be &quot;run&quot; to actually do something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
