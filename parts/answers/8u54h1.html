		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several types of OTC pain relievers. Advil (ibuprofen) belongs to a class known as NSAIDs. Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory drugs. Some other well known NSAIDS are naproxen sodium (Aleve) and Ketorolac (Toradol). NSAIDs work by stopping the body's inflammation response. These drugs inhibit certain enzymes that produce inflammation/pain at the injury site, as well as fever. Essentially, NSAIDs lessen the body's physical response to an injury. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) on the other hand, works differently. It's not entirely understood how Tylenol works. It doesn't reduce inflammation in injuries and appears to only inhibit enzymes in the brain. Tylenol isn't actually doing anything physical to the injury site. So, while NSAIDs stop swelling and pain at the injury site, Tylenol appears to stop your brain from recognizing the pain. </p>
<p>Another interesting fact, both NSAIDs and Tylenol are metabolized by the liver, but excessive Tylenol intake can damage your liver and kidneys. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depending on which kind, the process can vary. But I’ve had chronic kidney stones since I was eleven (it’s a complicated story) and because of this many doctors have explained this to me when I was actually a child. They described it as working to help reduce chemical in your brain that creates the pain to slow down production while also giving your brain other “good chemicals” to help distract you brain. Basically most don’t actually kill your pain, just distract you. I’ve heard some say that pain killers don’t make you hurt less, they just make you not care but a better explanation would be that they alter your brains perception of the pain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
