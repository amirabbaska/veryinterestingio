		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Especially with viruses that rapidly mutate, they can sequence the DNA or RNA (depending on the virus) and basically make a phylogeny for the virus. If you know the rate at which the virus mutates you can also start to figure out how long ago the outbreak started.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just as a note on terminology: &quot;patient zero&quot; was first used to describe Gaetan Dugas, who was falsely accused of being the first person to bring HIV to North America. And originally this theoretical person was called Patient O (the letter) standing for &quot;outside California&quot;, this was later misinterpreted as a zero, falsely implying that he was the first human with HIV or at least the originator of the oitbreak and also served to dehumanize him in the sense that he was seen not as the first patient (patient 1) but somehow the cause of the disease. Beyond the damage this did to Dugas's reputation, this has led to widespread misunderstanding of the epidemiological concept of an index case - which is just the first identified case of a particular infection or disease, or the earliest identifiable person in the transmission chain. It does not imply the person was the first person to contract the infection in the lead up to the outbreak or anything other than that they were the earliest identifiable case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
