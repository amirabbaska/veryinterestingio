<p>On a much smaller scale energy is converted to mass around you constantly. Photosynthesis &quot;stores energy&quot; from photons chemically in hydrocarbons. Changing the chemistry very slightly changes the mass. It's negligible compared to the mass of the atoms themselves but it still occurs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Correct!</p>
<p>But the relationship between matter and energy is even deeper than you might think! When we say that &quot;energy is mass&quot;, we literally mean that <em>all energy is mass, and all mass is energy.</em> You can seriously increase the mass of a glass of water by microwaving it.</p>
<p>For instance, say you microwave a 12-oz glass of water that was at room temperature (293.15K) to just slightly under boiling point (373.15K) <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-room-temperature-in-Kelvin" target="_blank">source</a>.</p>
<p>That's a change in temperature of 80 kelvin. The thermal capacity of of water is <a href="https://water.usgs.gov/edu/heat-capacity.html" target="_blank">4.184 joules per kelvin per gram</a>. (That is, it takes 4.184 joules of energy to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree kelvin).</p>
<p>Finally, our 12oz glass of water weighs 354.882 grams.</p>
<p>Throwing this all into the math-blender, we get:</p>
<p>Total energy added = 354.882 grams <em> 80 K </em> 4.184 J/(gK) = 118786.10304 J, or 118 kilojoules of energy.</p>
<p>Now, we may apply <del>Mr.</del> Dr. Einstein's famous equation:</p>
<p>E = m * C^2</p>
<p>Solving for mass, we get:
m = E/C^2</p>
<p>Plugging in our values (including the speed of light), we have:</p>
<p>m = 118786.10304 J/(299792458 m / s)^2 = 1.32167364 * 10^-12 kg</p>
<p>In other words, the weight of your cup of water <em>will</em> be increased by roughly <strong><em>one millionth of one thousandth of a gram</em></strong></p>
<p>Not nearly enough to be noticeable, but interesting nevertheless.</p>
<p>This works for <em>all</em> forms of energy too, including potential energies, such as the charging/discharging of a battery or capacitor.</p>
<p>The key thing to understand here is that, even in extremely high energy processes like fission and fusion, we're not creating or destroying <em>matter</em> at all -- instead, we are either releasing or trapping energy, which also happens to be mass, causing the matter that is <em>already there</em> to become either heavier or lighter.</p>
<p>However, if you can get the energy of your interaction high enough, like in the case of the LHC, matter itself <em>can</em> spontaneously appear, releasing some of the energy as true, physical mass/matter, rather than just increasing the weight (and speed) of any matter that was already present.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This box would have to be able to be able to take energy and use it to create the exact particles you need, and then arrange them into other particles, and so on until you have the molecules you need, and arrange them into the object you want.</p>
<p>So in theory, yes. But it would be unimaginably complex and take a truly ridiculous amount of energy to make an everyday object. Even with huge improvements in technology, this will probably never be more efficient than just going out and finding the material you need to make it in a more conventional way. It would probably be used to make tiny amounts of extremely rare matter, or maybe stuff that doesn't form naturally. Even then, there are or probably will be easier ways to do it (such as smashing existing stuff together in a particle accelerator).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It truly needs to be a magic box however :s</p>
<p>In reality it's more complex. E=MC^2 (or M=E/C^2 has it was originally presented) Proves that Matter is a propriety of energy: The more energy a system has the more it weights.</p>
<p>Most of the registered mass of an atom comes from the energy holding the sub-atomic particles together. The rest comes from &quot;regular mass&quot; of those sub-atomic particles.</p>
<p>But yes, It is possible to make matter from energy. Not as a regular 3D printer because we are talking about stupid amounts of energy. associated with radiations and extreme temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Energy is conserved, but not every imaginable energy-conserving process is physically allowed, as there are other conservation laws as well. For example, I can't just turn light into the protons, neutrons and electrons that compose ordinary matter, since the conservation of other quantities called baryon number and lepton number implies I would have to create equal amounts of antimatter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production" target="_blank">at the same time</a>. (For simplicity I'm glossing over hypothetical ways to change the total baryon number, if only because doing it on a large scale would be challenging.) If I create matter alongside antimatter, I'll have to separate the two quickly or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation" target="_blank">the result won't last long</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
