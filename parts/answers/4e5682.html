		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My biggest question would be &quot;Why do certain animals build certain shelters?&quot; Like birds building nests (and different nests depending on the type of bird) and beavers building dams. It's like some kind of culture among difference species that is inherited through genes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A bigger question is why can't a bird improve the design? The same question was asked by anthropologists about early humans. Why did Homo Erectus/Habilis build a stone hand axes &quot;just like birds build nests&quot; for MILLIONS of years before they ever improved the design and made a spear. Were humans once &quot;nest builders&quot; directed 100% by instinct until the mutation that made us hyper intelligent homo sapiens? If we understand how birds know to build nests we may answer this questions about us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, these animals are 'programmed' by their genetic code to do these things, and those 'programs' were developed by millions of iterations of trial and error, where the bad programs were erased (died out) and the good ones continued.</p>
<p>Now, a better question is why don't we humans have the same 'programs' in our brains?  Well, we do to some extent (suckling instinct, diving instinct, etc).  But because our brains are more powerful than an ant or bird, we actually can do better <em>without</em> fixed programming, because we can develop better solutions based on the available information, learning from others, etc.</p>
<p>To put it into a computing analogy - the birds and ants are very old, very slow computers with very limited RAM.  They can do what the first computers could do, simple mathematical operations and other tasks, one simple job at a time.  They are fixed in their programming, once they're programmed to do something, that's all they can do, and they can do it very well.  Us humans on the other hand are very advanced computers that can 'learn'.  We aren't programmed to perform every little task, but rather can learn how to do <em>any</em> task given enough time, training, and input.  Your washing machine doesn't need to learn how to wash clothes, it's programmed to do that from the time it's created.  If you developed a very advanced domestic robot, it might not know how to wash clothes when it was 'born', but with an advanced processor and the right learning algorithms it could definitely learn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have inherited the knowledge in their genes, but they learn through trial and error, at least that is what we assume. There's quite a lot we don't know about ourselves and nature, but that's why we keep studying. </p>
<p>They're really fascinating animals. We had a bird in our garden that made a square nest, for no reason, and then he did it again. He lived in our garden, it was quite the sight.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a fascinating question, and one I often wonder about spiders.</p>
<p>Clearly, a spider isn't thinking in its head about how to design this extraordinarily complex web structure, or even really understands the fact that it <em>can</em> develop these things.</p>
<p>This gets down into the gray area surrounding consciousness.  Are these animals acting purely on instinct (basically, they're a robot) or do they have to make decisions about how to go about this <em>in their own heads</em> (they're conscious).</p>
<p>It's easy for humans to say we're conscious, but where do we draw the line?  Dogs seem conscious.  Fish do.  Ants?  Maybe.  Viruses?  Probably not.</p>
<p>There is some dividing line between machine-like behavior (viruses) and conscious decision-making.  </p>
<p>Where that line is drawn, I have no idea.</p>
<p><em>Edit</em> : Due to the number of responses on this, I'd just like to add a relevant link that should explain this better.</p>
