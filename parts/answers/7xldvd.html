		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While it's not still considered a &quot;homosexual disease&quot; HIV/AIDS is still very prevalent in the homosexual community. Gay and bisexual men make up 70% of all new cases of HIV, despite them being less than 1.7% of the population (assuming 50% of homosexuals and bisexuals are male). </p>
<p>This is partly because of behavioral tendencies of gay/bisexual men who tend to have more anonymous partners and have unprotected sex. Also, anal sex is more traumatic to tissues than vaginal sex. The rectum is not built to accommodate sexual intercourse like the vagina is, so there is a higher chance of the HIV virus entering the bloodstream via anal sex than vaginal sex.</p>
<p>So the question for blood donation is, &quot;Are you a male who has had anal sex, even once, with another man?&quot; Saying yes may disqualify your donation as this behavior has a significantly higher chance of having HIV than other donor types. Yes, they do test blood for HIV and Hepatitis, but these tests are reliant on antibodies. If you were infected within the previous month, you could still be infected but it wouldn't show up on a test.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Homosexuals have a much higher rate of having the disease. </p>
<p>Being from Denmark doesn't mean you have mad cow disease. But it means you have a higher risk for having mad cow disease. Which is why it's another red flag on those forms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not disease found exclusively found in homosexuals, but homosexual behavior is an indication of a much greater chance of having contracted the disease, which is why there is often a restriction. </p>
<p>In addition, tests for the HIV virus are not perfect at detecting the virus in small numbers, such as if it was recently acquired.  As such, any behavior that is associated with a high risk warrants a temporary defferal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not exclusively a &quot;homosexual disease&quot;, but certain activity puts someone at a much higher risk of contracting the disease -- and male/male anal sex is the riskiest type of behavior. Without getting too graphic, the nature of the activity can lead to small ruptures in the skin that can allow the disease to flow from one person to another.</p>
<p>As a result, men that have engaged in anal sex with other men have, as a group, higher rates of infection than other groups.</p>
<p>Since a blood donation from someone who falls in this group is much more likely to be unusable than other groups, it's more cost-effective for blood banks to just reject those donors and spend their limited collection cost budgets on groups that have a lower risk of infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If someone has recently seroconverted, it will not show up in their tests for HIV.  It restricts gay men because they will have a higher risk but it doesnâ€™t restrict gay women to give blood. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
