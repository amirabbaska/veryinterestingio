		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In cities and towns for most practical purposes like in your school, work, shops or while doing business you don't actually know the person's caste and neither you care. But I'm villages it is quite different. Your social circle is quite small and everyone knows everyome else. Here your caste is part of your identity.</p>
<p>You will probably get many different answers for this question, which are all correct but also wrong because in country of 1.3 billion people thimgs drastically change from place to place and situation to situation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In urban areas, it doesn't matter that much. Although, won't say it is completely alleviated.</p>
<p>For example, I live in the top tier II city of India and I just asked my mother sitting in front of me this (she's not staunch Brahmin but conservative a little and knows stuff).  Some reasons are like names. The surnames can tell a lot. While Mishra, Shukla, Dubey, Tiwari et cetera are Brahmins, just like that Valmiki, Chaudhary for example are Dalit surnames. </p>
<p>They can of course change their name but even that practice is so common that it's not a secret anymore. Say a Valmiki can change his name to for example Kumar but that doesn't mean all Kumars are Dalits. But since it is practiced so commonly,  caste minded people get the idea. Hope I'm making myself clear.</p>
<p>Another way is the rituals! Upper castes tend to (want to) enjoy rituals themselves. Say someone dies in a Brahmin family, the mourning period and the rituals tend to last for 13 days but that is not the case for Dalits, since, from ancient times they have not been able to practice such rituals, it has become tradition for them, so if someone dies in a Dalit family, the ritual barely lasts for 2-3 days. People talking about their rituals and practices is the most easy way to understand. There are other examples too but that raises an obvious question! </p>
<p>Dalits today in a modern society can change those rituals right? They are guaranteed by the constitution and law and order and all that stuff.  This is true and many tend to do it but this tendency lies in urban areas only. In rural areas, if a Dalit man even tries sitting on a horse for his wedding baaraat (a procession) the upper caste would literally shoot him for attempting to show himself as equal to Brahmins. Of course the law takes its course but the damage has been done and since it's a rural area, even police tends to act loosely because they themself sometimes respect the caste system too much or are afraid of the local upper castes people.</p>
<p>And here's what you need to understand! India (a big chunk of it) still lives in those rural areas and this is why it is prevalent and while we are a developing nation and emerging super economy (means people are migrating to urban areas for better lifestyle and standard of living), these are the same people who once lived in rural areas and practiced those same traditions, they feel if they abandon such Brahminical mindset, they're betraying they're culture. So in a subtle way, it still exists in urban areas. For example, we have Dalits in our apartment and while my mother is outspoken  (a lot) she has called them Dalit (even after changing name using the same practices that I told you) but she hasn't ever discriminated. Dalits have come in our house, talked, ate, had fun, hell, even cooked in the kitchen. </p>
<p>Hope I answered you well.</p>
<p>PS - I'm a Brahmin. The sane ones. We don't shoot people for riding horses. Frankly I asked half of this stuff from my mother just now. As an individual who was never imposed all this, I couldn't care less but that doesn't mean I shouldn't know about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Usually one can guess the caste by a person's surname. As in there are certain surnames which belong only to lower caste people. People have done the changing surnames thing actually, a lot have changed their surnames to general Kumar, Kumari or Gupta.</p>
<p>Low mobility. People lived their lifetime in a given area and changing cities (dislocating from your family and profession) was not easy. Eventually someone from you area will notice you wherever you have shifted. Also, since education was scarce for them, finding a job in a new place would be difficult. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few ways:</p>
<p>1) Type of job: Dalits tend to do the most menial/dirty jobs, such as cleaning streets, picking up/sorting/disposing garbage, unclogging sewers, working with dead animals/leather, etc. For generations, that's the type of work that has been available to their caste and they historically haven't been able to move out of those.</p>
<p>2) Skin color: Dalits tend to be darker than the others in their community. This is a total guess on my part but based on some of my travels in India. Even in the South where my family is from, and where people are often darker than their Northern counterparts, I feel like people of lower castes tend to be darker. I don't know if it has to do with lower castes perhaps coming from indigenous tribes in India, or simply because those in lower castes historically work jobs in the hot sun. I feel like it might be the latter, but in any case, having dark skin is often looked down upon in India.</p>
<p>According to the Indian Constitution, discrimination of individuals due to caste is illegal. Sadly, you don't change thousands of years of social and economic discrimination in less than 100. And those in the &quot;untouchable&quot; community still face a <strong>lot</strong> of harassment and discrimination. Especially those who are trying to get educated and move up in life, and those who are fighting for their basic rights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are vast cultural differences between different castes, and indeed, between any countries' social classes.</p>
<p>An untouchable couldn't fake being a higher caste the same way that I, a nerd from the suburbs, can't put on a baggy coat walk up to the nearest crips hangout and say &quot;what up g? Let me in your gang&quot; </p>
<p>Faking a culture is harder than faking an accent, and even  foreigners who have been speaking your native language for decades still usually have a noticeable accent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
