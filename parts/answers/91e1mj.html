		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no, depending on the type of anesthetic used. Reflexes occur without conscious thought.</p>
<p>The patellar reflex or knee-jerk (myotatic) (monosynaptic) (American spelling knee reflex) is a stretch reflex which tests the L2, L3, and L4 segments of the spinal cord.</p>
<p>Mechanism</p>
<p>Striking the patellar tendon with a reflex hammer just below the patella stretches the muscle spindle in the quadriceps muscle. This produces a signal which travels back to the spinal cord and synapses (without interneurons) at the level of L3 in the spinal cord, completely independent of higher centres.</p>
<p>The patellar reflex is a clinical and classic example of the monosynaptic reflex arc. There is no interneuron in the pathway leading to contraction of the quadriceps muscle. Instead, the bipolar sensory neuron synapses directly on a motor neuron in the spinal cord. However, there is an inhibitory interneuron used to relax the antagonistic hamstring muscle (Reciprocal innervation).</p>
<p>But some types of anesthesia may inhibit the reflex by suppressing spinal cord transmission. <a href="http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/Article.aspx?articleid=1923785" target="_blank"><a href="http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/Article.aspx?articleid=1923785" target="_blank">http://anesthesiology.pubs.asahq.org/Article.aspx?articleid=1923785</a></a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’ve got a knee jerk reflex for you. I was about 17 and having my Wisdom teeth pulled. They gave me gas and possibly one other sedative but I didn’t go deep enough. At one point they pulled on my tooth and I must have felt the pain and kicked hard and high busting up the dental assistants mouth and sending her to the hospital. When I woke up they told me what had happened and I felt horrible.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
