		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thank you everyone for your responses, I think I'll try and summarise this thread:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Schizophrenia consists mainly of audio hallucinations and varies    from person to person in terms of 'reality checking' themselves</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hallucinations are possible to have on digital screens, meaning the hallucination many continue when looking at a video camera</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The person suffering with schizophrenia would likely come up with a delusion to explain the absence of the person, such as it being invisible to a camera</p>
</li>
<li>It all varies on the severity of the person's symptoms at the time</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that summary was adequate, another big thank you to all of the responses, especially to those who I have quoted.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As another poster has pointed out, those kind of full-fledged visual hallucinations probably don't happen very often. </p>
<p>But I can say something to the more general question, in that there in research on how other kinds of hallucinations/delusions respond to this kind of evidence.  I'm thinking specifically of the case of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anosognosia" target="_blank">anosognosia</a> for hemiplegia, in which a patient following brain damage is unaware that they have a limb that they can't move.  When asked to lift their arm, they insist that it has moved, even though everyone can plainly see that it hasn't.  </p>
<p>There are isolated case reports where patients have been put in front of a mirror, to make sure they are looking directly at their limb from a 3rd person point of view, and they continue to insist that it is moving. </p>
<p>However, there is a <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19428388" target="_blank">recent published study</a> in which a patient with anosognosia was shown video of herself, and this instantly resolved the condition. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vast majority of schizophrenic hallucinations are <strong>not</strong> visual, they are auditory.  It's popular in pop culture and media to portray hallucinations as crisp, realistic visual hallucinations- this doesn't really reflect schizophrenia accurately. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
