		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For a small amount, every molecule would continue to move unimpeded along whatever trajectory it has when you release it, so it would dissipate in all directions. Each molecule would be subject to the gravitational effect of whatever celestial mass it encounters. If you release a planet-full amount of it, then its total mass would cause it to exert enough gravitational pull to stay together as a blob. The center of the blob may register enough pressure to liquefy. You may be able to breathe if you happen to be at the position where pressure is close to Earth's atmospheric pressure, if you're lucky enough that this position coincides with the center of the blob. If it is on the outskirts instead then it means that the blob's mass is enough that you will continue to fall towards the center, with progressive increase in pressure, which would likely kill you, especially if the center is liquid oxygen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For small amounts, it would just disperse.  If you have HUGE amounts of it (like the size of a large planet), it will have enough mass to clump together.  However, things like solar winds will also play a role in dispersing it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you released a small amount (like a room full of only O2) it would disperse in the general direction it was released. </p>
<p>In the presence of other large gravity (planet), it could eventually attract to the planet.</p>
<p>In the presence of a star, the solar pressure would carry it away.</p>
<p>You have a container of some sort holding it. Because it has a gas, it is under pressure. The pressure of the gas will vent in the direction of the opening. Because you have gas going in one direction, the container will begin to move in the opposite direction. Thank you, Sir Newton.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason a small amount disperses is because the individual molecules are moving at hundreds of miles per hour- the only reason gases take so long to spread in a room is because they're hitting the particles already there, like moving through a busy room.</p>
<p>Think of how quickly air fills a vacuum. That's how quickly it moves when there's nothing stopping it, like in space.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Newton's laws.  Everything in motion continues in a straight line until it is acted upon by an outside force.</p>
<p>Assuming it has exit velocity from Earth's gravity it keeps going in a straight line until it gets pulled into another celestial objects gravity well, or until another molecule or atom attracts it electromagnetically.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
