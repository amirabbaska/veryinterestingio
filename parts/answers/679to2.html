		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If the game has a small dev team, and wants funding/non-intentional testing they can release early access.  Some early access games just get ignored by their devs after a while (which is sad), but the dev company has no obligation to release a finished product.  And steam has no obligation to keep hosting games that dev companies don't finish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In my experience, games stay in early access because they're trying to see what works. Subnautica is a good example of this: it's an underwater survival game that has been in early access for a long time now. Its release date has been pushed back several times, and for good reason. While the game has a great concept and good gameplay/mechanics, it is plagued by many bugs, glitches and flat-out errors. Its notorious for running slowly and shakily, even on some higher-end computers. Thanks to early access, they've been able to prioritize these errors from community feedback, figuring out what to do and how to do it while keeping the fans happy. For example, they've been able to squash bugs quickly because the community finds them for them.</p>
<p>TL;DR- It's so devs can work on the game to make it better and eventually prepare it for release.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They allow it because the market allows it.</p>
<p>Personally I only allow myself to have a certain number of alpha games.  </p>
<p>I allow myself 2 non-VR alpha games at a time.</p>
<p>One of those has to come out of alpha before I'll get another.  Which means I avoid all that other alpha stuff out there until either IT comes out of alpha, or one of my other two VR titles come out of alpha.  </p>
<p>I make an exception for VR and allow myself more of those on a case by case basis, because so much VR is small studio indie experimental stuff at the moment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
