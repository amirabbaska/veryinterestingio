		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> It could be diffraction. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4yolbi/when_i_hold_two_fingers_together_and_look_through/d6pp2ft" target="_blank">An optical physicist offers an interpretation from diffraction here</a>.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/4yolbi/when_i_hold_two_fingers_together_and_look_through/d6poole" target="_blank">And a psychologist who studies vision offers a explanation from the eye here</a>. Keep in mind that different people, with different visual acuities and corrective lenses, holding their hands different ways, and using different light sources could be seeing either effect!</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> So I just did this and I'm surprised it worked. I held my fingers about 1 mm apart and held the slit right in front of my eye and I actually saw a dark line or two between my fingers, though I'm not sure I have a good explanation for what it is.</p>
<p>A simple experiment may disprove the diffraction interpretation. I held my finger-slit a few centimeters over my desk and allowed light to shine through the slit. There were no visible fringes, so there is no diffraction (but this could be because I don't have a good light source). I suspect the trick is happening in the eye or brain.</p>
<p>Though it could be diffraction. A 1 mm slit, at a distance of 5 cm from the screen (your eye) should produce fringes 25 cm wide - about the width of a hair, consistent with what some people in the comments have seen. Though there are problems with this interpretation, diffraction is wavelength dependent so people in rooms with white light should expect rainbows, which I'm not seeing. </p>
<p>Depending on your light sources and how you hold your hands, you may see different things. Some people in the comments may be seeing optical tricks in the eye due to blur and lack of focus, but other people may be seeing diffraction bands, but I'm not one of them. If anyone has anything to add, please do. This is definitely the most fun I've ever had staring at my hands. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> Holy shit I just tried it again with a monochromatic source in a dark room. I totally see a bunch of fringes that look a lot like a single slit diffraction pattern. I get them if I focus at a distance, and lose them if I focus on my fingers. I'm now convinced I see the diffraction fringes with the width of about a hair. If you want to do what I did, take either your laptop or an LED to a dark room, hold your fingers parallel with as small a separation you can manage, close one eye and hold your fingers about 1-2 inches (3-5 cm cm) in front of your open eye. Focus your eyes to the light source. Adjust; slowly open and close the slit between your fingers and move your hand back and forth <a href="https://www.itp.uni-hannover.de/~zawischa/ITP/bildchen/spalt1.png" target="_blank">You might be able to see a set of vertical bars, similar to this.</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>TL;DR: I made the assumption that it was purely an ocular phenomenon and found evidence that it does have partial impact.</em></p>
<p><em>However, I have had vision corrective surgery. Can someone with good eyesight (especially no astigmatism) please repeat my experiments?</em></p>
<p>To play devil's advocate, let's assume for a second that it is not fringe diffraction. What else could it be?</p>
<p>The eye has a single lens, but a large <strong>curved</strong> detection area. That means there is the possibility that different parts of the retina will see slightly different angles of the object when the object is brought inside a critical minimum distance.</p>
<p>Ok, following that line of thought, there should be some quick checks to confirm if it is possible that it is just an illusion.</p>
<p>1)  The illusion would only work when you fingers are very close to your eye. </p>
<p>Yes! This appears to happen. However using two credit cards about 1/2 mm apart gives much cleaner lines than using your fingers loosely spread.</p>
<p>2)  Thin objects, like needles and string should also have multiple images. </p>
<p>Yes! A thin string appear to do the same. Of course, edge diffraction is a possibility here.</p>
<p>3)  You should be able to observe both the top and bottom face of a thin and  wide object (like a credit card). </p>
<p>Yes! But surprisingly I had the assumption backwards. You can see multiple versions of the near edge, but your eye resolves only a single far edge.</p>
<p>4)  And finally, to absolutely discount diffraction, you should be able to observe the same illusion on writing on a flat object, like lines on a piece of paper.</p>
<p>Only a partial yes. There is a distinct widening of the lines on a piece of notebook paper. It didn't resolve into multiple lines.</p>
<p>Taking 1 to 4 together gives us evidence that ocular focal characteristics is at least partially responsible. </p>
<p>I would be much more convinced if I could see multiple lines on a piece of paper, however the widening of the line might be the only way your eye resolves a flat object.</p>
<p>My overall conclusion is that ocular focal characteristics cause an apparent enlarging of a nearby object. This allows us to &quot;observe&quot; diffraction bands through a wider slit than is normally possible. Thus, a 1-2 mm gap between fingers appears to have diffraction bands. However, when compared to the bands in a narrower slit between two credit cards, you can definitely tell the difference in quality of the bands. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, so I've been doing this like this:
Close one eye, look with just one eye, look out your window or toward some bright background at an object in the distance.
The sky is perfect for this, it has to be bright background.
Hold your two fingers up and look through them but keep focus in the distant object (can be distant treetops for example.)
In other words, you don't have to hold your fingers close to your eye.</p>
<p>You'll see it has to do with the fact that the finger is &quot;unfocused&quot; and when the fingers are unfocused they get blurred edges.
If you look closely you'll see the dark lines even using just one finger.
but they get Stronger when two blurry finger-outlines overlap.</p>
<p>the blurry fingeroutlines appear like ... when you see double by crossing your eyes then you see two images, but the blurry outlies are MORE than two, and when two blurry finger-outlines overlap, some of those doublettes overlap and enhance eachother by overlapping eachother, just like waves do. And Those who overlap Just right, become dark lines.</p>
<p>...And I think the way the blurry finger-outlines become Blurred is a function of our eyes and how they work..</p>
<p>SORRY FOR MY ENGLISH... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
