		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most snot gets eaten (cilia push it down the back of your throat). If not, the moisture from your snot either gets reabsorbed by the mucosal lining, or it evaporates, leaving a crunchy booger that flies out when you're not paying attention. If you don't pick it for a long time and don't move or generate enough air pressure to move the booger it can actually stick around for quite a while, even long enough to cause an infection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
