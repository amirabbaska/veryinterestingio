		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you mean redshift due to a doppler effect, then energy is still conserved <em>in an inertial reference frame</em>. A doppler shift changes reference frame by moving at a different velocity when the shift is observed.</p>
<p>If you mean in general relativity, then there is no conservation of energy in this case. (Energy is not in general conserved in general relativity.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I always think of it as lost kinetic energy. Gravitational redshift is caused by photons going &quot;uphill&quot; effectively.</p>
<p>With redshift due to motion, the photon the right energy in the frame of reference of the source object, but less in the frame of reference of the observer.</p>
<p>This is obviously a gross simplification, and needs relativistic corrections, but its a simple way to explain. Imagine a bullet fired backwards from a train that is travelling at near bullet speed. On the train it moves like a bullet. To a person on the ground , the bullet moves slowly with little energy.</p>
<p>Photons aren't bullets, they appear to be moving at c to both observers, but the idea is the same.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
