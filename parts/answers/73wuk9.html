<p>According to the article, even when a human has a few tumors which are stable there may already be metastatic cancer cells detectable in their blood - i.e. the tumors are shedding that.  Yet in many patients these do not cause additional tumors (i.e. there is no rampant metastatis or spread/re-seeding in another place of the cancer cells etc.).  This is contrary to the layman understanding of tumors and cancers - where just having <strong>any</strong> cancer cells shedding from the tumor are seen as being potential metastasis agents - i.e. almost like every such cancer cell that is loose in the bloodstream can lodge somewhere and create another tumor.  But this article suggests the reality is something different - i.e. actually cancer cells are being shed all the time, and don't necessarily create new tumors.  And when they do create tumors, they tend to favor certain organs more.  The idea being suggested is that actually humans may have a pretty robust system working <strong>against</strong> cancer all the time - it's just when that fails that you find metastatis taking place.  Again I am not an expert to comment on these things - that is just my reading of what the article seems to be suggesting.  But this idea that cancer cells are being shed by tumors all the time - is scary.  But then the idea that despite that constant barrage, new tumors happen only in certain special conditions - is heartening.  Because it suggests cancer cells do not hold all the cards - there are other factors (i.e. the &quot;soil&quot; or conditions in the patient's body - which may depend on immune system, as well as organ to organ variation in how welcoming the conditions are for cancer cells to lodge and grow into tumors in that location).</p>
<p>This suggests that it may be possible that in cancer patients, and possibly even in non-cancer patients (or undetected cancer humans) there may already be metastatic cancer cells running around in their blood.  Except those cancer cells are not taking root elsewhere.  This is what the article discusses - the idea of looking at cancer not just from the point of view of the cancer cell, but from point of view of the &quot;soil&quot; i.e. what causes already-prolific cancer cells to NOT take root (example being patients with a few stable tumors who are shedding cancer cells, but they are not taking root beyond a few places).</p>
<p>If this view of cancer is correct - it could mean blood transfusions from even a presumed non-cancer patient could be dangerous.  And it is dangerous for sure when that donation is taken from a known cancer patient - because even though they are cured i.e. their existant cancer cells are not taking root, they might do so in another patient.</p>
<p>They give the example of cancer patients who have gone in to remission and seem to be long-term cured - yet when their organ was donated to someone else - that recipient developed aggressive cancer.  The idea being that for some reason in the donor the immune system or &quot;soil&quot; so to speak had become hostile or conditions were not right for cancer cells to prosper as tumors.  But in another patient (i.e. different &quot;soil&quot; - using that analogy again) - those same cancer cells may find a more supportive environment for those cancer cells to grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some cancers (like leukemia) go into remission. Other cancers (like melanoma) don’t go into remission; patients are considered “NED” meaning no evidence of disease. Doctors don’t see any cancer but it could, in theory, still be present. Cancers like melanoma can travel through the vascular (blood) system, so cancer patients cannot donate. </p>
<p>My son was diagnosed with melanoma when he was 3. It’s super rare in kids, and unlike adult melanomas it’s due to genetics rather than sun exposure. Protect your skin, and see a dermatologist regularly!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had leukemia and I’m unable to donate blood. From what I understand, it is because my blood is more susceptible to getting leukemia again than the average person. So donating my blood would increase that risk for the recipient. Same reason I can’t donate plasma or be an organ donor.</p>
<p>Someone please correct me if I’m wrong, but I think that’s what I remember doctors telling me. Being unable to donate blood or plasma or register as an organ donor has been a real bummer. </p>
<p>Edit: this comment blew up! i’m honored, thank you everyone for your replies! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I lost an eye to melanoma. I am now &quot;cancer free&quot; but need to be rechecked once a year. (used to be every 3 months) Those little bastard cancer cells can migrate and lay dormant. Then suddenly kapow, they shit their shit. I need to hit the Mayo for the next 15 years. So on the off chance that one of those little cells hitch a ride in the blood bag, no donating for me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Even if there's no detectable cancer ie remission, there might be some stray cancerous cells in such a donor, which could mutate and cause cancer in the recipient after a transfusion. It's unlikely, but statistically possible, so standard practice is to bar cancer survivors from donating blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
