<p>There's a lot more variation for dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets, though even then most orbit in more or less the same plane.</p>
<p>What you probably don't have is a true sense of scale (because most people don't). Space is <em>really big</em>. <a href="https://www.noao.edu/education/peppercorn/pcmain.html" target="_blank">https://www.noao.edu/education/peppercorn/pcmain.html</a> gives a great perspective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, they pretty much do line up. Not exactly, but close. The way a solar system forms is from a huge cloud of dust particles. It begins rotating in one direction after the random movements of the particles begin canceling out through collisions; eventually there are more particles moving in <em>some</em> direction than all others, and so you've got a rotating disc of dust (kind of like Saturn's rings, but millions of times more massive).</p>
<p>Due to the mutual gravitational pull among the dust, they will begin converging in the center to form a star. The leftovers, too far to have already been pulled in, will then converge upon themselves and become planets. The dust in Mars's orbit was all more attracted to each other than to the dust that would become Earth, and so it became a planet.</p>
<p>And as for the shape of the orbits, that's pretty much correct, too. All orbits are elliptical, never circular. However, the eccentricity of the orbit, which is the measure of how elongated the elliptical path is, is often very low. So the planets do all orbit in elliptical orbits at slightly different angles, but it looks very similar to circular orbits on a flat plane.</p>
<p>The thing that truly gets misrepresented is the distance. Space is extremely vast. The distance between the Earth and its moon is enough to fit every other planet between them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm guessing that it seems like a huge coincidence that the planets mostly orbit in the same plane, right? Thus your skepticism?</p>
<p>That's a good instinct, but in this case, there's actually a physical explanation: when you have a large rotating cloud, like the mass that formed the solar system, it naturally tends to flatten into a disk. Planets formed out of that disk, and largely kept the same inclination, thus, it seems like we formed in a row by freak accident, but it's actually what makes the most sense.</p>
<p>You see similar disks in other places, too: the rings of Saturn, the accretion disks around a black hole, even the Milky Way itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the basics are this - the &quot;5th grade&quot; understanding is that the sun is the &quot;anchor&quot; of the solar system, and all planets go around it in circular orbits, in the same direction, in the same plane, all centered around the center of the sun. At least, that was MY 5th grade understanding of the solar system. So what's right and wrong there?</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>All planets go around it in circular orbits - not quite correct. All orbits are elliptical, but most are fairly circular. &quot;Orbital eccentricity&quot; is the measurement of how circular an orbit is, where 0 = circle. Earth's orbital eccentricity around the sun is 0.0167. Mercury is the most eccentric planet at 0.2056.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_eccentricity</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All planets orbit in the same direction - true. Viewed from above all planets orbit the sun counter clockwise (same direction of rotation of the sun). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All planets orbit in the same plane - mostly true. &quot;Orbital inclination&quot; is the measurement of an orbit to a reference plane, and there are three main reference planes you can use in the solar system to define a planet's inclination. The most used is the &quot;ecliptic&quot;, which is the Earth's orbit around the sun, so by definition the Earth's inclination is 0. Mercury is the most inclined at 7°, but most planets are around 2° of the ecliptic. You can also use the plane of the sun's equator or the &quot;invariable plane&quot;. The invariable plane is the defined as the plane passing perpendicular through the center of mass of the solar system. Since the gas giants make up most of the non-solar mass, they are the least inclined in this plane. The Earth has an inclination of 1.57° from the invariable plane.

</li>
<li>All planets orbit the center of the sun as the anchor of the solar system - close but not really true. Two or more things orbiting each other will orbit a point that represents the center of mass between them, called the barycenter. For a simple two body system this can be thought of as a &quot;fixed&quot; point around which the two will orbit. In the Earth-Moon system, for example, the barycenter is point 4,670km from the center of the Earth. Since the Earth has a radius of 6,380km, this orbital point is inside the Earth but not at the center. Since the sun makes up 99.8% of the mass of the solar system, the barycenter is very close to the center sun but not always within it. Since there are many planets orbiting the sun, the barycenter is constantly moving due to the changing position of all the planets. Jupiter, with 2.5x the mass of everything else in the solar system combined, has the largest effect on the solar system barycenter. Sometimes the barycenter of the solar system is within the radius of the photosphere of the sun (in 1990 it was almost at the center), sometimes it's outside (in 1984 it was quite a distance outside, but still within the corona of the sun).
