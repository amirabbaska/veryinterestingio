		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insulation and food.  Living beings generate heat through metabolism.  What determines if you freeze to death isn't the temperature, it's whether or not heat leaves your body faster than it can generate more.</p>
<p>The bigger the temperature difference, the faster you cool, sure, but the better insulated you are, the slower you cool.</p>
<p>In short, the same reason you feel warm when you put on a coat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is unrelated to penguins, but there are fish that survive in the sub-freezing temperatures of the Southern Ocean (the salt depresses the freezing point, so the water temperature can get down to about 28 degrees F). The fish have special proteins in their blood which prevent it from freezing. A regular fish would not be able to survive. It's pretty neat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I should have included this in the original question, but what about  animals like polar bears that don't have the strength in numbers to keep warm? The same principles still apply?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By huddling together, their emitted body heat goes to keeping other penguins warm instead of being lost to the air. If you watch a timelapse of huddling penguins, you'll see the whole thing slowly rotates and penguins from the outside work their way into the middle, and then out again.</p>
<p>One big lump of penguin can retain more of its total body heat than a single penguin can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
