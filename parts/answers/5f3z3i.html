		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their are many reason to hate Kissinger, a lot of them will be covered here. I want to focus on the one that stands out to me, and makes me hate this sorry excuse for a &quot;human being&quot;.</p>
<p>That in an attempt to win himself favor with Nixon, and further his political career, he knowingly and willfully extended the Vietnam War by sabotaging the first Paris Peace talks in 1968 (for which he was an adviser for) in order to weaken LBJ's Democrat party in there bid for the 1968 presidency. Allowing Nixon to run at an advantage, and ultimately win.</p>
<p>This act makes him responsible for [21,126]  (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War_casualties" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War_casualties</a>)  Kia or Mia American servicemen. As well as an untold number of North, South, Cambodian, and Laotian combatants and civilians.    </p>
<p>To put the cherry on top of this whole shitstorm of political fuckery is that in 1974 when Kissinger when back to Paris to re-negotiate peace between the North and South the treaty that he finally got both sides to sign was almost the exact same one he had negotiated in 68' and then killed to advance his career. </p>
<p>There's a great [Documentary] (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5cwDFwteIY" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5cwDFwteIY</a>) on it, that if you can spend an hour of you life watching is a very good sum up</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Initiated the illegal expansion of the war into non- combatant Cambodia &amp; Laos, dropping thousands of bombs (which are still killing people today) and creating conditions that brought about the rise of Pol Pot &amp; the Khmer Rouge &amp; the deaths of millions. This was done <em>after</em> the so-called Paris Peace accords and was a flagrant violation of international law. The fact that at it was done, at least partly, to distract attention from the growing Watergate scandal makes it even more reprehensible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He is a proponent of realpolitik. That means he will make deals with whomever if it suits the needs of the US at the time. If it suited the US to make a pact with Hitler, then a pact with Hitler would be made. </p>
<p>That stance of realpolitik led to some very controversial (often hawkish) decisions being made. E.g., He was involved in some bombings during the Vietnam period that had high civilian casualties. In another way of framing it, he was involved in many deaths and many decisions he has taken have been considered morally bankrupt. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>He was one of he most bloodthirsty politicians in the history of the United States. He illegally expanded the Vietnam war into Laos and Cambodia, dropping almost 4 million tons of bombs on the area between 1969 and 1973. His expansion of the war into the entire area indirectly led to the rise of Pol Pot. Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge were responsible for murdering roughly 1/6th of the total Cambodian population. He also supported the coup and subsequent rule of Chilean Dictator Augusto Pinochet who was one of the worst dictators in history. </p>
<p>He was the Vietnam-era version of Donald Rumsfeld, except with a German accent. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
