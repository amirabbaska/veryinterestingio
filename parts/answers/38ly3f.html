		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anglerfish males. They don't sleep or even eat. In fact, they don't have the organs to do so even if they wanted.</p>
<p>They hatch and have to find a female in a short period of time. If they don't, they die. If they do, they fuse into the females and survive as a parasite. Most of their body parts die off, except for the reproductive organs which the female can use whenever she needs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dolphins have an interesting sleep cycle as they would drown if they were ever totally unconscious. They shut down one half of their brain at a time, closing the corresponding eye. Whales, Orcas and Porpoises sleep in the same &quot;Unihemispheric slow wave sleep&quot; manner.</p>
<p>This is not due to life-span but they are never fully unconcious.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your definition of sleep, but it's not really related to lifecycle. Giraffes, for instance, sleep no more than 30 minutes per day scattered in little micronaps. </p>
<p>To try and answer your question: no, not really. Sponges don't sleep, of course, but basically any form of life complex enough to sleep does so. Even jellyfish, corals and insects have periods of lower activity which can be defined as sleep.</p>
<p>EDIT: And those who keep saying &quot;mayfly&quot; are wrong. Mayflies actually can have pretty long lifespans, for an insect; they can remain in their larval form for years at times, and they most definitely eat and sleep during that period.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, it depends on your definition of sleep, but Hummingbirds dont sleep, because that would kill them because their metabolism is so high. Instead they go in to hibernation. Their temperature is lowered to more than half and their heartbeat sometimes slowed down o 20 times slower than during the day.</p>
<p>This might be totally irrelevant, but at least someone might have learned something today. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing is that &quot;sleep&quot; is a relatively subjective definition. For humans(and other relatively large organisms), we define sleep by behavioural states (e.g. laying down, less responsive to environmental stimuli etc). But we can often measure brain waves to quantify these changes.   </p>
<p>For other organisms, like the fruitfly, we have to use slightly different criteria. So for them, we measure response to being disturbed, and you find a circadian difference in responses. <a href="http://www.cscb.northwestern.edu/jcpdfs/hendricks00.pdf" target="_blank">It's referred as &quot;sleep-like state&quot; since, we can't know if it's sleep</a>. But it looks like it could be sleep.  </p>
<p>And since there has been circadian rhythms found in even single celled organisms, it's possible to for them to have 'sleep-like' states.   </p>
<p>I don't know enough zoology to even know all the short lived organism, so I can't answer your question. But I suspect that as long as it lives even for a little while (i.e. more than a day or two), it reasonable to assume it has one. I do know that the Mayfly (as other have mentioned) doesn't meet this criteria since it lives for a few years as a larvae, then a very short time as an adult. Anyway, pubmed also reveled that not even one paper has been done on this insect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
