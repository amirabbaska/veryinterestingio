		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mesentery got a promotion in name from supportive tissue (to the small and large intestines) to apparently the classification of organ. It's always been there. We've known about it for a long time. General surgeons who work in the abdomen cut and slice into the mesentery all the time when resecting bowel. It's not that mysterious in anatomy. In function, we think it provides structural tether to the bowels (anchors to midine of body inside belly cavity) and a soft tissue matrix to allow arteries and veins and lymphatic vessels to connect from bowel to central vasculature. Further organ-level physiology and function remains to be revealed. I'm a physician.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's basically a fan shape (like the Asian ones which you flick open in Mulan) - the top part are your small intestines, the bottom bit is attached to a relatively small line across the back of your body. The fan bit is the mesentery.</p>
<p>It anchors the small intestine (9m of tubing!) to a small area (about 15-30cm in length). It also conveys blood vessels to supply the small intestine along its course. </p>
<p>The fan structure is then pleated like a Scottish kilt to fold into the abdomen. Having played around with it in the dissection room, it's a very smooth structure which allows some sliding and makes it difficult to tie knots in the small intestine.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We've known about the mesentery for ages. If you think about the structure of your intestines, because they're so long they need bloody supply everywhere and you don't want them to get knotted up. The mesentery solves both these problems, its basically a massive sheet which is connected to the intestines everywhere to stop it folding it on itself and also providing a blood supply.</p>
<p>The only reason this 'news' is surfacing is because it has been rebranded from supporting tissue to organ. The definition of organ is: a part of an organism which is typically self-contained and has a specific vital function. So I suppose you can call it an organ now, its vital function being supporting tissue for the bowels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mesentery is a single mass of &quot;connective&quot; tissue that connects from the rectum to the small intestine beneath the stomach and to the backbone. It's function so far is to hold the intestines in place so they aren't sloshing around your abdomen. Whether it's an actual new organ remains to be seen as apparently most have a unique function and cell type distinguishing them from connective tissue or muscle etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
