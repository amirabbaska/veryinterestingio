		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, thank you for doing this AMA. I would like to ask your opinion of 'designer babies'? I'm not really talking about removing genetic disease, but parents picking and choosing desirable traits for their children: making them stronger, better looking, smarter etc. Do you think it could potentially create an even greater disparity between the rich and poor? Richer parents being able to afford to give their children far better traits than the poor for example. Or is this unlikely? </p>
<p>Thanks again, I'll be sure to pick up your book! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is anyone thinking about or writing about the possibility that intelligence is a harmful trait for an organism, for the reasons that intelligence allows us to interfere with natural selection and thus potentially weaken the sustainability of the species, inadvertently? Perhaps that's why there are no alien space travelers... because a species that develops that level of intelligence is highly likely to go extinct prior to achieving that ?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mike Judge's controversial film Idiocracy presents the idea of a dystopian society based on dysgenics. </p>
<p>Is there any worry that we'd actually see significant declines in human health and intelligence if more intelligent humans have less offspring, and less intelligent have more?</p>
<p>Are we seeing any evidence of this happening now?</p>
<p>Thank you!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As we can manipulate our environment to suit our bodies better and better will our evolution be more subtle, like disease resistance and immunity, rather than more anatomical evolution? Or as we become more reliant on technology will our bodies change to suit?
Edit: thanks for posting, this is a great topic!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Could we adapt our bodies to withstand, say, lower levels of oxygen for longer periods or higher levels of CO2? Or is our fundamental biochemistry not that malleable?</p>
<p>How about the same with cosmic radiation?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
