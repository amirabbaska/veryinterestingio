		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer is evolution. As /u/friend1949 said it's all about perspective and what we are used too seeing. The deep ocean is an environment totally unlike anything we experience on a day to day basis, and life has evolved to survive in those conditions; Lack of sunlight means skin pigments become pointless to protect the skin, meaning most deep see animals are full or partly translucent; Why would a fish need bones or a tough exoskeleton when it spends it's life floating in water and not coming into contact with a hard physical surface it's entire life; They develop big eyes and bioluminescence to hunt and evade prey/predators. There's nothing about the deep ocean that creates monsters, it's purely a very different environment that we are not used too. If humanity had evolved to live underground in cave systems instead of the surface we would look and act very different to how we do now, and wouldn't consider monsters of the deep so strange.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They look like monstrosities to you because they're very different from what you're used to. They look very different because they live in conditions that are very different to the ones you're familiar with. The deep sea is dark, cold but most of all it's a desert. Very little nutrients make it all the way down there before being snatched up by other life.</p>
<p>For starters that means life has to be very energy efficient because very little new energy comes into this system. Which is why a lot of deep sea life are either filter feeders or ambush predators.</p>
<p>Most predators fail more often during hunts than they succeed, simple fact of life. Down there, hunters can't afford to fail too often. Every failure expends energy without getting a return. So a lot of the monstrous looking adaptations deal with successfully catching any and all prey that comes within reach. Numerous long fangs intended to catch slippery prey and hold them successfully. Oversized mouths or even stretchy bodies so a predator doesn't have to pass up prey because it's too big for it's mouth. Some deep sea fish can eat prey larger than themselves.</p>
<p>Along the same lines in such utter darkness light becomes everything. Oversized eyes for seeing every scrap of detail they can manage. Some predators use light to lure prey. Some life forms use light to disorientate the hyper sensitive eyes of predators or to communicate and actually find a mate in the deep, dark emptiness.</p>
<p>Finding friendly faces is such a big challenge down there that some fish simply won't let a partner go once they found one. When the male angler fish finds a female, he bites into her body and their bodies slowly fuse together. He'll receive nutrition through their now shared bloodstream and she'll receive his seed for fertilising her eggs. Eventually the male will atrophy into little more than a pair of testicles attached to the female.</p>
<p>Light can even be camouflage. In the deep sea above is brighter than below. Some fish use weak bioluminescence on their bellies to make themselves invisible against the light coming in from above. While at the same time having dark backs to disappear against the inky depths when seen from below.</p>
<p>And the differences go well beyond what you'd expect. Bright red for instance is a perfect camouflage color down there. Have you ever noticed how things tend to look a little greenish or blueish underwater? Water acts as a filter to light. Colours with a higher wavelength like red get filtered out first while colours with a shorter wavelength get filtered out last (same reason tv's in living rooms look bluish when you look in from the outside at night).</p>
<p>Without any red light to reflect down there, red is a perfect camouflage color and many fish have a creepy reddish skin color. Of course for every defense there's weapons that counter that defense. Since there's no red light down there, most deep sea fish eyes can't even detect right light, their eyes evolved a sensitivity to other wavelengths. </p>
<p>So one fish in particular evolved eyes that <em>can</em> see red light... because it has a bioluminescent light that emits red light specifically. Effectively it gives him a search light that highlights red fish yet at the same time no fish can see it's searchlight.</p>
<p>Anyway in short deep sea life looks radically different because they're dealing with radically different challenges than the rest of the ocean.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The concept of monstrosity is in your point of view. I am sure to a boy monster the girl monster is very cute.</p>
<p>So your question is, In a  part of the world very strange to us, with tremendous pressures, cold, lack of any light, and being in salt water where creatures without legs are the norm, do we see some really strange looking creatures who do not resemble anything we are used to seeing. We are used to giraffes with long necks, snakes without legs who wiggle around, birds who fly through the air, but creatures in places we never go look strange. Why is that?</p>
<p>Well we never go there and see them on a daily basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
