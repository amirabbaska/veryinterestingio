		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s sensory overload. </p>
<p>Your body has independent receptors for hot and cold; but occasionally when you trigger them with too hot of a source, both hot and cold will react. The term for it is paradoxical cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is bad at sensing “hot” and “cold”,  but it’s excellent at sensing heat transfer, or changes in temperature. When you dunk your hand in hot/cold water, your body immediately picks up a huge spike of heat transfer, but it takes a second to figure out what direction (body to cold water vs. hot water to body). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have warm and cold receptors in your skin. Each usually fire individually warm receptors detect temperature increase, cold receptors temperature decreases.</p>
<p>When you put your hand in boiling water/on a hot stove/ice cold water. All receptors fire called paradoxical cold. </p>
<p>This is probably a random chance mutation that was advantageous because it essentially gives you a third &quot;sense&quot; you can now sense hot, cold and extreme temperature. This allows you to react much more quickly to things likely to cause damage to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
