		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acid reflux is a disease consequential to failure of the antirreflux mechanisms (sounds obvious but I'm getting somewhere here) </p>
<p>We, humans, have quite a few of these mechanisms, some of which are simply absent in fish in general. </p>
<p>They have no diaphragm - the muscle that separates thorax from abdomen in us - and that is part of the valve that keeps acid below the oesophagus-stomach transition. We also have an angle at this transition that helps us when the stomach is full, and they don't seem to have that (on a Google image search for various kinds of fish and their anatomy).</p>
<p>Gravity is also not going to be of much help since in most species the stomach is at the same level as pretty much everything else in the digestive tract. </p>
<p>So I can't tell you for sure that they do our do not, but those are some interesting facts about it. Maybe the only way to answer this would be to perform pH metrics in their tiny oesophagus, as even if we found indirect consequences like metaplasia or oesophagitis we wouldn't be able to ascertain the cause.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to [this](<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2013/12/03/how-the-platypus-and-a-quarter-of-fishes-lost-their-stomachs/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2013/12/03/how-the-platypus-and-a-quarter-of-fishes-lost-their-stomachs/" target="_blank">https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/phenomena/2013/12/03/how-the-platypus-and-a-quarter-of-fishes-lost-their-stomachs/</a></a>) link- a quarter of teleost fishes (bony fish, most fishes) have lost their stomach and therefore do not produce any acid. I believe that the other fish that do have a stomach will have stomach acid to properly digest food. As for the acid reflux question...i'm not sure!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unsure about reflux but they definitely have acids and enzymes that break down food. Also &quot;fish&quot; isnt really a useful term when talking about anatomy. Animals we call fish vary a lot due to hundreds of millions of years of evolutionary separation. A hagfish, for example is less related to an eel than an eel is to a dog. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
