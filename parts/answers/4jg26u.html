		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other answers are good but there are other interesting factors in play for specific nutrients.  </p>
<p>Potassium recommended daily intake in the United States is 4700mg.  Besides the fact that few people could swallow a pill that large, and that you're better off taking in potassium throughout the day rather than all at once, there's another factor that not many people know about.  The FDA only allows supplements to contain a maximum of 99mg of potassium per pill.  This is because a large, solid block of potassium slowly dissolving in your stomach could cause tissue damage.  The larger a pill is, the more time it takes to dissolve, and a large potassium pill could potentially eat a hole in your stomach. Besides limiting pills to 99mg of potassium, supplement makers are also forbidden from recommending that you take more than one pill at a time, since pills taken together could settle in the same spot in your stomach and cause damage.</p>
<p>So to get all your potassium from pills, not only would you need 47 of them, you'd need to space them out throughout the day.</p>
<p>Larger extended-release potassium pills are available by prescription.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in manufacturing making vitamins. Yes, it is possible to make one with 100% DV of vitamins, but not one with 100% DV of minerals</p>
<p>Label claims for vitamins have a lot to do with what's on the market. If your multi has 1500% for thiamin, it's because the marketing department looked at other multis on the market and thought that a multi with 1500% thiamin would be more competitive.</p>
<p>Minerals like calcium require much more material to get to 100% DV. For example, the 100% DV amount for thiamin is only 1.5 mg, but 100% DV for calcium is 1000 mg</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is generally divided by 'fat soluble' and 'water soluble' vitamins. Most water soluble vitamins are really hard to overdose on...like vitamin C. You can eat grams of the stuff and any extra just gets washed out in your urine. But, fat soluble vitamins like vitamin E can get stored in your fat cells and liver and reach a toxic level that will hurt you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of factors at play.  The three biggest factors are regulation, cost and volume.</p>
<p>Regulation plays a part in, e.g. preventing potassium supplements from exceeding 99mg when the RDA is around 5,000mg.  That's not because it's dangerous to take larger amounts, but because the FDA has taken it upon itself to engage in some misguided attempt to prevent a small minority of the population with a stomach disorder from injuring themselves when they take potassium outside of a food product.  Even these people will not typically experience problems with potassium when it's included in a pill with other minerals but that hasn't stopped them from passing their rule.</p>
<p>Next, cost is a huge factor.  If the pill is trying to market itself as containing &quot;more bio-available&quot; calcium in a form such as calcium citrate instead of the cheaper calcium carbonate, they may make their product more price-competitive with other vitamins by reducing the amount of calcium provided to 500mg or only 250mg.  Various vitamins and minerals all have different costs associated with them and if cutting back on one or more of them will have a significant effect on the final price, economic considerations will weigh on the final decisionmaking process.</p>
<p>Last: volume.  Most vitamins and minerals are only needed in trace amounts.  However, some are required in larger quantities.  Leaving aside the macronutrients and fiber, the human body needs large quantities of some minerals, such as:</p>
<pre><code>calcium       1g
sodium        2g
potassium     5g</code></pre>
<p>Pills that are also attempting to provide essential amino acids, fatty acids, choline or other nutrients needed in larger quantities may make for a larger volume of matter than many consumers can swallow comfortably.  That causes manufacturers to frequently limit their content of these nutrients as it is not possible to put everything the human body needs for a day into a single pill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, there is the fat soluble/water soluble thing.  Which is very important.</p>
<p>The other <em>major</em> one is sodium/potassium balance.</p>
<p>Go buy a bottle of potassium supplements, the strongest you can find in terms of RDA %.</p>
<p>You will notice it is extremely small, probably around 2%.</p>
<p>This is one of those elements that needs to be carefully balanced with sodium to keep your electrolytes in balance.</p>
<p>If you took a pill that was 100% RDA when you first woke up, dehydrated, with a sip of water, there is a very good chance it could turn out bad.</p>
<p>Regarding Thiamin (B1) this is a critical element in brain function.  Taking more then you need is not bad, your body will &quot;ignore&quot; it (fat/water soluble thing again).</p>
<p>Taking less than you need is <strong>very</strong> bad.</p>
<p>If you've ever heard of alcoholics getting &quot;wet brain&quot;, it's because they did not have adequate B1 in their system before it could be infused.  And there is no cure after that.</p>
<p>That is where you have people even in their 20s or 30s shuffling around in nursing homes (if they are not dead), and the brain damage can not be reversed.</p>
<p>A simple B1 pill (or, obviously, proper nutrition) would prevent it.</p>
<p>The gory details are here ... take your vitamins!  Or, don't drink so much that you forget to (or can't) eat food!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome (WKS) is the combined presence of Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) and Korsakoff's syndrome.  It is due to thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency, which can cause a range of disorders including beriberi, Wernicke's encephalopathy, and Korsakoff's psychosis.</p>
<p>Wernicke's encephalopathy and WKS is most commonly seen in people who are alcoholic, and only <strong>20% of cases are identified before death</strong>. </p>
