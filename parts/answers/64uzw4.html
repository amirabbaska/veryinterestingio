		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's caused by geological processes called mechanical weathering, transporting, and sorting. The previously formed rocks in the area are broken down by natural forces. I.e. water currents/waves, wind, ice expansion/melting, and tree roots breaking through rocks. These broken rock fragments or sediment deposits are then moved during a process called transportation. If it's a beach, then most likely the transport medium will be waves and ocean currents. </p>
<p>The sand is then sorted near the shore by how much force is involved in the transplant. Ex. Larger rocks deposited further from shore because the wave loses energy as it gets closer to shore and cannot move heavy objects. The energy in the waves, by the time it reaches shore, is just enough to move small grains. Usually beaches will have mostly the same sized grains make up the beach.</p>
<p>Notice that each beach has different sized sand grains. Some beaches have very fine sand. And some have very gritty large-grained sand. This is all due to the energy of the waves that reach the shore. The wave size is affected by the slope of the beach. Steep slopes lose energy faster, while gradual slopes lose energy slower. This is why Hawaii has huge waves. Some beaches have black sand. This is usually from volcanic activity near the beach that happens under water. The waves bring in whatever materials that it can push.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>sand forms from big rocks banging against each other to make little rocks which bang against each other to make coarse pebbles which bang against each other to make fine pebbles  which bang against each other to make sand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well sand is carried by rivers and deposited when energy dissipates.  So when the river's velocity drops as it enters a larger body of water the coarser material falls out of suspension.  Currents can then carry this sand away and push it along low lying coastal areas to form the beach.  Continuous wave action further erodes the grains. As the grains become smaller they also will get lighter.   Smaller grains are again picked up by wave action and carried into deeper water.  As you walk out from a beach the sediments under foot generally get finer due to the reduced energy found in deeper waters.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those saying it's from 'rocks breaking each other apart' - that's only the case for temperate 'beaches'. </p>
<p>The tropical white beaches we typically think of aren't made of 'rocks' but of biologically generated calcium carbonate. </p>
<p>Some proportion of that is broken down shells but a larger proportion is coral skeleton that's been chomped off and digested by parrotfish. </p>
