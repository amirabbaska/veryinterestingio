<p>A very durable, bright, cheap, and easily applicable road paint is very important. The slipperiness of that paint when wet is obviously not ideal, but whatever that paint is made of, I'm sure it scores very high in the durable, bright, and cheap categories.</p>
<p>Not all paint is the same. Modern road paint happens to be slippery when wet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;paint&quot; that you're thinking of isn't what we normally think of as paint. It's actually a layer of plastic melted onto the road surface! This layer of plastic is thick enough that it covers all of the rough imperfections on the road surface, leaving a smooth surface on top.</p>
<p>This slippery effect left by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoplastic_road_marking_paint" target="_blank">thermoplastic road markings</a> is now better understood, and the paint manufacturers now add rough additives like small glass beads to add a gritty texture to the plastic (as well as give it a reflective shine at night).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the materials in paints (whether enamel or latex) that allow them to be durable and flexible are naturally shiny and slick. So the more durable the paint, the slipperier it will be. </p>
<p>Some paints have sand mixed in to give grip (for stairs and pools usually), but since this costs more it’s not used for road markings. </p>
<p>In house paints semi gloss is the most durable, scrubbable, etc but is also very shiny due to the highest latex content. Flat paint has no sheen, a much lower latex content and is not washable- if you try to scrub a stain off a flat painted wall you’ll remove the paint at the same rate as the stain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of other top level responses are specific to roads and parking lots. I know little about that in specific.  But the initial question sounded like it may apply to all surfaces everywhere.</p>
<p>If that is the case, then the surface under the paint, total layers of paint, and any top coat treatment applied to the paint all matter as well.</p>
<p>A really rough concrete floor with a single layer of paint will still be very rough.   With dozens of layers of paint and then a good wax and buffing, it will be slippery even when not wet.</p>
<p>When you paint a deck, it is advisable to add something to the top two or three layers of paint, like crushed walnut shells.   This gives a texture that is a nuisance in bare feet, but amazing traction in the rain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Top comments are incorrect. Here is the answer. Road paint is called thermoplastic paint. And its an asphalt byproduct, called bitumen, or in simple terms rubber paint. The thermoplastic paint is rubber with a white/yellow die in it and gets molten at hight temperatures in order to be easily applied.</p>
<p>Crushed glass beads are inserted during installation of the paint in order to make it reflective. However these glass beads are the shape of a sphere thus sometimes slippery but that is not the response to the question.</p>
<p>The thermoplastic paint becomes slippery when no glass beads have been applied so it basically acts as molten rubber in the roadway making it highly slippery when wet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
