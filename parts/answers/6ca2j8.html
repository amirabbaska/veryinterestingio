<p>Well it turns out all molecules absorb at some wavelengths or another of light. They just aren't all visible. The wavelengths that molecules absorb at are specific to the individual bonds inside them. Similarly the wavelengths molecules emit when excited are specific to the bonds. </p>
<p>By measuring the wavelengths of light from distant planets we can get a feel for what molecules are in the atmosphere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Been a while but something along the lines of this...</p>
<p>Different molecules absorb certain wavelengths of light. In a lab we can kinda shine light though some molecules and then when viewing that light's spectrum, see which wavelengths are missing (absorbed by the molecules). So in a lab we can make a sort of spectral map for any type of molecule. &quot;When light shines though <em>these</em> molecules the remaining spectrum looks like this, and when we shine light though <em>those</em> molecules the remaining spectrum looks like that.</p>
<p>Now we just need to look at the remaining spectrum from the light of stars and see what wavelengths are missing and match it up to our lab made maps. &quot;The light from that star is passing though such and such type of molecules.&quot;</p>
<p>The cool thing is that there are many different types of molecules in a star, so we will see many many missing wavelengths, but we can match them up to maps we have and figure out all the types of molecules present in the star.</p>
<p><a href="http://sites.oglethorpe.edu/mrulison/files/2016/07/spectrum_binary-1698rt5.gif" target="_blank">Here is sort of an example</a> of two different spectral emission maps combined. The black lines are the wavelengths that have been absorbed by molecules. The top one is apparently from a star rich in hydrogen, and the middle is from a star with lots of heavier metals. The bottom is actually the light from the two stars (a binary system), but it's kind of the same type of spectral map you would see from one star with two different types of molecules blocking wavelengths.</p>
<p>EDIT: I just noticed that you specifically asked about planets, not stars. I've never looked into it, so take this with a grain of salt, but I can only imagine that it has to do with taking the spectral map of the star without the exoplanet in the way, and taking the spectral map of the star <em>with</em> the exoplanet in the way, and then somehow comparing the two.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astrophysicist chiming in here. There are essentially 3 things we can measure on exoplanets: radius, mass, and atmospheric content. I answered a similar question about the first two <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/space/comments/6box89/astronomers_discover_a_puffy_planet_with_the/dhowlgf/" target="_blank">here</a>. For HAT-P-26b, there are a few things I would like to address in terms of what the predicted atmospheric content is.</p>
<p>First off, the water detection. When an exoplanet passes in front of its host star, the light from the star will also go through the atmosphere of that exoplanet (assuming it has one). When light interacts with with the gas in the atmosphere it can be absorbed and scattered. This means that if we look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-spectrum_light" target="_blank">spectrum</a> of light, which is just the intensity split out into wavelength, then we can tell that certain parts of the spectra look different before and during the transit. In the case of HAT-P-26b, there was a clear <a href="https://d2ufo47lrtsv5s.cloudfront.net/content/sci/356/6338/628/F1.medium.gif" target="_blank">drop in the light intensity</a> that corresponds to water. Taking this spectra, you can do some computer modelling of the atmosphere and get some information about the content of said atmosphere. This is essentially how exoplanet spectroscopy works.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;found fewer heavy elements than they had expected&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now this is where the interpretation gets a little less straightforward. In astronomy, we like to use the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallicity" target="_blank">metallicity</a> which is essentially how much stuff is there other than Hydrogen and Helium in an astrophysical object (it doesn't have to be a metal). For HAT-P-26b, the scientists used the water content as a predictor of the total metallicity of the planet, and then compared that to the planets in our own Solar System, in particular Neptune and Uranus. They found that the metallicity was a lot lower than our Solar System. This is a fine approximation, but water isn't the normal &quot;species&quot; that we use to determine the metallcity in Neptune and Uranus. Methane is considered to be a more accurate tracer of metallicity. Further still, you have to consider the metallicity of the star that these planets orbit. HAT-P-26b's hosts star is considered &quot;metal poor&quot; by some estimates, meaning that you would expect any planets to also be metal poor.</p>
<p>So while the water detection is certainly a very interesting discovery, I don't necessarily agree with some of the interpretation. If anybody would like to read the full paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.04354" target="_blank">here</a> is a free link to it.</p>
<p>Edit: I would also like to direct people to /u/Astromike23 and his <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/6ca2j8/in_as_simple_a_way_as_possible_how_are_we_able_to/dhtat9j/" target="_blank">really great response</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>They can't using &quot;only a telescope&quot;.  They also need some sort of spectrograph.  </p>
<p>So our eyeballs only see three colors (one might argue 4 if you included rods, but whatever).  But light can have infinite different wavelengths.</p>
<p>When you shine light through a prism or diffraction grating, light is bent a different amount based on its wavelength.  Here's a silly picture of a lamp viewed through a diffraction grating I found in a little kids science book:</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/eNBO0CC.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/eNBO0CC.jpg</a></p>
<p>So the rainbow produced by the prism/diffraction grating, you have the different wavelengths separated by <em>distance</em>.  </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/WDHlMfh.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/WDHlMfh.jpg</a></p>
<p>Now this is a kids diffraction grating and a regular old camera, but it's the same basic idea as what fancy scientific equipment does.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of the spectrum emitted by that lamp (which has a compact flourescent bulb in it)</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/TCe6K2Z.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/TCe6K2Z.jpg</a></p>
<p>See some spots are brighter than others.  I looked up the spectrum of CFL bulbs online and found this graph, and overlaid the graph over the spectrum I produced </p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/IXZJzLU.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/IXZJzLU.jpg</a></p>
<p>Lines up pretty well, eh? :-D</p>
<p>Those spikes are associated with certain elements.  For instance, that bright blue spike on the left is emitted by mercury.  The bright green spike is terbium and mercury.  The bright red one is europium.  And so on.  The spectra of different elements and molecules has been categorized, so by looking at where the spikes are, we can tell what something is just by looking at the spikes.</p>
<p>So for stuff that doesn't glow, we can heat it until it glows, shine the light through a diffraction grating, and voila!</p>
<p>For things where that's not possible, we can do the inverse...  Shine full spectrum light on them (e.g. from a sun) and they will <em>absorb</em> at specific spots in the spectrum.  That's information is all categoried nicely for scientists too :-)</p>
<p>I wrote some software to process the images off the camera, and produced a similar graph to the one I found online using just the data from the pixels in my image.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/a3G0VpC.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/a3G0VpC.jpg</a></p>
<p>The red, green, and blue are because consumer digital cameras have a bayer filter over the sensors, so i'm not getting raw data, just data through red, green, or blue filters.  </p>
<p>And that's the story how I made a spectrometer with a digital camera and a kid's science book.  The scientists are doing the exact same thing, except with something <em>much</em> dimmer than a light bulb a couple feet from me and with <em>much</em> fancier, more expensive equipment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the answers here are saying, &quot;just take the spectrum of the planet.&quot; While that's the basic theoretical way to do it, in practice it's a lot tougher than just taking the planet's light and passing it through a prism, since that signal is almost always too weak for exoplanets.</p>
<p>Remember, the only way we can even detect that HAT-P-26b exists is because it passes directly in front of its parent star from our point of view - it's basically a very tiny eclipse. When we observe the star from Earth, the star's brightness drops by about 0.5% when the planet passes in front of it. If the planet were bigger, it would block more light during the eclipse; if the planet were smaller, it would block less light during the eclipse.</p>
<p>Now it turns out that water vapor is very good at absorbing light with certain colors. Specifically, water vapor will absorb infrared light with a wavelength around 1.4 microns (different wavelengths are just different colors), while letting most infrared light at other wavelengths pass through.</p>
<p>So, let's say there's lots of water vapor in HAT-P-26b's upper atmosphere. When we observe the eclipse, the amount of light from the star that's blocked out by the planet will depend on the wavelength of that light. Water vapor will absorb any 1.4-micron infrared light that passes through the upper atmosphere, but will let through infrared light of other wavelengths. The result is that the eclipse in 1.4 micron light will be deeper (more total light blocked) than in other wavelengths.</p>
<p>What we end up doing, then, is observing these eclipses in a lot of different wavelengths by placing different filters on the telescope that allows each wavelength to pass through. <a href="http://i.imgur.com/hYyQtgS.png" target="_blank">This graph</a> is from the original paper, showing all the different wavelengths the eclipse was observed in. The dip in the middle of each line there is how much light gets blocked for each wavelength during each eclipse.</p>
<p>When you then compare how deep the eclipse was for each wavelength, you end up with <a href="http://i.imgur.com/j9UoP3L.png" target="_blank">this graph</a>, also from the original paper. The black dots are what's important here (the colored lines are all just different models). The black dots around 1.4 microns are a lot higher than the rest, telling us that a lot more light near those wavelengths are blocked out during the eclipses, and so we can conclude that there must be a good deal of water vapor in the upper atmosphere blocking out that light.</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: We observe eclipses when the planet passes in front of the star in many different colors. Water vapor blocks out certain colors better than others, and we see deeper eclipses in those colors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
