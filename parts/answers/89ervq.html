<p>Are there analytical ways to determine an element's radioactivity without needing to observe anything</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are ways to roughly predict whether an element would be radioactive, but getting an actual quantitative result to any precision is not possible from first principles using theory, and even numerical methods will be at best very approximate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>Bismuth-209 was long thought to have the heaviest stable nucleus of any element, but in 2003, <strong>Noël Coron and his colleagues</strong> at the Institut d’Astrophysique Spatiale in Orsay, France, discovered that 209Bi undergoes alpha decay with a half-life of approximately 19 exayears </p>

<blockquote>
<p>We detected a-decay of 209Bi using the scintillating bolometer
technique. The earlier scintillating bolometers used CaF2(Eu) and a
silicon photodiode, glued on the crystal, as the light detector9. After recording an initial high-resolution a spectrum within a microtarget (a 1-mg diamond bolometer at 1.3 K, ref. 12), we introduced a ‘heat-and-light’ pair of bolometers, with 300 mg of scintillating CaF2(Eu) at 130 mK (ref. 8). </p>
<p>As part of our development of more massive scintillating bolometers (Fig. 1c) for the Dark Matter search experiment ROSEBUD, a 45.7-g BGO (Bi4Ge3O12) bolometer exhibiting unusual discriminating properties at 20 mK was checked at Orsay for contamination at high energy (Fig. 2): this crystal had already shown a strong 207Bi contamination13. Thanks to their high quenching factor, a-particles could be perfectly separated from events induced by cosmic rays </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radioactive decay is stochastic. A half-life of 2*10^19 years means that it takes that time for 1/2 of all atoms to decay, but it also means that in one year, one of every 10^19 atoms decay! If you compare that to Avogadros number of 6*10^23, thats not a huge amount. Get 200 grams of that isotope (easier said than done) and you have a comfy 60.000 decays in one year. Then you &quot;just&quot; need a very efficient and quite detector with great background rejection and you can measure such lifetimes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One other item of note that I haven't seen listed... Half life is a measure of the time it would take for <em>half</em> of a sample to decay.  For a sufficiently large sample, you would still be able to observe decay events.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
