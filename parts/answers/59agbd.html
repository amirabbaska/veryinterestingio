		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So trauma is a tricky thing. It's subjective. What the field defines as trauma, currently, is anything that causes an individual to experience fear for their safety or life, or the safety/life of a loved one. In other words, as long as it causes the individual to feel like they are in danger, it's trauma. This is entirely based on the individual's perception of events, and it means that what one person considers extremely traumatic may be nothing special to another person.  Even then, people react differently to trauma.  Some people are able to cope with nearly any trauma they experience (they are &quot;resilient&quot;), and some people are less able to cope with trauma.  The development of posttraumatic stress is not a given.</p>
<p>So the answer to your question is: yes, it is <em>possible</em> for a particularly extreme nightmare to cause lasting trauma (posttraumatic stress) to the individual, given the right circumstances.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You already have a great answer from /u/NawtAGoodNinja, but I just wanted to add my two cents.  </p>
<p>This is a very complex issue.  First, as Ninja said, you have to consider whether the dream is reflective of a traumatic experience that already has occurred in real life, or whether it's a novel experience that itself is creating new trauma.  That would be a very difficult determination to make, it seems to me, because often traumatic experiences are repressed.  In particular, people who have experienced severe and complex trauma (such as repeated trauma that occurred over the course of a very long time period, or trauma that occurred in the context of another psychiatric experience like psychosis), quite often dissociate during traumatic experiences, and this sometimes leads to a complete lack of conscious awareness of what happened.  Because of cases like this, I think it would be difficult to make a determination regarding whether the dream is merely a re-living (albeit perhaps distorted/transformed in significant way) of a past traumatic experience or whether it is a novel experience.</p>
<p>With that said, I see no reason to believe that one could not experience a trauma response from a purely novel dream.  To the best of my knowledge, all of the underlying neurobiological aspects of the brain-based etiology of a trauma response could be present during a traumatic dream.  Likewise, all of the psychological components could be there.  A person who has had such an experience could certainly I have never heard of this happening, but it seems possible.</p>
<p>In terms of the diagnostic criteria, again, I see no reason why they couldn't be fully met in this kind of situation.  The DSM 5 criteria for PTSD are less restrictive than past criteria in a number of ways.  First, one no longer needs to have directly experienced a traumatic event in which their own life was in danger.  Instead, they could have witnessed an event in which another person's life was in danger, or even have <em>heard</em> about such an event happening to a loved one.  The criteria do not specifically mention dreams, but the relaxation of what is considered to qualify as &quot;trauma&quot; is indicative of work in the field suggesting that our classification of trauma has been too vague.</p>
<p>An interesting question to think about in regard to this is: what, then, is the source of the trauma?  Is it what &quot;happened&quot; in the dream, or simply the experience of having a bad dream in and of itself?  People who have severe nightmares often have a trauma-based avoidance of sleeping, for obvious reasons.  Have these people been traumatized by a dream experience (such as being tortured for what seems like many hours) or simply by <em>having a bad dream</em>?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I've been involved in American Indian studies involving dreams and vision quests. I've participated in ceremonies as well. I've based life altering decisions on the result of dreams and suffered trauma as a child due to dreams which fueled my studies.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of examples of native american dream academia (not mine)</p>
