		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regardless of the base, PI will always be irrational and transcendental. Properties of numbers hold regardless of base because the base is just a way of representing the number, not defining it. You could put 3 in any base you felt like and it would still be a prime odd number. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No.</p>
<p>The definition of a rational number is that it can be expressed as the ratio of two integers. So a number X is rational if there exists integers A and B such that X = A / B.</p>
<p>Note that this definition is completely independent of the number system. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A number system is a way of representing quantities. If you are in base 3, and you say &quot;I have 11 apples&quot;, you will show that you have 4 apples. The amount you have in front of you is irrespective of the base used to represent that quantity.</p>
<p>Even if you go to base pi and say I have 10 apples, that still means that you would attempt to show that you have pi amount of apples, which will never be a ratio of numbers of whole apples no matter how you try and represent that quantity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think what some of the other commenters are trying to get at here is that the &quot;number&quot; pi the ratio of the circumference and diameter of a circle is always irrational. In a different base the number may look different but it will still represent the same thing. The symbol might change but the thing it represents is the same. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two concepts here: how to represent (ie &quot;express&quot;) pi, and whether it is rational.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Pi can be represented expressed by a single symbol, regardless of number system.</p>
</li>
<li>Pi is not a rational number. It cannot be made a rational number by representing it in a different number system.</li>
