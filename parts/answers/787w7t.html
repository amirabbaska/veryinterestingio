		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a forensic scientist, I can tell you that the reason hair is either wavy/curly/straight has to do with the shape of the hair. Straight hair is round, but wavy/curly hair is oval shaped. The curlier the flatter. Also, you can check out the pigmentation as little nodules within the hair under a microscope. Different amounts of pigmentation cause lighter/darker hair. Also fun fact, you can easily distinguish hair of different animals because it forms differently. For example, cat hair looks kind of like a stack of crowns while deer hair is straight with big ole vacuoles in it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The hair shaft is made up of the cell bodies themselves which are filled with very strong, highly cross-linked proteins.  It's not that a substance is squeezed out like a tube of toothpaste (although that would be really cool!).  Mice have different types of hair with names similar to what you described (e.g. guard, awl, zig-zag). I don't know the precise mechanism causing the different shapes is known (at least when I was writing my thesis). Length is controlled by how long the cells producing the hair remain proliferative (if they stay in the growth phase for longer, you get longer hair.).  The hairs go through a cycle (called the hair cycle) of growth (anagen), regression (catagen, where the follicle regresses) and rest (telogen) phases.  Depending on the relative lengths of these phases of the cycle you can end up for more or less long hair.  </p>
<p>I think a reasonable analogy as well is that the hair is like the top layer of your skin (the white, flaky part) in that it is made up of dead skin cells that are very strongly linked together.  For the hair, they just grow in tube.  Of course, there are different proteins (structural pieces) that are specific to the hair, but the general principle holds.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Has there been any study to the effect of Chemotherapy on hair follicles?   I've heard from a few different people that have gone through it that their hair grew back coarser and curlier.   I'm finding confirmation on <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/chemotherapy/in-depth/hair-loss/art-20046920" target="_blank">Mayo's website</a> but they list the effect as temporary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It may take several weeks after treatment for your hair to recover and begin growing again. When your hair starts to grow back, it will probably be slightly different from the hair you lost. But the difference is usually temporary. Your new hair might have a different texture or color. It might be curlier than it was before, or it could be gray until the cells that control the pigment in your hair begin functioning again.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find lots of studies on the hair loss portion of Chemo, but I'm not having a lot of success on finding studies on the returning hair after.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re right about the mechanics of hair shape being a result of how it’s extruded. Whether someone has straight, curly, or wavy hair depends on the shape of the hair follicle. </p>
<p>The rounder your hair follicle is the straighter your the hair will be, but the more oblong your hair follicle is the curlier it will be. </p>
<p>I imagine that hair texture is also partially a result of the hair follicle shape/size, but I’m not sure. As for color if someone has the answer to what exactly is going on there I’d also like to know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
