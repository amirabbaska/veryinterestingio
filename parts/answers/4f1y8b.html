		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To use your terminology, the edge of the Sun is rather soft. Take a look at <a href="http://i.imgur.com/X63zYEK.png" target="_blank">this graph of the matter density profile of the Sun</a>. Close to what we usually take to be the edge of the Sun, the density is about 10^(-4) g/cm^(3). This density is comparable to the density of our atmosphere on Earth at ground level. However, as you go deeper and deeper the density rises, until you get to the core where densities are on the order of 10^(2) g/cm^(3), which is about 10 times as dense as bulk gold. </p>
<p>Of course, like you say this doesn't mean you have any chance of sailing through anywhere close to the core. The temperature is already thousands of K at the edge of the Sun and <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zBTlzq3.png" target="_blank">quickly rises until it reaches more than a million K near the core</a>. If that wasn't enough, you also have to deal with some <a href="http://i.imgur.com/Bltc00L.png" target="_blank">utterly crushing pressures</a>. For example, close to the core, pressures rise upwards of 10^(15)Pa, a pressure higher than what you may find at the center of the blast of a thermonuclear warhead. Needless to say no material we could dream up could withstand these conditions. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I found a <a href="http://www.thesurfaceofthesun.com/index.html?" target="_blank">website</a> which talks about the sun having a solid surface beneath the photosphere described as a &quot;hard and rigid ferrite surface&quot;, which goes against other models of the sun so far. Anyone have any further knowledge about this? Is this speculation or is there hard supporting evidence?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'd start out just sailing through, since the outer layers of the sun are like clouds (that are also nuclear explosions). Eventually though, you'd reach a point where the pressure and density are too high for you to go any further. </p>
<p>You wouldn't crash into it as much as you would gradually come to a stop as whatever force is causing your acceleration can't push through the force of the sun's matter. On top of that, the heat of the sun constantly causes it to expand, which is why it doesn't collapse under it's own gravity. The further in you go, the less the gravity pulls you in and the more the heat pushes you out, adding yet another obstacle. </p>
<p>If you could somehow get past the core though, you would be able to make it back out pretty easily. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A different way of wording your question: <strong>can the material that the sun is composed of remain solid at temperatures and pressures found on the surface of the sun?</strong></p>
<p>The Sun is composed of 71% H and 27.1% He by mass (plus traces of other stuff). You don't even need to be a scientist to know that those 2 elements aren't even solid at ambient temperature on Earth. As for pressure, it is 5 orders of magnitudes lower than that of Earth. (Materials tend to become solid under high pressures)</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Conclusion: no, you won't encounter any solid on the surface of the sun.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Fun fact: the elements of the Sun are so far from being solid, they aren't even in gas form; they're plasma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We really can't know. Plasma does some really strange stuff. It leans towards superfluidity, but the pressure involved, and the fact that after some point fusion would be pressing on both sides of you would make for some interesting effects.</p>
<p>Imagine bungee jumping from the ISS with a cable long enough to touch the ground, Into a hundred foot pit full of silly putty.</p>
<p>Probably nothing like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
