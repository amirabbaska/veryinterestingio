		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you were 5, I'd explain: &quot;Blisters are nature's band aid.&quot;  They form to protect the underlying layers of skin from an irritant.  The reason people will tell you to never pop a blister is because the fluid within it is sterile.  Not only that, but our outer layer of skin is our &quot;first line of defense&quot; against pathogens. When you pop the blister, you break that line of defense and release the protective sterile fluid - leaving the underlying layers susceptible to infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you put too much friction on a particular spot, the upper layers of skin start to separate. There are liquid filled sacs in a lot of your joints too. It works like padding but in a blister you also get pain which prevents you from agitating it more. It's your body's way of saying &quot;You gonna keep wearing those Old Navy flip flops bitch? Fine fuck you.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I hate seeing cases where the top two responses answer the question but leave the thread unexplained.... To sum up: </p>
<p>Blisters form when the top layer of skin gets detached from the lower layers, separating &quot;plasma&quot; sacs in the process. The plasma is completely sterile and serves to protect the lower layers of skin from further harm, basically natures band-aid with a bit of pain thrown in to keep you from doing more damage.</p>
<p>To pop a blister use a sterilized (wiped with alcohol or hydrogen-peroxide) sewing needle along the side of it, as low as you can go. Aim the needle into the fluid, it shouldn't hurt. Press the plasma out, apply antibiotic ointment and a band-aid. Done.</p>
<p>TL;DR. Come on it's not THAT long... Skip the second paragraph if you want. Also don't wear tight shoes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blisters form in response to repeated agitation or friction to the area. The fluid is usually made up of plasma and is designed to pad and protect the area beneath so that nothing more than the skin is affected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question. What usually happens if you don't pop a blister? </p>
<p>Does the pus reabsorb? does the pus become septic?</p>
<p>Reason I ask is because when I was young, around 10 or so, I got 3-4 blister on my hand, my mom told me not to pop them and I'm convinced they turned into warts and I've blamed her for her bad advice ever since. I could have been mistaken, this was almost 20 years ago.</p>
<p>*edit: TIL pus is spelled with one 's', also, blisters contain plasma, not pus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
