		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When Old English was written, it used a mixture of Latin letters and older runes. One of these runes was Wynn, which was used to represent the wound that w gives today:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynn" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wynn</a></p>
<p>That runes was sometimes replaced by the combination uu - a double u - for the same sound.</p>
<p>In german, the letter v changed in sound to be pronounced as f in most cases (it still is). In a few cases the v-sound was retained. To distinguish these cases, scribes began to write vv for these.</p>
<p>When printing was developed in what is today Germany (and to some extent Italy, but that is less relevant here), the printing press manufacturers made types for the letters that they had. Since the combination vv was very common, they made a letter for it - w. In most languages letter is called &quot;double-v&quot;.</p>
<p>These printing presses and the letters for them were exported everywhere, including to England. The English quickly realized that they didn't have types for all their letters, so they made do with what they had. Since English didn't have the w before printing, they simply reused that letter for the Wynn rune, which was missing. It is called &quot;double-u&quot; because it was also sometimes written as &quot;uu&quot;</p>
<p>Similar story for the letter Thorn, which was also missing when printing and became the &quot;th&quot; combination.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the 7th century, the old English language was starting to be written in the Latin alphabet, but it had a sound that the Latin didn't, the W sound. To get around this, they doubled the U symbol to represent it. The following century, the &quot;uu&quot; digraph was replaced with the Ç· (wynn) rune. This died out after a while and in the 11th century, the Norman (French) scribes reintroduced the &quot;uu&quot; digraph as a single, though jointed instead of curved, character, the &quot;w.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At one point, U and V were not regarded as different letters (and in fact, F, U, V, and Y are all ultimately derived from the same Phoenician letter). You may be familiar with this to some degree if you've ever seen a picture of <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/40/Arch.of.Titus-Inscription.jpg" target="_blank">a Roman inscription like this one</a>, whose first two lines read <em>senatus populusque romanus</em>. A holdover of this usage appears in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulgari" target="_blank">branding of some Italian luxury products</a>. UU and VV, the ancestors of modern W, were similarly interchangeable. In Middle English (during the Middle Ages), the pointed V was used at the beginning of a word, while the round U was used elsewhere.</p>
<p>As time went on, English and other languages began assigning more discrete, well-defined roles to what started off as two visual representations of the same letter. By and large, V has become a consonant and U has become a vowel, but W is a bit of an odd case. The [w] sound it makes in English is a kind of consonant often referred to as a &quot;semivowel&quot;. In German, it is strictly a consonant (representing [v]). In Welsh, W is a vowel. It is also <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/w#Welsh" target="_blank">a word</a> in Welsh, and you can even put an accent mark over it, like in <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/d%C5%B5r" target="_blank">the Welsh word for 'water'</a>.</p>
<p>Whether you call it &quot;double-U&quot; or &quot;double-V&quot; varies from language to language. In upright type, it tends to have a pointed appearance, but in italics (as in cursive handwriting), many typefaces give it a more rounded look, a relic of when it was written <em>uu</em> in a calligraphic hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
