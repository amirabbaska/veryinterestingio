		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cable providers have to pay networks a fee for each channel. This fee is per subscriber, per month. You can see a short breakdown of these fees <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2013/09/27/226499294/the-most-and-least-expensive-cable-channels-in-1-graph" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>ESPN is notorious for being by far the most expensive. Even if you never watch it, if you have cable, you're paying ESPN over $5 per month. All the fees together for a basic cable package add up to about $30 by some accounts, which means $30 per month from your cable bill goes straight to networks. The cable company covers the rest of their costs and generates their profit with what is left after $30 goes to networks. In your case, that means the cable company charges $50/month but only gets $20 per month to maintain/expand infrastructure, pay employees, advertise, and do all other business outside of acquiring channels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>My DirecTV package with no premium channels is over $100 a month.  Comcast and Verizon FIOS don't offer anything better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I ran a cable company for years and I can give you a real answer. It has little to do
with cables and trucks ,etc. Although all these things do require money to maintain.</p>
<p>The fact is the cost (licensing) per channel is out of control. If you worked in the cable industry from
80's-98ish people would come to you and beg you to add channels. They would offer you free dishes and receivers
just to add their channels. Since they were giving you free stuff to add the channel clearly there was not a fee.
Fast forward to today. Every channel baring Christian channels and shopping channels charge at least $.50.
Even local stations you get for free (ABC, NBC, Fox, etc), charge the cable/satellite company for their channels.
The worst is the sports channels. ESPN charges around $5.50 per person! That is what the cable/satellite company
pay. Their contracts reads that you have to give there service to 98%+ of your customers to qualify for that price,
along with put it below channel 13 blah blah blah…. It doesn't stop there! To get that price you have to add ESPN
Classic, Sports, News. Basically all the ESPN channels. Then lets talk NFL, Big10, Varsity. They are, around $1 our
more each. Yet again you have to give that channel to everyone to get that price. If you don't a $5.50 channel goes
to $13 dollars or higher! Now add Fox sports channels and outdoor channel, sportsman, etc and you are at $17!!!!
Ironically channels that people really like such as discovery, and history channels are only $.50 each. We ran a 105
channel “Expanded Basic” lineup and we charged $75 of which $18 went to the sports channels and we paid out
over $59 dollars in licensing! We were a fiber to the home company (FTTH), the average construction cost was
around $1100 per home served. This doesn't include trucks, payroll, electricity to run the Head End (Server Room).
The cable companies are going belly up but the content providers are getting rich. You feel you are not getting the value for you money with cable and you are right, but your hatred should be pointed at the channel owners.</p>
<p>Who owns all the channels Fox, Viacom, Disney, GE NBC and Time Warner. Yep 6 corporations control 95% of
the media in America. Average yearly revenue is 275.9 Billion!  So get your ass out and start making videos and
post them on Amazon, Youtube (Google) and Netfilx.</p>
<p>In the past if you made a movie, tv series, documentary the only outlet to get paid was one of the 6. Today
you have the three above, yes Youtube will pay you! The face you could make a “Roger and Me” today and post it
on youtube and get paid boggle my mind. Especially because no one does in this day and age, where everyone has
a HD camera in their phone and free video editing software on their computer. All you get is bad “Jackass” type
crap or kids putting on makeup. No Reddit, I didn't forget the millions of hours of cats, being cats. So down load
blender and audacity and get to making movies!!! For you more tech savoy folks go for Ubuntu Studio and Blender!</p>
<p>Don't make crap, make a documentary about problems in your town. Show corrupt cops, unemployed,
underemployed, show people starting business. Show what is hidden by the big 6 companies. Show what hasn't
been seen!</p>
<p>edit: These guys can tell you cost per channel. Most small cable companies by from them.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is what other people are saying about how Netflix doesn't maintain the cabling etc and that is handled by the internet company. What doesn't seem to be mentioned yet though is that Netflix gets most of its content after it has already been milked for as much money as possible. Judging from my experience anyways, Netflix doesn't get TV shows until the entire season is over and it doesn't get movies until they have already been out on DVD/blue-ray for a bit. The people who own the rights to the content are willing to sell it much cheaper at this point because they have already made 99% of their money and anything Netflix gives them is now just bonus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TV used to be the only option beside movies for programming. There was internet too, but it wasn't fast enough to handle streaming. Once the internet did become fast enough though, Netflix was the first company to make an online rental model thrive. With more options of things to watch, customers became pickier and the number of cable viewers dropped. Why watch a narrow set of shows with commercials to boot, when you can watch whatever movie or show you feel like? Cable companies fought harder to get enough sponsorship--commercial slots were no longer worth as much. So, they keep their prices high since they're an oligopoly and they can get away with it. If you drop cable entirely, your internet service is still more expensive than it used to be. Cable knows it's useless and doesn't try to compete. It's just got us by the balls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
