<li>NSAIDs (ibuprofen/Advil/Motrin/Aspirin/etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mechanism: Block COX enzymes which inhibit prostaglandin production. One of the prostaglandins (PGE2) is associated with pain and fever. </p>
<p>Side Effects: Because we donâ€™t have a specific PGE2 blocker, other helpful prostaglandins are also inhibited. Use of NSAIDs over a prolonged time can lead to gastrointestinal bleeds, kidney disease, hypertension, and even heart attack.</p>
<ul>
<li>Acetaminophen (Tylenol)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mechanism: Not completely understood. Has some COX blockade (like NSAIDs), also inhibits pain impulse generation at the neuron level. Antipyretic effect is likely related to an effect in the hypothalamus (heat regulating center).</p>
<p>Side Effects: Acetaminophen is metabolized by the liver (as is alcohol). Overdoses or co-ingestion with alcohol can lead to life-threatening liver failure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Opiates (Oxycodone/Hydromorphone/Morphine/etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mechanism: Inhibit pain receptors in the central nervous system, preventing propagation of the pain signal</p>
<p>Side Effects: Causes respiratory depression. Overdosing on opiates will suppress the brain's autonomous breathing center - leading to death. Others include constipation/urinary retention.</p>
<ul>
<li>Topical Anesthetics (Lidocaine/Benzacaine/etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mechanism: Prevents peripheral neurons (as opposed to Opiates which are central) from propagating pain signals.</p>
<p>Side Effects: Relatively safe however if absorbed in large quantities via skin can lead to low heart rates, low blood pressure, and or confusion/disorientation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Benzodiazepines (Ativan/Valium/etc)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mechanism: Related to Opiates; blocks nerve receptors in the central nervous system (GABA, Opiates block mu receptors).</p>
<p>Side Effects: Similar profile to Opiates</p>
<ul>
<li>Antispasmodics (Baclofen/Flexeril)</li>
</ul>
<p>Mechanism: Prevents pain associated with muscle spasms by blocking muscle fiber depolarization/signal propagation</p>
<p>Side Effects: Drowsiness, fatigue, diarrhea.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cannabis</li>
</ul>
<p>Mechanism: Modulates pain threshold by influencing Opiate pathway (via specialized receptors).</p>
<p>Side Effects: Lethargy, vomiting</p>
<p>Not an exhaustive list of options and definitely not of side effects. Mechanisms have been simplified.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few mechanisms of action for painkillers, depending on the class of painkiller.</p>
<p>Opiates block opioid receptors in the pain pathways in the nervous system at the synapses. This stops the signals going from the injury to the brain to be processed.</p>
<p>Local anaesthetics, like lidocaine, work similarly but usually block sodium ion channels to stop electrical signals in nerve cells.</p>
<p>Day-to-day painkillers, like NSAIDs, target the cyclo oxygenase (COX) enzymes of the inflammatory pathways. This blocks the production of prostaglandins which stimulate pain pathways.</p>
<p>Generally, they block cell signalling mechanisms to stop the pain signals from being processed. Pain is a cool research area IMO.</p>
<p>Edit: opiates activate opioid receptors reducing neurotransmitter release</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
