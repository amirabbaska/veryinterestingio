<ol>
<li>
<p>Find subjects who type very slow. As quickly as they hand write. Compare results typing vs writing?</p>
</li>
<li>What about touchscreens and styluses? How closely to the paper experience do we have to go to completely model this difference? Can apps like OneNote's handwriting suffice?</li>

<p>Pictograph languages.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese are straight up being killed by typing. Young people can recognize and read the characters, but since writing them isn't a practiced skill, it is basically fading out. It is receptive only. Given a pen and paper, Japanese young people in particular will resort to phonetically writing out words, instead of using Kanji. Simply because they do not remember how to write them.</p>
<p>Edit: I gather that most of the answers are talking about cognitive skills OUTSIDE of writing gained by handwriting, so I thought I'd take a different approach. I've found it interesting because it is something that utterly doesn't come up with English-centric thinking. The English character set is so small that there is little risk of losing it. Whereas Japanese/Chinese is tens of thousands of characters. Basically infinite, as no one really knows ALL of them, like you would expect in English.</p>
<p>So the opposition to 'devices' in classrooms has a whole nother angle to it in these countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neuropsychologist here - I would start by saying this is a question you could ponder for hours...
There have been a lot of good points raised, but I haven't seen one discuss the concept of a motor program. A word generated graphomotorically (pen and paper) is generated one letter at a time, where each letter is it's own motor program. Typing generates words in several-letter sequences, like a chunked string to be linked with other chunked strings. The physics of it all is that a proficient typist creates letters faster than the brain can receive feedback on each confirming the completion of a goal-directed action. Rather, typing is an execution of a program of several letters (like the brain launching a .exe file) in combinations to form words. Graphomotor writing is different and is done by an execution of a program of one letter at a time. It is still a sequence of motor movements (remember practicing them way back when?), but the goal is to ultimately create one letter before executing another motor program towards a new goal/letter. This is a meaningful difference from a neurocognitive standpoint as it is evidence of a functional dissociation (hence, some can type well but have a hard writing or vice versa). As a side note, this is why we make so many more errors typing, we are executing incorrect motor programs and once they have started, they are hard to stop. If you read up on Tadlock or Fitt's motor sequence learning stages, it becomes more clear what I mean. In fact, I just accidentally typed &quot;learning 'states'&quot; because I executed the wrong motor sequence. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I teach a study-skills class to college freshmen. <a href="https://www.barnesandnoble.com/p/your-college-experience-two-year-college-edition-john-n-gardner/1124319902/2677872287853?st=PLA&amp;sid=BNB_DRS_Marketplace+Shopping+Textbooks_00000000&amp;2sid=Google_&amp;sourceId=PLGoP20441&amp;k_clickid=3x20441" target="_blank">Our textbook</a> addresses this: for most people, writing by hand is a more effective strategy.</p>
<p>Memory is determined by connective paths between brain cells. When you think a thought, cells in your brain twist and shift to create new pathways (or break old ones). The more times you think a thought, the more rigid these new pathways become and the longer you will retain the memory.</p>
<p>Each brain cell is capable of being part of dozens of pathways at the same time. If you connect a new memory pathway with older pathways that already exist, you are more likely to retain the new information and it becomes easier to recall it when needed.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/joshua_foer_feats_of_memory_anyone_can_do#t-21903" target="_blank">interesting Ted Talk</a> on the subject.</p>
<p>So when you write something by hand, several things are happening: 1) you are going slower, which means you have to repeat the information to yourself while writing, 2) you have to think about how to phrase what you are writing or drawing, 3) you have to decide how your phrase will fit with the other notes you have made (list, diagram, new paragraph, etc), 4) you have to translate your desired phrase into muscle movements, 5) because of the time and focus, you are more likely to tie the new memory path into existing memory paths.</p>
<p>If people type notes instead, they spend less time processing the thought, use fewer muscles, and the computer does the formatting and organizing rather than the body/brain. Computer screens also cause the brain to focus less on the task at hand - meaning that reading notes from a monitor is less effective than reading the same notes printed on paper. <a href="http://www.co.twosides.info/download/Computer_vs_paper-based_tasks_Are_they_equivalent.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a neat study</a> about how computer screens make people less efficient at tasks compared to using paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
