		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a new theory on sleep floating around that is becoming more commonly accepted that the 8 hour continuous nights sleep is a modern evolution and previously Humans had two sleep sessions per night.  They would go to bed for '1st Sleep' and wake up during the night, do something productive then return to bed later for '2nd Sleep'.   Apparently Humans did this for a very long time and it wasn't until the evolution of on demand artificial light that the consistency of the practice ended.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is an evolutionary left over that you are experiencing, that time when you would have gotten up and been productive between 1st and 2nd sleep.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the <em>idea</em> of doing all those things pleases you, but not so much actually <em>doing</em> them when the time comes.</p>
<p>See, you like the idea of getting organized and working on your projects and getting all those other things done too.  You see it as a better future, and there's nothing you can do about it while lying in bed except make mental plans so it's easy.  It pleases you.  You're also not distracted by other things so you have time to think about it.  It also might be a reaction to not getting as much done that day as you wanted to, so you resolve to do better.  When the next day comes and you have time to do them, now they each take work and maybe you feel tired right now or hungry or watching stupid videos brings more immediate gratification than actually working on something that takes effort and may not be immediately satisfying.  Kinda sucks, but welcome to life, you're certainly not alone in this.</p>
<p>As for how to make it last?  Beats me, I have the same problem.  Google how to beat procrastination and you'll find a lot of advice.  Try some of it and see what works for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Anyway start with something small that you know you can do and let the reward response snowball. I work two jobs and that is how I get shit done when I need to. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
