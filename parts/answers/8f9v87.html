		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At around 14 to 15 months, they’re able to understand that funny faces and illogical acts are meant to be laughed at. When you do something obviously silly, like pretend to eat off the plate as a dog would, it's particularly pleasing for your pipsqueak because he’s sure that’s not what’s supposed to happen, and being sure is a great feeling for a toddler who’s still unsure about so much of what he experiences.</p>
<p>And once their language skills have blossomed, they'll find rhymes and nonsense words funny too. Your toddler may also try making you laugh, perhaps by using your hairbrush as a cell phone, for instance. At around 24 months, he may point to his elbow when you say, &quot;Show me your nose,&quot; or pick up a doll and call it a truck, simply to get a giggle out of you. And he’ll redo his stand-up routine again and again and again.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apologies for the aside, but it is not medically advised (at least from an oral health perspective) to share saliva with your young children. Outside of spreading general communicable diseases, you are potentially introducing cavity-causing bacteria directly into their mouth. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0300571214003297" target="_blank">It is well-documented that there is vertical transmission of these cavity-causing bacteria from mother to child</a>, and constantly introducing these bacteria to them through spoon-sharing or other behaviors (including kissing on the lips) is not advised. <a href="http://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/aapd/pd/2016/00000038/00000004/art00009" target="_blank">High levels of this bacteria can significantly increase the progression of cavities/tooth disease in children</a>. <a href="http://www.aapd.org/assets/2/7/Education_-_Caries.pdf" target="_blank">The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry indicates you should not put anything in your mouth and then your baby's mouth</a>. Interestingly, it is also established that improving maternal oral hygiene (including chewing xylitol gum) can improve infant/child oral health and <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ipd.12155" target="_blank">reduce at least maternal-child transmission of these bacteria</a>.</p>
<p>It should also be noted, there are studies about the benefits of this salivary/general bacterial transmission from parent to child that show it can have a beneficial effect in terms of immune system development and potentially impact the development of certain allergies, but I have not looked at the literature in detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
