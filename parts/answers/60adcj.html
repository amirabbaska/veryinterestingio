		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's actually TWO effects here.</p>
<p>One is evening out the <em>aerodynamic</em> stability.  If you have a bent arrow shaft, it drifts to the right.  If it rotates 90 deg, it drifts up to the left, another 90 deg, back to the left, another 90 deg, drifts down, and over the long range, it just takes a spiral path but the center of the spiral is dead-on in the long run, but it's hard to gauge how wide the circle of a bent arrow will be, and what the angle of that offset will be where it actually hits.  Net result, if you're a master archer, the bent arrow may spiral in a 1ft radius and basically hit with +/- 1 ft accuracy of a perfect aimpoint at 10 yards AND 100 yards.  If it did not rotate, it might drift 2ft at 10 yards and 50ft by 100 yards.  And you'd have no way to know which way it'll drift, or how far, it's random.</p>
<p>The other is <em>gyroscopic</em> stability, which requires higher RPM.  It keeps the bullet from turning.  This is always accompanied by aerodynamic stability, already covered.</p>
<p>Arrows don't do that second one, BTW.  Commonly they only rotate about once per 20 ft.</p>
<p>Early musket balls and cannonballs got limited benefit from this.  They have a nasty instability in back which spinning only helps marginally.  Yes, golf ball dimples would have improved them greatly, but they didn't know, and would have trouble manufacturing it.  </p>
<p>In the 1840's the Mini√© ball (which isn't a ball, it's a &quot;bullet shape&quot;) was invented and changed everything.  Those were revolutionary for a number of reasons, but really benefiting from rifling was a big one.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(projectile</a>)</p>
<p>Cannonballs were spherical until the mid 1800's.   Initially, cannonballs were just iron balls, bouncing and rolling through a crowd smashing through people.  They did use rifling in later cannonball-firing cannons.  Those NEEDED to be spherical to maximize bounce.  Since about 1800, they'd been using spherical &quot;shrapnel shells&quot;, exploding cannonballs, which didn't technically need to be spherical because they didn't bounce, but they didn't quite figure that out.  Mid 1850's, they realized they could make a cylindrical shell and the now-familiar pointy nose and fit more volume of explosive inside and it would benotably more accurate and longer-range.  Pretty much all cannons were rifled by then anyhow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most bullets will not be perfectly symmetrical sure to flaws in the manufacturing process. These flaws will cause a bullet to naturally veer during flight. Think of a plane with the tail kinked slightly to one side, it will not fly sight without constant adjustment from the pilot. Since bullets cannot be stress once shot, one way to deal with this natural tendency to veer off is to spin the bullet to balance out the veering. If a bullet would normally veer slightly to the left, then spinning it causes it to spend half that time upside down as it were and it veers back to the right.</p>
<p>Think about an American football thrown in a spiral. The football is not a perfect ovular shape, because it has stiches on one a side that create increased drag. Spinning the ball causes those stiches to spend the same amount of time create drag in every direction rather than throwing it without a spiral where the stitches always stay on the same side.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically things are lazy, they don't want to move, but you can motive them and once you do, they don't want to stop. </p>
<p>They also have a hard time changing directions, because that would imply in stopping in one direction than having to move in another. </p>
<p>Rotations are changes in direction in time, every moment it's slightly different. </p>
<p>Now like I said, thing are lazy, if they have to move, then so be it in only one direction and at a set speed, any changes are annoying. But if they have to change directions, then let it be in very small ways, so it's acceptable to them rotating. </p>
<p>For the last part of this basic understanding, is that the faster it is made to move, the harder you need to motivate them to pick up speed AND the harder it is to get them to chill, making them stop (this is key to the question at hand). </p>
<p>This is true for the bullet and for the air, so when interacting, the one that's the laziest will win. </p>
<p>Air is an whole country's army, but it's in peace so the soldiers are dispersed. </p>
<p>The bullet on the other hand, is a small but firm gang trying to bring havoc into the land. </p>
<p>If the bullet goes in one direction and just pushes the air, then they'll start uniting (accumulating) and can more effectively stop or change that direction. </p>
<p>Now if a bullet goes foward but is ALSO rotating, then you did a lot more motivational speech to it, so not only is it flinging the air soldiers all over the place and thus they can regroup, it will take a lot more soldiers to make it change it's direction! </p>
<p>TLDR: Motivated objects will fling the air soldiers so they can't regroup and will need a lot more soldiers to contain it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Throw a piece of paper, and how does it fly?</p>
<p>Not well, because of many factors, namely wind resistance.</p>
<p>Ok, so crumple up the piece of paper into a ball and throw it. How does it fly?</p>
<p>Not well, but slightly straighter. Still because of wind resistance. This time it slows down too quickly.</p>
<p>Ok, so throw a ping pong ball, and how does it fly?</p>
<p>Again, not well, still because of wind resistance. This time it flies further and straighter, but still slows down too much.</p>
<p>OK, so make it denser. Take a musket ball and shoot it. How does it fly?</p>
<p>Better. Much better. But it still flies off in one direction. This is still because of wind resistance. As the ball flies through the air, it hits patches of air that are different pressures, temperatures, or velocities (wind speed), and it pushes the bullet off path.</p>
<p>OK, so let's make the bullet really aerodynamic. Now how does it fly?</p>
<p>Better, but still gets pushed off too one side or another.</p>
<p>OK, so what happens if we spin the bullet?</p>
<p>Ah, now we get to the good stuff. When you spin the bullet, a certain amount of energy is stored in the rotational energy of the bullet. Because of the physics of centrifugal/centripetal motion, any effort to turn or move the bullet is resisted by the energy in the spin of the bullet. So if the air wants to make the bullet turn, and therefore veer off to one side, it gets resisted by the spinning energy of the bullet. Now, the bullet can still turn, but the forces acting to turn the bullet need to overcome the rotational energy of the bullet in order to get it turning (and therefore veering off path).</p>
<p>So in the end, a bullet that is spinning will (to some degree) stay in the same orientation as it flies, and the biggest factors affecting its motion will be gravity and wind resistance that slows it down (since neither of those two are affected much by rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
