<p>Before you build a bridge you have to make sure the soil under it can bear the weight, the soil has to be very compact and stable. They had ways of doing this similar to a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25z0MewBj0Q" target="_blank">proctor test</a> and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oK9kt_P3IMw" target="_blank">sand cone test</a>The ancient Romans being the best civil engineers that history would see for centuries learned it the hard way. This is before science so it was just an ongoing record of learning from past mistakes with knowledge handed down to the next generation. They only built with the best plans, with the best material available. Earthquakes are a big problem in Italy so you have to &quot;over build&quot; often. That means make something much stronger than necessary every step of the way so that when it's finished it's going to stick around. </p>
<p>They also made sure to pick the best spot for their bridges and would sometimes dig and dig and dig to make sure that if there is bed rock, they'll hit it.</p>
<p>Also, you have to remember that after thousands of years all of the ones who couldn't survive the test of time fell apart. What you're seeing is the ones who could and did.</p>
<p>What you are seeing in your driveway is the cheapest cement on discount at Home depot, poured by the cheapest guys a crooked sub contractor tricked into working in terrible conditions regardless of the untested soil.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because they are two totally different things with almost nothing in common. If you built a Roman style arched bridge today it too would last forever.</p>
<p>Lemme elaborate: Your driveway has to flex like a big long beam, the bridge is an arch. All of the weight there is going straight down into the rocks of the arch legs. Concrete can't bend very well. Rocks are really good at just holding up weight. Your driveway is all concrete that cracks (except for the aggregate, but let's move along), the the arch legs of those bridges are big hunks of rock that don't crack. Your driveway has rebar. The bridge doesn't. Your driveway is sitting on top of the soil, which moves every year as the ground freezes and thaws. Or as water erodes it. Or about a thousand other things that can undermine what your driveway is sitting on. The legs of those Roman bridges go down to bedrock and don't move.</p>
<p>All of these things cause your driveway to crack and the bridge to not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Romans used concrete admixture that was composed of lime and another volcanic material called pozzalana (sp?). These materials are much more resistance to salt, which is the main culprit for the deterioration of modern day concrete. Romans did not use steel reinforcment either, which will accelerate deterioration of the concrete if it comes into contact with salt water. Water causes oxidation of iron creating rust, while salt accelerates that process. The rust increases the volume of the steel, creating a large force, which then results in the concrete (which is kind of like, glued together with a binder) to deteriorate because the tension resistance of the concrete is not strong. </p>
<p>I assume that your concrete driveway has some sort of welded wire mesh (fabric), and with enough rain, water, and salt, the concrete deteriorates faster over time - espcially with continual use. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TLDR: Romans used concrete with different stuff. Also most of the structures that are still standing do not have embedded steel reinforcement, which causes deterioration in concrete. Modern structures use steel reinforcment, and different admixture for concrete (cheapest method is best method) which deteriorate faster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of Roman stuff still standing has been maintained and periodically fixed.  The Colosseum for example has new parts that keep it from further damage.  However, the Colosseum was actually built with iron supports originally to keep it from falling down.  After the empire collapsed, people removed the iron to sell for scrap.  It would be in a lot better shape now if people didn't use it for parts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
