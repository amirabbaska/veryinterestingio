		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For stars, only two-body orbits are stable. Small objects can work in a three-body system (e.g. the Trojan and Greek asteroids), but stars are too massive for that to work.</p>
<p>However, you can <em>nest</em> two-body orbits to get more stars in a system. If you have two stars orbiting around each other, then the third star could be so far away from the system that those two stars effectively feel like one body, and you get a stable orbit. Alternately, the third star could be so close to one of the stars that they feel like one gravitating body to the other star. You can keep on going like that to add more and more stars to the system. Similarly, planets will have stable orbits if they are either so close to one star that they can stick to the star and follow it around, or so far from the whole star system that it all just feels like a single big messy star that they can orbit around.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nu_Scorpii" target="_blank">Nu Scorpii</a> is a <em>septuple</em> star system. It consists of a 3-star system and a 4-star system orbiting around each other. The 3-star system consists of a 2-star binary and third star. The 4-star system consists of a 3-star system orbiting with a fourth star, and that 3-star system consists of a binary star and a third star. So that's the sort of hierarchy you have with multiple star systems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's already a book like that out there called Nightfall, written by Isaac Asimov and Robert Silverberg. It's about a race of beings that live in a world with 6 sun's, and though I don't remember how that works (I can't remember how in-depth they got with it exactly), there was always at least one sun shining on a side of the planet at a time. </p>
<p>The story specifically revolves (heh) around an event that occurs every once in a very long time (I want to say every 14k years or so, but I'm not for sure on that) that it's a one-sun day and some outer planet/asteroid/whatever eclipses that one sun for one full rotation of the world. Basically everyone goes absolutely crazy, because this world's life evolved always exposed to sunlight, and civilization has to begin again.</p>
<p>Heck, I took my user name from a character in that book: Siferra 89, an archeologist partly responsible for this weird discovery right before it happens. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're looking for absolute realism, as far as I'm aware we don't really know enough about the environments of exoplanets to say anything about how such an arrangement would impact them. That said, we're presumably delving into the realm of science fiction here, so we can afford to speculate a bit. In physics terms, systems with multiple stars shouldn't behave too differently from systems with just one, as the stars would either be so close together that they're essentially one body gravitationally speaking, or so far apart that the farther-away stars are basically big, hot planets. The only arrangement that would prevent the existence of hypothetically-livable planet would be some of the stars orbiting <em>just</em> far enough away to mess with the &quot;goldilocks zone&quot; of the inner star(s); the result would be that no region of the system would be the ideal temperature to sustain life for any length of time, as orbits far enough away from the inner stars to be livable when the middle stars are nearby would be too cold when it orbited away, and any orbits close enough to be within ideal range of the inner stars would be roasted whenever the middle ones passed nearby.</p>
<p>Temperature-wise, it's possible that the stars would orbit just far enough apart to create a viable gap in the middle; in reality any planet that close to both would probably be torn to shreds by the constantly-shifting gravity, and baked to death every couple years when it has a star on both sides all day, but if you want an interesting setting for a <em>really</em> extreme desert or volcanic world it would be ideal. Beyond that, the only real option would be to have the planet orbiting one star or smaller group, with the rest being so far away that they might as well be stars, and that isn't much more interesting than a standard binary system unless you're building something akin to the 'Verse from Firefly (which is <em>extremely</em> soft sci-fi, for the record; orbits don't work like that).</p>
<p>A planet in the goldilocks zone of a binary pair probably wouldn't be too different from Earth in practice, as the orbital period of the stars around each other would be so short that the energy output would be fairly regular even though you could have up to twice as much star pointing at you at any given time. The planet would probably orbit somewhat farther out due to the increased heat, and as such would have a longer year, and it's possible that the less-consistent gravity and solar output could lead to more extreme weather, but otherwise I don't think it would be any more exotic a setting than any other foreign planet. Contrary to what Star Wars would have you believe, a planet in a binary system wouldn't be any more likely to be a massive desert than any other planet - if it's habitable, it has to be in the habitable zone, which means orbital distance has far more of an impact on climate than the number of stars involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>This guy has a blog dedicated to figuring out how ridiculous of a star systems could be made while being stable. And often talks about the other effects on the planet. I'd suggest checking it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on your definition of star.</p>
<p>There's no reason why a binary main sequence star system can't have any number of brown dwarfs.</p>
<p>Likely? No.</p>
<p>Possible? Yes. Just look at our solar system. If Jupiter were larger &amp; denser, which would also mean warmer (like 6x warmer) it would count as a brown dwarf.</p>
<p>I star system with 8 such stars around a larger main star could potentially have hundreds of habitable moons, too.</p>
<p>Now I have to go try that on the universe sandbox.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
