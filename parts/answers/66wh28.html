		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I personally like to think of simpler life forms as like tiny computer programs. Their DNA is their &quot;source code,&quot; and the cell itself is the hardware it runs on.</p>
<p>So a tiny cell 'knows' to avoid being eaten by larger cells because it's &quot;source code&quot; told it to build receptors on its cell membrane that are programmed to detects certain nearby chemicals, and one particular chemical triggers a flight response.</p>
<p>Other chemicals do the opposite -- they indicate a source of nutrients, and cause a chemical chain reaction that makes the cell move toward the food source. Once in range, various other mechanisms begin to operate, drawing in the food and disassembling it for processing.</p>
<p>But everything was built by following the template in the DNA, and certain triggers result in certain behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a bacteriologist and this is a great question! </p>
<p>Unfortunately like most things in nature bacteria don't have an &quot;intention&quot; as such. They don't have brains so there isn't even really a &quot;knowing&quot;. Everything they do is simply following genetic codes. Tiny organ-like components in the cells read their DNA, turn it into proteins, and these proteins either diffuse around the cell (doing fun chemical reactions) or diffuse out of the cell as waste. Some of this waste can be harmful (toxins), benign, or useful to other organisms. </p>
<p>Bacteria are also <em>covered</em> in receptors. The receptors pick up specific molecules - maybe it's a sugar, a protein etc. The receptors are basically the eyes and ears of the bacteria, because the receptors then cause a chemical reaction inside the cell, which dictates how it responds. So if it's a tasty sugar it can use for energy, the receptor might &quot;tell&quot; the cell to move  vaguely in the direction of the sugar by rotating its flagella. </p>
<p>None of these processes are perfect but bacteria have been around many, many time greater than us, and it shows in how with just one cell they can be ruthlessly efficient. </p>
<p>(It's also important to note bacteria vary massively in complexity - some are basic models, others are able to form communities with complex social structures whilst still maintaining a single celled existence) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think perhaps you're anthropomorphizing what's going on a little bit too much. </p>
<p>imagine a group of friends: </p>
<p><strong>friend 1</strong> really likes water -- and only likes water -- and will go wherever water is. </p>
<p><strong>friend 2</strong> really likes <strong>friend 1</strong>, and will go wherever <strong>friend 1</strong> goes. <strong>friend 2</strong> also likes eating food, so if there's food wherever <strong>friend 1</strong> goes, <strong>friend 2</strong> will eat it. </p>
<p>let's also say that there's a <strong>friend 3</strong> that, whenever their food is eaten by <strong>friend 2</strong>, will order more food (but will <em>only</em> order more food with <strong>friend 2</strong> eats their food). </p>
<p>you might have noticed at this point that each friend is pretty single-minded and only has one or two things that they're looking out for -- this is a simplified version of how intracellular dynamics works, where molecules interact with each other according to the rules of physics/chemistry. if you can imagine this on a much, much more complicated scale (while simultaneously being in a very, very, very small amount of space), then you can see how cells begin to function. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think to get to the root of your question we have to go beyond the molecular mechanisms of life and really examine what life really even is, on an abstract level. Billions of years ago, chemicals formed on this earth which had the ability to link together to form structures that could catalyze chemical reactions. The ability to form these structures was and is a consequence of the physical properties of the chemicals. Eventually over the course of hundreds of millions of years, it just so happened that a structure emerged from these chemicals which could catalyze the formation of itself. However, the self-replicating ability wasn't perfect and so different variations of the structure became formed. Most of the variations were likely ineffective at making a working self-replicating copy however others were more effective than the original. The more effective structures would naturally make more copies and so more and more effective variants of self-replicating structures emerged. This kept occurring over hundreds of millions of years during which time major variations popped up and different variations eventually dominated different environmental niches where their structures were optimal for the surroundings. (Cue animation of bacteria turning into fish then frog, lizard, mammal, caveman, human being.)</p>
<p>Why did that first self-replicating structure emerge? The immediate answer is that it emerged because the laws of physics and chemistry permit it. With enough time anything can happen so long as it's possible. But <em>why</em> did it emerge? That gets to a very deep philosophical question we mortals cannot answer. You could say it's random chance, it's just the way things happened to be. You could say it's the will of the divine. Regardless it happened.</p>
<p>Now, back to the question - how do single celled beings know what they're supposed to do to survive? They know because they are derived from a chain of ancestors going back to that original self-replicating structure. This isn't nothing. This chain is composed of living entities that somehow survived and replicated. In every generation there are plenty of entities that don't. The single celled entities are a collection of molecules that display an emergent behavior reminiscent of their previous generations which previously reproduced successfully. It appears that the single celled entity knows what to do when we see them now; but that's only because all of the cellular, macromolecular, and molecular mechanisms that led to non-reproducing emergent behavior were weeded out over the billions of years since that original self-replicating structure.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
