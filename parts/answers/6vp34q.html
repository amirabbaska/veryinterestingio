		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh yes, they wreak havoc on man made structures! Plate boundaries are shifting on average around 5cm per year, some are much slower but some are much faster (I think they clocked one in at 18cm / year) so there are <em>huge</em> engineering efforts combating these perpetual forces of nature. </p>
<p>The first thing they do is avoid these areas at all costs but if it's not avoidable (Think San Francisco, everywhere) then building things so they can either bend or have devices in the to let them either expand or contract is just the start. Now, overpasses and pipelines and sewers don't like to do these things so engineers either have to choose what the smaller cost is: to replace it after it is destroyed or to put in failsafes. </p>
<p>A highway or water infrastructure system failure isn't nearly as catastrophic as a hydro-electric dam failure so planning accordingly is the biggest factor in it all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The longest suspension bridge in the world, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashi_Kaiky%C5%8D_Bridge" target="_blank">Akashi Kaikyo bridge</a>, had both its two towers erected but none of the cabling when the Great Hanshin earthquake of 1995 struck. The slip beneath the bridge widened the gap by 1 meter (0.8 meters between the towers, and 0.3 between one tower and Awaji island). However the bridge was initially designed to withstand length changes of up to 2 meters <em>per day</em> due to temperature alone, so the lengthening of 1 meter only required very minor changes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All structures need to account for shifting even on the small scale. In construction we utilize things called expansion joints to compensate for the natural expanding and contracting that occur throughout the year whether it be caused by weather/temperature shifts or the physical changes in the ground surface. Bridges, for instance, utilize various different types of plates that allow the bridge steel to slide back and forth over the columns in the middle as this shifting occurs. Next time you drive over a bridge look at the ground on either side. You'll likely see something similar to this: </p>

<p>They're usually made of steel if big enough or rubber in smaller instances and allow for the movement back and forth without anything breaking apart. One side typically stays fixed while the other is free to move. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
