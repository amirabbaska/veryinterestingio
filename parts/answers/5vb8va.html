		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, yes. Just recently attended a lecture given by a geotechnical engineer where this was mentioned. He showed us a picture of curved mini-stalactites he found working on the Gathright Dam in  Virginia (1974). They determined it was the strong wind currents that led to their formation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if it's evidence one way or not but I recall in one room on the extended tour of Carlsbad Caverns there was a group of stalactites that all curved in the same direction and air flow was believed to be one of the reasons for the formation.  Been a long time since I took that tour.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't relate to wind but is relevant to growing sideways, or even up. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helictite" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helictite</a>
Edit: I actually started reading this article, looks wind is a possible explanation for how these form but not the leading theory. </p>
<p>I knew about these from visiting Mt Timpanogos Caves in Utah, which the article mentions has a large number of them. I remember seeing the upward growing structures and the guide talking about them but I had to look up what they are called. Anyway, thought you might find this somewhat relevant.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming a constant flow, I would say slanted rather than curved.</p>
<p>My argument: consider a drop having slidden to the tip of the stalactite. The (constant) air flow pushes it away with some force, causing it to be in a position that is slightly off from the place it would be without wind. The offset only depends on the strenght of the wind, so this offset is constant. This means the stalactite grows straight, from a constant angle (as opposed to curved).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
