		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a small educational YouTuber, so I can't promise that this covers all the bases, but I can give you an idea of how we make money.  There are really four or five revenue streams, and the composition differs depending on the creator.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>YouTube pre-roll, mid-roll, and text ads.
These are the ads that you typically think of when you think of YouTube ads.  The ones you can skip.  Unless you get millions of views, this is not going to be a major source of revenue.  The CPM (cost per one thousand views) is just too low usually.  It ranges from $1-4 dollars per thousand views, and is way more beneficial to YouTube than to YouTubers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Baked-in ads.  Did one of your favorite creators recommend SquareSpace or Audible to you?  They got paid for that.  Depending on your viewership and engagement, an ad spot like this can range from several thousand dollars to several hundred.  This is often a major revenue stream for people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Patreon.  It is a service where fans pledge a monthly donation for benefits or merchandise.  Depending on the creator this can be almost all of their revenue (some turn off ads as a Patreon goal) or literally none of it (they don't have a Patreon).  Some creators get upwards of $20,000 dollars a month off of Patreon (TeamFourStar makes $11,000 a month, CGPGrey makes $18,000 per video) but most successful YouTubers get between $500 - $2000 a month</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Online store merchandise.  Just like it sounds, people buying shirts, mugs, etc.  This is way too variable of a revenue stream for me to summarize.</p>
</li>
<li>Only very specific types of YouTubers who are well-respected and  famous get this, but events and guest appearance fees.  Some YouTubers host shows, tours, and conferences (Nerdcon, Vidcon, RTX, etc.). For example, Michael from vsauce is touring with Adam Savage from myth busters.  Ticket sales and merch at these events can be a great source of revenue.</li>
</ol>
<p>There might be other minor money makers, but these are the big five at least.  Being a YouTuber is hard, but some of the really top tier guys are multi-millionaires from it.  It all depends on how smart of a businessperson you are, and how engaged your audience is (and how large it is).  I hope this gave you an overview of the revenue sources available to YouTubers.  There are sites that estimate how much YouTubers make, but it is all guesswork usually.</p>
<p>Edit: another source of revenue that I would wrap into #1 is YouTube Red.  Based on how many Red viewers you have, you get paid.  It is weird, complicated, and difficult to ELI5.  YouTube also handpicks some creators to make YouTube Red Originals, and they pay for parts of production and I assume pay those creators fairly handsomely.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Grey just made $18,000 dollars as I was discussing his income.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Amazon Affiliate links also make some YouTubers money as /u/lionheart2189 mentioned below.  It is usually not that significant unless you review products on your channel.  I don't, and don't chat with any YouTubers who do, so I didn't think of it right away.  Linus Media is an example of a company that makes a large part of their revenue through this method.  (LinusTechTips, Techquickie, etc.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people are going to tell you that they make their money through ads, and for some people that is where all their money comes from. But for properly run channels, ad revenue normally only accounts for about 10% of the total revenue (this is obviously a very broad generalization, but it's what I've seen consistently). </p>
<p>As far as ads go, content creators get paid based on something called CPM, aka cost per mille, aka cost per thousand. Their CPM is how much they make for every 1,000 monetised views. If someone is watching with adblock on, their view isn't monetisable. If the video is deemed not advertising friendly, then none of the views will be monetised. The CPM is bassed off of how much advertisers are willing to pay to show an ad on that video, so if you're video is on how to choose the best car insurance, insurance agencies are willing to pay a lot to have their ad on the video, so the CPM will be much higher than if your video is about cheap meals to cook. The CPM is also effected by where your traffic is coming from. If your videos are popular in T1 countries (rich, developed countries who speak English, like the US, Canada, Australia, UK) then your CPM will be much higher than if the traffic is all coming from India and Bangladesh. CPM can vary so much that there really is no limit to how high or low it can go, but the average CPM will be around the $1 - $2.50 mark. Unfortunately CPM is on the decline, and we have been seeing a steady drop in CPM over the last few years. </p>
<p>Smart creators diversify their income streams with things like Patreon, affiliate marketing, sponsorship's, product placement, and selling physical or digital goods (like clothes, or books). To a smart creator, these things can make up 90%+ of their revenue, and if they aren't utilizing them, they are leaving money on the table. Gone are the days where you could just put a video up and make decent money. </p>
<p>I've seen people with 60,000 subscribers making $200,000+ a year from their social media, or people with 1,000,000+ subscribers making less than $80,000 a year. If you're smart and business savvy, you can make a lot of money from a small audience. But if you neglect the business side and just want to be a creator, then chances are you'll struggle to make money.  </p>
<p>As a small case study, let's look at Geek and Sundry's twitch, which has had most of it's success thanks to a live stream of D&amp;D called Critical Role. In about 2 years they have grown to 35,000 paying subscribers, each of these subscribers pay $5 a month, which means they are bringing in over $2,000,000 a year just in subscription fees. That's before the 2 sponsorships they have, and before all the youtube ad revenue, and before all the merchandising. </p>
<p>I've got 10 years experience with online marketing, mostly social media, and am planning on launching a big YT channel within the next 4 months, so feel free to ask any questions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are quite a few good answers in here regarding ad revenue but they're somewhat difficult to follow in my opinion. For the sake of making things easier to understand, let's say we have a monetized video that currently has precisely 100,000 views.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Step 1. CPM</h2>
<p>To start, a company is running an advertisement campaign and they are paying $6.00 for their advertisement to be shown 1,000 times, and another company is paying $5.67, and another is paying $6.13. The average of this is called &quot;CPM.&quot; CPM stands for Cost Per Mille, &quot;Mille&quot; meaning thousand. CPM generally means how much you are paid for showing people's advertisements 1,000 times.(Note: This changes <em>all</em> the time, because advertisers will pay more for their ads to be shown first. Take November or December for example, where ad rates are their highest.) Right this instant, for my channel, <a href="http://imgur.com/sUhwsLO" target="_blank">CPM seems to be $6.09.</a> This is pretty normal.</p>
<h2>Step 2. Monetized Views</h2>
<p>Now let's get back to the video with 100,000 views. Just because the video has been seen 100,000 times doesn't mean an advertisement has been shown 100,000 times. People have adblock, or sometimes it just doesn't show an ad. When an advertisement is shown, it is considered a &quot;monetized view&quot; in the analytics page of your channel. Generally, monetized views are about a third of the amount of video views. My channel, for having <a href="http://imgur.com/CAprzdF" target="_blank">45,129,607 views,</a> has had <a href="http://imgur.com/IkR0vxB" target="_blank">15,100,731</a> monetized views. With this same ratio, a video with 100,000 views might have around 33,000 monetized views.</p>
<h2>Step 3. Combining the Two</h2>
<p>At this point is where we combine CPM and monetized views. With the CPM (cost per thousand monetized views) currently at $6.09, and a video with 33,000 <em>monetized</em> views, that means the video has earned $200.97. BUT, YouTube has to take their share, of course, so they take their half, and you're left with <strong>$100.48 earned from a video with 100,000 views.</strong></p>
<p>*<em>This is also incredibly specific and can be different for other people. Different genres have different advertisements, ad rates are different every month, etc. but you get the general idea.</em></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Youtuber here. 160,000 subscribers and 15.9 million total views. Also affiliated with YouTuber &quot;DemolitionRanch&quot; who has 2.9M subscribers at the moment.</p>
<p>Ad revenue is near $180 for every 100,000 views you get. At some points in the year, like December, you get much more money-per-view because of something called CPM. CPM is basically the number that is decided by the amount of advertisers trying to buy ad space on youtube. In months like December, where every advertiser is running hundreds of ads, i get somewhere around 4X revenue during that period, no matter my views.</p>
<p>I also like to work with companies to do brand deals / sponsorships. They'll pay you to put sponsored content in your video. Usually you're approached by about 10 companies a week (through email) to see if you're interested in being sponsored by them, so there's a HUGE market there. </p>
<p>Amazon associates is a very easy way to basically make passive income as well. I put all of my computer's specifications/parts in my descriptions of my videos with amazon links to those specific parts. Amazon pays me a percentage of any purchase made after the user clicked on those links. So if a person wanted to buy the camera I use, they could go to amazon through my custom URL and purchase it, and because i brought them to amazon, i get a small cut of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a YouTuber from Germany. There are several revenue streams:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Google Adsense: YouTube pays 55% of all of the revenue that your channel creates with the preroll ads in front of your videos etc. (unless you have adblock ;((
This usually amounts to about 1€/$1 per 1000 Views but can be higher if you make longer videos (above 10min you can put a lot more ads in) - or if you have content that is easy for specific advertisers to target (like a Gaming, Beauty or Film channel), its also higher in December, because brands advertise more for Christmas. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brand Deals: &quot;Influencer Marketing&quot; is very popular. Brands will pay big money to sponsor individual videos, series or entire channels. People like Casey Neistat are also actual testimonials for brands like Samsung, like Jonny Depp is for some watch or perfume brand.
In Germany we are talking up to 80€/$80 per 1000 views for a single brand integration for one video. As far as I know, big US-channels can earn a lot more than that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Merchandise/Books/Products/Music/Movies/Events - Many YouTubers sell their own T-Shirts or have products that fit their content (your own make-up line as a beauty channel i.e.). Many YouTubers nowadays also try to release songs or sell straight to DVD movies like Grace Helbig, or sell tickets to a standup show etc, work with Netflix or YouTube Red on exclusive Pay-Per-View shows etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crowdfunding: A lot of more creative channels use platforms like Patreon to fund their videos through audience donations.</p>
</li>
<li>Livestreaming: This is a combination of ad revenue through platforms like Twitch and viewer donations/subscribtions.</li>
</ul>
<p>I would say these are the most common ones - nowadays many YouTubers have their own companies, providing services for brands or media companies, producing YouTube commercials etc.
Many YouTubers als get paid to speak at company events about social media or even straight up advice companies about their brands YouTube channels. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
