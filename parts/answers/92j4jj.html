		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You feel physical stimuli through <del>pain receptors, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nociceptor" target="_blank">nociceptors</a>.</del> nerves called exteroceptors. These come in various types, including thermal (allow you to feel heat/cold), mechanical (allow you to feel stretching/compression/deformation), and chemical (allow you to feel chemical burns, etc). </p>
<p>Exteroceptors are not uniformly distributed throughout your body. Your skin (especially hands) has the most. Internally, according to <a href="http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/d/d_03/d_03_m/d_03_m_dou/d_03_m_dou.html" target="_blank">this</a>, the  intestines, bladder, and uterus contain the most. The brain contains none at all, which is why the only painkillers needed during brain surgery are for the scalp. </p>
<p>So one answer here is that certain organs simply don't have many (or any) nerves that would allow you to feel it. </p>
<p>The second answer is that your brain is attuned to look for a change in stimuli. If I squeeze your hand, you'll notice. But if I keep squeezing it, after 5 or 10 minutes, your perception of that squeezing will substantially diminish (in fact, the action potentials generated will likewise diminish). This is because your body is keyed to detect changes in input, not inputs themselves. Your organs rubbing against each other is something that happens all the time, so your brain pretty much tunes it out. </p>
<p>EDIT: Changed noiceptors (pain receptors) to  exteroceptors per the comments below. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from a lack of nerve endings inside your abdomen (compared to pretty much any area of skin), some of your internal tissues do a very good job of keeping organs, muscles, and bones effortlessly sliding past each other, or held in place so they don't rub.</p>
<p>If you happen to find any connected joints at your grocer's meat department, you'll find they slide as easily as teflon. Compare to anyone who suffers from arthritis, where the bone tissues rub painfully against each other.</p>
<p>All of the tissue holding your intestines and other organs in place is a single organ called the mesentery. It works kind of like plastic pallet wrap, but also carries blood vessels and stores fat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So this will not be completely correct... Anyways you feel because some form of stimulus (heat, pressure, etc) activates a nerve ending which sends a signal to your brain. However only certain nerves can detect certain stimuli. So in essence, if there are no touch (pressure) sensing nerves in your organs then you would not feel them rubbing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to point out that people can get adhesions between their organs, and that hurts and you can feel your organs moving relative to each other. Adhesions are internal scar tissue and tend to be caused by having surgery. Then a rope of scar tissue can form between several organs and when you move in a certain way, perhaps your intestines will go one way and your uterus a different way and the rope of scar tissue will be pulled taut and it hurts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
