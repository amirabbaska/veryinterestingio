		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're asking about the storage of video, there's no need to keep each frame stored separately. Normal video codecs today only store some frames called keyframes. For all other frames, only the difference between the precious frame is stored, as this can be compressed more efficiently.</p>
<p>You could theoretically store video in many other ways. For example, you could store the different color values of the first pixel across all the frames, and then the same for the second pixel and so on. It would be highly inefficient, but it could still work.</p>
<p>If you're asking more about having the time dimension of video being discrete, I guess you could store the video in a continuous format. You could, for each pixel, store a continuous function of time giving the color values at any given time. That way you would not be bound to any frames. But defining these function would be highly non-trivial, either it would be very slow to compute or it would be very lossy (probably both).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you ignore the fact you're viewing it on a computer screen (which has a refresh rate and therefore 'frames'), vector animations can sort of do this.</p>
<p>Something like a flash animation - you don't store each frame normally, you store each object's start point and end point.</p>
<p>So if I had a square at T-0 Seconds, I can tell it at T+10 seconds I want it 15cm to the right.  I've not given it any frames, it has no frames stored in it - there are not 100 other location storage data between those two points - it just interprets everything in between - and what we see is motion, if we've done it fast enough.</p>
<p>Now once you <em>render</em> that out - then it's stored as a movie with a frame rate, but the initial data doesn't have that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can have animations that are saved as continuous motion, for example <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/71/Moebius-ladder-16-animated.svg" target="_blank">this one</a>. </p>
<p>Video recorded from real life? Well in principle it's possible, but nobody does it. Imagine a light-sensitive device where the light value from each pixel is recorded as a track on magnetic tape. It wouldn't be efficient, but it would be smooth in the time axis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You could render CGI just in real time depending on the computing power that you have available. For output you'd still have to show it broken down to frames because there is no other way to to show it to humans on a display. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In analog video you (basically*) have a stream of brightness information that goes across the image, then wraps around and starts at the beginning of the next line, and so on until you reach the bottom and start over at the top again (Raster scan).  Practically, these brightness values may be taken from a single moment in time (still frame), but you could certainly implement it such that a spot in the middle of the image shows the brightness at a time half way between the brightness for the first spot and the last spot.</p>
<p>If you've seen the rolling shutter videos where airplane propellers do surreal things, that's a result of the pixel values in the images coming from different moments in time.</p>
<p>Why do you ask?</p>
