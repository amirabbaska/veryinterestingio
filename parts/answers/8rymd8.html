And is there a general answer to this question, or would the answer be dependent on the application domain?</p>

What is your reaction to a comment by Noam Chomsky that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[Artificial Intelligence] is doing very little from a scientific point of view. It is achieving things from an engineering point of view. Which is OK -- nobody should be opposed to bigger bulldozers if they work. But we shouldn't be misled about the insight it is supposed to be providing into the nature of intelligence.</p>

<p>What is your opinion on adversarial attacks? Comments: your group has been doing many research in Bayesian machine learning. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.08244.pdf" target="_blank">Early results</a> show that adversarial attacks are less successful for neural nets learned with Bayesian inference. Can you comment?</p>
</li>
<li>Favorite learning algorithm for neural networks: variational inference or MCMC? You are known for comparing VI/MCMC to the bias/variance trade-off. MCMC: low bias, high variance; VI: low variance, high bias. What do you view as the benefit of being unbiased? It seems that neural networks have millions of parameters and the model does not resemble a physical process at all, so what value would we get from being unbiased?</li>
