		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mathematician here. Spheres, and in two dimensions, circles, solve a wide variety of optimization problems. Not only hydrostatic equalibrium (minimizing gravitational potential energy), but also the isoperimetric problem (maximum volume for fixed surface area), it's compliment (minimum surface area for fixed volume), minimum eigenvalue (lowest sound of a drum of fixed area), and many many more. I personally studied what happens when you combine two of these, such as the double bubble problem. Even when two bubbles stick together, every piece of the resulting shape is part of a sphere!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: Both planet and bubble formation are dominated by radially symmetric forces.  In the presence of free movement these systems will tend to organize into spheres.</p>
<p>The key here is forces that have radial symmetry.  For example the force of gravity is proportional to 1/r^2. This means that at any given distance away from the center of the earth (1 mile, 2 mile, etc.) the force of gravity is the same everywhere at that distance in three dimensions.  And the definition of a sphere is technically every single point in three dimensions that is one specific distance away from some specific location (the radius).  So gravitational force is said to have &quot;radial symmetry&quot; just like a sphere.</p>
<p>That means that if you could &quot;see&quot; gravitational forces around or even inside a planet they would kind of look like a set of concentric spheres, with the force of gravity being the same across the surface of any one shpere.</p>
<p>And there are many different forces at work in the universe, not all of which have radial symmetry.  But on the planetary scale gravity is usually the strongest and most dominant force, meaning that objects like planets and stars tend to form spherically.</p>
<p>But there are other forces, like surface tension, that are also radially symmetric.  And so basically in a system where radially symmetric forces are dominant, and where there is relative freedom for movement (like a bubble), these systems will tend to try to arrange themselves into a sphere.</p>
<p>And radially symmetric forces are actually incredibly common in the universe which is one of the reasons why spherical shapes are so common in nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to what RobusEtCeleritas said. When a celestial body is liquid (as it was after the supernova that created our solar system at 4.6Ga) and it's greater than ~10% the Earth's mass then the gravity is finally significant enough to create the equilibrium. This is partially why small moons and asteroids are usually lumpy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sphere is the largest volume within a given surface area. In a bubble, the air is being kept in by the water, in the case of the planets, its being pulled in by gravity. Over time, as the matter shifts, wouldnt it make sense to settle on a more or less spherical shape?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
