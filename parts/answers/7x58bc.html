I've read some estimates that the biomass of such comfortably exceeds that of the daylight world (i.e., everything but the life around underwater black smokers) by an order of magnitude.</p>
<p>Below a certain point, though, no, there's no water pooling up in small caverns.  The pressure and heat is too great even for fractured solid rock.  It's all hydrated into minerals and rocks.  It affects their formation, which is how we can tell it's there.  But that's about it.</p>
<p>The Soviet era Kola borehole project did find that mud from 12 km down was &quot;boiling&quot; with hydrogen.  Which is kinda cool.  Means that it was trapped there by gas-impermeable layers of rock above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you insist that it still be liquid water?  In many ways, the interior of the Earth is still unexplored and thus unknown.  It wasn't that long ago that <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133963-theres-as-much-water-in-earths-mantle-as-in-all-the-oceans/" target="_blank">some crystals</a> managed to change scientists entire perception of how much water is down there.  As for life, nothing we know about life allows it to survive in conditions of the Earth's mantle, where rock is semi-molten.  The deepest I've been able to reference is <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20827874-800-life-is-found-in-deepest-layer-of-earths-crust/" target="_blank">almost 1.4 km deep under the bottom of the Atlantic</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A full understanding of rocks and water in Earth Sciences requires some loose knowledge of thermodynamics and materials science.</p>
<p>Simplifying for the sake of summary, in the same way that salt can be dissolved into a glass of water (by salt atoms sitting in between gaps in the water molecules), it is possible for water to be dissolved into semi-molten and solid rocks (entire water atoms are intact, but held inside atomic lattices).  We call these &quot;hydrated&quot; or &quot;hydrous&quot; rocks.  In fact, such rocks/minerals are very common, and &quot;hydrated&quot; is the natural state of the upper mantle (the moltenish material that sits under the crust) probably about 0.02% by weight and the crust is a lot wetter.</p>
<p>Why is that important? Well, it means that any vaguely normal bit of the earth has water available.  We only need create the right conditions for water to emerge from the rocks it is currently locked into.  Understanding this is a thermodynamics problem that is not fully solved, but we can agree on the basics: hot, high-pressure systems generally release water.  We don't need continuous networks of cracks from the surface to allow water to percolate down into the crust like a giant aquifer.</p>
<p>For example, we have rock samples that come from the very lowest layers of the crust and contain esoteric evidence for water  (dunite channels from oceanic lithosphere), we know that subducted oceanic crust drags wet sediments into the mantle. So yes... Water everywhere.</p>
<p>Whether there is life is harder to know, but <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/earth-s-deep-crust-could-support-widespread-life-1.16575" target="_blank">literature</a> finding microbes in the weirdest damn deep reservoirs and mine shafts strongly suggests that life exists wherever there is an energy gradient that can be fed on --- and really weird salty crust water is a pretty viable medium.  My gut instinct is that any bit of water that has any remote communication with the surface will have microbes in it --- even if that communication is &quot;once touched another patch of water that touched another patch of water that touched another patch of water which 15 million years ago was in a ground aquifer&quot;.</p>
<p>(I am an academic who thinks about water in the mantle sometimes)</p>
<p>tl;dr: Q1: No, water probably exists at all crust depths, albeit in smaller amounts at greater depths.  Q2:Unknown but it seems increasingly likely that there is life</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
