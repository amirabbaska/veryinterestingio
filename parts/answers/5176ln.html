		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The core of Jupiter is very hot. As a result, there is a significant temperature differential between the upper layers of Jupiter's atmosphere, and the lower layers. This causes convection, which moves the atmosphere around (similar to our own atmosphere regarding global wind patterns and ocean currents). Additionally, the different gasses in Jupiter's atmosphere react relatively differently to heat and pressure, and so stratify into different layers. Each of these layers has a different color and behaves differently from one another and generally won't mix without outside influence. The rotation of the planet additionally affects the structure of Jupiter's atmosphere. All of these effects constantly acting together creates the banding and storms we observe on Jupiter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Arguably the most important consideration to Jupiter's iconic atmospheric structure which, as far as I can tell hasn't been discussed, is actually a consequence of an interesting result in the study of fluid turbulence.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pSXe4ri2KwE" target="_blank"> That result is that 2D fluid flows transfer energy <em>from</em> small scale structures <em>into</em> large scale structures as time progresses</a>. This may be unintuitive since most people are familiar with typical everyday 3D turbulence wherein large scale turbulent structures break down into smaller and smaller scales as time marches forward. This result, known as the inverse cascade, is <a href="http://people.atmos.ucla.edu/jcm/turbulence_course_notes/2D_homogeneous.pdf" target="_blank">mathematically provable</a> (PDF warning, but the figure on pg.7 is very understandable), given certain physical assumptions, using scaling analyses.</p>
<p>Jupiter's atmosphere can be approximated as a 2D flow since, near the surface, there is relatively little convection in the radial direction (<em>toward</em> the center) meaning that the near surface layers are stratified and don't mix with each other. These surface layers, while thick by human standards, are actually very thin when compared to the circumferential scale of the planet. All of this means that fluid flowing on the surface of Jupiter tends to remain at the surface, traveling laterally or longitudinally, but not radially. This is a 2D dominated flow.</p>
<p>Knowing that Jupiter's atmosphere is primarily 2D flow, we can apply results from the aforementioned mathematics which claim that small scale structures (like vortices) will, given enough time, begin to merge with one another creating <em>larger</em> vortices. This partially explains the Great Red Spot, which is a vary large scale vortex. Of course, other effects are also at play. Given enough time, even 2D turbulent systems will break down to a homogeneous average flow, due to the presence of viscosity (inertial energy is converted to heat). I would hazard to guess that Jupiter's residual heat from its formation, along with solar energy, helps to counteract viscous effects. Jupiter is also rotating about it's axis which adds some interesting dynamics to the mix. These dynamics don't greatly effect the turbulence arguments, but instead help to explain the distinct longitudinal striations on the planet's surface.</p>
<p>More examples of 2D turbulence giving rise to the inverse cascade include the Earth's own atmosphere,<a href="http://www.mae.buffalo.edu/research/laboratories/combustionlab/Flowing%20soap%20films/Flowing%20soap%20films.htm" target="_blank"> iridescence in soap bubbles</a>, and some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJP1J0_EhBk" target="_blank">pretty cool</a> office desk toys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look at <a href="http://solarviews.com/raw/earth/earthafr.jpg" target="_blank">this picture</a> of Earth. One could just as easily ask why Earth's atmosphere hasn't just blended into a single continuous grey cloud. The answer is that the atmosphere is a roiling, tumultuous mess of vapors, updrafts, downdrafts, jet streams, storms, etc. Jupiter's is the same way, perhaps even more so since the entire planet is gaseous. It's a self-perpetuating system of local variations that keep the atmosphere from ever being a smooth, united thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
