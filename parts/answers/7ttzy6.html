		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not quite sure if that what you mean, but...
They are silver (white or gray, depending on reflectivity) because we explicitly try to get them non-colored to better reflect color nuances.</p>
<p>Historically speaking, metal-covered glass mirrors were invented <del>somewhat recently (around 16th century, I think?)</del> Edit: Woah, they were invented in Ancient Rome! And they were <em>very</em> expensive Before that rich people were using polished silver, while a bit less rich used polished bronze or copper. Latter were, obviously, non-silver in color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That we think of mirrors as silver is psychological. Everyday mirrors actually have a very faint green tint.</p>
<p>It's just that we psychologically know that silver is capable of colour-preserving reflection, that's why we (you?) think  of it as silver-coloured.</p>
<p>Also, they are in fact coated with silver, but for to the near-perfect reflectivity and nearlx no scattering you cannot actually see it (or it weren't a good mirror). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
