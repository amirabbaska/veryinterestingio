		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When food gets really hot for a long time the complex carbons in food react and break down enough to leave behind pure carbon, which is black. This will happen with pretty much any food.</p>
<p>At lower temperatures, foods will brown due to similar reactions, but form flavor and aroma compounds instead of deteriorating completely. If this is done with amino acids and proteins, such as the grilling of meat, it is called the Maillard reaction. If it is done with carbohydrates such as sugar, is called caramelization. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Burning could also be called carbonising. I'm sure there's someone who can explain better than me, but burning food is the exact same as burning a lump of wood. Burning is a chemical reaction called combustion, and I can't remember any exact formulas but it uses oxygen, along with the organic compounds in the wood or food (generally composed of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen with some other fun things in there). One of the by products of the reaction is carbon dioxide which is just released into the air, and another is solid carbon, which is the black stuff left behind. Sorry if this answer is a bit long but basically;</p>
<p>TLDR: it goes black because the combustion reaction uses up most of the other parts of the compounds in the food, and what's left is solid carbon which is black.</p>
<p>Edit: as a few people have pointed out, it is incomplete combustion that produces solid carbon, which is the result of imperfect combustion conditions, for example not enough oxygen available for the reaction.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a combustion reaction, the same as burning wood. Ideally a carbon-hydrogen source reacts with oxygen to form CO2 and H2O. This means if you burned anything carbon based, there shouldn’t be anything left of the material other than water and carbon dioxide gas. But oxygen is the limiting reagent in this reaction which gives harmful byproducts like CO and volatile organic compounds and leaves unreacted products like  plain carbon (the black stuff). Charcoal is essentially just carbon and is often used as briquettes in barbecues because of the increased heat it gives off compared to wood. Its created by limiting oxygen during the combustion of wood to a point where only hydrogen, water and methane are released from the wood leaving behind pure carbon. </p>
<p>tl;dr The black stuff is carbon from incomplete combustion of anything carbon based</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of comments here are getting at the carbonization part, i.e. the fact that most organic matter such as food is made out of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), and other elements (N, S, P), and that when you burn it, the H and O is evaporated away in the form of water (H2O), leaving behind a bunch of C.  (This is a super simplified picture actually, food is very complex and consists of complex macromolecules such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, etc., and they all respond differently to combustion/pyrolysis--with some of them actually becoming quite tasty!  And while the stuff left behind is mostly carbon, a lot of other residual compounds are also present.)</p>
<p>A detail I want to point out though is that not all carbon is black!  For example, diamond 100% consists of carbon, but it is actually clear and transparent.  This is because carbon atoms can be arranged in many different ways, leading to the existence of different forms of carbon, called allotropes.  Some of these forms of carbon include materials such as graphite, diamond, buckyballs, graphene, and amorphous carbon.  Now you might remember from chemistry that every carbon atom can form up to four bonds with its valence (outer shell) electrons.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scienceabc.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Eight-allotropes-of-carbon.jpg" target="_blank">Visual guide to allotropes of carbon</a></p>
<p>If you take a look at the image linked above, you can see that while in diamond, every carbon atom is bonded to exactly four other carbon atoms, for other materials such as graphite, the carbon atoms are only bonded to three other partners!  When this is true, the extra electrons not participating in the fourth bond are actually &quot;delocalized&quot; or distributed/shared among all the carbon atoms, sort of like a giant shared electron cloud.</p>
<p>Now to fill in the last part of the picture, where does color come from?  Basically, when light or any other electromagnetic radiation hits a material, it can either be transmitted, reflected, absorbed, or scattered.  Light also comes in many different frequencies, and each color is associated with a specific frequency/wavelength.  For example, blue light is 450-500 nm, orange light is 590 to 620 nm, etc.  When you view a colored object such as an apple being red, that means that for the white light (from the sun, artificial lighting, your camera's flash, etc.) shining/incident on the apple, all the colors making up the light are absorbed/scattered EXCEPT for the color red, which is reflected back at your eyes.  Now here's the interesting part--what colors an object absorbs/scatters is completely dependent on its atomic/molecular structure!  For diamonds, the carbon atoms form an extremely well-ordered and regular, almost perfect, lattice, and the frequencies of energies they absorb are very narrow as a result.  This in turns results in diamond not being able to absorb/scatter any colored light in the visible spectrum, and diamond being a clear and transparent material!  On the other hand, for materials such as graphite, the delocalized electrons we mentioned earlier have a lot of freedom of movement, and their random motions enable them to absorb/scatter a broader range of frequencies, including visible/colored light.  This results in graphite's blackish color, since almost nothing is being reflected back at you.</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, burned food is mostly amorphous carbon, graphite, and miscellaneous random carbon nanostructures such as nanotubes, all of which do a mighty fine job of absorbing/scattering all the visible light you can throw at it.  In general, the more disordered/random/amorphous a material is, the better it is at absorbing/scattering light.  If only burning food could create diamonds though, but alas, that process takes quite a bit of energy input (high pressure, high temperature, or Superman's grip) to get all the carbon atoms to form that nice, ordered lattice.  Anyway, it's just super interesting how it's not only important to consider what a material is made of, but how the stuff it's made of is organized!  The chemical/physical basis of color is also a fascinating topic to consider, since the color of things (pigments/dyes, veins, the sky, etc.) is something we take for granted on a day-to-day basis.</p>
<p>Probably not quite ELI5, and I'm pretty rusty on my materials science, but just wanted to share my perspective on things!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
