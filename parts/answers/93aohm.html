		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay,  think about it this way. </p>
<p>Imagine that you want to specify exactly where and when something happened.</p>
<p>So, first you have to put it somewhere on earth:</p>
<p>You need  longitude (how far East or West from a specific place)
and latitude (how far North or South from a specific place). </p>
<p>So you have two separate measurements you need to take to put something at a particular place on the earth's surface. (also up-down, if you want to worry about being above sea level).</p>
<p>For time, we usually have only one line we worry about : Past-Future. </p>
<p>What Hawking is saying is that in order to do certain kinds of physics, it might be useful to have a second line that <em>behaves like</em> our normal time-line, the Past-Future line, but is as distinct from it from it as the East-West line is from the North-South line.</p>
<p>So, just like the East-West and North-South lines are sort of similar in how we interact with them, but perpendicular to each other (but very different in behavior from the time-line) - the regular Past-Future line and the &quot;Imaginary Past-Imaginary Future&quot; line would be similar in the way they behave, but treated as &quot;perpendicular&quot; to each other in calculations. </p>
<p>Why &quot;imaginary&quot;? Because there's a kind of numbers called imaginary numbers, and you work with them by taking the normal number line, and putting another number line perpendicular to that, which is called the imaginary &quot;axis&quot; (another word for line). </p>
<p>So now you're probably wondering what it would &quot;feel like&quot; to deal with two different kinds of time ... at the same time.  And there's no real answer to that, because we're only made to experience our one kind of time, and this &quot;imaginary time&quot; is mainly talked about to help understand certain physics calculations about the beginning of the universe - it's not something we could experience ourselves. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Normal numbers get bigger and positive when you square them.
Imaginary numbers get bigger and negative when you square them.
Time is measured with these numbers. Moving in time contributes negatively to the Pythagorean theorem, moving in space contributes positively. Those numbers always add up to a constant, and the exchange rate between distance and time is the speed of light. Photons move 100% in space, and experience no time passing. We material objects move in space so little as to be unnoticeable, so we move (almost) entirely in time. When objects move at speeds closer to the speed of light, there is less interval available with which to experience the passage of time.</p>
<p>edit: fixed an inaccuracy, I was tired. I'm glad this helped out some folks! IANAScientist, just a nerd, so I encourage you to research more on your own! This stuff is extremely cool, at least to me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy, this is a tough one to ELI5, but I'll try. Without getting into too much detail, the important part of general relativity is what is known as a metric tensor (the name is kinda intimidating, but try not to worry about it). Basically, this is the thing that gives you all of the information about your spacetime. However, the only difference between a space dimension and a time dimension is a negative sign (so the time term gets a negative and the space term gets a positive or vice versa depending on convention). It also turns out that, usually, these terms are all squared. So, if you multiply the time term by the square root of -1, you get back a space term. But the square root of -1 is an &quot;imaginary&quot; number, hence the name imaginary time.</p>
<p>But what's the point of it? Well there are a lot of thermodynamic implications of imaginary time, but I think you are more asking about the big bang type of deal. Essentially, what Hawking (and others with him) found is that, by considering imaginary time and using it with standard time, you can &quot;cap off&quot; certain types of universe. Basically, at early times, you can consider time to be imaginary and therefore act more like space. What this does is actually closes up the boundary of the spacetime so that it looks like it is all originating from one point. It gives you a big bang. This is known as a Hartle-Hawking state and has actually been a very valuable tool for understanding quantum gravity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big problem when talking about imaginary time is the real-life definition of &quot;imaginary&quot;, which gives the impression that imaginary time (and imaginary numbers) are &quot;made up&quot; or &quot;not part of reality&quot; in a way that non-imaginary time (and real numbers) are. This misunderstanding dates back to when someone first came up with a convention for taking the root of negative one, which was met with such derision that the resulting numbers got the epithet &quot;imaginary&quot;. And we got stuck with it.</p>
<p>All that happened was that we found out that the result of a square root of a negative number wasn't in the old set of numbers. We then found out that if we defined a new number as equal to that value (<em>i</em>), we could manipulate combinations of that new number with the old numbers and we would have an entirely new set of numbers that all the old operations still work on. We made them up, but it's <em>really important</em> to note here, <em>we didn't make them up in a way that was any different than how we made up all the rest of math up to that point</em>. The concept of zero is equally imaginary, we just calculate with it all the time, so we are comfortable with it.</p>
<p>Now, back to imaginary time, it turns out that there are some ways of describing time that map them to some sets of numbers that, when multiplied by <em>i</em>, result in similar sets of numbers that also usefully describe time. The approaches are not ways you'd normally count time--they are specifically used to relate special relativity to other physics concepts--so there's no such thing as a &quot;clock to measure imaginary time&quot;, or something. It's not an &quot;inverse time&quot; similar to dark matter, either--it is simply a way of describing time's behavior in a very specific context where this math is used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time needs one number to describe a point in time.</p>
<p>Space needs three numbers to describe a point in space. </p>
<p>Space is three dimensional, forward-back, left-right &amp; up-down</p>
<p>To make 4D space-time the timeline needs an extra dimension, just like a line needs a flat sheet of paper to be drawn on.</p>
<p>Mixing the 1D timeline with 3D space requires a second dimension of time. It as if the timeline were drawn on a 2D sheet of paper.</p>
<p>The second dimension is called imaginary time.</p>
<p>Imaginary means it is a numberline based on the square root of -1, called an imaginary number.</p>
<p>Imaginary numbers keep separate from normal numbers which is useful for a dimension.</p>
<p>Imaginary numbers have mathematical properties that allow rotation between the real and imaginary dimensions - just like a line can be rotated on a flat piece of paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
