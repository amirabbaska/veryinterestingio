When the egg white is clear, you're seeing a solution with dissolved proteins in it.</p>
<p>Proteins are very large molecules that are typically designed to function in a certain range (of temperature, pH, ...). For most proteins, that range does not include typical cooking temperatures. On a molecular level, the heat imparted by cooking is enough to undo some of the bonds that give protein its structure.</p>
<p>Then the protein loses its shape, so it is no longer water soluble. Then the proteins come out of solution as a solid. This solid happens to have a white color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
