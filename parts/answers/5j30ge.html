		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The comments about pus being a byproduct of infection and inflammation are quite right, although it's worth remembering that the creation of pus is specifically related to clearing infection from the body. White blood cells are attracted to the site of disease through processes like chemotaxis (migrating to sites that have high levels of chemicals either released by bacteria, or released by other white blood cells), and pus is formed as they engulf bacteria and then lyse/destroy them. All of the dead blood cells, bacteria and other breakdown products are what form pus (and by weight it's almost all white blood cells).</p>
<p>Like most processes relating to infection, you can have too much of a good thing, and while the inflammatory response is necessary for healing, pus building up to the visible levels the OP is thinking of is a sign that infection is not under control. If pus collects into an abscess, it's best to drain it away - even if you are on antibiotics, the pH changes considerably in the middle of an abscess, and antibiotics may not penetrate to the middle or work as well.</p>
<p>The belief that pus was necessary to healing is an old one, so the question is common - &quot;laudable pus&quot; was though to be a good part of healing and so encouraged until fairly recently in medical history!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Like many said, it doesn't aid in wound healing. It is a by-product of your body fighting an infection and can actually inhibit wound healing. </p>
<p>Too much pus can cause a wound to get stuck in the Inflammation Stage of wound healing. The dead bacteria ( if gram -) release endotoxins and there are other inflammatory chemicals and whatnot floating around which don't help to heal the wound.
Trapped pus can form an abscess<del>, and sometimes a cyst</del> when your body tries to wall off the infection. </p>
<p>Also, wounds heal best in a moist environment. Too much pus and other liquids (called exudate) can lead to the breakdown of the surrounding healthy skin. </p>
<p>Edit: thanks u/cclugston13 for correcting me about cysts... I know mostly about chronic wounds, not so much other health related things.</p>
<p>For those curious about moist wound healing- google up Dr. George Winter. This approach is used for many chronic wounds and is very successful.
Healthy individuals with small wounds generally don't need this type of wound environment to heal, but it would still help it heal faster, but healthy people heal so fast that it really is more trouble than it's worth. Neosporin plus band-aid is generally <em>too much</em> moisture and leads to maceration- the breakdown of healthy skin (when your skin starts turning white and wrinkly). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's basically formed of dead white blood cells. When you get a wound that ends up being infected your body sends loads of white blood cells to target and eat the bacteria. Many of the white blood cells end up dying either due to old age or because the bacteria release chemicals that kill them. </p>
<p>So it doesn't serve a 'function' so much as it is a by-product of some types of bacterial (or fungal) infection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's like the cleanup after the war. You don't want any dead bodies lying around cuz then people would get sick. So you all put the corpses in one place and seal it off from the rest of the community. No one gets sick. And some outside force should drain the deadpool or else the dam might break and infect everyone. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you think of your immune system as your body's military, pus is basically a battlefield after a battle -- it's a giant pile of the corpses of white blood cells (your body's soldiers) and the bacteria they were sent to fight. It's indicative that your body's military force is intervening and taking care of the problem, but if the pile of corpses gets too big, that might indicate that your side is getting overwhelmed by the bacteria. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
