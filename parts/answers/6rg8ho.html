		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, everything with a temperature is emitting black-body radiation with a distinctive Planck distribution of wavelengths:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation</a></p>
<p>For things on Earth, like you or me or a wall or whatever, which are at about 300 Kelvin, the peak of this emission is in the infrared, which is why we see no glow with human eyes (can see it fine with an IR camera though, that's what &quot;predator vision&quot; or thermal imaging is).  For something like the Sun, whose surface is 6000 K, the peak of thermal radiation is in the visible (it's almost like our eyes evolved to take advantage of that!).  That's what sunlight is, blackbody/thermal radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Processes like atomic transitions  that occur between bound states are discrete, but not all quantum processes are that way. Synchrotron radiation, Bremstrahlung (free-free emission), and Compton emission are processes that occur between two free particles or between one free particle and a photon. For free particles, energy is continuous rather than discrete even on the quantum level, so a continuous blackbody spectrum is easily produced. Note that because the Sun is hot, its hydrogen is mostly ionized. Therefore, there are few bound particles present at all, and continuous emission processes dominate on the Sun. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think all of these answers are good, but way more complicated than they need to be. You are correct that there are discrete frequencies that account for much of the radiation. But not all radiation is produced by an electron changing state from one orbital to another, in the manner that would produce specific bands with gaps in between them.  In plasmatized matter, like you'd find on a star's surface, there are liberated charges all over the place, accelerating every which way, every possible amount, as a result of thermal kinetic motion and collisions. Every time one of them is accelerated, a different wavelength can be emitted. So it is possible to identify certain frequencies in the radiation of stars, but also a continuous spectrum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
