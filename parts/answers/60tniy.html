		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There can be stuff in between, it just can't be enough to completely block out the star. We will often see stars as being &quot;reddened&quot; because of the dust and gas in our line of sight that blocks out part of the light. Stars can also be partially eclipsed by a planet moving in front of them, but planets are much smaller than stars and only block out a small fraction of a stars' light.</p>
<p>But yeah, generally space is very very empty, and you usually have a clean line of sight to most objects. The biggest issue is the dust and gas within the Milky Way - when we look straight along the plane of the Milky Way disc, we're looking through the thickest part of the disc, and all that dust and gas adds up and blocks out much of our own galaxy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

This is when an object bends the light around it, so we actually see the star in one place when it is in another, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_lens#/media/File:Einstein_cross.jpg" target="_blank">we see multiple copies of the same thing, but the light went in multiple directions around an object.</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically there could be a massive object in between that curves the light. In most cases though there can't be large objects in the way (small objects such as planets and asteroids can still be in the way seeing as they are so relatively small compared to the star.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There could be stuff in between you and the star your seeing as the light your seeing is very old. Planets or other objects could have easily gotten between you and the star but the light was already on its way here</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There in fact could be something obstructing it. The thing about looking a star X light-years away is that you are seeing the light from X years ago. If you watched something obstruct it it was actually obstructing it X years ago. Hell the star could have gone supernova 100 million years ago and we would have no idea. So in fact if someone was observing our planet from 19 lightyears away right now they would be observing 1998 when the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell, and plummeted 16 feet through the announcers table.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
