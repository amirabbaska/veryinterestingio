<p>From the POV of the exterior, though, it doesn't matter - a shell with the radius of the event horizon containing all the mass of the black hole would have exactly the same gravity field as a point at the centre.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't matter.  Any arbitrary (i.e. not point-like) distribution of mass, with total mass M, is gravitationally indistinguishable from a point-mass of mass M if you're at a distance much greater than the width of the distribution.  So a cube of mass M, a sphere of mass M, a blob of mass M, etc. are no different from a point particle of mass M at a distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It only takes an infinite amount of time to cross the event horizon from the perspective of an external observer. Someone falling into a black hole would experience it in normal time (until they get stretched to death by the extreme gravity gradient or just run out of oxygen).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question. If an extremely massive object passes the event horizon is there a time period where the black holes center of gravity does not align with the center of event horizon? Does the warping of space time effectively make black holes symmetrical once matter passes the event horizon?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
