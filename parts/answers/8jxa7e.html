<p>Abolition of the guild  resulted in that anyone could become a butcher, baker or cheesemaker and is was easy to open restaurants. Many aristocrats was killed of fled so  there was a large number of competent cooks and servats that needed  of find work. So what they made before for the rich started to be sold to the public and you the beginning of the French cuisine.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Italian cook here: it's a cuisine that unifies the South (healthy, olive oil based, Mediterranean) and the North (fat, butter based, continental) of Europe. That's why it can appeal to both worlds. They also imported a lot of Italian cooks during their early kingdom history, which resulted in strong culinary culture and highly developed techniques. From there, they built a really complex &quot;High Cuisine&quot; and exported the worldwide famous terminology during their empire. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a legend that the French culinary legacy all stems from Catherine De Medici bringing Italian chefs with her to Paris when she married Henry II.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an old line that says that you can be at war with France but never at war with Paris. In Paris they had a very interesting set up called the salon. It was basically the first restaurant culture. Before this you would go home to eat or if you were traveling would basically stay at a bed and breakfast and eat whatever was served to you. In the salons they offered more than one option for your lunch or dinner. If you didn't like a particular Salon you could walk across the street and go to a different one. Quite literally the first time in history anybody had real options for lunch. This led to a competitive nature between the different salons to attract clients based on their food. So chefs would try to outdo each other and create better and better and better recipes. The rest of the world picked up on it later, copying the French model, but they were years behind in actually working out recipes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
