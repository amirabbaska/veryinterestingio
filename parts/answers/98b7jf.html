<p>Hypothetically yes, a container of CO2 would freeze in those conditions, in a practical sense though, CO2 only makes up 0.04% of the atmosphere, and, unlike water nucleating into raindrops, won't gather into single places, so you wouldn't actually get dry ice snow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's cold enough, but there is very little CO2 in the atmosphere. You can't look at the sublimination point at 1 atm because the partial pressure of CO2 is much lower. The low partial pressure of carbon dioxide would cause it to subliminate in this environment--some molecules are freezing out, but at the same time others are sublimating and there is no accumulation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not really. This has nothing to do with freezing point and everything to do with saturation: air can contain humidity even if the air temperature is below freezing. At some temperature carbon dioxide <em>will</em> precipitate out of the site as dry ice &quot;snow&quot;, but that temperature is very low because there is very little CO2 in the air, about 0.04%.    </p>
<p>Compare that to water, which typically make up about 1% of the air and has a much higher freezing point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere on Earth is not in a high enough concentration to cause CO2 snowfall. </li>
<li>At the locations in Antarctica that experience these temperatures the air is extremely dry and there would be little H2O to cause normal snowfall. Some, but these temperatures occur in a desert.</li>
