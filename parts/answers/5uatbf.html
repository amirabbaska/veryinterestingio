<p>The Secretaries of Defense and State are likely to know almost as much information as the President, but they don't get lifetime protection. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The secrets also become dated. The world was a very different place in the 1990's. Are Clinton's secrets about Saddam Hussein really as valuable today considering the fact that he's dead? I'm sure it's interesting, but probably not that useful. </p>
<p>Also, in 1997 Congress signed an act that limited Secret Service protection for presidents to ten years after office. Obama reversed it, though, so now all presidents receive lifetime protection again. But the protection becomes much more limited. When I was in school in Boston 3 years ago or so Bill Clinton walked through the bookstore and all he had was a few agents with him. Contrast that to the current president where they close off highway exits that lead to where he is at the time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Continuing Secret Service protection also means you can't credibly threaten a president with future harm once they leave office. </p>
<p>Former US presidents are guaranteed a cushy retirement. And they tend to retire gracefully, which is good for the country. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is part of counterintelligence to consider this. If a person is compromised, then whatever information they ever had access to is considered compromised. That's why security breaches are so painful. It's also why the modern intelligence aparatus must be compartmentalized. Most of the incriminating information is about how we collect information. </p>
<p>For instance, if we have a record of who the attaches are in an embassy that belong to that nations intelligence service, it's not as important as the how we got it. All of them will be replaced, and as long as our method of obtaining information is secure, we can continue to monitor the correct people. Generally speaking, the president won't know, the how we get something. He doesn't have time for it, he'll just know the what. </p>
<p>As for the how, it can get pretty dicey, especially when we get it from a third party. Everyone spies on their allies, since often our allies know the kinds of things we want to know about our enemies, but they can't tell us because it would compromise their sources. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
