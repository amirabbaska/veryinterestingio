		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Non-rotating?</p>
<p>We don't really discuss such things very often because it's not a stable situation--the orbit around the star will result in a tidal force that imparts a torque to the planet, causing it to start rotating. A planet that's rotating counter to the direction of its orbit, like Venus, can be expected to eventually have zero rotation (unless, as may be the case with Venus, tidal effects from other planets counteract this), but its rotational speed would only be exactly zero for an instant, as this would be a continuous process of angular acceleration.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are no examples of this as far as Iâ€™m aware, every object in space rotates. </p>
<p>You could examine the orbit of Uranus, which rotates on its side, producing a relatively similar effect. The poles get sunlight for half a year, and then no sunlight for the other half. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A planet like that would have to be rotating the opposite direction of the way it would tend to be going after it's stars tidal forces worked on it long enough. From the perspective of the universe more or less it would be moving around the star, from the perspective of the star it would be rotating slowly in the &quot;wrong&quot; direction one time per orbit. An observer on the surface of the planet would see the star cross the sky once in a year while all the background stars would hold more or less steady in their positions.  Since I doubt anyone has found such a scenario I believe this would be called a &quot;retrograde&quot; rotation of one per year.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mercury is close!  For every <strong>3</strong> days on Mercury, it orbits the sun <strong>2</strong> times in a 3/2 orbital resonance. Astronomers used to think (as recently as the 1960's!) that Mercury was tidally locked.  </p>
<p>Anything between resonance, spinning, and tidal locking isn't stable enough, and therefore interesting enough, to be named.<br />
However! There are a tone of named orbits.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_orbits" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_orbits</a></p>
<p>Your question makes me think of Lagrangian points, specifically L1.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_point</a>   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think there's a term for that.
I don't think we've observed that either.
But you can count it does exist somewhere, at least temporally. I don't think that'd be an stable orbit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
