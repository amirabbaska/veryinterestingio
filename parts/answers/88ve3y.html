Asthma inhalers contains molecules (such as salbutamol) that will force the airways to release the tightness and therefore open again so the person can breathe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different types of medications in the inhalers, which are known as metered dose inhalers, or MDIs.</p>
<p>First, you should understand what asthma is. Asthma is a reactive obstructive lung disease which causes air trapping, which means the patient can breath in, but has trouble getting rid of the air in their lungs due to narrowed pathways in the lungs caused by inflammation and tightening of the smooth muscles that makeup these pathways.</p>
<p>The most common medication used that most people are probably familiar with is Albuterol, and this is what is most commonly used in rescue inhalers. Albuterol is a bronchodilator, and specifically a beta agonist. A beta agonist is a medication that specifically targets beta receptors (receptors are sites on cells which cause specific reactions when triggered by specific matching molecules), which are found on smooth muscle, like those in the airways in the lungs. The reaction between the beta agonist and the beta receptor on the smooth muscle triggers the smooth muscle to relax, which expands the airways, allowing the patient to expell that trapped air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most inhalers for asthmatics work because they are bronchodilators. This means that they work to relax the muscles in your airways (bronchi and bronchioles) in order to decrease the resistance and increase airflow into the lungs. They also can help to reduce inflammation, which has the same result of widening those airways.
The medicine mimics the signals that your body normally makes to carry out this action.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Asthma is an inflammation of the <em>bronchi</em> and <em>bronchioles</em> in the lungs (the smallest tubes where gas goes in and out), which means they swell up and let less air in and out. The medicines in inhalers work to decrease inflammation, so the gases in your lungs can get in and out effectively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
