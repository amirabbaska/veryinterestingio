		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many left Digg long before the v4 update. Here's the timeline how I see it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>First they introduced a Friends System where you could send 'shouts' to all your friends on digg to promote your submissions. This had the effect of a handful of well-connected users (notably <a href="http://readwrite.com/2008/05/17/digg_users_revolt_against_mrbabyman" target="_blank">MrBabyMan</a>) taking over the front page with crummy reposts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then they censored posts that contained the HD-DVD/Blu-ray encryption key which caused a huge backlash. Literally the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/a/ae/HD_DVD_Night_Digg_Frontpage_before_rose_blog_post_screenshot.png" target="_blank">entire</a> front page contained the key in protest, and the admins couldn't keep up. Eventually they lifted the ban.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then they changed the comment system to hide all replies beyond top-level comments by default, which greatly discouraged discussion. Why put effort into a detailed reply when few people are going to see it? Basically the way <a href="http://imgur.com/gallery/Y9G4SpV" target="_blank">Imgur comments</a> are now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then they introduced Facebook Connect. Ugh. Facebook and anonymous communities do not mix. Plus it made it even easier for popular users to get their posts promoted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then they introduced DiggBar. Clicking any link showed it inside a frame with a Digg toolbar. Generally, Digg was getting bloated with feature creep and it was adding complexity and dragging down loading times.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then they removed threaded comments completely. And since comments are sorted by diggs, it was impossible to reply to anyone. It was all a bunch of random one-liners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then they introduced an auto-submit feature for publishers to promote their content, which flooded new submissions.</p>
</li>
<li>But the nail in the coffin was Digg v4 on August 25, 2010. They removed the ability to bury, so advertisers got diggs simply through brand popularity and no one could counterbalance it. Most of the front page became either sponsored posts or reddit links in protest. There was a big focus on &quot;following&quot; companies to customize your front page. The new design was also often unreachable or unstable at launch. August 30, 2010 became 'quit digg day', and reddit updated their logo to include a digg shovel to welcome new users.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People really started to leave Digg soon after Digg v4 arrived. The version 4 arrived unstable and filled with bugs, and had several core features removed, rendering the site nearly unusable, such as :</p>
<ul>
<li>Burying (i.e. Digg's version of downvoting)</li>
<li>Favoriting posts</li>
<li>Subcategories (digg had main categories, like Technology or Gaming, each divided into about 10 specific subcategories)</li>
<li>Videos</li>
</ul>
<p>This obviously led to a lot of disgruntled users. Despite claims from the admins, very little was fixed, and far too late. At that time, reddit was really picking up speed. On Digg, a &quot;quit Digg day&quot; was declared, and massive groups of people left Digg for reddit. After v4, the traffic dropped. To many, that's pretty much when Digg died.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's some important details missing here.  I see references to Digg v3.  While that was problematic, <em>it didn't cause the mass-exodus</em>.  That was Digg v4 which was focused on two things (1) figuring out how to monotize as they weren't making shit at that point and (2) how to more effectively scale the platform by making a switch from SQL to NoSQL.</p>
<p>While a lot of stuff went wrong, there are a few key things that led to the biggest problems for Digg.  Cassandra DB was decided on as the NoSQL solution to be used in Digg v4.  While it was theoretically a great choice, it was extremely premature (or awesome bleeding edge if your cup if half full).  It was not stable, and I'd guess not very well understood by the developers and system architects on Digg's side.  During development of Digg v4, specific users were invited to beta test the new platform many (6+) months in advance of launch.  It wasn't pretty.  It wasn't even passable.  It was horrendous - ugly, slow, and half the time didn't work at all.</p>
<p>The problem was that beta users were providing this feedback to Digg, and quite literally, none of the feedback was taken into account.  Digg just didn't listen.  They assumed that whatever they did, because they were Digg, it would pan out and people would just accept it (kind of reminds me of Reddit right now!)...and well...that isn't what happened. </p>
<p>Digg v4 launched, and it was awful (big surprise!).  Nothing that was problematic many /many/ months prior were fixed.  Users hated it, ads were everywhere and the content no longer felt user driver.  In addition, the system was so unstable, you were lucky if the site would do simple things properly like posting comments or up-voting (pretty much what we saw during the invitation beta mind you).  </p>
<p>Did I mention Digg v4 was on a completely new (and incompatible) backend with v3?  Makes sense since they were migrating from SQL to NoSQL.  Unfortunately, this meant rolling back to v3 would not be possible.</p>
<p>In the end, it was Digg's ignorance that led to it's spectacular downfall (and rival Reddit's new user explosion).  Ultimately them not listening to the community about what was, and wasn't working, did them in.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
