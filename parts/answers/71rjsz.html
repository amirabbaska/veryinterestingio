		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as science goes, your guess is a good as anyone else's.   Most astrobiologists believe that there are many ways to form life, with many varying modes of transmitting genetic information or for maintaining disequilibrium with the environment; however, whether or not it is likely for life to form based entirely off of non-carbon chain molecules? - that is a huge point of contention.   The most likely element (after carbon) life could be based on would be silicon; however, silicon bonds are weaker than those of carbon, so the range of possible stable molecules that silicon can make are thought to be much less than that of carbon.</p>
<p>Personally (completely conjecture here) I do think it is possible to have life based on other elements somewhere in the universe.  However, I expect the overwhelming majority of cases to be based off of carbon.  The way I see it, it is a probabilities game...and carbon is just such a versatile element, it allows for an immensely larger number of ways and environments in which it could initiate life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly the more I study biochemistry the more I think it's unlikely. Carbon can form so many bonds in so many different ways that it's hard to imagine any other element forming the chemical backbone of life. While silicon is often mentioned in these things, it would have totally different chemistry and wouldn't be able to do a lot of things carbon can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You will get better answers if you specify what you mean by life. Very simple microorganisms could be made from almost anything. Large, complex life similar to us is a much different question. Our bodies require encoding a large amount of information. This means either very large molecules like DNA,  or some extremely complex way of combining many small molecules into a stable structure and orchestrating them, which is unlikely. Carbon is the only element which can make giant, stable molecules which can also easily be modified to suit different roles, like proteins. This is because it's on the first row of the periodic table, and thus has no inner electron shells, allowing strong covalent bonds of several different kinds.  You can't build a large foldable protein out of anything else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back in 2009 or 2010, there was a group of scientists who discovered amoeba ( i think) in an arsenic laden pond. They were able to have the amoeba create ATP using the arsenic instead of phosphorous. They still used carbon, but it was a pretty big breakthrough at the time showing how an element we thought was required for life, wasn't really necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
