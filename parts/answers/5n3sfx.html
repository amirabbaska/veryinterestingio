		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I wrote my dissertation on this very topic and I don't think anyone's nailed it in their answers yet. </p>
<p>Edit - I've only got a hard copy of the dissertation (I graduated years ago). Thanks to everyone who asked to read it, if I remember I'll try and scan it.</p>
<p>Crash91 has got a lot right but has made a few points I disagree with.</p>
<p>So, </p>
<p>Heavy Metal - This grew out of Hard Rock and used the same scales, rhythms and subject matter. Black Sabbath are widely cited as the first true Heavy Metal band, giving birth to both the Heavy Metal genre in general and the Doom Metal genre in particular. Led Zepellin, Deep Purple etc are Hard Rock and are only accepted as Heavy Metal bands in the US. In the UK Heavy Metal begins with Sabbath. Original Heavy Metal was fairly slow, gloomy, bluesy and lyrically dealt with subjects such as war, drugs, religion and occult themes. Vocals clean and sung.</p>
<p>Later iterations in the 70s, such as Saxon, Iron Maiden and Judas Priest are also considered Heavy Metal but are sometimes referred to as NWOBHM (New Wave of British Heavy Metal) and were pioneers of the 'chugging' guitar sound people often associate with classic Heavy Metal as well as the use of twin guitar harmonised leads. Generally faster and more bombastic, the vocals of NWOBHM were more high pitched and the lyrics while dealing with similar themes, more fantastical. Hair or Glam Metal also grew out of this style (but it's awful!).</p>
<p>Thrash Metal - Thrash was a product of the 80s and metal's reaction to the aggression of Punk in the late 70s. The band that kick started the whole thing were Venom from Newcastle in the UK. They are sometimes classed as NWOBHM but they don't really fit in that category because they were pretty poor musicians. Their contribution was mainly down to aural extremity, though they sound fairly tame now. They had a 'heavier' sound than previous bands combining speed, harsher distortion tone on their guitars, faux satanic lyrics and shouted/growled vocals. They were a big influence on a lot of Thrash and Black metal bands but were pretty rubbish themselves (controversial opinion!).</p>
<p>Early Thrash was pretty loose and messy with a lot of poor musicianship, bands like Sodom, Kreator and Destruction (Germany) made an unholy racket and began to attract the punk kids as well as the metalheads. Later bands worked out how to play their instruments better and the drumming in particular became more accomplished. Classic Thrash as played by the big four (Metallica, Megadeath, Slayer and Anthrax) combines very fast drumming often using 'punkier' beats, NWOBHM guitar riffs played at faster speeds, more aggressive vocals and 'face ripping' (extremely fast and shrill) solos which are often atonal (not in any given key!). Lyrically Thrash was concerned with politics, nuclear war and occult/satanic themes.</p>
<p>Death Metal - In the late 80s there was a lot of genre cross pollination and this lead to Death Metal and Grindcore (as well as many other specialist 'cores). Death Metal ramps up the intensity, complexity, heaviness and obscenity of Thrash Metal. It downtunes the guitars (makes them sound deeper) and is characterised by a particular drum beat known as the 'blast beat', and the use of double kick pedals on the bass drum to achieve a rumbling, machine-gun like effect. The vocals are extremely low grunts, growls and roars and are almost impossible to decipher without a lyric sheet. Similar to Thrash, early Death Metal bands struggled to make their musicianship meet their intentions but later bands and a lot of modern bands play music of quite dizzying complexity utilising odd time signatures and even bizarre tunings (tuning the strings on their guitars differently) to make the sound more unsettling. </p>
<p>This is the overall 'heaviest' style of metal sonically and lyrically deals with all manner of things including but not limited too, gore, zombies, war, sexual perversions, horror movies, torture and ancient Egypt (that's just one band called Nile from the US to be fair). Death Metal's heyday was the late 80s and early 90s but there's still plenty of great modern Death Metal being made today. While Thrash is seen as a retro style that will always evoke the early 80s, Death Metal has evolved much further and incorporated far more styles including, doom, prog, industrial and middle eastern/oriental music.</p>
<p>Black Metal - This one's a bit unique as it all began with a small group of teenagers in Jessheim in Norway in the late 80s/early 90s. They wanted to be 'evil' and 'extreme' but they lacked the musical ability to rival the predominantly (at the time) Swedish and American Death Metal scenes. So instead they did what anyone would do (not) they started burning down churches, proclaiming themselves 'Satanists' and killing each other. They were influenced by bans such as Venom (UK), Mercyful Fate (Denmark) and Celtic Frost (Switzerland) all of whom had elements of NWOBHM and Thrash in their sounds but distinguished themselves by being 'Satanic' with varying degrees of seriousness.</p>
<p>Whether or not they were serious, the kids in Norway took it all very seriously and out of that scene came what's come to be known as the 'Second Wave of Black metal', generally accepted as it's 'classic' phase. This style is typified by ultra lo-fi production values including lots of hiss, feedback and distortion a focus on treble rather than bass and vocals that were shrieked or screamed rather than grunted or growled. The music itself is far more primitive and basic than Death Metal and often utilises fast tremolo (rapid down/up strokes on a single string) guitar parts and minor scale arpeggios. Guitar solos are rare. </p>
<p>Due to these production techniques the music can take on a hypnotic quality where it's passed through heavy on to something more languid on the other side. Critics say it's poorly played, badly recorded and the product of stupid teenagers with offensive views. The early Norwegian black metal guitar sound has often been likened to a swarm of angry wasps in a box but those who love it find something spiritual about it. The lyrics deal with Satanism of course but also a strand of Nietzschean elitism and an affinity with the Norwegian landscape (ice, frost, forests, mountains etc).</p>
<p>Later Black Metal has evolved in myriad ways and incorporated allsorts of other styles including folk, celtic, oriental/middle eastern, prog, goth, shoegaze and traditional Nordic music. Offshoots include Blackened Death Metal, Viking Metal and Symphonic Black metal which combines the music with sweeping orchestral backing.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its not easy to define precisely what counts as which genre in metal, especially with the large number of sub-genres. The lines between many are blurry and there are even many &quot;crossover&quot; artists or genres. I think its a bit better to take the bands that defined the sound of the genre as an example.
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Heavy Metal:</strong>
&quot;Old-school&quot; Metal. This pretty much laid the ground for the many many sub-genres that now exist. Heavy Metal's roots were from Blues/Rock, but was defined by the &quot;heavy&quot; sound of distorted guitars. Singing is still pretty clean but more &quot;powerful&quot; than traditional rock.
Think bands like Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Iron Maiden, Led Zeppelin back in the 1960s-70s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Thrash Metal:</strong>
A generation of kids grew up listening to Heavy Metal and finally started to form their own bands in the 80s - this was the decade of Thrash. Heavy Metal, but heavier. Faster drums and more complicated and distorted guitars. Singing is more aggressive - shouts and screams are used. The defining bands of this genre are known as &quot;The Big Four&quot; of thrash metal: Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer and Anthrax. Lyrics are usually politically themed (influenced from Punk).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Black Metal:</strong>
Really fast tempo songs - guitars are distorted and notes are tremolo picked (one note played multiple times really fast) to create a drone-like sound. Vocals are harsh and mostly screamed and are not always clear. Songs are usually longer than the average song length (5-10+ minutes). This is (probably) the genre that gave rise to the idea that metal is &quot;devil-worship&quot; or &quot;satanic&quot; because of the lyrics and the image portrayed by many of the performers. Famous bands are: Bathory, Emperor, Mayhem and Dimmu Borgir</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Death Metal:</strong>
This genre is a bit more difficult to classify because of the multiple sub-genres it has spawned, however usually the sound is even heavier than the other genres mentioned above because the guitars are tuned to a lower pitch. Drums use blast-beats which is essentially playing two or more parts of the kit really fast (16th notes) in order to achieve an &quot;explosive&quot; sound. Vocals are also harsh and incorporate low pitched growling along with other extreme vocal techniques. Guitar solos are usually blazing fast and extremely complicated.
Famous bands are: Death, Morbid Angel, Cannibal Corpse and Entombed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heavy metal: Chug-a-wug. Slow, deep heavy stuff like Black Sabbath.</p>
<p>Thrash Metal: Chuggada-Wuggada. Faster, more rhythmic, usually with a bleeding fast meedlie-deedlie solo before diving back into a chugga-da-wuggada riff.</p>
<p>Black Metal: Meedlie-Deedlie. Squiddly fast high notes played super fast, with heavy chuggadas underneath.</p>
<p>Death Metal: Chuggada wuggada with meedlie deedlies in equal measure, and Cookie Monster on vocals.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
