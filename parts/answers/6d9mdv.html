		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is a fantastic observation. In classical general relativity, black holes have &quot;no hair&quot;: there is only one possible microstate and so their entropy is zero. Therefore, throwing any object inside a black hole is a violation of the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
<p>This is actually evidence for the fact that black holes actually do have an entropy S &gt; 0, in fact a very large one, and a corresponding number of microstates exp(S/k_B), but this is invisible at the classical level. These microstates are only apparent in the quantum gravitational description of the black hole.</p>
<p>The proof of this entropy and its exact value only comes about after you discover that black holes emit thermal radiation (Hawking radiation) at temperature T = 1/8πM (in Planck units) which means, by basic thermodynamics, that a black hole is itself in thermal equilibrium at that temperature. If so, then since its total mass is also its internal energy*, the first law of thermodynamics reads:</p>
<p>dM = T dS</p>
<p>If you plug in the expression for T and integrate, and ofc set S=0 at M=0, you will get the entropy (still in Planck units)</p>
<p>S = 4 π M^(2)</p>
<p>This is also equal 1/4 the event horizon area measured in Planck areas. Which is obviously gigantic for any reasonably sized black hole. In fact, this is the largest possible entropy that can fit in that volume - which is the Bekenstein bound. Black holes are not states of zero entropy; they are states of maximum entropy!</p>
<p>Then throwing stuff inside a BH is not only possible, it is also necessarily irreversible. It is impossible, in fact maximally so, to recover information lost in a BH, and in this sense (when interpreted in a more precise way) they are the most efficient scramblers of information.</p>
<p>So... where are those microstates? Depends on your preferential theory of quantum gravity. Any respectable candidate QG theory <em>must</em> reconstruct Hawking's temperature formula and the expression for the entropy, because these prediction are made in the semiclassical regime which is independent on whatever the true theory of QG is, for a certain technical reason I won't go into here. A very promising candidate is string theory. A BH in string theory admits a description as single, very excited string. The string is long and tangled into a Planck-length-ish-thick membrane above the horizon, and its possible configurations give the large entropy (which is proportional of course to the area of the membrane) and it is itself at a Planck-temperature-ish... temperature, and its blackbody radiation, redshifted from climbing out the potential well, is cooled down to the Hawking temperature and becomes Hawking radiation.  </p>
<p>* it's more sensible actually to map M to the enthalpy, but it doesn't matter now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
