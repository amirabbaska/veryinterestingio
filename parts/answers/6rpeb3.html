<p>The short answer is... practice. In calm winds, lining up with the runway's dashed centerline is actually one of the least challenging parts of a landing. It's basically not too much harder that tracking your car down the middle of the lane. Student pilots (and experienced pilots) tend to have much more trouble maintaining a safe and stable speed and &quot;glidepath&quot; down to the runway. </p>
<p>Where things get tricky is when you have a crosswind. Pilots will line up with the runway in a &quot;crab angle.&quot; In this case, the nose of the plane is pointed slightly into the wind and the aircraft track slightly sideways towards the runway. It's like a boat going across a river. In order to go directly across, you have to point the bow slightly into the current so you don't drift downstream. You don't want to land sideways, so just before touchdown the pilot will point the nose straight down the runway with the rudder and then bank the wings slightly into the wind. This is called a &quot;sideslip&quot; and it ensure the plane will be pointed straight down the runway while the bank angle of the wings prevents the plane from drifting downwind. The upwind wheel will often touch before the downwind wheel. Here's more info.... <a href="http://www.flyingmag.com/technique/proficiency/mastering-crosswind-landings#page-3" target="_blank">http://www.flyingmag.com/technique/proficiency/mastering-crosswind-landings#page-3</a></p>
<p>Most of the time pilots are landing using visual references out the cockpit window and flying by hand, even passenger jets at major airports. This is called a visual approach. It sounds kinda crude, but air traffic controllers at big airports prefer them because they can usually get more planes lined up for a runway at once, thereby increasing an airport's capacity. </p>
<p>But what if you can't see the runway? Most runways at big airports are equipped with an Instrument Landing System (ILS). Basically, the pilot follows a radio signal through the clouds/fog/rain/snow down to the runway. The goal is to break out of the clouds or get close enough to the runway that you can see it and land on it. A basic ILS approach will get you down to 200ft and 1/2mi from the runway before you have to go around and land somewhere else. Some airports are equipped with CATIII ILS approaches where you can land at almost zero visibility. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrument_landing_system</a></p>
<p>These days, GPS based approaches are becoming increasingly popular because you can create curved approach paths and the airport doesn't have to invest in a ground-based radio signal system.</p>
<p>As for autopilot... it's very rarely used all the way down to the ground. Normally the pilots will turn it off when they drop the landing gear and fly by hand. Sometimes they might use the autopilot to intercept an ILS but then turn it off once the runway is in sight. Fully automated landings are only done in very low visibility. They require so much extra button pushing to set up that it's usually easier to hand fly the plane when conditions permit. </p>
<p>*I should note that while I'm a flight instructor, I'm not an airline pilot and haven't flown any big jets. I don't want to give away my job but I work pretty closely with them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Repitition. Do you drive and park in a garage? If so, do you vear off and hit your side mirrors on the side of the garage often? I'm guessing not.<br />
As others have pointed out, there are also systems that can assist pilots to ensure they are lined up properly, but majority of it is repitition/skill.  A few of my coworkers have recently gotten their pilots license (small craft) and numerous times during their training all they do is take off, circle, and land. All of this becomes part of their skill set. If a pilot is unable to land (safely), then they will be unable to get their license. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airstrips are much bigger than you think. Any that land large commercial airliners are 150-200 ft across. The back wheels of a 737 are less than 60 ft apart. So there is quite a bit of wiggle room there. </p>
<p>Also skill. Most pilots have landed those planes hundreds if not thousands of times. You get pretty good after a while. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two whites, two reds. Centerline between legs. </p>
<p>There's a stationary lighting system called PAPI that will show two whites and two reds if you approach with a certain angle. You also align the aircraft just like you align your car. Voila. Make enough landings and it's just like parking your car. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
