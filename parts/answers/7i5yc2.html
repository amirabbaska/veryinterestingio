		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What do you see as the most promising technology (or technologies) for sequestering carbon at the same order of magnitude as the rate at which we are producing CO2?</p>
<p>Several methods of capturing the carbon from CO2 have proven themselves to work chemically, but the thing that bothers me, is what can we do with it that is on the same scale as the rate at which we are producing it?  Converting CO2 to chemical feedstocks just puts back in some of the chemical energy we took out to make electricity in the first place, and there is no chemical feedstock that we use that is even with 2 orders of magnitude of the level of CO2 we produce.  Injection underground or in the deep ocean seems temporary.  Locking it up by letting it mineralize, as in your Hellisheidi power plant story, sounds the best solution (and the only one that would last on a geologic timescale), but that can only work where there is a certain type of reactive geological mineral formation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
