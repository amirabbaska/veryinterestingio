		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No there is a limit for microscopes and telescopes, it is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffraction-limited_system" target="_blank">diffraction limit</a> and it relates the size of the observed object, the wavelength of light and the size of the lense (specifically the aperture). If you solve this for the size of a telescope for the size a human in the visible light you get a telescope size of around 100m. The largest telescopes we currently have are in the range of 10m.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, not in 1969 and not today. The resolution required to make an image of the size of a human (~1m) over the distance from the moon (384.000 km) is just not achievable, and we are not even talking about athmospheric refraction that makes this even harder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know why people like /u/bluscr33n aren't mentioning this, but the diffraction limit can be &quot;defeated&quot; with a process called interferometry. If you place two telescopes a kilometer apart and mathematically &quot;interfere&quot; what they're seeing (I believe it involves Fourier transforms), you'll end up with a single telescope with an effective aperture width of 1 km, thus giving you way sharper resolution.</p>
<p>Adaptive optics can also be used to cancel out atmospheric turbulence.</p>
<p>Theoretically, I'm quite sure interferometry could be used to see Armstrong and the lander. I don't believe it was possible in 1969, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Googlebait summarized answer from the thread: Technically it should be physically possible to construct a set of telescopes whose combined output would allow tracking of a human on the face of the moon, yes, BUT:</p>
<p>(a) not from inside Earth's atmosphere unless you are using REALLY good atmospheric interference tracking/countering systems;<br />
(b) not with 1969 telescope technology; and<br />
(c) not with anything currently available either, not even the Hubble.</p>
<p>Summary of the summary: Not in 1969, no.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
