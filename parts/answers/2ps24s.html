<p>Cats hate belly rubs.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With a dog, a popular position for petting is often the belly rub. To most dogs, nothing feels as enjoyable as when you endlessly scratch and rub that tender tummy. Try that with a cat, however, and you’ll most likely end up with a scratched hand. Why is it that a cat doesn’t enjoy a good belly rub?</p>
<p>A cat is an incredible predator but she’s small enough that she’s also prey. That’s a heck of a lot of pressure on her. As prey, the last thing a cat wants is for a larger predator to have access to her most vulnerable area where vital organs are located. The typical response for a cat who has her stomach touched, is to spring into defensive mode. She may grab your hands with her paws (if you’re unlucky, her claws will also be extended and ready to protect herself) and then maybe even bite. She isn’t being mean to you – it’s a natural protection reflex.</p>
<p>Why a cat would expose her belly depends on the immediate circumstances in which she finds herself. If she’s in a face-off with another cat, rolling over onto her side to expose her belly isn’t a sign of submission, but rather, the ultimate defensive reaction which communicates to the opponent that all weapons (teeth and all claws) will be engaged if a fight is to become physical.black cat Why You Shouldnt Pet Your Cats Belly
If a cat is stretched out on her back in a sunny spot in a room of your house and looking very peaceful and relaxed, it means she feels very comfortable and not threatened. She’s secure enough in her immediate environment to enjoy the warmth of the sun on her tender tummy. Just don’t ruin that moment by thinking it’s ok to pet her in such a vulnerable spot.</p>

<p>EDIT: Okay, guys. Two things: 1. Some cats <em>tolerate</em> belly rubs and don't object to them. Some cats do enjoy them. But most cats don't like them. I'm willing to bet OPs cat doesn't like them either.</p>
<p>Also, cool that everyone is telling me their cat likes them, fair enough. Some people are telling me I'm overgeneralising, which I disagree with. The words &quot;cats hate belly rubs&quot; wouldn't normally be taken to mean &quot;<em>all</em> cats ...&quot;, but &quot;<em>most</em> cats ... &quot;, which I stand by. (EDIT3: I'm not going to debate the semantics of this here. It's not the place. When &quot;most&quot;/&quot;all&quot;/&quot;some&quot;/etc... isn't specified it's normal for people to infer the most likely one from the context. This is a spoken language between people, not a programming language where that stuff matters. If you're still unhappy with this, <a href="http://phoenixtechnicalgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/humpty.png" target="_blank">take it up with Lewis Carroll</a>.)</p>
<p>EDIT4: (Yeah, these edits are out of order...) Some of you are still unhappy with the missing &quot;most&quot;. Well, I have a research paper here that says it is normal useage: <a href="http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-6197-4_9" target="_blank">http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4020-6197-4_9</a> They write that an indefinite pronoun is used where it isn't clear which is appropriate from the context, or where the pronoun is to be emphasised. Since the pronoun can clearly be inferred from the context here, it is clearly correct to leave it out.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Some more sources:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.northernilcatclinic.com/why-does-my-cat-like-belly-rubs/" target="_blank">A vets clinic who writes:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your cat loves it when you rub her belly, take it as a compliment. It means that your cat wants attention and trusts you enough to touch her belly. Remember your cat’s belly is the most vulnerable spot on her body. If she allows you to pet her in this area, then she trusts you completely.</p>
<p>Your cat can be on full attack mode when she is belly up because now she can use all four sets of claws and her teeth to defend herself or attack her prey. When your cat rolls over on her back and playfully sways from side to side it could be a way of fine tuning her hunting and defensive skills. This is why she will sometimes grab your hand and nibble on you while you are rubbing away.</p>
<p>It’s also possible that your frisky feline loves it when you rub her belly because you’re simply scratching that itch. Your cat may have skin issues like bug bites, allergies or ringworm which can cause irritation and hair loss.  While rubbing your cat’s belly, be on the lookout for red patches or bald spots and feel around for protruding bug bites.  If something is awry, contact your veterinarian&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.cats.org.uk/uploads/documents/cat-care-leaflets-2013/EG09_Understanding_your_cat's_behaviour.pdf" target="_blank">A pamphlet from Cats.org.uk, a cat protection charity based in the UK:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>While there are always exceptions, as a general rule,
many cats don’t like to be touched in these places:</p>
<ul>
<li>Belly – which for some cats can include their sides and chest</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>and later...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Behaviour:</strong></p>
<p>Often starts with a tail up greeting, rubs its head and side of his body around your legs and sometimes may roll over onto his side to show his belly.</p>
<p><strong>Mood</strong></p>
<p>Relaxed, friendly cat showing greeting behaviour, often seen after a period of separation.</p>
<p><strong>How to interact with your cat:</strong></p>
<p>Cats that roll on to their side or back and expose their belly are communicating that they feel relaxed enough
in the person’s presence to expose such a vulnerable area. The best response is to verbally acknowledge the cat’s greeting, rather than stroke or tickle his tummy.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In domestic situations, a cat who exposes her belly is actually testing your trust, Dr. Houlihan says. “The abdomen is a vulnerable area for cats because that’s where all of their vital organs are located,” she says. “So exposing it is a form of communication — they want to see what you might do.”</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cats are in a difficult position - they're small enough to be prey but they think of themselves as predators.  So their natural state is somewhere between dangerous and nervous.</p>
<p>For this reason cats are all about trust. If you're friends with a cat and you long blink your eyes, they will long blink back at you. What they're communicating here is that they trust you enough to close their eyes in your presence. </p>
<p>Even more intense then long blinking is exposing the vulnerable belly. When your Siamese stretches out and shows you his stomach you are supposed to be impressed by his courageous nonchalance.  You're supposed to be honored and humbled by his trust. If you are so ill bred that you can't keep your grubby monkey paws off at his magnificent belly, you deserve to be deveined like a cocktail shrimp.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some cats love belly rubs. But not like dogs do, you can't just rub it vigorously, usually. They're okay with slow, one-direction pets. And when they attack, they're probably playing with you. That, or your affection has been perceived as a threat, or they're just tired of being petted. You have to read body language with cats. Every cat and breed is different. </p>
<p>My Russian blue loves pets anywhere, anytime. Another cat welcomes belly rubs at the right time, and for short periods. And my calico - it's anyone's fucking guess. I can read her like a book, but I'd never invite a friend to pet her tummy lol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've had many cats over the years, and I've helped run a feral colony for the past 4.  Constantly meeting with vets and hearing a whole host of different theories, let me tell you mine:</p>
<p>I think they're ticklish.  Some people who are ticklish laugh when you tickle them, even if it hurts and they beg you to stop.  A cat obviously doesn't laugh...but he doesn't really run away when you do it because he doesn't see you as a threat.  Instead, he finds you annoying and you obviously want to play, so he plays with you like he does anything else: with his claws and teeth.  I don't think most cats really like belly rubs, but they do know you can't resist touching them there.  It's a trap but a way to interact with you.</p>
<p>My theory might be silly, but it's been my experience.  I know that this sub doesn't encourage people to answer if they can't prove they know about the topic, but if it helps, I've had a vet tell me it could be a valid response.  So there's that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
