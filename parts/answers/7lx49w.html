		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A straight flat belt fits around a cylinder perfectly.  Chances are you're not cylinder, because you have a bum, and maybe some belly.  Your girth is bigger at the bottom of your belt than at the top of the belt. ( A contoured waistband is curved instead of straight, but most ready to made clothes have straight waistbands because it takes less fabric.)</p>
<p>When you sit down  your body becomes longer in the back and shorter in the front. The pants will rise in the front and make accordion folds, while the back will pull down lower and the straight waistband wants to stick out from your body.  In this position you aren't anything like a cylinder.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the belt gets conditioned into a curve from being held in that position for long amounts of time, or multiple periods of use (E.G. from wearing it). you can achieve a similar result when conditioning a new baseball glove (rubbing conditioner the leather, putting ball in mit, then wrap a few rubber-bands around it.) baseball players do this whenever getting a new glove because it helps them catch the ball easier. Hope that helps :)</p>
<p>Edit: changed the phrasing, and minor grammatical corrections.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just inherited a belt from my grandpa, who died earlier this year. I literally wear it all the time now, to the point where it's getting to be sort of noticeable. If anyone could recommend something to keep it from getting to wrinkly in the &quot;bend&quot;, that'd be great as I wear it with my finery as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
