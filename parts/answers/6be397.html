		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll expand on the existing answer a bit because there is an important distinction that wasn't fully explained. In frequentist statistics, it is regularly assumed that you are determining the probability of the null hypothesis being true or false given some observed data. This is wrong. What frequentist statistics can actually tell you is the probability of your data (or data more extreme) emerging given the null hypothesis is true (or by chance, if you want).</p>
<p>It's a subtle but very important distinction for the types of inferences you can reasonably make. Frequentist statistics cannot ever actually say anything about the truth or falsehood of the null hypothesis, only about the data observed.</p>
<p>Bayesian statistics, on the other hand, allows you to determine the probability of the null hypothesis given the data observed-- something they call the posterior probability (i.e., the probability of a hypothesis being true after data has been observed).</p>
<p>The posterior probability, p(hypothesis given data), is obtained from the prior probability of some hypothesis before the experiment or observation, p(hypothesis), and the likelihood of some data occurring given the hypothesis under question, p(data given hypothesis).</p>
<p>Now the prior probability can rarely ever be known exactly, so instead Bayesian statisticians use models to determine a distribution of likely prior probabilities. And you might recognize what Bayesians call &quot;likelihood&quot; as exactly what frequentist statistics provides.</p>
<p>So, the ultimate difference between the two schools is that the Bayesian tradition goes beyond the likelihood of the data given a hypothesis (which the frequentist tradition is limited to) and instead weights it by prior knowledge of the likelihood of that hypothesis.</p>
<p>Both traditions have strengths and weaknesses, and the relative value of either depends on the type of question you are trying to answer and the types of uncertainties and biases you're willing to accept in your inferential process.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also <a href="https://xkcd.com/1132" target="_blank">obligatory xkcd</a>. Bayesians condition their expectations on the occurrence of the event--while frequentists look at the raw frequency of the event. Is the event rare enough to say we think the null is false (freq) vs what's the likelihood given our expectations/observations (bayesian). </p>
<p>Bayes rule: p(b|a): p(a|b)p(a)/p(b) where p is probability and a and b are events. So the likelihood of b given a is the likelihood of a given b time a over b. </p>
<p>Also, so excited to have something to contribute here!</p>
<p>Edit: details and bayes' rule plus typing is hard</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A frequentist probability is a relative frequency. That means that if you have a probability p of some event occurring, and you observe infinitely many trails, the fraction of the time that your event will occur will be p. It's an objective value.</p>
<p>Bayesian probabilities are subjective &quot;degrees of belief&quot;. That means that they depend on your knowledge of the situation. And when you take some more data, you can use it to update your degree of belief to include the new information.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose I shuffle the a deck of cards look at it and set it on the table without letting you look at it.  What's the probability that the deck is in order?</p>
<p>One reasonable answer is to say that the deck is either in order, or it's not in order, so the probability is either 1 or 0.</p>
<p>Another reasonable answer is to say that (assuming a proper shuffle) the deck has a 1 in 52! chance of being in order, so that's the probability.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, that corresponds to the difference between Frequentist and Bayesian viewpoints.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
