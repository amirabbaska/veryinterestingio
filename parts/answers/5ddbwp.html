		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My senior capstone is on building a robot that mimics the gaits of millipedes, and while they do mostly have one gait they do have gait variations for dealing with certain terrains. Typically they have a phase shifted wave gait, however On very rough terrain and slippery terrain the legs on either side are in phase. I've been spending my last six months looking at the stability margins of both to see if this gait shift is mechanically inspired or if it is an emergent biological behavior. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, gait can be assessed in centipedes and their relatives described as orthokenesis - change in speed - and klinokenssis - change in turns.</p>
<p>No, their gait is limited by their biology and remains species specific. Centipedes are not going to inch like inchworms tomorrow. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I recall correctly, both centipedes and millipedes have only one gait.  They can change the speed of it, but it is always the same gait. </p>
<p>Their legs work in pairs and it's a sequential ripple movement.  It's been a long time since I read about their movement, but I seem to recall that they don't actually have a lot of control over the motion.  It's a semi-automated movement.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
