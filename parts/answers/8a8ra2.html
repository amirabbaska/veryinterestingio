		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aquatic turtles DO swallow water when they eat, and actually can't swallow <em>without</em> water as they do not produce saliva. But they have a specially evolved esophagus that acts as a sort of pre-stomach. They fill the esophagus with food and water, and then constrict it to expel all the water while keeping the food inside. The food and a small amount of water then enter the stomach.</p>
<p>Edit: Three years on reddit and I finally got gilded while I was asleep, and for something turtle related :D. Obligatory &quot;Thank you kind stranger&quot;, and &quot;this blew up&quot;. Seriously though, thank you. Volunteer to be the one who protec.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans could actually eat underwater just fine. We just don't normally do it because we are not aquatic animals and that is not our thing.</p>
<p>When an animal closes its mouth underwater, it can push out the excess water simply by pressing its mouth together tighter and letting it rush out through the cracks.  That said, swallowing water along with your food is not really that bad a thing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same way we humans eat food on land without swallowing too much air.</p>
<p>It can be pushed out of the mouth, nostrils and if it still manages to get swallowed, burped out of the stomach.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know from a visit to the turtle hospital in the Florida Keys that turtles have a mechanism that squirts water out of their nose when they take a bite of food.</p>
<p>Turtles don't have lips, so they can't seal their mouths when they chew.</p>
<p>So, the nose squirting is probably how they control the water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
