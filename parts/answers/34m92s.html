		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Most replies are from a US homeowner perspective. As someone who grew up in India, this is what I thought:<br><br>In countries like India, very few cities ever get 24x7 electricity. You can be a millionaire, but still you can not have 24x7 electricity unless you install some sort of an expensive backup system. Almost every middle class and richer family owns a battery or fossil fuel based backup unit for their house and from the smallest business to the largest industry, uninterrupted power supply is always a huge issue.<br><br>The existing battery based solutions have many of the issues that Elon Musk pointed out in his announcement. They use old-school batteries (no thermal management, nasty leaky chemicals and toxic fumes). They also need special storage areas and most don't &quot;just work&quot;. At $3500 for a 10kWh storage, it is a little more expensive than some existing good quality devices, but it really isn't that much more expensive! Reliability and easy of use are very important and if Tesla can make a reliable and high-quality product which is also scalable enough that even businesses can own, then it will be a huge deal in many parts of the world.<br><br>Also if you tie it to other sources like solar, then many remote locations that were never connected can also have some power! (Think of hospitals, internet access stations etc.). <br><br>If Tesla can deliver all that they have promised, it can make a huge economic (and environmental) impact across the world.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>For people with solar panels, it lets them store the excess energy and use it themselves rather than selling it back to the grid for pennies.<br><br>For everyone with variable usage costs, it lets you take power from the grid when it is cheapest (nightime) and then store it to use at any time you want basically meaning you always pay the minimum rate for your power.<br><br>For everyone long term, if these gets widely adopted, power companies can completely change the way they create power, and there will never be variable rates. And &quot;theoretically/optimistically&quot; power would get cheaper because power plants would be running constantly rather than stopping and starting.<br><br>Telsas power banks are better than what you can get today simply because they are for the most part a lot cheaper than current methods, and have programming built in so anybody can use them efficiently.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Before, the best you could hope for solar power to achieve (if you had solar panels on your house) would be to reduce your drain on the grid.  You would use less electricity but you would still need to be hooked up to a grid because you need electricity at night when the solar panels are not working.  People who have solar panels could have always used batteries of course, but there's a heap of problems attached to that, which the Powerwall basically solved and it's no small technical achievement.  <br><br>I used to live in a farming community that used wind power in remote locations because they had no choice.  They were way too far away to hook up to the electrical grid.  So it was wind power or use a diesel generator which sucks up money.  There was this one farmer I knew who lived next to a wrecker and he used to take dozens of car batteries and he hooked them up together to a windmill.  It was unbelievably nasty.  If you neglect something like that in the open there is corrosion, and leaking noxious chemicals that are dangerous.  You have to be super careful where you place batteries like that.  He stored the batteries on top of gravel because nothing will ever grow there ever again.  It smells bad.  It's seriously something you don't want in your house.  <br><br>And there's another problem.  Let's say you decide to hook solar panels and use batteries to power your house at night.  There are no batteries you can buy that have a built in industry standard that allows you to conveniently hook them up to power your house.  You're going to have to hire an electrician, possibly an electrical engineer, to build something for you.  That would be pretty damn expensive.  Most houses I ever saw that have it were specially built for that purpose.  They had a storage place specifically for those batteries that is dry, ventilates out of the house, and is safely built to electrical code to supply power.  Not easy.<br><br>Now it's easy.  The Powerwall is a battery that has basically created an industry standard that has never existed before.  A battery that is not adopted or modified, but is purpose built to work to power your house.  Yes, it will still have to be installed by an electrician, but they won't have to build anything, they just have to install it.   <br><br>What this does is instead of just reducing your drain on the grid, you can go off it altogether.  Depending on what your electrical needs are.  Remember the name of the house battery?  10KWH?  That's ten kilowatt hours.  The significance of that is the average daily use of electricity in an American home is 11 kilowatt hours.  That's the equivalent of using 1 kilowatt of electricity for 11 straight hours.  So 10 is pretty damn close and you can expect to get your house to under ten by simply switching to energy efficient appliances.  (Don't worry about your computer, TV, gaming consoles, their electricity use is bugger all.)  It's your washing machine, dryer, and refrigerator is your biggest drain.  And if you are using old-fashioned light bulbs, get rid of all of them and switch to energy efficient, that's a big difference right there.  <br><br>That means for an entire day the Powerwall battery can power your house on a single charge.  Which means it should be good enough to last at night when your solar panels are not working.  So during the day your solar panels power your house and charge up the Powerwall, and at night you get power from the Powerwall .  That's the point of the whole thing.  <br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>it's a big deal because of mass production of lithium ion packs directed at consumer.   <br><br>residential battery packs is not a new thing.  (although mainly backyard tinkerers)<br>commercial battery power installation is not a new thing.   (although using lead acids for cost)<br>lithium ion battery packs is not new thing. (that's what powers your cell phone and laptop)<br><br><br>combining all 3 and scaling for mass production is a new thing.<br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">
