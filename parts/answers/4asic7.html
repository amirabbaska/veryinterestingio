<p>I want to thank the entire community for allowing me to share my work!</p>

<p>Very gracious of you, but rather I'd like to thank you for working towards a cure for Alzheimer's while I am sitting on my couch eating trail mix.</p>
<p>In your text here, you give the example of the memory of a past birthday party. In your research, the memory for the mice is a Pavlovian electric shock coincided with a colored light. The idea being that a conditioned mouse would freeze when the colored light was turned on, since it associated that light with the electric shock. Right?</p>
<p>If I managed to get that all correct, my question is: what is the difference between a memory of being shocked, versus a memory of a past birthday party? Are they both memories, but just different sizes? Are memories different based upon the conditions they are formed under? (i.e., danger, happiness, sadness).</p>
<p>Thank you for your contributions and dedication to this field. You have my utmost admiration and respect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>As a tangent from AD but seemingly relevant to your field, what are the latest ideas/breakthroughs on memory vs drunkenness? More specifically, in the last few years there have been hypotheses put forward that instead of the conventional wisdom idea that when we're intoxicated we simply forget what we did during that period, what actually happens is our brain &quot;stops recording&quot;? So basically &quot;blank spots&quot; in our memory aren't because we can't access it, but because as far as our brain is concerned it never actually happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
