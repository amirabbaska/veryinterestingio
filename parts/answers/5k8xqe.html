		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned by another poster, they're not subgroups of Catholicism in the sense of denominations if that is what you were thinking. Rather, there are different types of religious &quot;orders&quot;. As the previous poster also mentioned, each order has a different way of serving and worshipping God. It's not to say that they believe any particular way is &quot;more correct&quot; than another way, but that it is simply the way they feel is best for <em>themselves</em> to glorify God. Some find that through prayer, others through education, others through prayer and reflection. Now, the origin of each of these orders comes from various groups of monastic priests (monks/brothers), and the rituals they would follow under their leader (an abbot). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whoever founded the order would have several monastic priests under him, and would often form several monasteries in his lifetime. It's not always founded under one specific leader, but to keep the explanation simple we'll treat it that way. Especially when the founder of an order passed away, others would often form new monasteries teaching in the same principles. This is why they are often named after a specific individual. There exist two main &quot;divisions&quot; when it comes to these orders: active and contemplative. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Active would be those such as the Franciscans (St. Francis of Assisi), the Jesuits (St. Francis Xavier, after whom Pope Francis took his Papal name), and the Dominicans (St. Dominic). These &quot;active&quot; orders are the ones often going out and preaching, serving the poor, etc. Unless you visit a monastery, these are the ones you would be more likely to run into somewhere. The &quot;contemplative&quot; are more of the typical image of what a monk/brother is, living in the monastery with other monks, spending most of the day in prayer, reading Scripture, etc. As their name would imply, these are the ones spending most of their time in solitude, dedicating their lives to God in this manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would like an overview of the most-popular orders, <a href="http://www.religious-vocation.com/differences_religious_orders.html#.WGAVineZMy4" target="_blank">this webpage</a> does a good job of explaining what each one specifically dedicates themselves too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR - All these different groups were founded in the Middle Ages to be a place to throw your 'extra' kid, to do different kinds of work for the Church.</p>
<p>In the middle ages in Europe, life was hard. If you and your wife were commoners, it was very likely that more than half of any kids you brought into the world would die before giving you grandchildren. But what happens when you're 'lucky' and have five sons survive to adulthood, and the family farm can only support one or two of them? One path was apprenticeship, essentially selling the kid into indentured servitude in exchange for them having a paying trade at the end. </p>
<p>Okay, that gets rid of one or two of them. But now you have Fred over here who has no talent in farming or a trade. You've spent a bunch of money to get him to breeding age and you're not going to get anything back from this. If you were a noble or something, you could send your kid into religious 'officer's school' to be a priest or bishop or something, but that option isn't open for poor Fred, either. </p>
<p>Enter: monasticism. Basically, you can sell your kid to the Catholic Church, not for money, but for Heaven Credits (tm). We send useless Fred off to go be a monk at a monastery somewhere where he can earn money for the Church by toiling in some way or another (or providing some sort of administrative role) and spend the rest of the time praying for you and your wife's immortal soul. He doesn't get the prestige of being a priest who gets up in front of people and runs church, but there is at least a little status bump for having a kid be a monk, and you don't have to look at all those pox scars on his face all the time to remind you of all the food you could have saved if you had drowned him in the bathtub. </p>
<p>But not all monasteries could sit off in the mountains and make beer for the Church to sell, or the bottom would just fall out of the market. So they diversified into doing shit that Church leaders really didn't want to do themselves.</p>
<p>Some became those guys you can pay to sit in line for you on Black Friday,  like the Carmelites squatting in what's now Israel so all those other filthy groups who wanted Israel couldn't live there. But it's kind of sandy and boring there, so nobody else wanted that job.</p>
<p>Some became actual soldiers for god, like the Dominicans, who were brought together because the Cathars were Catholic'ing wrong and needed to have their heads rearranged by sharp bits of metal.</p>
<p>Some went on biohazard duty, like the Franciscans tending to lepers. I mean sure, Jesus mentioned being nice to lepers, but those fuckers had communicable diseases!</p>
<p>Some went out to be salespeople of Catholicism to the heathens like the Jesuits, because who really wants to go to foreign lands where they don't even have half-decent liquor and convince all these idiots to give your church their allegiance?</p>
<p>That's not to say that's what all these groups do today. Today, the vast majority of religious orders do some great work for mankind. But you'd be surprised how many of them started with some priestly noble fuck not wanting to learn Native American languages or leave behind his comfy life in his family castle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't the most important thing, but it's good to know that the monastic orders operate independent of the local diocese. They are accountable to the leaders of their order, the College of Cardinals and the Pope, but they aren't under the authority of the local bishop.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The different groups you're thinking of are different religious institutes. A religious institute is basically a society where members take public vows and live as brothers and sisters in common. There are a lot of different institutes and they all function a bit differently. </p>
<p>In general, though, each institute focuses on a particular area or areas of church life. Some are contemplative, some serve in parishes, some have schools, some are separated from the world, some are active in the world, etc. In addition, each institute usually follows a specific set of rules about communal life. The Benedictines, for example, are monks who follow the rule of St. Benedict. The Franciscans are mendicants (meaning they live off alms, travel, serve the poor, etc.), who follow the teachings and practices of St. Francis. The Jesuits are clerics regular (a kind of broad category for priests) who work in all sorts of fields including parish life, education, scientific research, cultural pursuits, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
