		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because liquid glue doesn't stick to anything. It isn't until the water (in white glue) evaporates that it actually adheres to anything. In a bottle, The water cannot evaporate, so the glue can't stick to the bottle. If you leave the lid off, it can evaporate and the glue will get stuck inside the bottle.</p>
<p>Edit: Super Glue (cyanoacrylate) hardens when it comes into contact with water. The CA molecules start to line up and stiffen. When it is solid, it has fully lined up and has cured. With the cap on the bottle, water in the air cannot get to the glue and it can't cure. If you leave the cap off, it will get into contact with water vapor and garden inside the bottle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some glues need to &quot;dry&quot;, some need to &quot;cure&quot; (which is typically by letting an alcohol or other solvent evaporate), and epoxies need to be mixed with an activating agent (that is they are two parts that set up only when mixed, but usually don't need to give up anything like water or alcohol).</p>
<p>If you've ever tried to get the top off of a glue bottle that has been glued shut by accident then you know that glue does, indeed, stick to the bottle.</p>
<p>The bottles <em>are</em> chosen for being hard to glue shut using the glue that it contains. For instance &quot;white&quot; and &quot;wood&quot; glues require pores to work well, so smooth plastic will tend to shed the dried glue easily because the glue cannot &quot;grab it&quot; well.</p>
<p>So one of the main difference between glues that some are &quot;filling glues&quot; and some are &quot;contact cements&quot;.</p>
<p>A white glue is a filling glue. It works by filling the tiny gaps and pores in each of the surfaces and then &quot;sticking to itself&quot;. White glue basically forms a puzzle piece that is locked into the irregularities the two or more parts being glued. This is why you can let it dry on your hand and peel it off to find a mold of your hand print. If you let that harden fully it becomes quite strong. Basically the body of the glue is &quot;structural&quot;.</p>
<p>Various &quot;super glues&quot; are exactly the opposite. They can't stick to themselves well. If you let a drop of it try out the result is brittle and easily broken or shattered. So you want to use as little as possible when you use superglue. If you let a layer build up the joint will not hold. But it works well on &quot;smooth and hard surfaces&quot;. So it's good for things like sticking glass to metal. It still relies somewhat on microscopic irregularities, but the more perfect the match between the surfaces the better the glue works because it's stronger for being in close contact with both sides of the joint.</p>
<p>So glue is fascinating stuff, and picking the right glue is a skill, but lots of glues will work &quot;well enough&quot; where &quot;the right glue&quot; could have been superb.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glue sets either through chemical reactions with the air, exposure to light like UV, evaporation of a solvent like acetone or water, or the use of a 2 part catalyst and epoxy which when mixed cause it to set. </p>
<p>Inside the bottle there is only a limited amount of air that can seep in and it runs out and the reaction stops. Over time though it will eventually harden in the container. </p>
<p>Normal white glue sets on exposure to air, and the mechanical adhesion of the surface it's touching. This is why it works better on materials like wood, paper, or cloth which have a grain for the glue to penetrate. </p>
<p>Other glues like CA (super glue) react to pressure and air exposure to create heat and the heat helps set it. There are also catalysts you can spray on it to set it faster. </p>
<p>Finally epoxies usually have a glue, and a catalyst which is mixed separately. The catalyst reacts with the glue creating heat and changing the structure of the glue. The heat and reactions help cure it. </p>
<p>The epoxy used in dental work on the other hand is an example of a glue which sets with the energy of UV light. It stays liquid until it's exposed to ultra violet light, which provides the energy necessary to catalyze the glue into a solid. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Liquid glue cures by having the excess moisture evaporate, leaving behind a hardened solid.</p>
<p>If the bottle is properly sealed, the moisture can't evaporate because there isn't anywhere for it to go - it would make any air in the bottle saturated, but once that air is saturated, no further water can evaporate</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
