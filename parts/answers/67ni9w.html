		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever you talk about potential of any sort (gravitational or electrostatic are the most popular), you have to set a 0 point. Potential is the work done in moving something from point A to point B. </p>
<p>For terrestrial usage, that 0 point is taken as the surface of the Earth. You have to do work to raise mass above the surface, thus at a distance r (&gt; Re), potential is greater than 0. </p>
<p>But we also often use 'infinity' as a 0 point in electrostatic problems, or in dealing with Earth orbits. In that, we have negative gravitational potential since the Earth does work on the mass when bringing it closer to itself from 'infinity'. </p>
<p>The negative mass-energy required in an Alcubierre drive is to regular mass what negative charge is to positive charge in a way. Rather than increasing the density of energy around it above the vacuum energy density, this 'negative' mass-energy would instead decrease it. You can imagine it as normal mass-energy pulling in things and the negative mass pushing that same mass-energy away (opposites repel)</p>
<p>I'd be happy to explain further if my explanation wasn't up to snuff (still working on it!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The negative Newtonian gravitational potential energy between two objects is only a convenient convention, because in classical physics (and quantum mechanics) all that matters for potential energy is the difference in its value between locations. Unless there are black holes involved, you can always use gauge freedom to set the potential energy to a positive number at every point (just add a huge number to the potential energy everywhere in the universe).</p>
<p>In contrast, the negative mass required for an Alciuberre drive is a quantity that is truly physically negative as measured by a local observer - if the observer pushed it it would move in the opposite direction of the push (F=ma, m&lt;0). We currently don't think that such a material can exist, but we can't rule it out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind that the even assuming this kind of negative energy, the total mass-energy of any gravitating object will still be positive. Roughly speaking, for a gravitating shell of mass m and radius r, the total energy will be mc^2 - 1/2 G m^2 / r. This will be negative when r &lt; Gm/(2c^2 ), but that's 1/4 of the Schwarzschild radius, meaning that long before you could ever make something with &quot;negative mass&quot;, Newtonian gravity (and this formula) breaks down and the object would turn into a black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
