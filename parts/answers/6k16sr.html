		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is that asparagus contains a natural chemical aptly named asparagusic acid. This acid is broken down by the body into sulfur-containing compounds. Those sulfur compounds smell. This is the same reason rotten eggs smell. And once made, the breakdown products end up in your urine. Because they are highly volatile, they make it into the air as you pee, and float on up your nose!</p>
<p>I don't know exactly why it shows up so quickly, but my best guess is just that the smelly compounds are made from asparagusic acid very quickly, as soon as you begin digesting the asparagus. </p>

<p>Not an asparagus expert, nor a pee expert. Just googled your question and found a good article. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are something like 500 genes that contribute to the ability to smell that &quot;asparagus pee&quot; smell. Only roughly 50% of people have the necessary genes for it, meaning only about half of all people can smell it. There is some debate to this; some scientists think certain people don't produce the smell itself, however I can say from personal experience that I always smell it, while my wife never smells it, regardless of who is the pee-er.</p>
<p>The cause of the distinct smell is sulfur, as the byproduct of the digestion of asparagus is a bunch of sulfur-based chemicals. The chemicals are volatile, which means they have a low vapor point where they can get into the air and therefore be detected by human noses. While they are locked in the asparagus, they are not volatile and so we don't smell them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When your digestive system breaks down mercaptan (a compound in asparagus), by-products are released that cause the strange smell. The process is so quick that your urine can develop the distinctive smell within 15 to 30 minutes of eating asparagus. Not everyone suffers this effect; your genetic makeup may determine whether your urine has the odor -- or whether you can actually smell it. </p>
<p>Some people can't even smell the odor in asparagus urine! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>What causes it?</strong></p>
<p><em>Enzymes</em></p>
<p>There's an inheritable gene that some people have that includes a specific enzyme that can break down the acid in asparagus (C4H6O2S2). This acid, when broken down, smells.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong in &quot;asparagus pee&quot;, as it's not toxic. It simply is unpleasant.</p>
<p>When you have the right gene passed on to you, you can either produce or smell this &quot;Asparagusic acid&quot;. If not: You simply lack a gene modification. Nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>Why does it happen so fast</strong>?</p>
<p>Again, Enzymes. They are pretty quick in breaking down the compounds found in asparagus and therefore it smells instantly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun Fact: There are two things at play here, the ability of the body to <em>produce</em> the pee smell (one gene) and then there is the ability to <em>smell</em> the pee smell, which is a different gene. So you could be producing the smell and not know it, you can also be able to smell it in other's pee, yet not produce it yourself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
