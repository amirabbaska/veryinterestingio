		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While /u/RobusEtCeleritas answer is super cool and interesting, what really happens to any amount of water floating about in space is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOYgdQp4euc" target="_blank">this</a></p>
<p>the answer is that any size blob of liquid water will partially boil off in to space, leaving behind a core of solid ice.  The only way to preserve liquid is if the blob of water is sufficiently large to gravitationally bind an atmosphere of water vapor (or perhaps other gasses) of high enough pressure to stop the boiling, which is also hot enough to prevent freezing by conventional means.  If the atmosphere is allowed to wane over time, then your water ball is doomed to become a dusty ice ball like the majority of the stuff in the solar system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It does greatly depend on the temperature. On a tangent, you don't need any great pressure outside of a solar system's &quot;ice line&quot;, which is the point where the temperature is low enough for volatiles like water to form solid crystals in space. This line is believed to be the demarcation between where terrestrial planets and gas giants form. Gas giants are believed to form outside of the ice line because all the volatiles become solid and aggregate and form much more massive cores, which in turn allows those cores to grab and hold on to lighter gases such as hydrogen which allows them to become gas giants.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isn't water uncompressable, because for equal moles of ice, water, and steam, water is the least volume?  My totally not professional expectation if that's true is that the pressure would boil the core, not freeze the ball.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
