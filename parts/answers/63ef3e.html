There is also the issue of deciding when to declare an animal extinct. Many birds are elusive and haven't been sighted in years. From a quick search here are some animals thought to be extinct but rediscovered:</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coelacanth#Discovery" target="_blank">Coelacanths</a> were thought to be extinct since the Cretaceous period. They're a really cool ancient lobe-finned fish species and are relatives to the ancestors of land animals (tetrapods).

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;What are the biological implications when a species that we thought was extinct, rebounds it's population? Is it just limited to things like focusing on changing what caused their extinction in the first place, like eradicating the rats in the 'tree lobster' article?&quot; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are many potential side-effects of drastically decreasing population sizes to the point of near extinction, and none of them are very encouraging.  The most common/pertinent are the implications from a <strong>population bottleneck</strong> (genetic drift).  Essentially, when population sizes are reduced drastically, the genetic diversity that was found in the species before-hand is eliminated, leaving only a small fraction of what there was before.  This can lead to a bevy of mishaps, some of the more notable being increased species vulnerability to disease, and random deleterious mutations spreading through the population more easily.</p>
<p>Currently, cheetahs are exhibiting severe side-effects from repeated population bottlenecks; their genetic diversity is so low that skin grafts from one animal to a separate one are not rejected by the recipient.  You can find lots of interesting information about cheetah genetic diversity.  Also, there was a thread not too long ago in which a similar question was asked about the last remaining Wooly Mammoth populations on earth.  The link to that thread (in which I gave a similar answer) is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/5xa3ly/dna_clues_to_why_woolly_mammoth_died_out_the_last/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p><em>EDIT:</em>
Because I don't think I fully got to the heart of what OP was asking.  As far as management issues are concerned (I have also worked and continue to work in the field of conservation genetics) typically a particular species has an increased amount of funding allocated to studying its ecology and reproductive habits (if it's one of the lucky ones to receive funding).  From that point on, the species is listed as vulnerable/threatened in some way and active management is taken to ensure the survival of that species.  For example, if it's found out that a particular invasive competitor is very detrimental to the persistence of a species, we go out of our way to ensure that is less of a problem (if possible).  Once the species reaches what is deemed an acceptable and 'stable' population size (or if the money runs out), it is usually still monitored, albeit less frequently, for many years after to assess the success of the strategies employed.  Also I work mostly with plants in this area so it may be different for you animal people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to address your edit because no-one else has so far:</p>
<p>Firstly, most of these cases aren't the result of a species 'rebounding' so much as being rediscovered, either by chance or by extensive searching. The population is probably still tiny. The question then becomes how to help it to recover and prevent it actually becoming extinct. In that case, yes eliminating the original threats is a vital first step. Unfortunately that step is not always easy - for example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivory-billed_woodpecker" target="_blank">Ivory-billed woodpecker</a> is probably extinct, primarily due to habitat destruction. It's prefered habitat is old forest (as it depends on dead trees for food and nesting). As such, it is very difficult to simply recreate habitat - mature woodland takes literally hundreds of years to develop.</p>
<p>In many cases, we would want to carry out further interventions to help speed up the population's recovery, as well as insuring against disasters. This often means captive breeding programmes, as well as translocations to create new populations in other places. One good example of this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mauritius_kestrel" target="_blank">Mauritius kestrel</a> which was brought back from the brink of only 4 individuals in 1974. However, many other species have benefitted from similar programmes (e.g. <a href="https://www.zsl.org/conservation-initiatives/conservation-breeding" target="_blank">these</a> run by ZSL).</p>
<p>In terms of biological implications, the most obvious one is the risk posed by loss of genetic diversity, especially if a once large population rapidly dropped to a very low one and remained low for several generations. An example of this is the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229640-700-killing-with-kindness-conservations-cautionary-tale/" target="_blank">Chatham ISland Black Robin</a> (paywall - <a href="http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/22704831/0" target="_blank">this</a> page has fewer details but is free) which has recovered from a single breeding pair. Unfortunately, there is strong evidence for genetic problems which resulted in eggs not successfully hatching due to poor parental behaviour. In this case, there's not much that can be done other than intensive care for the species and hope that evolution acts in time. In other cases, isolated populations with low genetic diversity can have their diversity boosted by introducing individuals from other, more diverse populations - an example of this is the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050818/full/news050815-7.html" target="_blank">Florida panther</a>.</p>
<p>There can also be more subtle effects. In particular, many species interact with the rest of their ecosystem. If a population becomes so small as to be functionally extinct (i.e. too few individuals to impact the ecosystem) then the ecosystem can change in such a way to become less suitable. A hypothetical example would be an insect that feeds on and pollinates a specific plant. If the insect population declines, then the plant no longer gets pollinated and also declines. Then, it becomes difficult for the insect to recover as it no longer has any food. There are many examples of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecosystem_engineer" target="_blank">ecosystem engineers</a> which this could apply to. A real example (albeit in a slightly different context) was the <a href="http://www.livescience.com/13957-giant-tortoises-ebony-trees-introduction-extinction.html" target="_blank">introduction of giant tortoises</a> to Ile aux Aigrettes to replace the native species of giant tortoise which had become extinct.</p>
<p>On a completely different vein, rediscovery of an extinct species can have important legal considerations. Many countries have legislation to protect rare and endangered species, but this doesn't apply to extinct species. If it is confirmed that a species is, in fact, not extinct, then suddenly all those laws become applicable. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/mar/23/night-parrot-sighting-confirmed-in-western-australia-for-first-time-in-100-years" target="_blank">This recent rediscovery</a> of a night parrot mentions that mining development is likely to be restricted as a result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
