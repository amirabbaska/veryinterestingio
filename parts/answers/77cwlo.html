		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just reread my answer and realise that, while it's very long, it is not even scratching the surface of what is a surprisingly difficult question to answer. Congratulations on asking such a good question, and apologies for the oversimplification that is to follow. </p>
<p>There are a few reasons, and the best way to explain it is to see how currency has evolved. </p>
<p>So there are at least 2 theories of how money evolves. The first is that, in any community beyond a certain size, barter becomes inconvenient. For example, maybe I'm an apple farmer and I want some pork. But I can't trade apples for pork because it's the middle of winter and I don't have any fresh apples around. So communities start using some form of currency like gold or beads or silver or whatever as money. Then I can sell my apples in autumn, and spend the money on pork in winter. </p>
<p>The result of that is, if you have 2 communities that evolve more or less independently of each other (like separated by mountains or whatever), you would end up with different currencies. For example, cigarettes used to be a popular currency in USA prisons, but outside prison the currency was US dollars. </p>
<p>The second theory is that, governments are responsible for deciding what currency their country uses. Imagine you're the king of a country called Alpha. You have a problem - you want to raise an army, but the army costs money, and you don't have any money. So what do you do? You can pass a new law. You can say, up till now, you have all been paying your taxes in kind - pig farmers give me pigs, apple farmers give me apples. But from now on, I want you all the pay your taxes in a new currency called Alpha Dollars. I won't accept anything else. </p>
<p>Now your subjects are confused and worried. They have never even seen an Alpha Dollar before. Where would they get them to pay their taxes with? Luckily, you are the king. So you print Alpha Dollars, and you give them to people you employ. For example, you pay your brand new army in Alpha Dollars. Your army is keen to accept the Alpha Dollars because they want to be able to pay their taxes in Alpha Dollars. </p>
<p>Now your soldiers start buying stuff like boots and food and drink and all the things soldiers need. All the shopkeepers want Alpha Dollars too, because they also have to pay their taxes. So Alpha Dollars have become your kingdom's currency. And that's very, very good for you, because whenever you feel like raising a new army, you just print more Alpha Dollars (which will lead to issues of its own, but more on that later). An example of this happening is casinos. Why is all gambling done in chips instead of US Dollars? Simply put, it's because the casino management says, we will only accept chips. So within the casino you can use chips to tip staff, play tables etc. Whenever the casino has a shortage of chips (maybe more people come to play the tables), they can always make more. </p>
<p>Now imagine you're the king of a country called Beta. You also want to raise an army. You don't want to pay them in Alpha Dollars because you don't want to go crawling to the King of Alpha and beg him for Alpha Dollars. So you create your own currency, Beta Dollars. Before long, every king is printing his own currency, using the same trick - declare that they will only accept their own currency in taxes. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sovereign accounting, or the ability to create currency, enables a nation state to create a financial relationship with citizens. </p>
<p>Government requires citizens to pay tax, the government creates currency to make the process easier (they don't want to tax milk in terms of grain after all). </p>
<p>So the citizens do things that the government pays them for, public works, subsidies, etc. </p>
<p>Changing to a universal currency, or even a union currency (like the Euro), can have disastrous side effects for countries that make use of sovereign accounting. </p>
<p>Because if you do not create the money, you are stuck with household accounting where you cannot run a deficit without debt.</p>
<p>That's one reason at least. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it would be very bad for most nations' economies. Countries want to be able to control how much currency is in the circulation (technically called money supply). Too much money and you have inflation. Too little and you have recession and deflation. It constantly changes relative to the business cycle and natural economic growth. Thus countries (usually their central banks) want to be able to fine-tune it based on economic conditions. If countries join currencies, they lose that control. </p>
<p>Euro is one attempt at creating a common currency at least in Europe. The results have been mixed so far. Some countries like Greece had their problems exacerbated because of their inability to control their own currency. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a possibility that cryptocurrency could take off and either supplement or replace fiat currency. Governments will have to get creative to find ways to tax the citizens, but I think it's a possibility. </p>
<p>&quot;Bitcoin&quot; and things like it could be a universal currency. </p>
<p>If there is a more intelligent species elsewhere in our Universe, I guarantee you they've transitioned past national government-issued currency into something like cryptocurrency and maybe beyond it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
