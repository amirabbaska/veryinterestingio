		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It isn't really a matter of advantage, but of cost. HFTs rarely hold positions very long...and pretty much never overnight. The amounts they make per share are extremely small (measured in mils) which are inconsequential unless you are trading millions or billions of shares. They pay gobs of money for lightning fast switches, routers, co-location, microwave relays, etc to catch these tiny amounts... My $7 per trade at Scottrade isn't that fast but for buying a few hundred shares I'm going to hold for weeks, months or years, it wouldn't make sense for me to pay what it would take to trade at the speed of an HFT.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>not everything needs to happen lightning fast,
the fast trading really counts when you are &quot;day trading&quot; and looking for stocks that move in that moment(for example you see it start to go up you buy it you then wait for 10 mins you see it start to go down and you sell it,you are trying to get a profit by the minute or sometimes second).
but there are still a lot of people who just want to buy a stock and just let it be, for example you save some money and want to invest it so you go and buy some stocks or bonds buying it in lightning fast speed or waiting a couple of minutes has no effect for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A good ELI5 book on the subject is &quot;Flash Boys&quot; by Michael Lewis. It goes into how HFT works, the advantages (like increased liquidity) and disadvantages (like shaving points on every trade.) Also how &quot;dark pools&quot; work.</p>
<p>IIRC, RBC and Goldman Sachs are the &quot;good guys&quot; in the book.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Discretionary trading, as opposed to automated high-frequency-esque trading allows human insight and reasoning to provide significant returns above and beyond simple automated trading systems.</p>
<p>HFT is well suited to doing exactly the same thing many times per second and scraping small fractions of pennies in the process. In aggregate this can return significant profits for whoever can buy or build the fastest systems. This becomes a race to the bottom requiring increasingly larger investments to gain a fractional edge over the competition and today has a cost of entry in the hundreds of millions.</p>
<p>Algorithmic trading systems are fundamentally constrained by their designers to operate in the world they understand. HFT is typically focused on maximizing profit by finding an arbitrage opportunity, for example a minor pricing difference between two exchanges.</p>
<p>Humans on the other hand are not limited in the scope of opportunity to which they can apply cognitive understanding and reasoning. </p>
<p>One example of this [1], where humans used insight to find opportunity was using satellite images to monitor the numbers of cars parked at Wal-Mart. From this you can extrapolate a correlation between traffic, visitors and revenue. Monitoring this before Wal-Mart release their quarterly earnings provides one signal of the health of the company.</p>
<p>This system of mining satellite images could then be automated to provide that signal. In isolation that is a useful data point but it requires many more perspectives to make a rational trading decision. Was the traffic driven by aggressive discounts which will impact profits today? What is the reputation of the company? Has the board or CEO significantly changed recently? Are there other signals on their operating performance and other investments?</p>
<p>In this particular case note that the decision to monitor specifically parking lots of specific locations came from a human. A machine given satellite images of the world could find billions of patterns, however a pattern does not necessarily have meaning, especially when it needs to be linked to financial performance; the classic causology vs correlation.</p>
<p>In our Wal-Mart example above - taking all of that information and deciding to trade with it requires human insight. With skill, experience and enough information a human should be able to choose a trading position that will return profits by looking beyond the remit of simple algorithms. When they pull the trigger on the trade HFTs will likely scalp the purchase for a few pennies here and there - but the human trading for the longer term stands to make significant returns.</p>
<p>I would recommend three books to understand first HFT, second longer term macro-investing and third the limitations and abilities of algorithms and AI:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several timeframes at which profit can be made in the market:</p>
<p>-<strong>seconds/minutes:</strong>
This is what you're thinking about. Profits are purely made based on mathematical analysis of the market trend, and trading is mostly done by bots or people who can calculate really fast and well.
Also a bunch of bots are constantly searching the web (e.g. twitter bots) to be the first to capitalize on news.</p>
<p>-<strong>hours/days:</strong>
Here it's a mix of people buying rumours (companies with good/bad news), and trend analysis.</p>
<p>-<strong>weeks to years:</strong>
In this timeframe people buy the stock mostly based on merit: they fundamentally believe the company will create more value (for example buying amazon after the dotcom bubble).</p>
<p>Especially in the latter timeframe normal humans can do very well if they have specific knowledge which helps them pick better stocks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
