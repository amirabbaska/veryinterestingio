<p>Am I correct in thinking that an accelerating expansion means a constantly changing Hubble Constant?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, and what /u/hikaruzero wrote is wrong. A perfect exponential expansion (dark energy and nothing else) corresponds to a <em>constant</em> Hubble constant. &quot;exponential&quot; and &quot;constant&quot; are referencing different things here: &quot;Exponential&quot; looks at a given object and how the distance to it increases (exponentially). The Hubble constant looks at at given distance and looks how the apparent recession speed is there (constant).</p>
<p>We have matter in our universe so the expansion is not completely exponential and the Hubble constant is still changing a bit, but not much any more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Last question: What caused/causes the farther galaxies to move away faster - why are they not moving away at a static rate (before we realized the accelerating expansion)? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Space is expanding everywhere. Essentially new space is being created, pulling everything that isn't gravitationally bound to each other apart. Imagine baking bread with walnuts - as the bread rises, as essentially more volume of bread is being created, all the walnuts are pushed away from each other.</p>
<p>So, then, the more far apart two things are, the more space is being created between them, which leads them to accelerate away from each other at a faster rate than nearer objects would.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
