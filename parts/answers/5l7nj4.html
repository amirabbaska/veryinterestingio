		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Mariana trench is about 11,000 meters below sea level. If you built a cofferdam down to that depth, as u/SirHerald suggests, the pressure would be about 3.2 atm. Divers experience a similar pressure at a depth of around 22 meters, so humans can survive these pressures in the short term. In the long term, I found <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/pao/History/conghand/fig15d3.gif" target="_blank">this chart</a> from NASA suggesting you would have to worry about mild <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrogen_narcosis" target="_blank">nitrogen narcosis</a>, making you feel slightly drunk, and mild <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen_toxicity" target="_blank">oxygen toxicity</a>. So you probably wouldn't want to live at that pressure, but a short trip down wouldn't be any worse than diving.</p>
<p>But, your question was about draining the oceans. The oceans cover 72% of the surface of the earth, and the average depth of the ocean is about 3700 meters. That means a large portion of the atmosphere will sink into the ocean, resetting 1 atm of pressure to a depth of something like 2600 meters below sea level. So that would make the Mariana trench a bit more tolerable at around 2.5 atm, but it would also mean some high altitude cities would become nearly uninhabitable. </p>
<p><strong>edit</strong> Fixed the bracket on the link. Wish I had caught it before I left this morning - wasn't expecting this to blow up so much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The oxygen would re-distribute, and as such some of the higher elevation places would see a dramatic decrease in air thickness. Think akin to how on higher elevation mountain the air is thinner which affects blood flow and your brain. Hypoxia occurs when not enough oxygen is distributed among the body, it can be general (throughout) or localized to a specific part. Since the Oxygen re-distribution would re-scale altitude, people would suffer Altitude Sickness. We know the extreme baseline for this is 6000m, at which and beyond, human sustained life is not possible. Essentially those effects would now be on higher elevated cities. So anything currently exceeding 1000m would, under the new distribution be at the threshold where our current 6000m altitude sickness baseline is. BASICALLY we'd just have to move to more coastal situated cities. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instead of draining the ocean, what about a cofferdam down to the ocean floor? Something like a giant tube all the way down so that you were at the elevation of the bottom of the ocean.</p>
<p>Are you interested in whether we could breath there or if the pressure would be too high?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well... hold on a second. Just draining the ocean would change the topography of the earth, and we'd have the same amount of atmosphere. So I guess we'd HAVE to move down there, or learn to breathe the thinner air way up here.</p>
<p>If you're replacing the water with air such that the pressure stays the same where we are now... I imagine it would feel strange breathing in the thick soup of air down in the Marianas Trench or whatever. But we've already got many kilometers of atmosphere, so I don't know that it would be dangerous to add a few more.</p>
<p>Couldn't you do the experiment by just going down a 5 km shaft or something?
