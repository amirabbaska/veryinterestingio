<p>Is the paradox that larger mammals have many more cells, but similar cancer rates to smaller mammals with many less cells? More cells could obviously mean more chances to develop cancer, so would that mean larger mammals need better regulatory/recognition of tumor cells?</p>
<p>I know that our immune system has pathways to kill cancerous cells,  the danger is that when the cells evolve to hide from our immune system. So my question is: Do larger mammals immune systems recognize cancerous cells better than smaller mammals, and if so, would that potentially cause more sever auto immune disorders?</p>
<p>Again, thank you for the AMA!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>What you wrote made me think: </p>
<p>If the large mammal takes longer to get cancer, is it because their cells last longer so don't copy as often as smaller mammals? </p>
<p>I would imagine small mammals like mice etc replicate themselves like crazy because a lifetime in comparison is short? </p>
<p>If you get what I mean. Thanks for the AMA! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
