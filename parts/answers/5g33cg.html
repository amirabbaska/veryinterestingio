		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One really interesting aspect of Ebola is that it has an extremely difficult time sustaining itself in human population for a variety of factors (many unknown). This is a zoonotic disease, meaning its natural host - called the resovoir - is an animal other than humans. There have been several efforts in order to identify this resovoir as it would help us fight this disease. Whenever Ebola goes into a cycle where it jumps from infecting the unknown animal to infecting humans, it creates an international scare. The panic is mainly due to its extremely high mortality rate (estimated around 70-90%). Therefore, if 10 people are infected with Ebola, anywhere from 7-9 of them may die. Scary right? This is actually a little misleading, however, because there are several different strains of Ebola - with one of these leading to the high mortality rate and others maybe not even life-threatening.
Another reason Ebola is very scary to the public and scientists alike is that we don't really know much about it. As said above, we have no idea what animal the virus resides in it's everyday life. Additionally, it is difficult to research because it is so lethal and has to be contained in very hi-tech locations called BSL4 labs. The government also doesn't allocate money to Ebola research because it does go through the cycles of infectivity and the media only focuses on it for a couple months. </p>
<p>Tl;dr: Ebola is a nasty virus that can be extremely lethal. We don't know much about it, and the government doesn't spend money on its research, so it is unknown and scary. The virus does exist in parts of Africa at all times, but we just don't hear about it. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_African_Ebola_virus_epidemic" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_African_Ebola_virus_epidemic</a></p>
<p>What happened was that it was the largest outbreak ever of a very serious, scary, and poorly-understood disease, so it was big news.</p>
<p>There was a massive response involving quarantines, accelerated R&amp;D efforts, deployment of medical teams and supplies to Africa, etc, etc. The response was not perfect but it did help.</p>
<p>Also, the ebola virus is extremely lethal - 70-90% fatal without supportive care. It is also relatively hard to spread compared to something like the flu or common cold. This means an ebola outbreak tends to burn itself out quickly once everyone figures out what is going on.</p>
<p>So, it wasn't some conspiracy, it was something that was a problem, could have been an even bigger problem, but was solved through circumstance and efforts of professionals.</p>
<p>Oh, my, edits!</p>
<p>Edit 1: Thanks for the gold! There were so many idiotic comments when I got here I almost just clicked away, but mining the rising tab sure paid off today!</p>
<p>Edit 2: As pointed out, this strain was less lethal than some, which may have contributed to the spread.</p>
<p>Edit 3: The mainstream media (however you define it) does suck. That's fine. But not everything is a conspiracy to distract you from whatever scandal. Ebola is not a nice thing and this crisis did have a big impact on a lot of people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're getting lots of good responses, but I remember in my home (Omaha, NE) we had a local 'scare' when the CDC decided to <a href="http://www.unmc.edu/news.cfm?match=15636" target="_blank">send some Americans with the disease here to the University of Nebraska Medical Center</a>, because UNMC is one of the few American hospitals with a Biocontainment Unit, which is designed for exactly this type of highly dangerous infectious disease. From what I remember, at least one patient there arrived in later stages of the disease, and did die under care.</p>
<p>The local news tried to whip up a panic, but all that did was lead to some funny interviews on the streets with people saying they didn't care, or thought it was a good thing our community is served by a hospital with such advanced facilities. </p>
<p>I think that's ultimately what happened to the 'scare' part of it - after the public learned more about the disease, they didn't panic, and then it didn't drive the ratings the news is always craving.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did a small research project on this actually and tracked the number of new cases in the 3 most affected countries: Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. The number of new cases essentially topped off by the end of summer 2015 and by the start of January 2016, these 3 countries had essentially stopped having new cases. And like other commenters said, the media doesn't report on &quot;not new&quot; news so it was probably mentioned once the outbreak was contained. But after that, the media moved onto to other topics. </p>
<p>Edit: summer 2016 --&gt; 2015</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My wife is a virologist and she was over in Sierra Leone helping out as part of the South African response team. </p>
<p>Just because we stopped seeing it in the news doesn't mean it just disappeared. They were still very hard at work when it stopped being covered by the big news outlets. It's typical. After covering the first bit, the news just moved on to something else, as they do. </p>
<p>Nothing annoys my wife more than those dumb ebola &quot;conspiracy&quot; memes. She was there, busting her ass for months and it was very real. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
