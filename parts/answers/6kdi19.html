<p>As for how this happens, it is usually part of aging process. Many organs need fat around them to shield them from shock and to maintain them in good shape. Eyes also have a bit of such fat around them. As people age, the skin and the muscles on the face get weak, while the fatty tissue tends to expand a little bit. Combined, they end up making the fat get saggy under the eyes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;Bags&quot; under your eyes are typically a symptom of aging (as another user said above), since the tissue will age and sag.  The fatty tissue will move to the bottom of the eye lid, creating a saggy look to it.  It's typically cosmetic, but there are home remedy treatments to prevent sagging of the eye lid. </p>
