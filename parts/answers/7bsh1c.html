		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To keep it clear, vitamin naming is a mess and changed with time and what part of the world you're in. This is why most scientists do not use the vitamin classification, and rather proper chemical nomenclature.</p>
<p>Alright now to the question: most of the latter vitamins (FGHIJ) were compacted in vit b (thus it being called a complex). Also vit B is a mess because most of them changed numbers or in some cases even letters eg. Bm &amp; Bt. There were also vitamins that came after K but no consensus has ever been reached over them.</p>
<p>A lot of vitamins disappeared because they were non essential and thus not a vitamin. The whole problem with vitamins is that there isn't a clear definition and was made up a long time ago by people who did not understand the human body that well.</p>
<p>TL:DR vitamins changed names and numbers because they found out some of the vitamins weren't actually vitamins, or they were found in the same foods and thus became a vitamin complex. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
