		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tricky part about science is that you can never be 100% confident that a given explanation or theory is correct. At most we can say that a particular model explains all available data well (it is explanatory), which gives us confidence that it can also be used to make new predictions (it is predictive), which can then be tested. As new evidence comes in, either our confidence in the model/theory grows, or we are forced to modify or fully discard it. </p>
<p>With this idea in mind, looking at the Harvard result from 2014, it would be uncharitable to call it bad science. At the time the researchers published the result, they truly believed that what they saw was real. Specifically, what they thought they saw is <a href="http://i.imgur.com/PSfmt07.jpg" target="_blank">neatly summarized in this diagram</a>. The short story is that within a minuscule fraction of a second after the big bang, the universe expanded at a breakneck pace in a process called inflation. This inflation produced massive gravitational waves that a few hundred thousand years later shaped the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_microwave_background" target="_blank">Cosmic Microwave Background</a> (CMB) that we still observe today. By looking at the polarization of the CMB in a certain patch of the sky, the Harvard researchers thought they were able to indirectly observe the effects of gravitational waves. </p>
<p>The problem with these findings, which became apparent later, is that their methodology was not very robust in accounting for an additional source of signal, namely galactic dust. Follow-up studies then determined that at least a very large component of the signal did in fact come from this pesky dust. In other words, it wasn't that the signal the Harvard folks saw wasn't real (or statistically significant), but rather that the contribution from gravity waves, if there was any, was far smaller than what they had initially thought. The media was a bit brutal in how they announced this reevaluation of the original results, but it would be unfair to say that the researchers had done anything improper. At most you can say that they should have tempered the claims a bit, allowing for the possibility of confounding signals. </p>
<p>So is the LIGO result any different? Well, I would say that there are good reasons to say yes. For one, LIGO directly detected gravitational waves, not only their indirect influence. LIGO literally measured how <a href="http://i.imgur.com/OwEl85Q.gifv" target="_blank">space expanded and contracted as a gravitational wave washed past the detectors</a>. The results they measured were not just consistent among the <a href="http://i.imgur.com/zOB8m28.png" target="_blank">two detectors they used</a>, but they also <a href="http://i.imgur.com/DxYstHU.png" target="_blank">beautifully matched</a> the expected waveform of two black holes dancing in a spiral before finally merging. Even the timing between the two detectors (situated thousands of kms apart) is consistent with gravity waves traveling at the speed of light. All in all, this really does look like as definitive a proof as we could have hoped for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taking a stab at clarifying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;According to the Harvard group there was a one in 2 million chance of the result being a statistical fluke.&quot;</p>
<p>1 in 2 million!</p>
<p>Those claims turned out completely false.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's not precisely true, and it's unfair to reduce a complex piece of science such as this to that statement. From the <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.112.241101" target="_blank">original BICEP2 results paper</a> (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.3985" target="_blank">arXiv</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We find an excess of B-mode power over the base lensed-ΛCDM expectation in the range 30 &lt; ℓ &lt; 150, inconsistent with the null hypothesis at a significance of &gt; 5σ.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The key statement here is its inconsistency with the null hypothesis — i.e. that there was no detection of B-mode polarization. Both a primordial B-mode signal from inflation as well as B-modes from galactic dust emissions cause a signal that can be detected. Furthermore, the abstract tries to hammer home the point that — at that time — the data on galactic foregrounds (namely dust) was not well constrained and could potentially explain the signal seen:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;However, these models are not sufficiently constrained by external public data to exclude the possibility of dust emission bright enough to explain the entire excess signal.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What has changed since that initial announcement was the BICEP/Keck team collaborated with the Planck team to use a combined data set analysis. Their <a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.101301" target="_blank">joint publication</a> (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.00612" target="_blank">arXiv</a>) has a detailed explanation of how the additional data provided by Planck changed the interpretation, namely that a galactic dust foreground can explain at least half of the observed signal. (And then beyond that paper, the Planck data has mostly been released for public use.)</p>
<p>What I'm trying to emphasize, though, is that the BICEP/Keck team had limited information about dust foregrounds so the interpretation of the signal was wrong, but the <strong>detection of a signal</strong> is not. See <a href="http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/graphics/bb_detections/bb_detections_2015nov.pdf" target="_blank">this figure</a> (<a href="http://lambda.gsfc.nasa.gov/graphics/" target="_blank">source web page</a>) from NASA which collects CMB detections and upper limits from a variety of projects — note that the BICEP/Keck team is the only experiment to make positive detection of a B-mode signal and degree angular scales. All those data points taken together do add up to a confidence of greater than 2 million to 1 that the signal is real and not just a statistical fluctuation (but we now know that the signal is partly caused by dust rather than being primordial B-modes).</p>
<p>Finally, getting back around to the main point of your question, the LIGO result is trustworthy because the analysis and methodology are sound (just as I'd argue was also true for BICEP2). LIGO has an easier job of <strong>interpreting</strong> their results since they don't have a relatively poorly understood foreground to deal with like the BICEP/Keck team did. (I.e. LIGO uses multiple observatories to remove local environmental noise. The necessary equivalent in CMB observations would be to move across the galaxy or to another neighboring galaxy.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>OP, there is a lot of negative editorializing going on in your post.  are you suggesting that anyone at Harvard acted in bad faith?</p>
<p>the BICEP2 and LIGO experiments were very different.  iirc, BICEP2 measured the polarity of photons coming toward the south pole.  LIGO involved two separate interferometers measuring the actual distance between two fixed points.  all science is provisional in the sense that the next great insight might require us to go back and erase some stuff, and all new claims about anything should be met with questions like &quot;are there any other explanations for this data?&quot;  </p>
<p>reasonable doubt is reasonable.  unreasonable doubt is unscientific.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons we should be a bit less skeptical of the LIGO announcement:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The waveform measured by LIGO matches very well the expected waveform for a gravitational wave.  It would have to be a bizarre source of noise which could generate a similar waveform.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The detection happened at <em>both</em> detectors, and with the expected time delay due to the speed of propagation of a GW.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LIGO has over 100,000 channels which record sources of noise.  Things like EM noise, acoustic noise, seismic noise, etc.  Each of these channels is compared to the GW channel to determine if the GW signal is due to spurious coupling of noise. <a href="https://dcc.ligo.org/public/0122/P1500248/010/P1500248_EarlyaLIGOCalUncertainty.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is a paper describing the LIGO calibration as it relates to GW150914.  This is much of what was going on between September and February - making sure that what they saw was an actual gravitational wave and not noise coupling.</p>
</li>
<li>False alarm rates.  In the LIGO publication they talk about the false alarm rate - that is, how likely is it that this signal is simply random noise that happened to build up to what was measured.  The publication where they discuss this event (<a href="http://journals.aps.org/prl/pdf/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102" target="_blank">Here</a>),shows the false alarm rate is lower than 1 in 22 500 years.</li>

<p>You seem to imply that the publishing and peer-review process somehow failed last time, but this could not be further from the truth. It worked <em>exactly</em> as it's supposed to: A group announced their method and results, their peers reviewed their work, and problems were found with the method and conclusions. I can't think of a <strong>more</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method" target="_blank">scientific method</a> than that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, taking as gospel the announcement of some big science place that has scientific scientists in the field of science who are sciencing lots of science is <strong>not</strong> very scientific at all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
