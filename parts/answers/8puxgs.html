		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>acne is caused by bacteria entering a follicle and infecting that pore. Therefore you ANY area where you have more acne then another place means there is more bacteria in that area that is causing the pimples. If you have more pimples on your face its because there is more bacteria on your face. </p>
<p>One reason this may occur is because of many oil glands in the face. the oil clogs pores causing the bacterial to flourish since there is no oxygen going to that area. The bacterial growth translates to a pimple. </p>
<p>This is why all topical acne medication work by (1) killing the bacteria and (2) has a peeling agent to help remove the dead skin. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had read somewhere that pimples happen on our face because past human descendants had hair on their faces and we needed to secrete oils to protect the hair.</p>
<p>Now, since we've evolved to not have hair on our faces, the oils tend to get backed up beneath our skin and we break out in acne/pimples.</p>
<p>Not sure if that's 100% correct but that's what I remember from a while ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
