Their sails use rip-stop construction so that a pinhole doesn't develop into a large-scale tear, and they can accept several localized holes without losing mission effectiveness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't.  Depending on the environment (low Earth orbit, high Earth orbit, solar orbit...) there will be a flux of particles of various sizes, with a distribution of relative speeds.  A thorough solar sail design would need to analyze the expected exposure over the mission lifetime and show that it can meet the mission requirements with that many holes :-)</p>
<p>Any big space structure (ISS for sure, probably JWST) does that kind of analysis.  We're still in the early days of solar sails (i.e. &quot;let's just get something up there and see how far we can get&quot;), so there may be less emphasis on this level of analysis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of great answers here, one thing I want to highlight is that when a wind sail is pierced it loses more effectiveness than the amount of area lost. This is because the difference in air pressure that causes the sail to generate lift also forces more through the gap, increasing drag and decreasing lift. </p>
<p>With a solar sail it is generating impulse through radiation pressure, reflecting photons to gain momentum. This means as long as the sail is still structurally intact  you get the full impulse from every photon that strikes the sail. Also there is no &quot;photon drag&quot; on the sail due to a non aerodynamic surface.</p>
<p>It's a case where the name analogy breaks down because each propulsion method is different in a pretty fundamental way, despite a similar appearance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't avoid debris, except in the macro sense where they might avoid an area of known debris but that's just thruster maneuvering.</p>
<p>They actually are designed so that if you punch a hole in the panel only the local area to the damage stops working and the rest of the panel is unaffected. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would something like two layers of graphene with a liquid between them work as a shielding? It seems like solid armors are insufficient for this kind of protection but dispersing the impact force through liquid could be more effective.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
