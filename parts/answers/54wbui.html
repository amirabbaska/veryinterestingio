		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Science isn't always about finding applications. There have been many discoveries throughout history that didn't have practical applications for decades or centuries. </p>
<p>These super-heavy elements won't have applications because they're too short-lived. But they're useful for testing our current theories on nuclear physics. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what others have said, its also predicted that there could be a so-called island of stability somewhere between element numbers 125-135.</p>
<p>Instead of a half life of milliseconds, these could persist for minutes to hours, though some models predict they could last as long as a few days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are thousands of known nuclides but only hundreds of them are stable. Furthermore, many of them are <strong>highly</strong> unstable, so the only way to study them is to produce them ourselves.</p>
<p>We make them because we're interested in them and we want to understand them. We want to test theories in extreme cases where they're most likely to fail. Because when theories fail to reproduce reality, we learn something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another reason left out is that these nuclides may exist briefly as transitional states during explosive nuclear burning, like in supernova or neutron star mergers. We need to know their properties to know how the burning will proceed so that we can understand the chemical evolution history of the universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the immortal words of Cave Johnson, &quot;Science isn't about why, it's about why not!&quot; A lot of this is less applied science and more just trying to learn about how far the limits of the universe can be pushed. It's important to know how our theories on atoms hold up when pushed to the extremes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
