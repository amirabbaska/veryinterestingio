		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chemist here, how acidic a substance is is measured in pH. This measure is a concentration of protons (or H+) atoms in the liquid, and it is a log 10 scale that goes from 0-14 with neutral being 7. </p>
<p>At pH 0 the concentration of protons is 1. At pH 1, it's 0.1, at 2 it's 0.01. etc all the way to a pH of 14 and above. It's a logarithmic scale, so 3 is ten times less than 2 and ten times more acidic than 4. (When you get to basic conditions you can think of it instead as the hydroxide ion (OH-) rather than the proton (H+)). </p>
<p>My Googlefu says that the stomach holds ~40ml when &quot;empty&quot; and has a pH of ~2. </p>
<p>If you were to drink a liter of water (1000ml, ~a quart) you would dilute your stomach acid 1:25. A 1:10 dilution would get you to pH 3, and with how log scale works, a 1:2.5 dilution gets you to something like 3.15. </p>
<p>Now, that's if it's a simple system, it's not. In reality there is a thing called buffering capacity, the same thing your blood does to the pH at a relative constant. Hydrochloric acid does not buffer, but your stomach also has carbonic acid, which does. </p>
<p>The second your stomach acid starts getting diluted, the buffering molecules in the liquid start losing protons, which causes the number of free protons as a whole to increase. Essentially, the system resists the change in concentration. It wants to stay as close to pH 2 as it can.</p>
<p>Additionally, the cells in your stomach can tell what the pH of the stomach acid is. It's how your body knows when to pump out more acid, which it does. </p>
<p>So essentially, yes, drinking water will change the pH of your stomach, but not by very much, and not for very long. Google says that the volume of your stomach halves every 12-15 minutes, so after drinking a liter of water you'd get back to the 40ml you started with in 50-60 minutes.</p>
<p>Edit: even though I live in America, I refuse to learn the imperial system</p>
<p>Edit 2: tried to explain buffering better</p>
<p>Edit 3: whoever told me to go back to my country and then deleted their comment, or edited it, or whatever, I was born here too, lived here my whole life. <strong>EVERYONE</strong> who does science, <strong>LOATHES</strong> the imperial system. </p>
<p>Edit 4: added estimate to get back to normal after drinking a liter of water.</p>
<p>Edit 5: Clarified a couple things, changed my explanation oh pH to what is correct although I think it's harder to understand. Added a more friendly ELI5 Below. I also tried to go through the comments and answer more questions that came up directly or address them in edits. </p>
<p><strong>Simpler answer</strong></p>
<p>Your stomach is very very acidic. So much so that even though you have such a small amount of liquid in your stomach when it's empty that drinking a normal liter sized water bottle would hardly change how strongly acidic it is. </p>
<p>Your stomach also notices when the acidity changes, and will start producing more acid, trying to stay at a constant level of acidity. </p>
<p>Your stomach then starts emptying itself, which on an empty stomach with a liter of water, takes a little less than an hour, and over that time has gone back to its normal level of acidity. </p>
<p>I don't know how to make my first explanation easier to understand without removing the ability to have you walk away from this thread truly having learned what is going on. I can answer the question simply, but <strong>explaining</strong> and having you truly <strong>understand</strong> is a lot harder.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacist here, we study the effects of water on the stomach for bioavailability of medications. Studies show that water goes right through the stomach in a matter of seconds (why drinking a cup of water right after some pills is recommended). While smoothies, for example, take about 30 mins to go through the stomach. </p>
<p>The stomach also has very complex mechanisms for regulating stomach pH. Not only does it have very efficient pumps to pump acid into the stomach, it also has pumps to pull acid out of the stomach. It also can secrete bicarbonate (a buffer) and typically has a bicarbonate layer in the protective mucosa of the stomach. The stomach is good at self-regulating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The immediate effect of drinking water will make your stomach acid less acidic. Stomach acid normally is around pH 2 and will usually rise to around 6 or so after drinking water. However, the effect fades pretty quickly, probably in a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>The thing is that your stomach maintains a buffer, which means that if the acidity of the stomach decreases, then the relevant cells will release more acid to increase acidity once again. Overwhelming this system to raise the pH level (lower acidity) for long periods of time probably requires too much water to drink safely.</p>
<p>EDIT: Source of information that I used for this explanation is listed [here] (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18473176" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18473176</a>). In response to what others have said in the replies, I do understand the principles of pH and how they work, but I felt like there may be other factors involved that could lead to spikes in pH.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
