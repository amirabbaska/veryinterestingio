There is currently a higher concentration of such particles due to dust from the Sahara blown in by Hurricane Ophelia as well as byproducts of the fires in Portugal. </p>
<p>Many of these particles are small enough that they mostly scatter light using a mechanism called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_scattering" target="_blank">Rayleigh scattering</a>. This type of scattering affects light of shorter wavelengths (e.g. blue light) more strongly than longer wavelengths (red light). As a result, blue light is effectively filtered, causing the Sun to look red-orange. Conceptually the same effect explains why the sky looks red during sunset or sunrise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
