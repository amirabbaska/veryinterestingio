<p>&quot;Climate at high-obliquity&quot;, Ferreira et al, Icarus 2014.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mit.edu/~pog/src/ferreira_climate_high_obliquity_2014.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.mit.edu/~pog/src/ferreira_climate_high_obliquity_2014.pdf</a></p>
<p>For a water-covered Earthlike planet tilted at 90°, they find a relatively moderate climate, all things considered.  Summer pole temperatures reach 310 Kelvin (100 F), winter pole temperatures around freezing, coldest year-round temperatures at the <em>equator</em>, which gets less sunlight on the annual average.</p>
<p>Wind speeds at ground level are similar to the regular Earth, but the pattern is somewhat different.</p>
<p>I'd consider their simulated planet &quot;totally habitable&quot;.  The ocean and atmosphere are very effective at smoothing out the large differences in heating across the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing about Uranus that I thought was great to dwell on -- At the beginning of Summer, the Sun is directly above the pole.  That means that, to an observer at the pole, the Sun is nearly motionless ... and is directly above.</p>
<p>It does not set or rise, and its light comes down directly.  That spot should become what would be relatively &quot;very hot&quot; for the planet.  It would depend on how long the planet was in that position.  For Uranus, it is close to that for decades.</p>
<p>I --think-- that is unique in the whole solar system.  For a period of decades, the Sun seems motionless in the sky directly overhead.</p>
<p>That is why I was surprised at that paper that was mentioned.  Yes, the continually sunlit pole is warmer than the side that gets no light at all for a long time, but the atmosphere movements distribute it far more than I would have thought.</p>
<p>As I remember it, when Voyager swung past Uranus, (I hope I have this right correct me if I am wrong) the planet was in that summer solstice position.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m not that smart but I learned in science class that Uranus is tilted at about 60 degrees which actually causes it to have 1/3 of the year in complete darkness which greatly decreases the temperature. Uranus also has 1/3 of the year in total daylight which increases the temperatures drastically.</p>
<p>This darkness and brightness creates very cold winters and very warm summers. Uranus most likely does not contain life forms due to extreme changes in climate.</p>
<p>Uranus also has very powerful winds due to the temperature differences across the planet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
