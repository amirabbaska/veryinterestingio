<p>See my other reply for details.</p>
<p>Tl;dr: lactobacillus in vagina and gut are different at species and strain level (in healthy women).</p>
<p>Cunnilingus is no free probiotics treatment.</p>
<p>Also, don’t try to make “vagina yoghurt”. (Please...).</p>
<p>Source: I am an academic researcher on the human microbiome.</p>
<p>Edit: These are some papers on this, as requested repeatedly. I posted them in a different reply before which was subsequently deleted. Some of these papers were published literally two weeks ago, but the results were known in the field for some time.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I previously worked in a lab that isolated natural compounds from lactobacillus derived from vaginal swabs. Lactobacillus species are mostly facultative anaerobes, and form biofilms, allowing them to colonize low pH areas such as the oral cavity, the gut, and the vagina. No study has been done replicating the exact scenario you described, but there are strains of lactobacillus currently being used as probiotics aiming to introduce these bacteria to the gut through cultured foods/drinks. It's not reasonable to draw conclusions on whether oral sex directly affects the microflora of your digestive system, but it is well documented that lactobacillus species can produce small molecules important for combating exogenous microbes and promoting a healthy microbiome, and are capable of living in the environments involved in oral sex.</p>
