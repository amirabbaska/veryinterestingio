		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The smell lingers as long as you're drunk because it's not coming from residual booze in your saliva, it's the smell of your blood itself.</p>
<p>When you imbibe an alcoholic beverage, ethanol (the active ingredient that gets you drunk), is absorbed into your bloodstream. Ethanol is a volatile chemical (it evaporates easily), so when alcoholic blood passes through your lungs, some of the ethanol evaporates into the air that you exhale. It's this process that allows a breathalyzer to measure BAC based on your exhalation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Coke is simply digested. You would only have residual coke after taste in your mouth, and would not be exhaling it from your lungs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because no one seems to know the right answer:<br />
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketoacidosis</a>  </p>
<p>After an extended period drinking (exactly how long depends on a person's metabolism) alcohol is metabolised to acetone which is released through skin pores and through the lungs as you breath out. Acetone is the distinct smell that you find on drunks.  </p>
<p>A bit of trivia: diabetes sufferers are more prone to ketoacidosis than a healthy individual.  </p>
<p>edit:<br />
As u/3111111111 points out alcohol is not metabolised to acetone, it's metabolised to acetaldehyde. Over consumption inhibits the synthesis of glucose which leads to fatty acids being metabolised to acetone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
