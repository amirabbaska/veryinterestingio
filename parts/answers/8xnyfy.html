		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a veterinarian who has also studied behavioural medicine, what parallels and differences have you noticed between human and dogs when it comes to such conditions and anxiety, depression, obsessive-compulsive disorders, and so-forth?  (If that is something that is part of your work.  I personally try to minimize the use of TCAs and SSRIs when it comes to managing cases, instead relying heavily on training and behaviour modification, and would be curious to hear your input on such.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
