		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, we must understand that a poison can be anything. Whether it acts as a poison or not depends on the dose. Having said that poisons which depend on the shape of the molecule like Ricin have been shown to degrade and become less effective. On the other hand Potassium thiocyanate which is 'mildly' poisonous decomposes to give Cyanides which are more poisonous. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be easier to consider what is meant by expires? Typically it's when something doesn't do what it is supposed to do. If that doesn't happen then it will not 'expire'. So if your poison is intended to make someone ill or dead, no matter how, your poison will only expire if it stops doing that. In reality very few people create a poison without wanting other constraints, such as &quot;humanely kill&quot; in which case it could be the humanly bit the stops working and the poison gets more deadly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The expiration date is the date beyond which the chemical's properties can not be expected to be the same as when it was new. That may make it less or more poisonous. Many &quot;poisons&quot; have uses other than poisoning. Some are used as medicine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
