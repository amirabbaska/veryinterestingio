		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Major cities had a &quot;long distance switchboard&quot; which had access to overseas telecom lines (typically cables running under the ocean). You had to call the operator and ask for &quot;long distance&quot; and then talk the the &quot;long distance operator&quot; and tell them what country you wanted to call. They made the connection through very primitive means, sometimes literally by plugging a wire into a socket.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first transatlantic telephone cable, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TAT-1" target="_blank">TAT-1</a>, wasn't built until 1955. Before that, there were transatlantic telegraph cables, but they couldn't really carry a voice call. Before 1956, transatlantic telephone conversations were carried by radio on the HF bands. The HF bands (3-30Mhz) are a chunk of the radio frequency spectrum that can bounce off of the ionosphere, taking the signals much further than line of sight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone is talking about the cables, but a major difference between how information was transmitted in the 1950s and today is back then they used circuit switches and today we use packet switching. So in the 50s when you called someone, you got a dedicated end-to-end electrical circuit which meant that no one could use the line, or any part of the circuit, until it was opened. In the 60s, scientists developed packet switching, which broke data into tiny packets that could be sent across the line much faster and independently of each other. Fiber optic cables were dropped to make this process even faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Regardless of public perception, your phone calls are not going to space over long distances. Especially cell phones.</p>
<p>Cell phones go to the nearest tower, that's it, and then back to earth through cables.</p>
<p>phone -&gt; in the air to nearest tower -&gt; cables -&gt; nearest tower to person you are calling -&gt; phone.</p>
<p>Not once did it go to space or hit a satellite. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
