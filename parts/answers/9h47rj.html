		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're acclimated. The pressure inside their bodies is the same as the pressure outside their bodies. Since there's no pressure difference, they can breathe and function normally down there, although the <del>increased water resistance from the high pressure</del> <em>difference in the water's 'slipperiness' (called &quot;viscosity&quot;) at that depth due to pressure and temperature</em> (edited, with props to /u/agate_ for the correction) from the high pressure (plus lack of high-calorie food) likely makes most of them generally move slower than surface creatures.</p>
<p>This is why deep-sea species are almost assuredly dead when you capture them and bring them to the surface unless you take extraordinary precautions. As they rise through the water, the pressure inside their bodies becomes tremendously higher than the pressure outside their bodies, and their internal organs rupture like an overfilled balloon as they're dragged up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What I’d like to add to the topic, is that there is also a Cetacean by the name of <em>Cuvier’s Beaked Whale</em> who actually descends down to depths of 3000m (9,800ft). This is twice as deep as a goblin shark, and deeper than the huge colossal squids. Why is this so crazy? Since it is a whale, it regularly has to go up for air. Cuvier’s beaked whale has foldable ribs, which means it can reduce air pockets for buoyancy. </p>
<p>I am not sure how the whale just doesn’t explode when it goes up to the surface though. I guess as others suggested the foldable ribs might increase pressure inside the animal when it goes down to hunt squids. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit: ELI5 tl;dr - As long as animals don't have any air-filled spaces in their bodies, they basically *are* water. Since water is pretty much incompressible, their tissues won't be compressed by increasing pressure - their tissues will just exist at the same pressure as the water around them, and it won't even matter to the animal, except at the deepest depths.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Lots of partially correct answers here, so I'll clarify something:</p>
<p>Pressure is only an issue when you have air-filled spaces in your body, like lungs or air bladders. When you increase the pressure outside of an air-filled organ, the air inside will decrease in volume and the organ will begin to collapse in on itself (which is not always a bad thing - this is normal for lungs of deep-diving whales).</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>However, deep sea creatures don't have any air-filled spaces in their bodies. Even fishes whose ancestors had a swim bladder (air organ used for buoyancy) have completely lost the structure through evolution - no deep-sea fishes have swim bladders.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>The tissues of animals are very similar in properties to water, as long as there are no air-filled spaces. Because water is basically incompressible, the tissues of deep-sea fishes will not be compressed by external increases in pressure, and as many people have said in this thread, their watery tissues internally are at the same pressure as the water externally. Basically, there is nothing to collapse - from a pressure perspective, it's as if the animal is just a part of the fluid environment, and there is no difference between external and internal pressure.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>At very large depths (&gt;2000m), pressure can start to change enzyme function, because enzymes tend to only be effective under specific physical conditions. However, as lineages of deep-sea animals moved deeper into the ocean, they have evolved different enzyme functionality in response to this. However, only some lineages have successfully done this, which is why you see the same specific types of animals invading the deepest parts of the ocean all over the world. The best example is the hadal snailfishes, which are commonly found at the deepest depths (e.g., Mariana and Atacama trenches, which are thousands of miles apart). The snailfishes seem to be a group that have the genetic ability to adapt to the deepest depths, whereas many other deep sea fishes are evolutionarily stuck at \~1800m.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pressure isn't an issue. Pressure difference is though.</p>
<p>High internal pressure and lower external pushes outwards causing explosion (like blowing a balloon up too much).</p>
<p>Lower internal pressure and higher external pressure pushes inwards (like if you squeeze a bottle until it bursts).</p>
<p>If their external and internal pressures are equal. They're okay (like if you pushed on a door with 10kg force and your friend was on the other side pushing with 10kg force, the door wouldn't move).</p>
<p>That's the basics. It gets complicated when you get onto cells as they are like mini bubbles themselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
