		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Free weights use connecting and supporting muscles to stabilize your arms and legs and body when Using them. They give a more well round whole body work out. Machines are great for <em>isolating</em> muscle groups, giving you the ability to target specific muscles. So they both are good, just different. Use free weights to build overall muscle fitness. Use machines to target specific areas you want to improve.</p>
<p>Edit: I just want to say there is a lot of amazing and competent information in this thread and I am really impressed by everyone communicating positively and expanding knowledge together! This is what reddit should be like more often!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short - when you use free weights, you use more muscle groups compared to machines. </p>
<p>It is therefore more efficient. </p>
<p>Another reason I would recommend it to any non-bodybuilder is that free weights lifting is more functional and has more real-world applications. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What nobody in this thread mentioned is that it is very effective, to first isolate the muscle with one set at the machine with heavy weights and then work with free weights or body weight or do a full body workout. That way you can create some extra stress on specific muscle groups that you want to grow faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was told that machines tend to isolate your specific muscles, while free weights improve your &quot;stabilizer&quot; muscles, which were described to me as &quot;the tiny muscles around the major muscles&quot;.  </p>
<p>I used to like to switch between the two when i lifted (many many moons ago), especially if I hit a plateau.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
