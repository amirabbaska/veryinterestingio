		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer</strong>: the difference is in how much your processor does in those clock cycles. </p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong></p>
<p>The amount of instructions your processor handles each second depends on two factors: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Clock speed: the speed at which the processor components switch state</p>
</li>
<li>Instructions per Clock cycle (IPC): the amount of instructions the processor can handle during one cycle. </li>
</ul>
<p>Clock speed has not improved that much over the last 5-10 years. A higher clock speed results in more heat, and we have hit a limit to how much we can comfortably cool. For desktops that's in between 3-4 GHz, for laptops that's even lower. </p>
<p>Therefore lots of improvements have been made to the IPC. Mostly it comes down to parallellism: processing multiple instructions at the same time. If we compare processing instructions to doing the laundry: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pipelining: instead of washing, drying, ironing the first load, then doing the same for the second, third, ... the second load can already start using the washing machine as soon as the first load is transfered to the dryer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instruction parallellism: if two loads of laundry require the same washing machine settings, we can put them together and execute in the same cycle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiple processor cores: we use multiple washing machines, dryers, irons to wach multiple loads at the same time. </p>
</li>
<li>Multiple instruction threads per core: if a certain load does not need to be ironed, we can use the iron for another load.</li>
</ul>
<p>EDIT: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Most people seem to use the term &quot;IPC&quot; only to indicate single core performance, here I used it in the broader sense and do count multicore processors as an improvement in IPC. </p>
</li>
<li>Cache is indeed a factor I forgot. In laundry terms, cache is a set of racks where you can store a small amount of laundry. You can store laundry you just washed while it waits for the dryer to be free. Or if you have a load of blue shirts in the washing machine you can already prepare another load of blue shirts to follow so you don't have to switch settings. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you got the model numbers of both parts on you? If it's the same architecture for both, you're only going to see a very tiny boost in single threaded performance but the i7 probably has twice as many threads to throw around. Your team of CPU men hasn't gotten much stronger individually, it's just doubled in size.</p>
<p>I went from an i5 4300M to an i7 4810MQ, the clock speed only went up from 2.6 to 2.8 but it also went from two cores and four threads to four cores and eight threads. Effectively, I've got twice the power to throw around now. It won't neccessarily make every single application faster, because not everything uses more than one core, but it'll let me do more things at once.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oooh a question I can answer.</p>
<p>Ok, imagine you have some people painting a wall. They can paint thousands strokes a second because these are some really fast painters. There are two ways you can finish painting the wall quicker, either make them paint faster, or get more painters.</p>
<p>In this analogy:</p>
<ul>
<li>clock speed = number of strokes a second</li>
<li>the number of cores = number of painters</li>
</ul>
<p>Now when you get a hyperthreaded (or multithreaded) CPU, this is like giving the painters a brush in each hand. They can multitask now! It's hard to multitask though, so two painters are usually better than one painter with two brushes.</p>
<p><em>(In reality it's a little more complex than that, sometimes faster clock speeds will be better, and sometimes more cores will be better)</em></p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I noticed I hadn't brought it back to the question really, but an i7 has one big benefit over an i3, the i7 has more cores. Now, the i3 might be better if the i7 is a lot lot older <a href="http://cpu.userbenchmark.com/Compare/Intel-Core-i7-3820-vs-Intel-Core-i3-8350K/m739vs3935" target="_blank">for example an 8th generation i3 vs a 3rd generation i7</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing to understand is that &quot;i3&quot; and &quot;i7&quot; are more about <em>branding</em> than technical specifications.</p>
<p>Depending on year it came out &amp; even the particular model that year, they could have different numbers of cores, different amounts of cache, different onboard graphics processors and other differences.  The systems they're in can have different amounts and speeds of RAM, different types &amp; speeds of HDD/SSD and might have different types/speeds of graphics processor (or none at all).  All of these can have significant differences in performance.</p>
<p>Year over year, the &quot;2.3GHz i3&quot; gets faster because they're constantly updating the core architecture so it can do more per clock tick.  <a href="https://www.cpubenchmark.net/compare.php?cmp[]=750&amp;cmp[]=2602" target="_blank">Going from a 2000-series to a 5000-series gives you about a 20% performance boost</a>.</p>
<p>Then you're jumping from an i3, which is supposed to a mid/low-end chip to an i7, which is supposed to be a high-end chip.  It's going to have more cores, hyperthreading and all the bells &amp; whistles enabled.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another factor not yet mentioned here is cache. A computer uses multiple forms of short-term memory. These things cannot hold data without drawing power, but have much higher bandwidth. Which basically mean how fast data can be moved around.</p>
<p>One of those types of memory is called cache, and is part of the actual CPU chipset. It's much faster than the system memory you have called RAM. The most used data is stored in the cache, anything that doesn't fit is put in system memory. </p>
<p>Higher grade CPU's come with more cache. And this plays a part in the better performance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
