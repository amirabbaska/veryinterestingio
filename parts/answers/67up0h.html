		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>She loses electrolytes every time she uses laxatives to purge - prolonged imbalance in electrolytes can lead to heart problems, brain swelling, seizures, coma and death, among other things. </p>
<p>She may also suffer from edema, where her body holds onto water and swells. Repeated diarrhea may lead to a tear in her bowels and bleeding.</p>
<p>There's also something called &quot;reflex constipation&quot; where the bowel stops being able to move things along as it should. She might also permanently break her digestive system, so she might end up needing a colostomy bag. </p>
<p>Colon cancer risk increases. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cautionary tale time: I starved myself from the beginning of high school til my mid 30s. To help with the hunger pains, I would take Dexatrim (an appetite suppresant) and drank alcohol. I sometimes took laxatives, to look extra good for special events. My weight was always yo-yoing, it was part of my charm. Until one day, nothing in my closet fit me. No big deal, I thought, I'll just cut down my intake a little more. But I kept gaining weight. A year later, I had gained 130 pounds. I started developing food allergies. I would break out in hives every day, mostly on my face. The mornings were brutal. I would dart to the bathroom, blast the toilet with a fire hose of diarrhea and then flop back on the bed in the fetal position, moaning from the terrible ache in my abdomen. Because my thyroid was struggling so much from malnutrition and alcohol, I was in a very serious clinical depression that lasted...well, we're now in year 7, but I'm finally heading back in a better direction. I quit drinking alcohol and taking medications, especially ibuprofen, I started eating natural whole foods, I removed the things from my life that prevented me from happiness (bad husband) and did a bunch of inner work, focusing on self love and body acceptance. To date, I've lost about a hundred pounds and my mental clarity is coming back. Most importantly, I will never again treat my body like a toxic waste dump. I hope your friend can realize how beautiful her body is before things get bad. The worst part was being invisible when I was over weight. I was used to getting a lot of attention from men, and then suddenly, they would go to great lengths to avoid looking directly at me. I could always tell they were judging me for not putting down the fork. I wanted to tell them: I never eat anything!...but it turned out that was why I was large. Your body tries to handle what you throw at it for as long as it can, but then at some point a switch gets flipped. And then you're royally screwed. The best, and my sincerest love to your friend. Please tell her she's loved and she's always been good enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone who relied on them for years because of bulimia, it's terrible for your body for very little weight loss. Talk to her about why she feels she needs them. A lot of the time I would use them because I felt bloated or too full so that would be my solution. Temporarily it works fantastically. But it does really awful stuff to that who system. And coming off of them is rough, it takes the body time to remember how to poop on its own </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A long time ago before probiotics became popular someone explained them to me like this: &quot;you have a village of helpers in your intestines. If you take a laxative they all get flushed away. If you do not eat vegetables, fruit, or yogurt then they will not come back and the only way you can poop is to use more laxatives. The human body itself is incapable of digesting food. We utilize the poop of the bacteria in our intestines. So the bacteria eats the food we eat and we eat absorb their poop. Just like the earth worms in a garden. Dirt is the result of earth worms eating everything in the ground.&quot; If she cannot be healthy for herself maybe she can think of her gut as a playroom for pets and keep them healthy. She can grow her own bacteria and maintain their health with fruits and vegetables. She can grow bad bacteria that feed on sugar and junk food and be over weight and unhealthy. She can flush all of them away with laxatives and bring about a myriad of health problems because her body has no access to nutrition or the food she did eat whether healthy or not due to the lack of probiotics in her gut. I hope she does seek your advice in the future. You are a good friend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Agree with u/requestmedadvice, that covers everything I can think of from the medical portion.</p>
<p>From the former anorexic/bulimic section here... I can truthfully say that it doesn't even work that well, other than really fucking up your body. I've tried it a few times, when I was doing better with my eating habits but still wanted to lose weight/terrified of gaining, and it honestly didn't seem to make any difference in my weight. How long has she been doing it? She may even realize herself that it's not working, and is harming her body. (The constipation when your body gets dependent on laxatives SUCKS. And is extremely painful.) Even knowing, medically, the harm it could cause didn't stop me... it was the realization that it didn't work and was causing me pain that made me stop. </p>
<p>Good luck with your friend, and to your friend. I read your other comments, and it looks like she has a long road ahead of her.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
