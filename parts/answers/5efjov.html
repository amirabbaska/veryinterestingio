		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we just consider a simple single crystalline Si solar cell, we will never run out of material. Si is one of the most abundant elements on the earth. I am unsure about repairing panels but it is possible to recycle the Si. </p>
<p>There are many other type of solar materials being researched that contain less abundant elements. Most of those materials however are more efficient absorbers and a lot less material is needed to begin with. </p>
<p>The biggest limiting factor would be the use of indium Tin Oxide for the 'glass' coating/contact. I don't know if this is used in commercial applications but it has become fairly common in research cells. This is the same thing your touch screen is made out of and there is already work being done to find an alternative due to the cost and relatively low abundance.</p>
<p>Edit: When I say abundance I mean in the crust. It's late and I am tired.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The limiting resource for Si solar cells is probably the metal contact materials e.g. Silver, copper, aluminum. But yeah, we could make Al metallized Si solar cells for a long time without running out. Al is less conductive than the others though, so that can cause efficiency issues depending on architecture. Besides the semiconductor and metal, solar cells typically have tiny amounts of &quot;dopants&quot; and &quot;passivation&quot; but here also we are talking about fairly abundant elements like H, B, N, P, As, C and tiny tiny amounts. </p>
<p>The second most popular solar cell semiconductor after Si (for now) is cadmium  telluride (see the large US solar company, First Solar), whose elements, Cd and Te, would run out a bit earlier. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although you mention solar panels specifically, which implies panels of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics" target="_blank">photovoltaic</a> cells, the answer to your question about <strong>resources</strong> required for solar power is: <em>there are no limits.</em></p>
<p>The reason is, solar power can be produced by many other means than photovoltaic cells. One of the more common methods is to simply take a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabolic_trough" target="_blank">parabolic mirror</a> which works like a magnifying lens to focus the sun onto a black pipe full of water. As long as we can make pipes that are black and mirrors that are parabolic in shape, we will always have the resources available to trap solar energy.</p>
<p>Other methods include <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power" target="_blank">focusing the sun onto a tower</a> containing turbines like at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivanpah_Solar_Power_Facility" target="_blank">Ivanpah Solar Power Facility</a> in California, or focusing the sun onto a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar-powered_Stirling_engine" target="_blank">Stiriling engine</a>, which is a mechanical reciporicating engine that requires only an external heat source to run and produces zero emissions.</p>
<p>So, as others have explained, photovoltaic solar panels have no practical limits on abundance of materials required to produced them, but even if there were practical limits, there are plenty of other methods of collecting solar energy that are simple to build and require no special materials made out of refined silicon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Solar manufacturing tech here. The cells are made of silicon nitrate and aluminum, mostly. The interconnect ribbons are copper, coated with some alloy that won't oxidize (this can be changed to a different alloy if we run out of the current formula's constituent elements).</p>
<p>The majority of the weight of a panel comes from the protective glass, which is easy enough to make. We could make more panels than the planet could utilize before running out of glass-making materials.</p>
<p>The frames could be made out of something else if we ran out of aluminum. If we run out of ethylene vinyl acetate for the binding inner layer, we could use something else. There are plenty of materials that could work for the backsheet and the exterior of the junction box.</p>
<p>The copper in the ribbons and junction box will probably become the first element to become an issue in this hypothetical scenario. But even then, that won't be for millions of years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most solar panels are quoted at having a lifespan of approximately 20 years.  This is because even once the cells are encapsulated, they will still oxidise at a very slow rate.  The oxidisation causes the efficiency to be reduced.  After 20 years (unless they have been damaged) they will still produce electricity, but only about 85% of what they were producing when new.  This is not able to be repaired, but requires the panels to be replaced (if the owners want to bring the efficiency back up).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
