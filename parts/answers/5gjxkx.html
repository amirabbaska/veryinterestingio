		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR</strong> It's because animators used single background images that were highly detailed, and then drew the actual animated things on clear plastic cels which were then changed out to create the illusion of movement. If you want to use/alter (animate) an object, it needs to be animated, which looks simpler than the background).</p>
<p>Old animations used cels, which are the non-digital version of what we call layers now. What you are seeing is basically a result of a technique used to optimize the speed and consistency of animation, while preserving traditional camera techniques and just making things look good.</p>
<p>The heart of animation is drawing a series of images that, when seen in order, create the illusion of movement (sorry if I'm getting too basic, but it helps to go back to fundamentals to really eli5 this). Imagine an animation of a bouncing ball, you would have a series of images of a circle going up and down, combined with the physical effects bouncing would have on a ball. For example, when a ball bounces it flattens a little bit, you wouldn't notice it in your day to day life but if you saw a ball that didn't flatten it would stand out to you (animators have learned through trial and error that you not only need to include these physical distortions but it looks weird if you don't exaggerate them as well--see the 30 rock clip dealing with the &quot;uncanny valley&quot;). Depending on the quality of the animation and how long it takes your ball to bounce you would be looking at somewhere around 12-100 individual drawings of the ball. </p>
<p>Now imagine that you want to add a floor for the ball to bounce on. Let's keep the animation really simple and just draw a single straight line, no tiles or cobbles or any fancy shit, just a straight line. Now you can draw 12-100 straight lines into your animation but you're going to notice something really quick. As weird as it looks when a ball doesn't distort at all, it looks just as weird when the floor <em>does.</em> That is to say, if you want your floor to look natural that straight line really has to stay <em>exactly the same</em> in all of your 12-100 drawings. That's obviously really hard to do. Or you can do what animators figured out about 100 years ago and draw your 12-100 ball images on clear plastic, then draw one single straight line on another piece of clear plastic, put it under the ball drawings, and <em>voila</em>, line stays the same every time <em>and</em> you've drastically reduced your workload.</p>
<p>Here's the cool thing though, now that you're dedicated to have one background image that never changes you can make it a lot more complicated, you can add cobblestones, bushes and trees in the background, whatever, you only have to draw it once so you can really go nuts. </p>
<p>You have to dip back into film history to explain the next step. Back in the old days cameras were shit, they need a <em>ton</em> of light to pick up any kind of image and had a real hard time picking up distant objects. As a result film-makers figured out that if you want to film something happening in front of Mt. Fuji at sunrise, it's going to look <em>a lot</em> more real if you just paint a really big nice painting (called a matte painting) of Mt. Fuji at sunrise and have your actors walk around in front of it. The cameras just couldn't pick up the mountain at low-lighting (like sunrise) at all (wonder why we have all those big warehouses full of movie sets? lots of matte paintings live in there).</p>
<p>Thus the glorious age of the matte painter. These guys did nothing but paint super-detailed, beautiful, hyper-realistic, and giant paintings of backgrounds, sets, castles, buildings, trees, skies, whatever. This was going on around the same time as animation was getting going and animators figured out that they could do the same thing with their background images, paint beautiful real looking places and have the actual animations just sit on top of them. And not only did it look nicer, but it looked more <em>real.</em> There's some trick of the human mind where we think of objects as having lines even though they don't (have you looked at a pencil drawing? Noticed how they can look recognizably like people? Do you know any people that are flat white with black lines for features?), the problem is this doesn't really extend to backgrounds, why? cause we don't focus on those in the same way that we focus on people, objects, animals, etc, so while you can have cartoony backgrounds it just doesn't look as good as matte painted backgrounds. Once animators started to play around with matte painting they found that having a realistic background made the whole animation look more real, even if the animation on top was cartoonish. </p>
<p>The problem is you can't animate matte paintings, they are too detailed, have way too much color gradation going on, and are just too big. So they settled into the habit of hyper-detailed backgrounds with simpler cartoonish looking animations on top up until digital art came around and opened the doors on doing some more complex stuff.</p>
<p>Ok, now that I've explained everything in a super-long comment the answer to your question is really simple. If you're going to have a house with a cookie jar in it, you just matte paint the cookie jar in the house, but if you want to have your animated character pick up the cookie jar then at some point that jar is going to have to transition from a highly detailed matte painting to a simple cartoonish looking animation (like I said, you can't animate matte). Some animators made the transition from matte to cartoon as the character touched the object, but most settled on just putting the object in the scene as a cartoon to begin with; partly because of taste, but mostly avoiding weirdness. Yes the audience can see that the cartoon cookie jar doesn't fit with all the matte painted things on the shelf, and they can guess that it's going to be used at some point, but it tends to be less visually jarring for us to deal with that small bit of breaking the fourth wall than it is for our minds to grapple with an object suddenly transmuting from highly detailed to cartoony. </p>
<p>FYI this is still the basic template for hand drawn animation today, youtube an anime clip and you will see that the people and objects being used are line-drawn and tend to have 2-3 different colors to indicate shadows on the people/objects, called cel shading. The background, on the other hand, won't have any line work, and will have <a href="https://40.media.tumblr.com/e372b61adb77f2adf2601b2e97e2a7fa/tumblr_inline_nqtgw1fo3n1ri0s9d_540.jpg" target="_blank">diffuse shading instead of cel shading</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is due to cell animation that relies heavily on painted backgrounds as filler for relatively cheap in comparison animation. Moving objects are printed or drawn onto transparent layers that can be interchanged, while  a background stays the same. It takes much longer to paint several portraits with an object moving rather than smaller animation handed to other people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright, so when watching a cartoon, you can say that there are two kinds of drawings on the screen: All that is going to move, and all that is not going to move. There's the characters, whatever they're interacting with, and then, there's the backgrounds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The backgrounds are drawn as images of their own. This is what background artists does. It's basically like a regular painting. This is forests, rooms, cities, etc. </p>
<p><a href="https://one1more2time3.files.wordpress.com/2009/05/cind092pan-a.jpg" target="_blank">Example</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The characters are then drawn on blank pieces of paper by themselves, later to be put on top of the background. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.disneyclips.com/freestuff/imagesbsgm4/cinderella-wallpaper2.jpg" target="_blank">Example</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when you see something that is vastly different color from the rest, it's because it had to be drawn separately from the background, and sometimes it's hard to get things to match - especially when you're on a strict budget and deadline, which most animated studios were back in the day. The difference is, animators have just gotten a lot better at blending the backgrounds with the foregrounds.</p>
<p>Check out this scene from Disney's &quot;Sword in the Stone&quot;: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTuKRovG5P0" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTuKRovG5P0</a> </p>
<p>Everything that moves - every splash of water, every little rock, that really big rock - was drawn along the characters, <em>on top</em> of the backgrounds. Everything that does not move, like the branch Arthur and Merlin jumps on top of at 0:22, is part of the background. The animators are just being really clever there.</p>
<p>In short, It's like having two layers, and then putting them atop of each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simplest possible explanation: it's easier to paint a detailed still image than a detailed animation. If an object is going to move, the animators won't waste time making it as detailed as the static background image, because they're just gonna have to draw it again for the next few frames. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because animated items in the scene were drawn separately from the background items.  Then, the two drawings were manually composited together (i.e. laid on top of each other) and photographed.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/M2ORkIrHUbg?t=3m42s" target="_blank">Here is a video of the technique.</a></p>
<p>As technology improved, the images could be digitally composited and the hue and lighting of each element could be tweaked to more closely match each other, so it wasn't so noticeable that they were actually separate elements.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
