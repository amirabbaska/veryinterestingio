<li>
<p>Global ozone and ozone in the Arctic and Antarctic is no longer decreasing, but is not yet increasing.</p>
</li>
<li>The ozone layer outside the Polar Regions is projected to recover to its pre-1980 levels some time before the middle of this century. The recovery might be accelerated by greenhouse gas-induced cooling of the upper stratosphere.</li>
<li>The ozone hole over the Antarctic is expected to recover much later.</li>
<li>The impact of the Antarctic ozone hole on surface climate is becoming evident in surface temperature and wind patterns.</li>
<li>At mid-latitudes, surface ultraviolet radiation has been about constant over the last decade.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Montreal protocol is an international agreement that was passed, heavily regulating the use of ozone depleting chemicals. The most familiar effect was changing the propellants you can use in aerosol cans among many other things. </p>

<p>Since then, the hole in the ozone layer has recovered and the problem is getting better. The world identified the problem and took action to fix it. Hard to imagine that happening now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Montreal Protocol banned the use of CFCs in the 80s. CFCs essentially knocked off the third O in O3 off, cutting down the ozone layer. The CFCs still have a decently long residence time, meaning they have not fully degraded out of the Ozone layer a few decades after their emissions were significantly slashed, to being effectively zero. </p>
<p>Now the growth of the Ozone hole is ceased and has started to regrow, although it does change seasonally. It may be completely covered up as soon as the end of the century. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time to shine.</p>
<p>Chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) were created by the terribly unfortunate Thomas Midgley Jr to replace dangerous gases used in refrigeration that killed lots of people in accidents. (Midgley also probably killed more people than Hitler and Stalin combined by putting lead into gasoline. This has resulted in unprecedented levels of early death and natal malformation around the world).</p>
<p>Eventually someone figured out that CFCs were depleting the Ozone layer (that stops cosmic rays from the sun destroying all life on Earth - cf. Venus) at a level that makes Carbon Dioxide look like a schoolkid - 70 000 to 1 by volume) and it was banned in 1973. It took a while for it to get through to the less scrupulous manufacturers in places like China, but it seems to be working.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, CFCs have a productive life of about 100 years, so, until 2073, they'll keep wrecking our atmosphere on a level that dwarfs anything related to carbon. If you want to be famous for doing good works, invent something that can scrub CFCs from the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
