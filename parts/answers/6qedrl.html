		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of spiders spin test webs, just a few strings in several locations and check on them later to see which one roughed it out better. </p>
<p>Now, spiders have several sensory organs that determine a location's appropriateness based on humidity, heat, cold, wind, light, etc., but sometimes a spot is just not good for non-environmental reasons. So many spiders set up individual strings here and there, and the one that lasts the longest or remains intact the most will later be used.        </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spider guy here.. yes spiders do tend to scout out multiple locations before spinning up their webs. But not in the way that you might think. Spiders don't actually have to go to the location to scout. Using their senses (which are extraordinary!) they can discover the most wonderful locales to spin it up!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
