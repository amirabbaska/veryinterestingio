		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This doesn't address the philosophical perception of beauty, but primates' ability to see them in three colors is special, in the world of mammals:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, most mammals possess dichromatic vision, corresponding to protanopia redâ€“green color blindness. They can thus see violet, blue, green and yellow light, but cannot see ultraviolet, and deep red light.[4][5] This was probably a feature of the first mammalian ancestors, which were likely small, nocturnal, and burrowing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Primates have re-developed trichromatic color vision since that time, by the mechanism of gene duplication, being under unusually high evolutionary pressure to develop color vision better than the mammalian standard. Ability to perceive red[7] and orange hues allows tree-dwelling primates to discern them from green. This is particularly important for primates in the detection of red and orange fruit, as well as nutrient-rich new foliage, in which the red and orange carotenoids have not yet been masked by chlorophyll.</p>

<p>Being able to see <em>red</em> made ripe fruits stand out visibly from unripened fruit, and from the green background foliage. I'm sure this influences our ability to appreciate flowers and their vivid contrast to <em>green.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our sense of smell and our sense of taste are very connected. </p>
<p>When food has spoiled, the aromas given off by bacterial or other activity are apparent to us... isovaleric acid with rancid milk, butyric acid which smells like vomit or bile, aromatic indoles that smell like poop or manure, or the vinegar of acetic acid. We have built in aversion to these smells due to evolutionary pressures and the back of our head &quot;knowing&quot; these are linked with nasty biological processes such as spoiled food or rotten meat. </p>
<p>When a fruit, or an orange, smells sweet and tasty, we're smelling the oils of the plan and other aromas. Many flowers that you might not think of as edible, actually are (even dandelion weeds can and are made into a tea, and lavender has culinary uses for instance). Fruits, too, are often &quot;flowers&quot;, pear trees have flowers and many fruits are &quot;flowering fruits&quot;. So there are evolutionary reasons for a human to smell the flower and be sure they aren't smelling something weird like acetic acid (meaning that maybe some berries have gotten gross and fermented). Cooking flowers in the west isn't done so much these days, but before artificial flavors and other ways of cooking, it was a lot more prevalent, but you still see this in people making herbal teas for example; the chemicals given off are pleasant, sometimes linked to chemical signals that mean &quot;food&quot; and other complex flavors (bitter, after all, is a flavor too). </p>
<p>Someone in the comments mentioned corpse flowers and how their rotting smell attracts insects like flies, etc.; this is of course the opposite extreme where the flower is releasing isovaleric acid and other compounds into the air; flies which WANT to find and smell rotting corpses think &quot;Oh hell yes, some corpses over there&quot; and have an evolutionary impulse to go over there.</p>
<p>Edit: People keep bringing up roses as an example of &quot;useless&quot; flowers not linked to evolutionary pressures...</p>
<p>Umm, hello? Rosewater in cooking anyone? Turkish delight? Roses have TONS of culinary uses, and it's linked to the aromatic compounds they release that, like many of the plants that we cultivate for straightforward culinary purposes, both activate our sense of smell and taste (and most importantly, do not activate any instinctive aversion).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi- I am a master florist and I teach floral design in a formal curriculum. </p>
<p>Flowers and greenery were initially introduced as a ceremonial reward. A crown of greenery, for instance was given to an athlete for completing a monumental task which reflected his prowess. </p>
<p>Floral crowns were bestowed on maidens to accentuate and highlight their youth during courting ceremonies. </p>
<p>Bouquets were carried by brides to mask any unpleasant smells when hygiene was not important, and also to give the bride something to hold on to. Some have noted that this may represent a phallic meaning, but it was probably just to keep her from calm and to keep her hands still. </p>
<p>Funeral flowers also masked any smells and also deflected from staring at a corpse, i.e. Lighten the mood. </p>
<p>Large arrangements were displayed to indicate wealth. </p>
<p>The Victorian era introduced giving flowers as a gift as the flowers had different meanings. For instance, roses for love, hydrangea for gratitude, baby's breath for innocence...</p>
<p>These all evolved into a cryptological messaging system that delivered a message in a discrete way, gentile way. </p>
<p>That being said, the floral business is dying. People see flowers as a ridiculous expenditure but I'm really trying hard on my end to share my skills and knowledge with anyone who is interested. </p>
<p>Great question, by the way! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a heavy element of culture in this. While the appreciation of flowers is widespread around the globe, there are many societies in which flowers have been viewed with indifference or even disapproval (floral decorations have never been especially important in West African cultures, for example: sub-Saharan art has routinely depicted animals and people, but rarely flowers).</p>
<p>In general, the kind of societies in which an appreciation of flowers is mostly likely to develop are ones that are urbanized and have economic surpluses. Flowers are appreciated <em>precisely because</em> they are wasteful and don't have any practical use as foods; they symbolize the abundance of a wealthy society. </p>
<p>Part of the beauty of flowers lies in the physiological response their colours and shapes generate; but it's also that the cultivation of flowers, and the time and attention necessary to make floral decorations, denotes luxury and leisure - and these are qualities that have positive associations for human beings.</p>
<p>(I've loosely drawn from <em>The Culture of Flowers</em> by anthropologist Jack Goody for this answer.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Attraction to these particular &quot;useless&quot;  flowers e.g. Roses,  is highly unlikely to have been specifically driven by natural selection. </p>
<p>A few people here are getting towards a potentially correct idea from an evolutionary perspective which is our sense organs and brains are attracted to things like flowers for potentially adaptive reasons. </p>
<p>Not every trait we have is driven by natural selection. Some of our traits are driven by natural selection because they offered a fitness advantage and were selected for. Other traits we just have because they didn't cause a disadvantage and so they happened to spread through the population by chance even though they could have been lost. Other traits are things which weren't selected for but come with other trains which are adapted. E. G. Red blood itself isn't adaptive because of the colour red but is a product of having our haemoglobin which is adaptive. These were coined &quot;evolutionary spandrels&quot; by Gould and Lewontonin. </p>
<p>It's likely were attracted to useless flowers like roses for a sort of spandrel reason but it could also just be a we are because of chance variation which wasn't harmful. </p>
<p>It's easy to form a&quot; just so story&quot; which comes up with an explanation for traits like this in an evolutionary framework, but you can't prove or disprove them so be careful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
