		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not unique to the UK.</p>
<p>Other countries have or had the same sort of thing. It just evolved differently in many places. In the UK what stands out is that you have so many tabloids competing with each other egging each other on and raising the bar about what is considered acceptable because everyone else is doing it.</p>
<p>For comparison in Germany you have the &quot;Bild&quot; newspaper which is the countries biggest selling newspaper and largely a print repository of exaggerations, rumors, lies and unethical journalism in general. (One popular band called them out in lyrics of one of their songs as consisting only of &quot;fear, hate, tits and the weather&quot; and a novel about a woman's life being ruined by a Bild reporter and subsequently murdering him is required reading in many German classes in school.)</p>
<p>In the US the height of this form of journalism was when the tabloids in New York started the Spanish American war based mostly on lies and manipulations by yellow journalism. One of the main culprits later Joseph Pulitzer ended up regretting his behavior so much that in his will he left his fortune to help make better journalist though education and though creating a prize in his name that rewards the exact opposite behavior of what made him rich.</p>
<p>In the UK the tabloids just managed to hold on in numbers and continue to make the world a worse place through their lies and unethical behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>British tabloids have a history of being 'awful' and unethical, best illustrated by the Rupert Murdoch's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal" target="_blank">News International phone hacking  scandal</a>.  Celebrities, the Royals, deceased soldiers, bombing victims and 13 year old murder victim, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murder_of_Milly_Dowler#Voicemail_tampering_investigation" target="_blank">Milly Dowler</a> all had their phones hacked.</p>
<p>Scotland Yard had discovered Dowler's voicemail had been accessed by journalists working for the News of the World and the newspaper's private investigator Glenn Mulcaire. The Guardian also reported that, during the police investigation into that newspaper's phone hacking activities, detectives discovered that journalists had deleted some messages—potential evidence—in Dowler's voicemail box because it was full, in order to free up space for new messages, to which they could listen. The deletions after Dowler was missing led family and friends to think that Milly was still alive</p>
<p>Edit: The Sun newspaper is known as 'the scum of the earth' in the UK for good reason.  News report from today <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jun/16/sun-journalist-grenfell-tower-victim-hospital" target="_blank">Sun journalist 'impersonated Grenfell Tower victim's friend at hospital'</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a child I grew up being told to read all of them and choose the one I agree with the most or felt was 'most true'. </p>
<p>I always found this incredible screwed up! Surely they should all be TRUE at least?</p>
<p>They're essentially paper representations of various demographics utilising clickbait style techniques to drag their 'readers' in. They're VERY opinion based and the government doesn't hold journalism to high scrutiny as they are notorious for gagging orders/public enquiries they can control the release of information over. The 'newspapers' pander to the parties they believe they will have the most success selling too. Morality and good journalism is few and far between, in the U.K. And the world. </p>
<p>E.g. The Daily Mail is notorious for pandering to the audience that has no idea what life is like for MOST people so they get away with saying any of shit because their readers aren't commonly known to be deep thinking, research driven customers. They are often face value readers, much like The S*n. Both have countless lawsuits against them in response to false news stories. </p>
<p>The Guardian, on the other hand, appeals to mostly Liberal viewed readers, the social justice readers. However, aside from a few reporters, they don't really push the boundaries very far anymore or cause much debate. </p>
<p>Essentially they've become 'safe' if their market so don't do any journalism anymore. </p>
<p>They do mix it up a bit for the sake of meeting various journalistic standards but any opinions they print for 'balance' are buried in sections you'd struggle to spot them in anyway. </p>
<p>TL;DR: They pander to different political demographics using sensationalist tricks to guarantee clicks/sales; like if buzzfeed was printed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The UK tabloids are basically like the US gossip rags, but unlike the US, they have the veneer of a &quot;serious&quot; paper. Everyone knows the National Enquirer or Perez Hilton's gutter rags for what they are....they are trash, but at least they're pretty honest about it. Whereas the UK tabloids at least make the pretence of being &quot;proper&quot; news sources. </p>
<p>So they are so awful because they're basically gutter gossip rubbish, masquerading as genuine, legitimate news.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
