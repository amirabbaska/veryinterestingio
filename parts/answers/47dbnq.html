		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, it doesn't take years per se to make a movie. But there can be some delays - perhaps principal shooting only takes 2 months, but you have to wait 3 months for your lead actor to be available. </p>
<p>Shows like GoT get benefits over movies since the sets are all pre-built (past the 1st season) - actors have contracts stating they need to be available during a predictable time schedule if the show is renewed for the next season.  GoT in particular also gets to benefit from the fact there are several plot lines that are independant - the Wall stuff, the Khalesi plot, the Westeros stuff, can all film in parallel. Not possible with a movie, where your lead actors can't be in two places at once.</p>
<p>edit: ok Khaleesi is a title, I get it.</p>

<p>as numerous have said (thanks), a lot of the upfront preproduction and 'selling' of the show (aka the development hell) is out of the way before the pilot gets shot. Long running series don't have to sell the production each season - just point to a rabid fanbase clamouring for more. Each movie has to churn through what could be years of this stuff. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/47dbnq/eli5_how_come_it_takes_years_to_make_a_2_hour/d0chhjg" target="_blank">Production stuff</a></p>

But people will sit through 10 1 hr episodes no problem. So writing, timing and storytelling can be radically different.</a></li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ELI5 answer is they often don't, you're just not aware of TV production the way you are aware of film.</p>
<p>The longer version:</p>
<p>TV shows take years to make as well (think about how long you've known there will be a <em>Westworld</em> and we're still waiting 2 years later for both <em>Luke Cage</em> and <em>Iron Fist</em>), but the general public is much less aware of shows than movies. </p>
<p><em>Game of Thrones</em> took <strong><em>4 years</em></strong> to bring to the small screen. To produce those 10 episodes each year they are spread over several countries (mainly Ireland, Croatia and Malta) and have to use 3 main units all shooting simultaneously. Even within those units there are different crews working on different episodes depending on the director (this is very unique for television, where typically a crew works on a complete episode then moves on to the next one). </p>
<p>Because of the extensive CGI required, it takes months to finish those episodes, far longer than typical TV shows. Season one was shot beginning at the end of July, 2010. The last episode aired on June 19th, 2011). That is literally a film-like schedule.</p>
<p>But the single biggest difference between TV and film is what typically defines them: TV is about dialogue, movies spectacle. It might only take 2 days max to film a scene of Tyrion having a small council meeting that lasts 10 minutes, but an action sequence can take weeks to finish. Plus, a lot of that spectacle comes from unique sets that have to be built on soundstages or whole city blocks outside (much of NYC in the first <strong><em>Spider-Man</em></strong> film was actually an abandoned rocket-fuel facility for the Apollo program in Downey, CA).</p>
<p>And because of that spectacle, films are very expensive. GoT might be one of the priciest shows on TV (over $8M per episode now), but everything costs more of films starting with what the crew gets paid. Big budget films now are typically $150M+ (BvS's final budget will probably be close to $300M) and when a studio spends that kind of money they often take a long time deciding if the financial risk is worth it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former TV Development guy here.  So many reasons, I'll just separate them by category:</p>
<p><strong>1) Scheduling</strong></p>
<p>TV contracts tend toward exclusivity... This means that the cast and crew are contractually beholden to their showrunner's scheduling.  Any other projects need to be moved around the show each contractor is exclusive to.  </p>
<p>Movies don't have this, so schedules can be incredibly difficult to put together.  The period between the greenlight and actual production can be years, depending on the schedules of the cast and crew attached.</p>
<p>Also, TV shows have a much more rigid schedule to meet.  They don't stop shooting, writing, editing, etc because it's done to their satisfaction.  They stop because it's their deadline.</p>
<p><strong>2) Writing</strong></p>
<p>Film scripts don't normally roundtable their stories.  This means fewer writers working on the story's conception, longer time between drafts, more notes between more parties, etc.  </p>
<p>Development hell is what it's called, and it's frequently the cause of long delays between an announcement and release.  I've personally seen interest in my own pilot scripts fall victim to Development Hell.</p>
<p>TV shows do go through this in the pilot phase, but by the end of the pilot phase, a picked-up show (one appearing on television) has a Show Bible.</p>
<p>Show Bibles are basic breakdowns of each episode's structure, character dynamics, backstory, common themes, etc.  By the time a show is picked up, a Bible already exists to give writers a guideline to go by.  Especially-so with Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>With film, no such thing exists.  The writers are throwing their only attempt at these characters on the screen in a film.  </p>
<p><strong>3) Advertising and Liability</strong></p>
<p>Somebody has to pay for the movie and the show, respectively.  That person, or people, need to come back with a return on investment.</p>
<p>Shows get a chance to build up an audience, and to also advertise other products.  If a show fails, a chunk of the liability of the show is carried by advertisers.  So from a network standpoint, there's a lot less risk than you'd see in a feature film.  And if the show does really well, they can make a fortune selling into syndication.  If the show fails, at least the cost is somewhat offset by selling rights.</p>
<p>With a feature film, it's a one-shot deal.  Advertisement is product placement or nothing, and product placement isn't really that big a factor in most film budgets.  So the people who pay for film production need a big return on a single story.  That means higher budgets to ensure the right talent is attracted and they have the right resources, but it also means market research, focus groups, studio interference, etc.  </p>
<p>That's also why a failed film isn't likely to get a buyer for its rights.

All of this adds up.  Add in complications that come with producing a single, longer piece of work as opposed to short-form with a pre-existing format. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a lot more that goes into making a movie than just shooting the scenes themselves.  There is pre production work (hiring actors, scouting locations, writing scripts) and post production work (editing the movie, sound effects, etc).</p>
<p>Movies have to do all of these steps before they are released and, generally, have to do each one every time they make a movie.  For a show like GoT, they don't have to hire the actors or scout locations before they start filming (they have all of those from previous seasons/episodes) and since the episodes are released weekly, they don't have to do all of the post work all at once (they can be working on editing episode 5 after episode 1 has already gone to air).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shooting a feature film <del>only takes 4-6 weeks typically</del> can be done in 4 to 6 weeks for mundane dramas and comedies, but big blockbusters and FX-heavy films can take more than twice as long to shoot. The rest of the two years is spent doing things like hiring a cast, crew, and writers, building sets, location scouting. It probably did take two years from when HBO decided to do GoT until the release of the first episode.  But by then, they had gotten all that pre-production out of the way. Now they use the same cast, crew, and sets from week to week, and they spend less time fine-tuning the actors' performances because they have a lot more material to churn out than a feature film does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
