		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a difference between singing in tune and sounding good. </p>
<p>Singing in tune is a matter of practice. For some people it seems natural, because they've been listening to music and singing since they were a toddler. Practicing unintentionally.
Practically anyone can learn to sing in tune given enough practice. </p>
<p>Sounding good is a mixture of things as mentioned in other posts here. People can be trained in styles of singing (see: opera) but ultimately the subtleties of their sound come down to physiological factors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily singing. Singing requires precise vocal and respiratory control and is in large part due to training.</p>
<p>However, pitch is something different, and quite fascinating. The phenomenon of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_pitch" target="_blank">'absolute pitch'</a> (or 'perfect pitch') is one whereby the individual can instantly identify any note sounded, and often recreate it vocally.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11707095" target="_blank">A study in 2001</a> (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.420.7784&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">full text</a>) found that a region of the brain called the planum temporale is different in those with absolute pitch. The planum temporale is an interesting region in the brain -- it's one of the few areas which is asymmetrical from the left side to the right side (in general, structures on one side of the brain are mirrored in size and location in the other). It's located in the region of our brain primarily responsible for understanding speech (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wernicke%27s_area" target="_blank">Wernicke's Area</a>), and is typically up to about 10 times larger in the left hemisphere than the right (especially in right-handed individuals, whereas the larger side is more random in left-handed individuals).</p>
<p>One of the most interesting roles of the PT (along with other aspects of Wernicke's area) is in [Prosody](<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics</a>), which simply put is the emotional content of speech. Someone with damage to the right hemisphere's PT may have impaired prosody -- they can understand the semantic content of speech, but may be <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7316838" target="_blank">impaired</a> in their ability to interpret nuance, subtlety, sarcasm, etc.</p>
<p>How are the two linked? Well, interestingly, when you throw someone in an MRI and check which bits of their brain are &quot;lighting up&quot; when they listen to speech, you predominantly get the left hemisphere. When you have them listen to music, you get the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15709930" target="_blank">right hemisphere</a>. This is evident even in <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/107/10/4758.full" target="_blank">newborns</a>. The idea seems to be that our ability to interpret emotional valence in speech and our understanding and appreciation of music are linked.</p>
<p>Back to the neurobiology of absolute pitch, though. The asymmetry is interesting in one particular aspect -- it appears to be the result of &quot;pruning&quot;. Remember, musicians with absolute pitch tend to have PTs that are <em>more</em> asymmetrical than others. That is, their left PT is even bigger than normal compared to their right PT. It isn't due to an increase in the size of their left PT, but rather a reduction in the right. These results, in general, are fascinating but not particularly well replicated (some studies confirm the difference in PT asymmetry, others find it only between musicians and non-musicians). Regardless, there's a lot of evidence for <a href="http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2013/12/04/cercor.bht334.full" target="_blank">differences in brain anatomy</a> between those with absolute pitch and those without, suggesting that there is a strong physiological basis for at least some aspects of musical talent.</p>
<p>On a final note, I should mention that the above deals almost entirely with the ability to hear music, rather than produce it vocally. Understanding speech and producing it are two tasks which are handled by almost completely separate brain regions, and there's little overlap. The same is very likely true of something like pitch, and to some extent then, vocal singing ability.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sound of your voice comes down to the shape of your vocal cords and the movements your muscles make when altering them; Singing in tune comes down to practicing the matching of what you hear with what you produce (which depends on the quality of your brain, ultimately, and the decisions you make).</p>
<p>Not everyone is born with a great sounding voice, but everyone can sing in tune if they practice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>/u/seamustheseagull is definitely right in saying that the mechanics of using your voice to match pitch is something that can be taught to anyone. How quickly you pick it up seems to largely depend on how musical you have been your whole life. I come from a very musical family. My parents sang with me as a kid a lot, my mother played the piano, my father the guitar, etc. I have been on stage singing since I was a child. So, for me, it's never been an issue.</p>
<p>But I have watched many, many people come through my fiance's voice studio (I generally sit in the living room playing video games like an oaf). Many come in unable to match pitch at all (meaning, if I play a note on the piano, they cannot for the life of them make that pitch with their voice). After 6 months - 1 year of training, all of them come out sounding like singers. Now they may not be broadway quality yet, but Broadway singers spend literally their whole lives studying and practicing to sound the way they sound.</p>
<p>To answer your question more directly, yes, there are definitely physiological aspects that make a person sound the way they sound, but that has more to do with vocal range and placement than 'sounding good'. It's also a matter of taste! What might sound good to one person, might not to another. Some people love Idina Menzel's voice, some people want to throw the mp3 player out the window when Wicked comes on. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
