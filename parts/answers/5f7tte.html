		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The psychological and physical (i.e. biological) aspects are interdependent: it's a combination of both. However, as in most psychological changes, they are a consequence of changes in the underlying neurobiology (this also implies that a behavioral change will effect changes on neurobiological function, leading to reinforced psychological changes). The establishment of neural connections between your gustatory cortex and limbic system is necessary for the acquisition of a taste. These are specific for the flavor of black coffee: a combination of mostly bitter flavors that get picked up by taste buds connected to nerves that normally carry information regarding noxious elements in the ingested food. The idea is that your brain will rewire the connections for the set of flavors associated to black coffee, likely by making the prefrontal cortex override the instinctive rejection of coffee's bitterness (the prefrontal cortex is the area of the brain where behavior and personality are controlled), thus promoting its association with pleasure circuits in the brain, usually dependent on serotoninergic neurotransmission. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tangentially related, but taste buds age over time, which can cause a shift in perception of foods.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Gustatory dysfunction may indeed be related to the normal ageing process. However, in many cases, what is perceived as a taste defect is truly a primary defect in olfaction. Other than smell dysfunction, the most frequent causes of taste dysfunction are prior upper respiratory infection, head injury, drug use, and idiopathic causes.</p>

<p>This has been attributed as the cause of baby boomers eating increasingly spicier foods.
