<p>In beer, N2 makes lots of little bubbles while CO2 makes fewer big bubbles.  And just like how fine silt feels smoother than rough sand in your fingers,  finer bubbles feel smoother in your mouth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few reasons. </p>
<p>For one, N2 doesn't really have good solubility in water, and tends to escape faster once the pressure is decreased. Therefore, your nitro beer is just a foamy beer with nitrogen bubbles. </p>
<p>On the contrary, CO2 tends to supersaturate very well (think a can of cola that you leave open, and an hour later it's still slowly bubbling) and bubbles come out slowly over time, unless there's a nucleation site (and/or salivary enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase in your saliva that converts carbonic acid to CO2 and water) that encourage it to bubble out. Therefore, once you drink a liquid supersaturated with CO2, bubbles form in all your nooks and crannies in your mouth (nucleation sites), and physically make that stinging sensation.</p>
<p>Of course, this is amplified by the fact that CO2 dissolves in water to a slightly acidic solution of carbonic acid, so your tongue also feels the acidity as the liquid hits your mouth. N2, being inert and neutral, does not give the same taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bubble size and nitrogen dissolution is only part of it!
Nitrogen, when dissolved in water, partially blocks the mechanism that causes certain molecules to activate bitter taste in the tongue. This is why Guinness tastes smooth and creamy despite using bitter roasted malted grain.
Also, nitro infused cold brew coffee is beginning to take off for the same reason. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nitrogen doesn’t stay in solution very well, it’s takes high pressures to get it to dissolve in a beer. When you pour a nitro beer the nitrogen comes out of solution and knocks the CO2 out of solution with it, essentially making the beer flat but with a nice creamy head.</p>
<p>In addition, soft drinks often have two or more times the amount of CO2 dissolved in solution compared to beer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's my take:</p>
<p>CO2 is very special. The gas dissolves in water, and acidifies the water. We humans seem to have the ability to not only sense the sourness of carbonated soda with our sour taste-receptors (like any other acid), but also sense the dissolved CO2 gas through special proteins also associated with our sour taste receptors (Chandrashekar et al. 2009). Nitrogen doesn't acidify the water and doesn't interact with our senses chemically.</p>
<p>It has also been shown that when bubbles are suppressed by drinking carbonated soda in a hyperbaric chamber, the soda still has a &quot;bite&quot; to it. So it was concluded that it is in fact the carbonic acid that plays a dominant part in the sensation of &quot;fizzyness&quot;, although bubbles are a second component that can influence the sensation (Wise et al. 2013).</p>
<p>From this I'd say bubbles and their sizes are a very minor component.</p>
