		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The change of the earths orbit would be detectable, but small.  Nobody would be able to detect by direct observation (i.e. noticing season oddness, or ‘by eye’).  But careful observation would reveal that the orbit is no longer ‘perturbated’ (tiny adjustments from a perfect ellipse).  </p>
<p>The orbit of the moon would also change a small amount.  Lunar theory is the math that is used to calculate the orbit of the moon and, to be accurate, has to take a LOT of things into account.  It has a section called “the great Venus term” which accounts for the minuscule difference Venus makes in the lunar orbit.  Again, nobody would notice by-eye, but if you cared about EXACTLY where the moon would be in 20 years (for tides predictions, etc), those formula would have to updated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would be far more worried about the moons of the outer planets in such a situation. The speed that Jupiter's inner moons orbit Jupiter are far greater than the speed that Jupiter orbits around the Sun. Jupiter as a whole is orbiting at a relatively stately pace, while its inner moons are tightly bound to it and zipping around rapidly.</p>
<p>If you pop Jupiter out of existence, those moons are going to go flying off in all directions. They will not remain bound to each other. Even worse, they won't just all stay in the general vicinity of Jupiter's former orbit. Depending on where in their orbits they're released, they'll go flying off in all sorts of directions.</p>
<p>So we'll now have to deal with all sorts of large and small bodies in highly elliptical orbits. Many of these will likely pass through the inner solar system. This is going to cause...problems...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>so, one way of approaching this would be to compare what we know about solar systems with one planet, and ones with many planets. In order for earth's orbit to be changed by the planets disappearing there must be some differences in its orbit between these two cases.</p>
<p>-basic physics: it's understood that a single planet orbiting a star is stable indefinitely (orbital distance will not be changed. the planet will not fly off into space, or crash into the sun eventually).</p>
<p>-multi-planet solar systems have also been observed to be stable IRL. </p>
<p>there are two possibilities that could explain the stability of multiplanet solarsystems:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>additional planets have no net overall effect on the orbital distance of other planets</p>
</li>
<li>planets in the same solar system do affect each other's orbital distances, but the right combination of planets will balance each other out leading to a stable solar system.</li>
</ol>
<p>case 1 seems more likely, but is there a mechanism that accounts for this?</p>
<p>imagine you are on Jupiter watching the earth orbit the sun there are two points where the sun and the earth are in alignment, when the earth passes in front of the sun, and when the earth hides behind the sun. These points separate the earth's orbit into two halves, one where Jupiter is accelerating earth prograde, and one where it is accelerating the earth retrograde. Since these two halves are symmetric the earth's orbit does not change overall. (NOTE: this is somewhat simplified)</p>
<p>So removing the other planets would remove these slight perturbations that introduce some variability in the earth's orbital distance, but this will not change the orbit in a profound way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The different planets <em>do</em> cause a little wobble in Earth's orbit, depending on their position relative to the Earth and the Sun.</p>
<p>But, the real factor of how close the Earth is to the sun is its velocity. So, if you could by magic &quot;push&quot; the Earth a million miles closer to the Sun but it kept its same speed, after some oscillation, the Earth would eventually return to its current orbital.</p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the Earth's distance from the sun is always changing anyway because we are in an elliptical orbit, not a circular one.</p>
<p>I know none of this answers your actual question, but I thought it was information about orbital mechanics you'd find interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
