		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the Hawaiian Islands seem remote, there are many many island chains in the region. The polynesians slowly spread to most of them. They were renown explorers, and highly skilled navigators (for the time period). It's not as if they just cast off the mainland one day and went straight to Hawaii. <a href="http://www.politicalresources.net/oceania-map.gif" target="_blank">This illustration</a> should give you a better idea of how they were able to spread across Oceania. Growing populations and limited resources made it a necessity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question was asked a year or so ago, and was one of the most interesting threads I have ever read on Reddit. </p>
<p>Notably, I'm surprised no one has mentioned the main take away from that thread.</p>
<p>I'll recap to the best extent my my chemically abused memory can allow:</p>
<p>Land masses effect the flow of air, upwards and downwards etc. because of this, clouds consistently form in consistent patterns above and down wind of land masses.  In ancient times people (Polynesians In particular iirc?) could look at cloud patterns and map out land masses they had never in fact been to. They would draw maps of these islands, with out ever having been to, or seen, them in person. </p>
<p>These maps were handed down for generations, while the people waited for a storm or proper weather conditions to carry them by boat to these islands for the first time. </p>
<p>Mind blown. Maps to never before seen lands were drawn accurately and passed for hundreds of years, until some nob-typical winds allowed and they would take a leap of faith and push out. </p>
<p>I think I got the concept right. With some proper google use, you can probably find more information on this method. </p>
<p>That prior thread also mentioned the ability to see the reflection of distant lands when looking up at the bottom of an overcast cloud layer. </p>
<p>Edit:
This page has nothing to do with anything I just mentioned, but seems to answer this question precisely:</p>

<p>Maybe just ignore my entire original post and read this page. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Over the course of his life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_Heyerdahl" target="_blank">Thor Heyerdahl</a> made several sea crossings to prove that ancient people could have absolutely made trans-oceanic journeys using only ship made from tools and materials available to them at the time.</p>
<p>Very likely that on some similar voyages, islands would have been accidentally discovered and inhabited by these people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
