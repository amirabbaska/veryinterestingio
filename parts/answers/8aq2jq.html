		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My degree is engineering, not mathematics, but I know enough about math to <em>begin</em> to answer your question.</p>
<p>Sometimes a relationship is discovered because people recognize it's true for <em>some</em> numbers, and they then devote themselves to trying to prove (or disprove) that it's true for <em>all</em> numbers. (EDIT: &quot;Every number I try fits this rule&quot; isn't proof when you have an infinite set of numbers to try.) Here's an example.</p>
<p>The Pythagorean Theorem. Take a right triangle. Square the lengths of the two shortest sides, add those numbers together, and that sum will be the square of the longest side. It was probably known for a very long time in ancient history that this was true of <em>some</em> right triangles. A right triangle with sides of lengths 3, 4, 5. One with sides of lengths 5, 12, 13. But today we credit a Greek man named Pythagoras for proving that this relationship is true in <em>all</em> right triangles. And he did it by arranging and rearranging triangles into squares and rectangles and showing that the areas had to be equal no matter the lengths of the triangles' sides.</p>
<p>That's just one example. I'm sure there must have been lots of relationships that were discovered by accident in the thousands of years we have been using numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the type of formula, some may be based on experimental data along with theory, some may be purely theoretical and derived from things we already know to be true.</p>
<p>Take the quadratic formula for example:</p>
<p><em>x = (- b +/- sqrt(b^2 - 4ac))/2a</em></p>
<p>EDIT - Since the original post wasn't very clear, the quadratic equation can be derived directly from rearranging the general form of a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b and c are constants.</p>
<p>Using a technique called completing the square allows us to collect the x terms and create a generalised formula which is much more useful.</p>
<p>This is an example of mathematicians taking a known relationship and using techniques to create something more useful.</p>
<p>Other than this, formulae can be experimentally driven, with scientists using experimental data to confirm relationships between certain quantities, which can then be refined with theory down into a formula.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Formulas aren't magic. They're a way to communicate ideas the same as English language. The difference is that mathematical formulas enable you to describe precise relations between things, while natural languages, like English, are more suited to describing things like emotion, intention and such.</p>
<p>When you write down an equation, you're simply writing down an idea you have, in a precise manner. Formulating that takes some practice but not really that much. Understanding those ideas then is about as complex a task as understanding ideas others have, after you know how to read the language.</p>
<p>Finding ideas that work, which you can then communicate with formulas, is a much less precise art. You can have just a fun idea about how things are connected. Maybe you start from some known connection, and then use it as a base which you use figure out much more complex connections. Mathematics is essentially an art of studying connections concepts have, and this art is then codified into very precise and exact statements made using its language. The search for those ideas itself is pretty freeform, devoid of any particular structure. Some mathematicians say ideas just come to them in their sleep or something like that. Sometimes you know the end result you want to achieve. Sometimes you have some inspiration about some intermediary step and you just try to work backwards and forwards from that step to get the full story.</p>
<p>One thing I kinda want to highlight is that school mathematics relies heavily on reading what mathematical ideas others have had, and utilizing them, rather than doing any sort of mathematical innovation of your own. This happens for a good reason, as those nuggets you are taught have been perfected after centuries of hard work by the brightest minds of our species, and school kids can't really be expected to reinvent all that math. However, it muddies our understanding of what it is that mathematicians do as every formula just sort of appears with often little regard to how it came into being.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its more about a solution not so the formulas. They first come up with a problem (mostly abstract). Then they think about the problem often over several generations until some knows how to solve it. </p>
<p>The formula is just the step by step proof, that this is this cuz of that etc. -&gt; solved</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Much of it is building on examples, intuition and mechanisms.</p>
<p>For example, consider triangles on the surface of a ball (e.g. a flight round trip between three cities). Then the Pythagorean Theorem does not quite work anymore, angles don't quite add up anymore etc. . But for small triangles your triangle &quot;looks like&quot; a standard triangle, so your formula should look similar to what you know then. For large triangles it seems to depend on how big and how curved your ball is.
So your take-away is that it seems plausible that spherical triangles should satisfy some relationship and that it should involve some description of the ball not being flat (curvature). Next, you try several examples, come up with a formula and finally prove that it actually is correct. Along the way you figure out that this formula also works for more general surfaces (donuts, hyperboloids etc.). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
