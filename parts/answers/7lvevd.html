<p>The best experimental verification of this so far (as far as I know) is the temporal coincidence between gravitational waves and gamma rays from the recent neutron star merger event, which set limits on the difference in propagation speed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, it does (according to general relativity). There have been numerous observations. </p>
<p>The most recent and most accurate was from LIGO, when gravity waves were detected and correlated with a gamma ray burst (light waves) from a pair of neutron stars merging. The light waves and gravity waves traveled for 130 million years and arrived within a few seconds of each other.</p>
<p>Prior to that we were able to make observations by watching the orbits of pairs of pulsars decaying; the rate at which energy is lost is related to the speed of gravity.</p>
<p>So I would say that the theory (general relativity) proposes that gravity travels at the speed of light, and all observations/experiments so far are consistent with that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers were pretty good. Here's another way to think about it:</p>
<p>Instead of thinking of <em>c</em> as the &quot;speed of light&quot; or 3*10^8 meters per second, think of it as <em>the speed of massless things</em>. Anything without mass, be it electromagnetic radiation (light/photons), fields, etc. will propagate/travel at <em>c</em> in a vacuum.</p>
<p>Every force has a &quot;field&quot; (its range of influence) that covers an infinite distance. Typically, the force diminishes in strength the further you get from the center of the field; it's why you weigh marginally less on Mount Everest than you do in Death Valley. At an &quot;infinite distance&quot; from the center, the magnitude of the force would be 0. </p>
<p>Now, how could the range of influence of a force have mass? It clearly doesn't. Changes in a field propagate at <em>c</em> because fields have no mass.</p>
<p>It should have taken Obi-Wan a bit longer to sense a &quot;disturbance in the force&quot; ;).</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/7lvevd/does_the_force_of_gravity_travel_at_c/drpm0h8/" target="_blank">this comment</a> patches up my oversimplification of forces.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, or very much so - an experimental confirmation of this was recently made from the event of two neutron stars merging a month ago (announcement).  The neutron stars spiralled in to each other spinning around each other, radiating gravitional waves and eventually hitting each other/crashing/merging.</p>
<p>The gravitational waves demonstrated this as a chirp signal.  The crashing led to gamma-rays, x-rays, and optical signal.</p>
<p>The event was observed as gamma-rays by orbiting satellite telescopes a few seconds after the gravitational chirp - so it was pretty much coincident.  And this after both had travelled 130 million years at the speed of light.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By the way, Einstein himself asked the same question. So, not a bad question you have there :&gt;</p>
<p>He asked what if the sun vanished? Would all planets instantly spin off into space? Or would there be a delay as the information that the sun was no longer there with its gravitational pull traveled at the speed of light to the planets?</p>
<p>The answer was not known. But what made Einstein, Einstein, was he then figured it out! The planets would travel as if the sun was still there until the change reached them at the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
