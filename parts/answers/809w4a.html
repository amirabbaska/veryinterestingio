		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain has a finite amount of chemicals that make you feel good called &quot;neurotransmitters&quot; such as dopamine and serotonin. When you orgasm your brain gets flooded with a few different types and when you're done you have less of the chemicals available. They replete over time unless you've abused some really hard drugs and killed the neurons that produce them. Common antidepressants that work by altering these chemicals such as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) have many sexual side effects such as the inability to orgasm, genital numbness, and impotence. </p>
<p>Edit: Many people suffer from this condition to some degree but it can be minimized by exercising more and adopting a diet that provides more of the amino acid precursors that allow your brain to produce these neurotransmitters. Tyrosine is the amino acid precursor to dopamine and is found in foods like bananas and walnuts. Tryptophan is the precursor to serotonin and can be found in foods like eggs and fish. There is also a rare condition known as &quot;post orgasm illness syndrome&quot; which some believe to be rooted in the brain. Other believe it to be an allergic reaction to one's own semen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Do a google search and surf around, there are several perspectives, but the most fascinating to me is that the Greeks characterized this phenomenon and discussed it. Aka I don’t have a simple hard and fast answer for you, but that’s the name. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
