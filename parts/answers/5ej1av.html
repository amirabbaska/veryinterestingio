		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think one of the biggest impacts would be the alteration of water flow.</p>
<p>I don't think you could successfully build a wall down the middle of the Rio Grande river, which is the border, so the wall would have to be on the north side of that river, denying access to that water to all the animals north of the river. This would probably drive all the larger animals farther north in search of water and would flat out kill lots of them.</p>
<p>For permanent waterways that flow across the border, you're going to have to either divert them or create some sort of grate system. If you divert them, again, you're denying water resources to something.</p>
<p>In arid regions like this, there are a lot of ephemeral waterways that are dry 99% of the time, and full flood the other 1%. Altering these waterways would change the distribution of soil, sand and organic matter that is carried by these waterways.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't work on mammals, although I work in a conservation biology lab that mainly works on reptiles and amphibians. I hope someone more knowledgeable than I comes along, but till then, here's what I know:</p>
<p>A <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2009.01277.x/full" target="_blank">2009 study</a> looked at the potential impact of other animals like the ferruginous pygmy-owl and desert bighorn sheep, two conservation-dependent species. One thing this study pointed out that's really interesting is that a lot of the area that the current border fencing runs through along the Arizona-Sonora border is <em>not</em> developed. On the US side, it's federally managed, generally in line with modern conservation practices. </p>
<p>Ferruginous pygmy-owls are endangered in the US but seem to be doing better in Sonora, so habitat connectivity may be really important to them. The study found that they tend to fly pretty close to the ground. None of the animals observed in the study flew higher than 12m above the ground, and less than a quarter of their flights were above 4m. Their flight heights increased as vegetation height increased. They disperse as adults, even over mountains, but dispersal was 116 times slower in more disturbed areas. Dispersal success was 92x greater in less disturbed areas. Their lower flight path coupled with cleared vegetation would make it more difficult for them to deal with a border wall or fence. </p>
<p>Desert bighorn sheep populations are already pretty fragmented. The study linked above found that 9 populations would be disrupted by the fence (as it was proposed in 2009 - I don't know if it was built or how the plans changed).</p>
<p>Also, southern Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas are the <del>southern</del> northern edge of the jaguar's historic range, so we should expect them to be there. Interestingly enough, the only known jaguar in the US right now was first noticed by border patrol agents in Arizona (<a href="http://thewildlife.wbur.org/2016/02/09/el-jefe-the-uss-only-wild-jaguar-can-we-keep-him/" target="_blank">source</a>). He was spotted from a helicopter in 2011 (there hasn't been a female jaguar spotted in the US since one was shot in 1963). </p>
<p>Unfortunately large predators like the jaguar tend to have large home ranges, so habitat fragmentation presents a pretty serious problem for them. Habitat corridors are pretty critical for these animals, and have been identified as a key part of their conservation (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320710000030" target="_blank">source</a>). </p>
<p>I'll keep looking for more information. There's a lot of information out there on the effect of barriers like roads and fences, but these are the two things that came to mind that are specific to the US-Mexico border.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One thing it can do is cut off species who regularly cross the border so it would restrict their gene pool and possibly cause inbreeding.  It could also lead to the restricted populations developing into new species as well through speciation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
