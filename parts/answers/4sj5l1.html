		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> If you wanted to dig on Mars to reach a depth where the pressure would be 1 atmosphere, i.e. equivalent to sea level pressure on Earth, it would most likely be much too warm.</p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Consider the case of Death Valley on Earth. Since it lies below sea level, the atmospheric pressure there is actually greater than what's found at sea level, roughly <del>1.1</del> 1.01 atmospheres. Similarly, we could dig below the surface of Mars so that the weight of the overlying atmosphere would be the equivalent of 1 atmosphere.</p>
<p>We can calculate how deep a hole one must dig by using the &quot;scale height&quot; - this is the difference in altitude needed to produce a factor of e = 2.718x increase in pressure. In Mars' case, this is equal to 11.1 km.</p>
<p>Now, the pressure at the surface of Mars is a measly 0.006 atmospheres, while we want to go to 1 atmosphere. The number of scale heights we want to dig is then:</p>
<p>ln (1.0 / .006) = 5.12 scale heights</p>
<p>...which, for a 11.1 km scale height means we want to dig 5.12 * 11.1km = 56.8 km. Note that this is over 4 times deeper than the deepest hole ever dug on Earth, so this is already a pretty tough technological achievement.</p>
<p>Now, how warm would it be when we get there? For this, we need to consider the adiabatic lapse rate; this tells us how much the temperature drops as we ascend in the atmosphere, or similarly how much the temperature increases as we descend. (It's also for this reason that Death Valley has the highest temperatures recorded on Earth.)</p>
<p>In the case of Mars, the adiabatic lapse rate is 4.4K/km. In other words, for every kilometer we descend, the temperature increases by 4.4 K. </p>
<p>Thus by descending 56.8 km, we're increasing the temperature by 56.8 * 4.4 = 250K. Since Mars' average temperature is 223 K (= -50 C, -58 F), that means <strong>the final temperature at 1 atmosphere of pressure would be 473K (= 200 C, 391 F).</strong></p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Since a lot of people are asking:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is unrelated to whether Mars has a &quot;dead core&quot; or not. This temperature increase is <em>not</em> due to geothermal (or in this case, areothermal) energy. Rather, it's a simple consequence of taking the current atmosphere and compressing it adiabatically as it fills up our hole. A similar transformation would be suddenly opening the doors on a pressurized jet at 33,000 feet...the air would quickly expand to the thin ambient pressure and cool down in the process by 65^o - 98^o C, depending on how humid the air inside the airplane was.</p>
</li>
<li>You can't generate electricity from this temperature change. It seems counter-intuitive, but even though the temperature has increased, there's no extra energy added to the system - this is the definition of an adiabatic transformation.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been suggested we could use ancient <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_tube" target="_blank">lava tubes</a> for basing or colonisation purposes. As well as being easier than drilling, the Igneous rock should be semi-impermeable and tough as... well rock, so it can potentially hold a pressurised atmosphere and also provide protection from the significant radiation on Mars' (or the Moon's) surface. So yeah it's a very viable idea.</p>
<p>Here's a white paper on the topic:

<p>I mean, we don't know how deep they go.  As dar as i know, we've yet to utilize ground penetrating radar on Mars.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In theory sure, pressure and heat do tend to increase as more soil is mounted on top. However it would be almost as impractical as it overlooks the fact that Mars atmosphere itself is highly inhospitable containing very high concentrations of carbon dioxide and very low levels of oxygen. As such an airtight artificial environment would need to be made anyway to house earthen life, so the problems of pressure and temperature merely become a sort of small side issue addressed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Not sure if that answers what you were wondering :) lmk</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Building an airtight container and adding air would be easier than digging really deep.  If you want radiation shielding, you can throw dirt on top of the building.  We could dig down a few feet and connect buildings with underground tunnels.  Sidewalks would also have to be pressurized and radiation shielded.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
