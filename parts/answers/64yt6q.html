		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Height varies a lot and very short people - children, usually - won't be properly held in by the ride's restraints.</p>
<p>Very tall people and very fat people also might not be able to ride, but they will be a lot less common. But theme parks are full of children who might not be tall enough for some of the rides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked at an amusement park, and got some insight.  You experience a variety of not often experienced forces during your day at the amusement park.  Height is good measurement to determine how well you fit into the safety specifications of a ride.  It is also quite consistent, and quick measurement that can be applied to all rides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a very simple metric to check.  All they need is a sign people walk next to and you can determine who will be able to ride a ride.</p>
<p>In contrast, almost any other measurement would need to be invasive or handled on an individual basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not the only important factor, and some amount of additional discernment may be called upon by the operator. That being said, height is useful in two basic estimations, 1) if the safety equipment is likely to fit you, 2) your age, and hence expected maturity when dealing with the ride.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
