		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rover has different fault modes / failsafe modes.  From  <a href="
https://mars.nasa.gov/news/8360/six-things-about-opportunitys-recovery-efforts/">Nasa's site</a>  </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Low-power fault: engineers assume the rover went into low-power fault shortly after it stopped communicating on June 10. This mode causes the rover to hibernate, assuming that it will wake up at a time when there's more sunlight to let it recharge.<br />
Clock fault: critical to operating while in hibernation is the rover's onboard clock. If the rover doesn't know what time it is, it doesn't know when it should be attempting to communicate. The rover can use environmental clues, like an increase in sunlight, to make assumptions about the time.<br />
Uploss fault: when the rover hasn't heard from Earth in a long time, it can go into &quot;uploss&quot; fault -- a warning that its communication equipment may not be functioning. When it experiences this, it begins to check the equipment and tries different ways to communicate with Earth.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>The rover has different antennas: <a href="https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=2003-032A" target="_blank">high gain, low gain, and UHF</a> -- using the lowest power, most directional antenna is important when power is critically low due to lack of sunlight.  </p>
<p>The clock is important for communications - both to determine where in the sky earth would be for pointing a directional antenna, and understanding when a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_missions_to_Mars" target="_blank">Mars Orbiter</a> might be overhead.  Spirit has communicated with both <a href="https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/monograph/series13/DeepCommo_Chapter7--141030.pdf" target="_blank">Odyssey and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO)</a>  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since you cant really send technicians out there to fix it. These things are designed to fail in many different ways, but still recover as much functionality as possible. Most situations have already been planned for, and the code running on the machine has several redundancy measures to ensure it doesn't need physical intervention to keep it working.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
