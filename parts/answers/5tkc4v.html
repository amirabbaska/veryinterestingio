		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I found <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.5337.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a> to be quite readable on the subject.  Here's the tl;dr version:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You have to directly image the planet in order to do it because you need to look at the spectrum of light coming from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>O2 is twice as hard to detect compared to H2O</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>chlorophyll will be 6 times more difficult to detect compared to O2.  Factors like cloud cover on the exoplanet factor heavily into this.</p>
</li>
<li>It's possible that level of resolution will only be achieved when the Advanced Technology Large-Aperture Space Telescope (ATLAST) telescope is launched sometime after 2025.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Might be worth pointing out that life on other planets might not rely on chlorophyll for photosynthesis. It's quite possible it would use other pigments with absorbtion spectrums more optimized for the light from the nearby star (or stars).</p>
<p>Edit: <a href="https://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/news/20070411/" target="_blank">Here</a> is a NASA news article about it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>James Webb Space telescope, which is launching in 2018, might be able to do that. I'm saying might because chrolophyll levels are very low and might not be detectable. Distance wise I think we are talking in the hundreds of light years.
The whole sky will be surveyed so I expect 1000s of exoplanets to be analyzed</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was watching a program with professor Brian Cox, and he said that we can somehow detect which gasses are in the atmosphere of an exoplanet.</p>
<p>That's significant because there are certain gasses that are only produced during manufacturing processes (not natural processes).</p>
<p>If that's possible then perhaps we already can detect chlorophyll. </p>
<p>I'll try find the programme and post a link. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
