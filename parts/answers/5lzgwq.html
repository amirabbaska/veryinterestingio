		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming you're describing the classic two-body orbit, then a perfectly circular orbit would generate gravitational waves. If you consider a very heavy object being orbited by a much lighter object, for instance the earth rotating round the sun, then to an observer at a distance the gravitational waves would be imperceptible due to their weakness. They would be there, just not easy to detect. </p>
<p>Gravitational waves are emitted, in layman's terms, when the system has some kind of asymmetry. I.e. the system I just described is different to, say, if we crushed the earth into tiny rocks and spread them in a perfect circular orbit round the sun. (Don't try this it would be highly immoral) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whether an orbit is circular or elliptical isn't even Lorentz invariant (one observer might see a circular orbit while another observer sees it as a non-circular elliptical one due to length contraction). So clearly both circular and elliptical orbits must have the same physics. Both emit gravitational waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Any acceleration radiates gravitational waves, and circular motion is acceleration. The only motion which does not radiate is straight line at a constant speed and that never happens when orbiting some other body</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
