		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thunderstorm Asthma is caused when a strong storm hits an area that has unusually high pollen and humidity. The winds whip up the pollen and the excess moisture gets absorbed into the grains and causes them to explode -- making it so that grains which are usually too big to be an irritant (such as those from grass) are now tiny enough to affect your lungs. This is what happened in Melbourne. </p>
<p>edit: clearer explanation on how moisture plays a role</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>An increase in the amount of PM10 particulate matter (the mass of particles present in the air having a 50% cutoff for particles with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 Î¼m) in the air is associated worsening of asthma symptoms as the particles lodge and irritate small conducting airways.  These are essentially fine dust/dirt particles, much larger than pm2.5 which are created by exhaust and industrial smoke.  These particles may be stirred up by winds associated with the thunder storms.  Similar to an increase in asthma symptoms associated with the Santa Ana wind phenomenon in Southern California.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
