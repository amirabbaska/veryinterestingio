Or did they steal or ID, open up 18 credit cards, get a fraudulent loan, and then sell your SSN to an immigrant from Ghana who got caught selling bush meat?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think you are mixing up identity theft with credit card theft. </p>
<p>If someone gets your credit card information, it is pretty run of the mill, and a good credit card company should be prepared to handle it. </p>
<p>If someoneâ€‹ were to get your social security info, then they could apply for loans in your name. This could be a big problem for you if they don't pay them off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If by steal your identity you mean that someone used your identity to get a new phone, installment loan on a product and pretty much purchases that require a credit inquiry; then you wont be held liable. </p>
<p>Credit scores cannot be sabotaged permanently if you find out someone has been making purchases without your permission or knowledge. </p>
<p>Once you tell the credit union/police that you're a victim of identity theft, they do the rest and your credit score rolls back to what it was before all the inquires and purchases by the thief. </p>
<p>Credit unions can't and WONT penalize you for purchases that were made under your name without your knowledge after you tell them what happened. Same thing with Credit Cards, most/all credit card companies hold 0 liability protection for all its customers in the case someone steals their card and tries to use it online/in-stores. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
