The gap between this and James Webb (which appears to be launching in about a year, and that is a fact that appears to remain true independent of what year you're reading this in) is gonna kill me. Bye little buddy. Anybody close to this project have any cool science/mission facts they could share that aren't available through the links in the OP?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am always blown away by how successful Kepler was. It scanned a relatively small section of the sky, and could only detect planets if A. they exist and B. they are precisely angled in their orbit to pass in between their star and the Earth. Despite that, it detected <strong>thousands</strong> of planets, even before it's alignment motor broke. Really changed our view of how common planets are, and also the diversity of planetary systems beyond our N=1 solar system datum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do we have enough data yet to conclude whether our Solar system is &quot;typical&quot; among others in the galaxy, in terms of planet count, size, composition, distance, etc.? Or does our system have some features that are considered rare or unique; maybe some that could be possibly related to the origin of life?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember being a kid when no other planets were known out there.  I mean everyone thought there must be planets but there's a difference between that and actually having proof.  When they discovered the first planets around a pulsar that was really something and we've come so far since then.</p>
<p>I can't wait until we start getting atmospheric spectra on them!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
