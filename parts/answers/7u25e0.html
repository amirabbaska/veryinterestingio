		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>String theory is as of yet unproven. QED, on the other hand, is one of the most accurate theories we have to date. One of its predictions is quantifying what’s called the fine structure constant, a sort of measure of the strength of the EM field (more so, the coupling strength between an electron and a photon). This constant can only be determined experimentally, but we use QED to make predictions of this constant and then compare with experiment. To date, the fine structure constant is accurate to about 1 part in 100 million, or something like that. It’s absurdly accurate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>QFT is extremely well tested, it is used in essentially all of condensed matter and high energy physics. It is a much more general theory than QED, which is a particular QFT contained within the standard model. </p>
<p>QED is often called &quot;the best tested theory in physics.&quot; This is basically a statement about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_tests_of_QED" target="_blank">fine structure constant</a>, which can be computed in QED and gives an answer that is measured to be correct within 1 part in 100,000,000.</p>
<p>As far as other predictions from particle physics, there is the prediction of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons#Predicting_the_W_and_Z" target="_blank">W, Z</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism#History_of_research" target="_blank">Higgs bosons</a> (which includes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldstone_boson" target="_blank">Goldstone's Theorem</a>), as well as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism#Consequences_for_fermions" target="_blank">higgs coupling to mass</a>. </p>
<p>Other things that come to mind immediately are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_effect" target="_blank">Casimir effect</a>, and Dirac's prediction of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle#History" target="_blank">antiparticles</a>.</p>
<p>Then there are all the things that only have a coherent explanation through QFT. Examples include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamb_shift" target="_blank">Lamb shift</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_production" target="_blank">pair production</a>. Indeed, essentially all observed physics phenomenology seems to be in harmony with Quantum Field Theory.</p>
<p>String Theory, on the other hand, is a class of quantum field theories (or at least started that way). I am not an expert in String Theory, but to date it has made no testable/falsifiable predictions. The main reason people like String Theory is because of its mathematical beauty. There are many string theories that become the standard model in the low energy limit, which is part of why it's so hard to make falsifiable predictions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quantum field theory (QFT) is a theoretical concept to formulate a physical theory. The electromagnetic , weak and strong force can all be described with appropriate quantum field theories, and can also be combined to the quantum field theory known as the Standard Model (SM). This is the best model we currently have, with some parts tested really really well to absurd precision, other parts and predictions are not testable with current experiments, but so far every experiment agreed with predictions. </p>
<p>At the moment, gravity (general relativity, GR) can not be formulated as a quantum field theory. It is also really well tested, in calculations from the mercury rotation, satellites to black holes and gravitational waves, every experiment so far is also consistent with the theory.</p>
<p>There are still some open questions where SM and GR cannot explain reality (see also (here)[<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_physics</a>] for a list). String theory is also a kind of QFT that tries to be more general, incorporate GR and have as a special case the SM, and also predict additional particles or fields for dark matter. But there are no successful attempts (that I know of) that predict anything useful and testable by experiment, so it is entirely theoretical.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
