		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Magnetic fields are axial vectors; they don't change under the parity operation.</p>
<p>If you look at the <a href="https://quantummechanics.ucsd.edu/ph130a/130_notes/img3852.png" target="_blank">electromagnetic Lagrangian</a> (the classical one or the quantum one), it's invariant under parity.</p>
<p>If you look at the Lagrangian for the weak force, it has a part which violates parity.</p>
<p>As for &quot;why&quot; these are true, that's just an observed fact of nature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The B vectors are not in the image for good reason!
The magnetic field loops, that you are referring to, will make the “spin loops” align - and they are exact mirror partners. As the “coils” in the image.
Then in the mirror the electron beam should just go up as in front of the mirror - but they don’t.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The magnetic field is only used to polarize the Cobalt atoms. Wu took the preffered direction of gamma radiation as a measure of this Polarisation.</p>
<p>This Experiment uses the p-conservation of electromagnetism for its analysis. </p>
<p>If you have any specific questions about the Experiment by wu et  al. feel free to conntect me. (I did a presentation on Parity/CP violation for a particle physics course)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
