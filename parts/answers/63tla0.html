		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forget causality, tachyons in a quantum theory break everything.</p>
<p>If tachyons exist, then considering one tachyon there is at least one frame where its energy is negative (this comes from a bit of relativistic geometry). Now, consider the lowest energy state there is (the ground, or real vacuum) and then create such a negative-energy tachyon: this lowers the energy to below that of the ground, which means there actually isn't a lower bound to energy and no ground.</p>
<p>The energy not being bounded from below is uncomfortable in a classical theory but completely unworkable in quantum mechanics, since it means that the probability of any process is irreparably divergent. Basically any process includes uncontrollable contributions from the production of an arbitrarily large number of virtual tachyons and everything is infinite.</p>
<p>Lower-boundedness of energy is therefore usually taken as an axiom of quantum mechanics and this excludes tachyons as physical particles (and partly saves causality as a bonus). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>General relativity, it could be argued, makes such a field impossible; if you solve the time dilation equation for a photon, you find that time doesn't exist for a massless particle. The eight minutes a photon exists for between the sun and earth, only exists for things with mass, from the reference frame of the photon, the distance was traveled instantaneously. A particle with mass requires more energy to accelerate closer to the speed of light, as its mass increases, and time dialates to almost infinity as you approach the speed of light. A tachyon, or faster than light field of any sort would do the opposite, it implies negative mass, and backwards time, and by General relativity, a particle that goes faster, gains mass, and releases more and more energy to reach a stable, or ground state and &quot;slow down&quot;. It would break physics, but more importantly,  a single tachyon, once it popped into existence,  would travel backwards in time, emitting more and more energy as it approached its ground state (lowest energy state) and would, at the end of its &quot;timeline&quot;(which would be the beginning of time) emit infinite amounts of energy. Which, when I think about it, would explain the big bang nicely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
