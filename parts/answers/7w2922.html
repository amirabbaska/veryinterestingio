		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For some products, they are packaged in a environment and method so that the package is sealed, and pathogens are not present. This results in a product with a long shelf life when unopened. Once the package is opened, it is no longer sealed from the environment, and it is possible that bacteria may come in contact and grow rapidly in a warm setting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take an example of a sealed bottle of apple juice. When the juice was bottled, it was sealed and pasteurized. So any harmful bacteria that might have been in the bottle or juice was killed during pasteurization and vacuum sealing prevents any harmful pathogens or oxygen from reaching the product. </p>
<p>Once opened, any bacteria that might have been on the bottle lid, or in the air can reach the product inside. Refrigeration keeps the product cold, and slows down the growth of bacteria/yeast. </p>
<p>40 F - 140 F  is called the &quot;danger zone&quot; in food safety, that's the temp range where bacteria can rapidly grow and multiply. So that bottle of apple juice that you took a sip from has been contaminated with bacteria in your mouth/lips/saliva, and any that settled in from the air. Kept in on the counter, it's basically a giant petri dish with an all you can eat buffet. </p>
<p>A fridge should be colder than 40 F, often set to 37F, so out of the danger zone, bacteria can still grow, but slowly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What happens is bacteria, spores, and other contaminants get inside the packaging. Most food producers take great care to have exceptionally clean facilities, and many packaged foods are frozen, pasteurized, or otherwise treated to kill bacteria after the package is sealed. This keeps them fresh, until you open the package. After they're re-exposed to contaminants they need to be refrigerated to inhibit the growth of bacteria/mold/etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Opening it has introduced microbes from the air, your mouth, or hands into the bottle, which will now reproduce and release toxic wastes (food poisoning) into the drink or food. So you have to refrigerate the food or drink to slow them down. The food or drink was pasteurized during packaging which killed the microbes inside, but opening the container recontaminated the food or drink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
