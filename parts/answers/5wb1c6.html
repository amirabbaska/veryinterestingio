		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As any barista will explain coffee is a delicate balance of quality beans, quality equipment and a stedy hand. </p>
<p>Good beans means that they are fresh, roasted to the correct point in a uniform manner and ground in a quality grinder creating a uniform powder at the correct calibre for the application (the faster the extraction method, the finer the coffee more or less)</p>
<p>Good equipment means having a good burr grinder thats mantained clean and produces a consistant grind, and a coffee machine that mantains consistant pressure and temperature during extraction. </p>
<p>And a Stedy hand to know how to correctly tamper the coffee, how to wet it a bit before hand, how to time the extraction correctly and how to judge the extraction depending on flow and color. </p>
<p>TL;DR making good coffee requires good equipment, skill and decent coffee beans. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From my time in specialty coffee, it takes some experimenting with grind size/brew time/bean-water ratio before you hit that range of flavor you want. </p>
<p>The biggest advice on making a perfect cup at home is to play to your water: Every time I move to a new city/state, the change in water alone is enough to have to change up my brewing methods.
Going from well-filtered water at a shop to the higher solute content of city tap water required me to adjust my grind/temp/time accordingly to achieve similar taste profiles from the same coffee at home.</p>
<p>An adjustable burr grinder and fresh(~&lt;30 days old, imo) is almost completely necessary for great coffee. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>May I recommend trying to cold brew your coffee? I found cold brewing to be common at coffee places and restaurants and reduces a lot of bitter flavor from coffee. This could explain the better taste.</p>
<p>One ounce ground coffee to two cups water, let then sit in the fridge for 24 hours. This makes the cold brew concentrate. Pour concentrate into French press to filter and remove grounds (cheese cloth also works).</p>
<p>Depending on your tastes, fill your cup 1/4 to 1/2 way with concentrate, the rest with water (and ice if you prefer cold coffee).</p>
<p>Best way I've ever found to make non bitter coffee like you'd get at a nice place.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trend in cafes nowadays is to base all coffees on the espresso, and to make a good espresso requires a good espresso machine. Unless you spent a lot of money on yours, you probably don't have one. Pod coffee machines won't really come close. And if you're using a filter or a cafetiere well that's a different way to make a coffee which gives a different flavour even using the same beans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
