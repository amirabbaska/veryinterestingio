		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The rich don't necessarily have to sell stock to get money. Bill Gates gets hundreds of millions in dividends every year. And founders of other companies that don't pay dividends may not need to sell stock either...</p>
<p>One thing that the super rich do that you and I can't is they borrow against their money to finance their lifestyles, often for their entire lives and only settling when they die. This allows them to keep 100% of their money invested earning a greater return than the interest rate on their loans....this is free money in their pockets.</p>
<p>I only have some millions but I have taken advantage of similar things to a much smaller extent. I can't borrow to pay everyday bills against my investments, but I was able to borrow to finance a house in a way that would make most people think I was being financially insane. In 2010 I got a balloon ARM at 1.8%. This was on a house I could have paid cash for without problem. </p>
<p>It's paid off - leaving my money in the market and making the minimum payments until the time when the interest rate exceeded the market returns (and it hasn't happened yet). If the market turns bear or the interest rate goes too high I simply pay the thing off. I'm up about 150k on this transaction.</p>
<p>That's how the rich pay for things. They borrow money they don't need to borrow at terms you and I could never get. They settle up when they die (or lose all their money). Or they just sell stock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on how much liquidity he needs.  Bill Gates gets $180 million every 3 months from quarterly dividends from Microsoft stock, so he doesn't have to sell shares.  Amazon doesn't pay dividends, so if he is paid in stock, he would have to sell it.  Apple works the same way.</p>
<p>If Jeff Bezos has holdings in other companies that do pay dividends, he could use that instead of having to mess with Amazon stock.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Founders of companies who have huge numbers of shares typically set up automated liquidation of shares to fund their living expenses and to free up capital for diversification purposes. By automating the trading, it makes it easier to avoid perception or accusation of insider trading, nor signal anything about company prospects. So somebody like Bezos might sell 10k shares every month on the last trading day of the month, or something along those lines. They might also make other sales, too, but have to ensure they follow trading &quot;quiet periods&quot; and such when they do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is rich in assets and there is rich in cash.  Cash slowly erodes in value due to inflation, so it doesn't make sense for people just to have a billion in cash sitting around. So all very rich people generally have lots of assets. Even when they get cash, they buy assets with it (bonds / Treasury bills if they want to be conservative). </p>
<p>He's rich in assets, but he has cash too - the company pays his salary.  But Amazon doesn't pay dividends. </p>
<p>So he either has to borrow based on the shares or sell some to cover anything that his company salary doesn't cover.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
