		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most film is based of salts of silver or &quot;silver halides&quot; like sliver chloride and silver bromide (there were other chemicals based on iron, palladium, and even platinum but silver is the most common). These are chemicals that change when exposed to light (by changing we usually mean they get darker). So when light hit the negative, that part of the negative would turn dark (I'm skipping daguerrotypes and tintypes which got around the negative by having the silver on a mirror or darker ground material). Then when you shined light through the negative onto a paper coated with more silver halides, the areas the light hit there would turn dark... making a positive print... But it's just where light hits, become black... no color.</p>
<p>Along the way they came up with a few techniques to try to cheat the system to add color. They would shoot 3 shots with 3 cameras each with a different color filter over the lens... they'd get 3 black and white negatives but when they then made positive transparencies of them and projected each of them with the same filter again, the could get a color image on a screen. The early technicolor movies also used a similar principle.</p>
<p>There were a couple of brothers (Lumiere) who thought well... they could make such a filter but on a tiny level... if they took a bunch of potato starch and died them different colors, mixed them up and spread them on a sheet of glass they'd have a glass filter made up of tiny dots of color. If they put that right in front of a piece of &quot;film&quot; (this was in the days before film was actually on film, rather it was on glass plates) they could then photograph, remove the filter, develop the plate to make a positive, and very very carefully realign the filter so the individual potato starch cells lined up, they'd have a color image. This was called an autochrome. Like the projection method above, you couldn't print this and as it sounds, it was kind of a pain in the but to do. But there are several amazing looking autochromes from around the 1900's in museums today.</p>
<p>About this time Kodak was getting popular making film which made it much easier for people to shoot without having to have a huge darkroom or know as much about chemistry, they said &quot;You press the button, we'll do the rest&quot; and they'd take your camera, pull the film out of it, send you prints, negatives, and your camera loaded with a new roll of film and as a result Kodak made a ton of money... they hired a bunch of researchers to develop new techniques. Two of these researchers: Leopold Mann and Leopold Godowski ended up making what became called Kodachrome, which was a film that when processed out would create a color transparency with very vivid colors. Thus it is said that Kodachrome was made by God and Mann (old photographers pun, sorry). The process was kind of a pain in the but, the machines were complicated and had to be calibrated very precisely, so there were not a lot of labs that could process this (not nearly as many that could process B&amp;W) but it was a way to shoot color on film. With those Kodachromes it was possible to print using methods like Carbro printing or Dye Transfer... but these were very complicated methods and not many people could do them. So still for a while we were mostly shooting B&amp;W. It really wasn't until the 60's and 70's that color film and color printing that had multiple different layers with dye couplers, which made processing easy enough for smaller local labs to be able to do cheaply (cheaply is the important part). But even then the early color films and papers made then tended to use dyes that did not have very long life spans (which is why a lot of color photographs from the time seem so faded).</p>
<p>Even today, most digital sensors cannot see color, they still have to cheat the system. Most digital cameras (everything from an iPhone to a Nikon or Canon DSLR) will actually have a checkerboard of red, green, and blue filters over the dots that make up the sensor. The software in the camera then has to interpolate what colors each pixel is based on the surrounding colors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Color film was EXTREMELY high tech, actually.  It took a lot of care, trial and error, and investment to get it to work right.</p>
<p>B&amp;W film is a sheet sandwiching a layer of gelatin full of silver crystals.  These crystals darken very quickly in a similar fashion to sunburn.  Just like sunburns, you don't get a variety of colors, just different levels of &quot;darker than your normal skin&quot;. </p>
<p>Color film is actually the same process, but with several layers of emulsions for each color.  So you now have a sandwich that is like quadruple layered, but in order for it to work it still has to be thin enough to go through the camera.  All those layers and protective interlayers are thinner than a human hair. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holding your hand in front of a flash light makes a shadow on a wall. First thing you do is wave your hand in front of the flash light, maybe stand in front of it. Later you develop the idea, let's make light shadow figures, by holding your hands in certain positions to make a bird or dog.</p>
<p>Same thing with photography. Discover photosensitive chemicals that darken when exposed to light. Make a primitive photo showing grainy image. Like this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_photography#/media/File:View_from_the_Window_at_Le_Gras,_Joseph_Nic%C3%A9phore_Ni%C3%A9pce.jpg" target="_blank">earliest known photo</a>.</p>
<p>About 30 years later, the technology had been improved a bit to make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_photography#/media/File:Crystal_Palace_General_view_from_Water_Temple.jpg" target="_blank">sharper images</a>.</p>
<p>The first extremely primitive color photos weren't developed until almost 60 years after the invention of the black and white photo, which was actually 3 photos taken with 3 different color filters put over the lens, then all 3 images were projected onto a wall using 3 different color lights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's some bad responses in this thread.</p>
<p>There were a few things that needed to be invented before color film could be practical:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The idea of using three primary colors to make a full color photograph.  This was first described in 1855.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emulsions (the light-sensitive part of film) that are sensitive to all colors of light.  Early films were only sensitive to blue light, and were not affected by red or green light. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way to photograph the three seperate colors at the same time.  Early color photographs were made by taking three seperate exposures.  The Autochrome process, first marketed in 1907, used special filters on the plate to expose &quot;dots&quot; of red, green, and blue.  Kodachrome film, developed in the 1930's, used the modern approach of three seperate layers of emulsion.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way to make inexpensive color prints.  Autochrome and Kodachrome produced transperancies; you held them up to the light to view them, or projected them with a slide projector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A way to make the film more sensitive, so less light is required to make an exposure.  Film sensitivity is measured in ASA, where a doubling of the number corresponds to halving the amount of light required to make an exposure.  Early Kodachrome had an ASA speed of 8.  Today, film speeds under 100 are rare, and speeds up to 3600 are available.</p>
</li>
<li>Price.  In order for color film to completely overtake black &amp; white, it needed to cost the same or less. </li>
</ol>
<p>These problems were solved by the 1970's, when color film surpassed black &amp; white as the primary method of photography.</p>
