		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually yes! It has been speculated that mitochondrial dna may pass from mother to fetus in utero, even if they were not a genetic contributor to the embryo (these cells aren't thought to have much of an effect on the future of the baby however). Likewise, some of the foetal cells may remain with the mother past birth, called fetomaternal chimerism. Most important however, are the nutrients and diseases the surrogate is exposed to during her pregnancy, as they affect the genetic development of the embryo enormously i.e. she can affect how their DNA is used in their future life. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is really interesting! I am a parent via surrogacy -- my own uterus is on strike and I failed to be able to carry a baby to term. We turned to surrogacy, and it was a wonderful experience. We used our embryos, so my son is genetically mine and my husband's. Some of my son's DNA definitely crossed the placental barrier and went into my surrogate -- that is how the new NIPT (non-invasive prenatal testing) is done. It's a blood test at 10-12 weeks that can detect anuploidy (abnormal number of chromosomes) in the fetus. The blood is drawn from the pregnant woman (my surrogate; in most other instances this person would also be the genetic mother) and sent to a lab. As long as the free fetal fraction of DNA is above 6%, they can build a karyotype of the fetus. This is how people are finding out gender at 10 weeks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://genetics.thetech.org/ask/ask420" target="_blank">I found this:</a></p>
<p>A woman who carries someone else's baby contributes very little, if any, DNA to the child. This is because the child already has its DNA from its mom and dad. Also, the baby's own blood passes through its body – not the blood of its surrogate mom.</p>
<p>However, there is a possibility that some DNA could be transferred from the woman to the fetus that she is carrying. And vice versa, from the child to the mother.</p>
<p>This exchanged DNA will have almost no effect. At most, it will be a few cells (with DNA) hiding out amongst the trillions of original cells of the child. Too few cells of the surrogate mother are passed to the child for them to actually pass on any of her characteristics or affect the child in any significant way.</p>
<p>Remember – a child's DNA comes from two places. Half comes from its mother and half from its father.</p>
<p>But in this article, we're talking about changes in DNA that happen during pregnancy – while the child is developing. So, all of what I talk about is true for both mothers carrying their own child, as well as for surrogate mothers carrying the child of another woman.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a mom to a donor egg daughter. I lost my ovarian function in my late 20s from having to do chemotherapy for breast cancer. In my late 30s, my husband and I went to a fertility clinic in NC where we participate in an anonymous donor egg program. After I started taking certain hormones to sustain a pregnancy, my anonymous donor was hyper stimulated with other  hormones so that she would produce multiple eggs. They were then harvested and fertilized with my husband's sperm. After a few days, three viable embryos were implanted in my uterus and I continued with my hormones. One baby survived and she's now in college and the light of our lives. Science is freaking awesome and so is that wonderful woman who donated her eggs! It's is NOT easy and quite painful as I understand. They definitely deserve the financial compensation (I highly doubt it's 1K per egg as another person posted but maybe times have changed). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
