		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reasoning that the mug gets cold is obviously a good thing, but that implies that copper has a very high exchange rate of temperature. It does, that's why they use copper for computer heatsinks. Very good at heat transfer. Which is bad. Your drink will get warmer faster and your body heat will transfer to the drink faster than a glass. If you drink it fast, great, if you spend more than a few minutes, nope. Basic physics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The story goes that the people who invented it worked for Smirnoff Vodka and went around getting pictures at different bars with a copper mug - the mug was a part of the marketing and <a href="http://cdn2.bigcommerce.com/server5400/271b7/product_images/uploaded_images/5303072c337d2_coppermugs-smirnoff.jpg?t=1398725710" target="_blank">became instantly connected with the drink</a>.</p>
<p>Another version of the story I've seen floating around is that three guys were drinking together when they first mixed up the cocktail - the owner of Smirnoff, the owner of C&amp;B Ginger Beer, and a guy who sold copper wares.  So they put it all together and made a killing!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;It can be definitely stated that the main reason to serve Moscow Mule in copper mugs, is the presentation. Like any other well prepared drink, when it was prepared for the first time, Moscow Mule also needed a distinctive look.  So the inventors served the drink in specially made copper mugs, and circulated photographs of celebrities drinking them to increase the popularity of the drink.&quot;</p>
