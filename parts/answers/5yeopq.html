		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need high voltage. Air is a very poor conductor, but by providing the electrons with a high voltage, they have sufficient energy to ionize the air between the two ends of the wire and create a conductive channel.</p>
<p>At standard temperature and pressure, you'd need 3 kV per mm of distance, so in your case, you would need to apply at least 1500 V in order for the gap to be bridged.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Voltage is the force that pushes electrons. Current is just the measurement of how many electrons are passing through a cross sectional area per second. Voltage is required to force electrons across a resistive air gap. Current is entirely dependent on resistance and voltage, Ohm's law, V = IR. Current just follows what V and R are, and if R is relatively constant, it depends entirely on V.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the other answers are correct, you need high voltage. This is governed by Paschens Law. The high voltage will ionize air and you'll see a big bright flash (this is sometimes known as arc flash).
<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen's_law" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paschen's_law</a></p>
<p>If your asking about transmitting electricity across a gap, however, there are much more clever ways to do this. Assuming you're using AC current (or possibly a square wave D.C.), you can use inductive or capacitive coupling. This is how wireless charging works. It's not always super efficient, but it doesn't involve big balls of plasma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know the answer is voltage but how does current (or lack of resistance?) play a role in sustaining the arc or ionized air? If I pull a 16KV switch with 1 amp of current nothing happen and the line is de energized on the load side. If I do it with 100 amps you'll wish you hadn't. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When comparing electricity to water pressure...you can think of voltage as the water pressure, and amperage as the diameter of the pipe.  </p>
<p>If you need that to cross a gap in a wire (or any air gap) you need high voltage.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
