		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The tree splits due to the pressure of the boiled sap inside it, not due to the lightening chopping or physically striking the tree. </p>
<p>This happens in a tree because there is enough resistance to the flow of electricity.  When there is enough oomph, like a lightening strike, the electricity is able to overcome the resistance but this creates heat and a lot of it.  </p>
<p>There is a lot of moisture in trees aside from the normal sap and this will boil into steam when heated up. </p>
<p>Steam takes up much more space than the liquid it used to be and because it cant escape this will cause the tree to rupture, split, or explode. </p>
<p>Edit: Unrelated cause but trees will also explode in the winter if enough of their moisture/sap freezes.  Water -&gt; ice takes up less space than water-&gt;steam but still more than the water itself. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Electrician here. Trees have a higher resistance than humans do. This resistance to the flow of electricity causes more heat build-up in the tree as the lightning travels through it. Heat, causes the tree to explode. </p>
<p>Humans on the other hand, are less resistant to the flow of electricity. So often times instead of exploding, just suffer extreme burns, shock, destruction of nervous tissue etc..... </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are mostly water so most of the electricity goes straight to the ground.   Trees have more resistance so more damage is done.  People are better conductors than trees. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In trees the electricity of the bolt travels through the sap, which overheats it causing it to explode.</p>
<p>In humans it generally travels through or on top of the skin (skin effect) which causes those lightning figures on the skin after being struck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
