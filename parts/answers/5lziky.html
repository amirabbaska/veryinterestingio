<hr />
<p>In order to answer this question, we need a working definition of 'emotion'. To this end, we can use the definition proposed by Tooby &amp; Cosmides (1990) of <em>adaptations that have arisen in response to the adaptive problem of mechanism orchestration</em>. In layman's terms, emotions help us make sense of our environments and circumstances.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of evolutionary psychology, it's likely that emotions developed and were cultivated/refined through the process of repeated encounters with stressors that required early humans to process information quickly and accurately. Situations such as mate-stealing, encroaching on territory, finding a mate, and death of other humans lead to recognizable patterns of behavior that became ingrained in human behavior as emotional responses. </p>
<p>We can see a perfectly good example in <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.337.109&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Tooby &amp; Cosmides (2000)</a>. Most people experience fear when it is dark, to varying degrees. It is likely that this is a relic of a time when humans needed to be aware of nocturnal predators. Fear served the purpose of making early humans more cautious and avoiding situations where they may be hunted or killed. Humans that exhibited a fear of the dark and utilized it to avoid dangerous situations had a better survival rate than those that did not, leading to the residual fear of the dark we experience today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming there is some form of selection pressure favouring emotional development then presumably this is how emotions developed in humans.</p>
<p>In your examples there is no evidence that 'love' would spontaneously occur in a formerly emotionless species, however it seems plausible that there would be favorable pressure towards individuals that experienced love (for example leading to pair bonding, more successful mating and so forth)</p>
<p>Equally with anger, I think its fair to assume that hardship would be common throughout early human history and individuals who experienced anger in response to injustice could be more fit than those that did not. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to someone like Paul Ekman the basic emotions (Ekman identifies at least five: joy, sadness, surprise, anger, and fear) and their non-verbal facial cues should be considered universal. This is in accordance with Charles Darwin's own theory on the development of emotions which you can read about in his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Expression_of_the_Emotions_in_Man_and_Animals" target="_blank">The Expressions of the Emotions in the Man and Animals</a>. This is in line with the response given by /u/NawtAGoodNinja, which is clearly given from an evolutionary perspective. </p>
<p>The anthropologist Margaret Mead disagreed with Ekman and instead  claimed that the development of emotional expression are more dependent on behavioural learning, and therefore not universal. This is also what the answer by /u/Glaselar reflects. </p>
<p>Both answers reflect two sides in a debate that is still ongoing. John Dewey also critiqued what he saw to be Darwin's functionalist view on emotions (see <a href="https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Dewey/Dewey_1894a.html" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Dewey/Dewey_1895.html" target="_blank">here</a>). So it is difficult to say who is in the right. However, it is important to note that a lot of evolutionary psychology is theories grounded in speculation with very little evidence backing up individual theories. That is not to say that there can be no truth to them, but simply that we have to be careful in our assumptions. </p>
<p>I don't think there is an actual and conclusive backed-by-science answer to your question, OP. At least not at this moment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<hr />
<p>Acquired traits are almost never passed on. Evolution requires that something is heritable, and that requires it to be genetically encoded. You can't change your genes in response to your life.</p>
<p>It's much more likely that the desire to find a mate and to find food (neither of which require emotions) were more successfully acted upon by those whose genetic programming not only gave them instincts to find food but also to zealously guard what they'd won. That made them more successful at having more offspring. That act made their genes more prevalent in the population, thus making emotional acts evolutionarily important. </p>
<p>With the exception of epigenetics, which is a change in the way existing genes are turned on or off rather than the development of new gene variants, it's not possible to train something into a heritable feature.</p>
