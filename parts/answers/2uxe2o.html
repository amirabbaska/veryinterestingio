Population densities were low, there wasn't much pressure to feed a lot of people confined in a small range.  There was abundant game and wild foods.  So there was really no need or reason to bother with planting or domesticating, and there weren't usually enough people around to build any large structures.</p>
<p>It's not so much that they couldn't figure out how to domesticate animals or plants, it's just that it didn't make sense to bother going through the work when you could reliably get food from the wild.</p>
<p>Here's a paper on the topic that posits a favorable climate encouraged population growth, followed by climatic downturn forcing people into higher population densities in remaining favorable locations--and that higher population densities spurred people to settle down and start planting things.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of people are suggesting a lot of hearsay.</p>
<p>To clarify some points, it is widely accepted that anatomically modern humans would have possesed language every bit as expressive and complex as our own, so language acquisition almost certainly does not explain the technological transition to agriculture 14k years ago.</p>
<p>For most of human history humans lived in tiny populations and were hunter gatherers, often nomadic too. There isn't much scope for storing knowledge during this period as you have to remember everything your group &quot;knows&quot;. And there isn't much scope for coming up with lots of ideas as there aren't actually very many of you.</p>
<p>One idea about the neolithic period and the agricultural transition is that it is the first time in human history where we reach critical mass intellectually. There's enough of us that we can store lots of knowledge via memory alone and there are enough of us that we're generating lots of ideas. Once both those are in place we've hit the point in history where good ideas can accumulate reliably and not just get lost/forgotten.</p>
<p>This economics/anthropology paper is about this very idea</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are so many factors, but a big one that hasn't been mentioned is climate.  The last &quot;Ice Age&quot; at the tail end of the Pleistocene era last from about 100K years ago to... drum roll please... 12K years ago.  Even before that periods of what's know as &quot;climate volatility&quot; created less then ideal conditions that would have limited population growth.  </p>
<p>The first modern homo sapiens would have began venturing out of the Ethiopian area around 125K years ago, though it is also then believed that their was a &quot;retraction&quot; back into Africa around 75K years ago due to climate change and possibly conflict with Neanderthal tribes more adept at surviving in a colder climate.  </p>
<p>That retraction also coincides with the eruption of Lake Toba... the largest volcanic eruption of the last many many millions of years, and a &quot;climate event&quot; that most likely caused a dramatic reduction in total human population.  Some estimates put the total number of humans that survived in the  sub 20K range.  </p>
<p>That still does give us a huge amount of time that people were living in tropical regions of Sub Saharan Africa... so why no agriculture development there?   Well... a big reason could be that Africa is a really difficult place to develop agriculture.  It had almost no large seeded grasses, which are the basis for almost all grain agriculture.  It had almost no easy to domesticate animals.  It was very wet... which is the enemy of trying to preserve foods you do manage to save.  If you're into the whole geographic theories behind why agriculture developed where it did Guns, Germs, and Steel is a fantastic read. </p>
<p>Basically... the world just wasn't a very easy place for us to develop the first couple hundred thousand years.  We tend to think of the world as it is today, but the world a long time ago was a very different place... both climatically, and in terms of how agriculture would be nearly impossible in many places without technologies and species developed in relatively few places.  </p>
<p>*edit... couple hundred thousand... not couple hundred. </p>
<p>It's really fun to think about.  Great question.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If  Neolithic  Ned  was  screwing around trying to  get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woolly_rhinoceros" target="_blank">rhinoceros</a>  to  settle  down or whatever, then  he  was  going to  miss the  berry  harvest  or the  salmon run  or  something,  and  his  family  was  going to  go  hungry. </p>
<p>Neolithic  people had  cultures  that  were  very  well  adapted  to their  environments, and  didn't have much of a margin  for  trying  new  and  different things. </p>
<p>People in  grain-producing  areas  got lucky  -  grain was a resource that was practical  to    grow a  lot  of and then store,  and that  gave them a storable surplus  so they could start  large-scale experimenting  with  other things. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
