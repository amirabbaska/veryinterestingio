		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geneticist here!  CRISPR (or CRISPR-Cas9, if you want the full name), is a big improvement in how we genetically modify organisms.</p>
<p>All organisms, from single-cell bacteria, to plants, to animals, to humans, have long molecules inside of them, called DNA.  The pattern of different molecules in this chain of DNA, called the <em>genetic code,</em> provides instructions for building those bacteria/plants/animals.  Tiny little machines inside those cells read the genetic code and use those instructions to make every part of the organism, so that it can grow and reproduce!</p>
<p>Now, one of the really cool things about DNA is that, because it's the &quot;blueprint&quot; for making an organism, we can make changes to the DNA and see the results in the resulting organisms!  For example, if we insert the instructions for producing a green fluorescent protein (called GFP for short) in a bacteria's DNA, that bacteria will make the protein, and will glow green under fluorescent light!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, inserting a new chunk of instructions into DNA isn't as easy as making a change to a set of blueprints.  We can manipulate DNA when it's isolated from an animal, on its own, but there's no way to build a new organism around that naked DNA.  If we want to change an organism, we need to get at the DNA inside the cells, without killing them.</p>
<p>In addition, cells don't like getting random chunks of DNA shoved at them.  They see this as a threat, and will destroy that DNA.  So in order to get a chunk of DNA to stay in a cell, we need to incorporate it into the cell's own DNA - merge it in, like glueing a new sheet into the blueprints.</p>
<p>In order to add a chunk of foreign DNA, we need to add our chunk inside the cell, break the cell's own DNA somewhere, and then get the cell to fix its DNA by sticking our inserted chunk into the gap.  Three tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Task 1:</strong> getting the foreign chunk of DNA into a cell, can be accomplished by using electricity or soap to temporarily &quot;pop&quot; the cell's membrane.  Obviously, this doesn't work well on adult humans, but it works great on bacteria and single cells.</p>
<p><strong>Task 2:</strong> Breaking the cell's DNA somewhere.  This is the really tricky part.  Using certain (very nasty and dangerous) chemicals can make the DNA break in random places, but this is dangerous; what if we break the DNA in the middle of a gene that we need?  Our cells will die!  </p>
<p>This is where CRISPR comes in.  CRISPR is a combination of a scissor-like protein and a DNA guide that lets it only cut at very specific chosen locations.  Unlike old methods, we can be very precise with where we cut the cell's own DNA.  We can cut to turn off a gene, or cut at a place where there's nothing but junk so that we can insert our own foreign DNA pieces!</p>
<p><strong>Task 3:</strong> Close the DNA back up, fixing those cuts - with our inserted chunk inside.  Fortunately, cells have the machinery to repair DNA cuts on their own!  That was easy!</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>So, CRISPR is a molecular pair of scissors that cuts DNA in very precise locations.</strong>  There are still big challenges with genetic engineering - it's tough to get these scissors into a cell, the foreign chunk of DNA doesn't always get inserted, and the CRISPR scissors can still miss and cut in the wrong places.  But this is a huge advancement in making more precise cuts, a very important part in creating an organism with new abilities.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is more on the &quot;how it'll change everything&quot; side of the question.</p>
<p>The most popular thing that people bring up when talking about what CRISPR can do is designer babies.  CRISPR allows for editing our DNA very precisely when compared to previous methods.  As the methodology on how to use CRISPR is worked out it will likely become more accurate and safer.  Once it's deemed safe enough to use on humans we'll be able to cure all genetic diseases by changing who people are at the root, their DNA.</p>
<p>The sci-fi trope for this technology is where a living person can change their genetic code to make them faster, smarter, stronger, or even change hair color or physical features.  Currently though most of the talk is about making these changes during fetal developmental stage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>DNA (the blueprints to your body) is like a Jenga tower, and each block does something different. Now we can swap blocks without breaking the tower. This will let us do different things to your body. Those things could make you healthier or better. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
