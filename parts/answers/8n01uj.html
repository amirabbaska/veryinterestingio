It's because the reaction can only happen where the fuel and air are in contact with each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Why does an ideal fuel:air mixture not burn completely, in practice? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>A few reasons:  </p>
<ul>
<li>Because nothing is perfect, chaos, 2nd Law of Thermo, however you want to put it. The ideal system is exactly perfect, and no system is ideal. As your system approaches ideal conditions, the results will trend toward perfection, but you will never reach perfection.  </li>
<li>Imperfect mixing. Even if the ratio is perfect <em>on average</em> there are localized pockets of higher and lower densities, this is compounded by temperature variations within the cylinder.  </li>
<li>Because most of the matter inside the cylinder is not (supposed to be) involved in the combustion reaction. I'm looking at you nitrogen.  </li>
<li>Because combustion isn't instantaneous. Even if you had pure O2 and Octane at the perfect ratio, perfectly mixed in the cylinder all that would go to shit the instant combustion starts near the spark plug, because we now have a CO2 and H2O in the chamber along with a temperature and pressure gradient.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Why do the &quot;lean&quot; mixtures used in road vehicles not burn completely, either?  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Same as above, though a lean mixture adds even more Nitrogen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there leftover oxygen, as well? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, there will almost always be left over O2 in the exhaust. It's worth noting that in a real, modern, fuel-injected vehicle, the car is constantly oscillating back and forth between rich and lean as the fuel-injection system &quot;chases&quot; the 02 sensor's readings.   </p>
<blockquote>
<p>If so, why is secondary air injection needed? Thanks.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Secondary air injection primarily dealt with changing fuel levels, like if you suddenly took your foot of the gas pedal of a carbureted  vehicle, the throttle would close, and the air-fuel mixture would suddenly spike very rich. Secondary air injection's primary job was to handle these spikes in unburned fuel in the exhaust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, at idle and low load (cruising, for instance), the ECU/PCM monitors the output of air/fuel and tunes for a  stoichiometric ratio of 14.6:1 (for gasoline). That is what is called a perfect burn, and there is very little hydrocarbons left exiting the tailpipe (not factoring in the catalytic converter). As load increases, the PCM adds fuel to drop the stoich to somewhere in the 12-13 range, depending on the engine specs. High strung engines with a high static compression (eg: 13:1) run a higher risk of predetonation/ping, so their tunes tend to add a little more fuel to allow a buffer (more fuel equals cooler burn = less heat = less chance for predetonation). The same goes for supercharged/turbocharged engines. Their ECUs will shoot for mid to low 12s whereas an engine without a turbo/blower and a lower static compression ratio (between 9:1 and 10:1) will push the air/fuel mixture into the low 13s.  </p>
<p>Of course, things change dynamically in an engine, but the ECU is always making corrections. If an engine gets too hot, for instance (not enough coolant, thermostat funky, +100F temps, etc), the knock sensor will detect even the lowest pings occuring in the engine before they get bad, then pull electronic timing/advance so that the detonation events stop (due to cooler combustion temps). That is also when EGR valves open up and dump exhaust into the combustion chamber to staunch good combustion cycles... cooling things down. In that case, what comes out of the tailpipe will contain more unburnt fuel.</p>
<p>As for direct injection/dual injection, it is all about making a burn cleaner. Having the injectors *inside* the combustion chamber and controlled per-cylinder is much more desirable than having the mixture of fuel/air occur outside the chamber. I honestly don't know what the benefit of having both is... Japanese VW Golfs, for instance... but I know they have worse emissions than the US cars. If you take apart the manifold in a US-sold Golf, you'll see the bosses where the other injectors would go, and you can even machine them and put the second set of injectors in. I think the wiring harness even has the unused plugs for them. The rest is just in the tune, which you have to go somewhere to have done.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You’re probably looking for something more based in chemistry, idk the answer to the first part other than nothing is perfect in practice.</p>
<p>Lean mixtures in modern gasoline automobiles don’t burn completely because there’s not enough fuel to burn every bit of oxygen in the combustion chamber, so yes there is leftover oxygen. This oxygen is used as an input to your first oxygen sensor, before the catalytic converter, sometimes called an air/fuel sensor. This is what tells the computer to switch to rich condition when it senses excess oxygen. It switches back and forth between rich and lean conditions depending on multiple inputs (coolant temp, manifold pressure, air temp, air mass, accelerator pedal position, gear selection, etc.)  creating an average fuel ratio that usually hovers around ideal 14.7:1. There exists also what is called short term and long term fuel trim. These values are calculated by the ecu to try to get that average closer to ideal conditions. </p>
<p>To throw another wrench in the proverbial cogs we have emissions standards that manufactures have to adhere to. For example, exhaust gas recirculation or egr takes already burnt inert gas from the exhaust and takes it through the ecu controlled egr valve back into the combustion chamber. This inert gas takes up space that would otherwise be fuel and air. It also lowers combustion temperatures and lowers oxides of nitrogen, or NOx, which causes photochemical smog. The ecu has to compensate for that inert gas though. It can’t just guess what values to use. It has to see a rich condition and then switch to lean, it sees a lean condition and switches to rich, the ecu is always one step behind really. </p>
<p>Secondary air induction or sometimes called air suction is only to improve the catalytic converter’s efficiency, the little bit of unburnt oxygen remaining after a lean burn is not quite enough for an efficient reaction in the converter so more fresh oxygen is brought in. There is also a second oxygen sensor after the converter to measure the converters efficiency and to control how much oxygen is used. </p>
<p>Maybe not what you were after but hopefully someone learns something :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few basic thermodynamics/chemistry issues at play even in a properly running engine.</p>
<p>First, even if there are the exact quantities of fuel and air for complete combustion, there's no guarantee that they are mixed fully, which is a requisite for complete combustion. This is especially problematic for scenarios where the combustion cycle occurs very quickly, like a typical vehicle engine that has strokes on the order of milliseconds. If more time was allowed for the fuel and air mixture to dwell in the cylinder, you'd get a more uniform mixture and therefore more complete combustion.</p>
<p>A second major issue is the reactivity of the elements. The oxygen does not combine equally readily with all elements in the fuel. In reality, the oxygen will bond with the hydrogen much more easily than it will with the carbon in the fuel. The hydrogen almost always burns to completion, but there is usually leftover carbon byproducts from the fuel which did not fully burn. Running lean does help with this issue, ensuring there is sufficient oxygen to fully burn all of the fuel, but due to the time limitations from the first point, there will still be incomplete combustion.</p>
<p>Now from a practical engine side of things there a whole bunch of things that can go wrong, further hurting the combustion process. Impurities in the fuel, high temperatures and pressures that cause the oxygen to bind with nitrogen (which should be relatively inert for this process), dissociation where the burned carbon products actually break up due to high temperatures, insufficient spark or temperature for ignition, incorrect engine timing resulting in the fuel-air mixture being detonated early or being purged before combustion completes, etc.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, you're never going to get 100% complete combustion, and you're going to have partially burned pollutants in the exhaust gases. Secondary air injection is meant to provide additional oxygen to the partially combusted exhaust to achieve closer to complete combustion, therefore reducing vehicle emissions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
