		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> Yes. If you're near a black hole. </p>
<p><strong>Longer answer:</strong> So you already hit on the fact that light can't escape black holes, and it turns out that if you are at just the right distance from the event horizon (which is sort of the point of no return- where the black hole begins and the normal universe ends), photons can actually orbit at this point. It means that if you were at this point, and you looked straight ahead, you'd see the back of your head!</p>
<p>Anyway, it's called the <a href="http://sciencevspseudoscience.files.wordpress.com/2011/09/schwarzschild.png" target="_blank">photon sphere</a> (not to be confused with the photosphere of the sun). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I am not a physicist, but I believe that at 1.5x the Schwarzschild radius, photons orbit a black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the reddit joke &quot;OP's mom&quot;, super massive objects besides black holes could, in theory, contain enough mass to do this. For the purposes of physics, gravity is treated as having the same speed as light so an object massive enough to bend light could, in theory, also be moving fast enough so that the amount of bend it causes in the photon's vector corresponds to the object's movement, causing it to orbit the object.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is not entirely practical because of the massive amount of energy required to move an object at such a speed and the path the object would have to take (doesn't lend well to what I would call &quot;reasonable movement&quot;). Since we know that black holes can indeed cause light to orbit (because of the ability to keep light from escaping), we have to look at size of object, nearness of light, and mass of object. In doing a little research for this, I've found that someone else has already done the math and will link that for you instead of muddying it with my lower understanding of the solid concepts: <a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/111279/how-close-does-light-have-to-be-to-orbit-a-perfect-sphere-the-size-and-mass-of" target="_blank">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/111279/how-close-does-light-have-to-be-to-orbit-a-perfect-sphere-the-size-and-mass-of</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Yes! None other than Albert Einstein proposed this very idea with the Theory of General Relativity. It's truly fascinating. You don't even need a black hole. A galaxy or a cluster of galaxies will do. In fact, we can see the same supernova over and over again that took different paths around these galaxies. It's mind blowing!</p>
<p>The NY Times have a video on this very phenomenon here:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The bending is called gravitational lensing, and aside from blackholes, a sufficiently large clump of matter can also exert gravity, i.e. a cluster of galaxies, strong enough to bend light.
