		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The colour of an object is determined by the wavelength(s) of the light that it emits or reflects. If you take an object that doesn't emit visible light on its own, then the visibility of the object is purely caused by reflection of light from other sources.</p>
<p>Depending on what the object is made of, it will reflect some wavelengths of light, while absorbing others. In general, we say that an object is red if it primarily reflects red light and absorbs other wavelengths.</p>
<p>So in that sense, the colour of an object is indeed determined by the non-absorption of specific wavelengths. But what ultimately determines which colour we see is the wavelength of the light that hits our eyes. When we look at a red object, all light other than red is absorbed and only red light is reflected towards our eyes.</p>
<p>But when we look at a laser or other light source, we directly see the light that it emits. So a red laser emits red light which eventually enters our eyes. In this case, there is no absorption or reflection required.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are confusing the concepts of additive and subtractive color. When we talk about the color of light or a monitor we are talking about additive color. So we can add red light to green light to blue light and create white light. </p>
<p>Subtractive color is really the same thing, only you start with a surface that reflects all the light and add dies to selectively absorb specific wavelength. But instead of naming these dyes by what they absorb, we name them by what they let pass, because this is what we see. We try to find ink that absorbs just red, or just green, or just blue light. But those dyes are named cyan, magenta, and yellow respectively.</p>
<p>So a red laser emits red light. To print an image of that laser you would add magenta and yellow dyes together on paper, which would absorb most of the green and blue light from a white source and leave the red light to reflect back from the paper.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer your question &quot;wouldn't a red laser consist of every color except red?&quot; ... the answer is no. One of the important properties of a laser is that it emits monochromatic light, or light of only one color. Using a few key concepts of laser theory, we can explain why that is.
A laser is composed of an active medium (either a solid, liquid, or gas) that has its electrons excited by a secondary mechanism (perhaps an electrical current or an optical pump). As energy is pumped into the active medium of the laser, the electrons rise to a higher/excited state. Some of these electrons will spontaneously fall back down to lower state. In the process, the electron will emit a photon of light. The laser process begins when this photon hits another electron that is still in the excited state. This stimulates the emission of another photon. This process is a key concept of laser theory known as &quot;stimulated emission.&quot; There are now 2 photons, each with the same wavelength. These 2 photons will each strike another electron, creating a total of 4 photons of the same wavelength. Each of these 4 photons will go on to strike another electron and so on, causing a chain reaction. The light that is ultimately emitted by the laser is made up of photons all of the same wavelength and, hence, the same color. Lasers come in all sorts of colors, depending on the specific wavelength of the photons within a given medium. For example, a HeNe laser (helium-neon) has a wavelength of about 632 nm and produces red light, while an argon laser has a wavelength of 488 nm and will produce blue light!</p>
<p>Additional fun fact: LASER is an acronym for &quot;light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation!&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's possible for photons to bounce off of each other, but it's extremely rare. And I'm pretty sure it's more likely for a red laser to reflect blue light than red light. So if you want to know its color in the sense of what bounces off of it, it's an extremely transparent blue.</p>
<p>But generally people define the color of light by the wavelength and the color of physical objects by the wavelengths of light they emit (whether from glowing or just having light bounce off of them).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of colour systems: additive and subtractive. The system most people here are describing is subtractive. Taking pigments out of the light reflecting off a surface, and only reflecting a specific wavelength.</p>
<p>This is not how laser pointers work. Lasers are emmited from a diode that creates red light. We call this an additive colour system. </p>
<p>Additive systems are used by any light based colour system. An LCD TV for instance uses a combination of colours (rgb) to create aNy desired colour. </p>
<p>Red laser pointers streamline this process by emitting only red light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
