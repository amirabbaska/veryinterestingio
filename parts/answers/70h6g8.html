		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Make a fart noise with your lips! Now make a different sounding fart noise! Fun right? Well you're able to make this sound because when you breathe out and let your lips flap together, there's lots of vibrating going on, and vibrations are where sound comes from.</p>
<p>Now you don't have another set of lips down your throat, but you do have some skin flaps down there at the opening of your lungs. They sort of work like your lips: they keep some things out (food, water, spiders that climb into your mouth when you sleep, etc), and let other things in (air, marijuana smoke, etc). Also like your lips, these flaps make noise when you let air pass through them in a certain way. This is called...your voice!</p>
<p>So what happens when you lose your voice? Well try to make a fart noise with your lips again but this time, hold your lips very tight. Harder to do right? Now try with your lips loose goosey. Same thing: air is going out, but no sound. That's because your skin flaps, or lips, aren't flapping and making vibrations.  The same thing is going on way down in your throat when you lose your voice. For some reason or another, these flaps aren't...flapping. You could have a swollen throat, or there could be something caught down there that's preventing the vibrations from being made.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you don't necessarily need those flaps to speak! You just need air flow and your other set of flaps, aka your lips, your tongue, and the rest of your mouth! This is why you can usually still whisper clearly when you've lost your voice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your voice is created by two flaps of tissue in your throat called vocal folds. Their primary functions are keeping food out of your lungs, phonation (making noise), and increasing thoracic pressure for lifting/shitting. These flaps are very small; only as big as your pinky nail. When they become swollen through infection and overuse the muscles in them can't bring the folds together to vibrate. Thus you cannot talk. Sometimes when the vocal folds cannot be brought together fully, small regions of the folds can come together to make incomplete vibrations and you get scratchy sounds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The vocal cords are a very thin tissue that vibrates quickly. When they get swollen they become heavier and can't vibrate properly.
The edema can usually come from over usage or from a viral throat infection that happens to attack the larynx. Usually this happens to people that work with their voices: on telemarketing, or teachers (job + laryngitis).
You cannot lose your voice from regular throat infections theoretically.
Other obstructions can interfere in a lower degree such as in sinusitis.
You can, of course, lose the voice because of other deformations such as cancer or other benign tumor that can appear on professional singers. Comum causes of larynx tumors are is smoking and the sexually transmissible HPV that can grow stuff anywhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your throat gets unwanted bacteria.
Your throat has these two flappy lips that vibrate when you attempt to talk
Your flappy lips does not like bacteria which when infected, makes the sound of a scratched throat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
