		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0707.4550" target="_blank">This is a relevant paper</a>. The flow of granular objects is very different from the flow of a liquid in terms of underlying mechanics (e.g., pressure vs. friction). So determining the flow rate is not a trivial matter. What follows is a short paraphrasing of a relevant section of the paper.</p>
<p>Dimensional analysis can get you a rough relation for the flow rate. For simplicity, suppose our &quot;hourglass&quot; is a right circular cylinder filled with sand, which flows out through a small hole punched in the bottom of the cylinder. There are ostensibly (at least) 5 parameters that enter the flow rate: the diameter of the cylinder (<em>D</em>), the height of the sand (<em>H</em>), the diameter of the hole (<em>r</em>), the diameter of each grain (<em>a</em>), and the local gravitational acceleration (<em>g</em>). </p>
<p>It turns out that experimentally you can determine that if <em>H</em> is large compared to <em>D</em> and <em>r</em> is large compared to <em>a</em>, then the flow rate is independent of all our parameters except <em>r</em> and <em>g</em>. By dimensional analysis, the speed <em>v</em> of the grains as they exit the hole must be proportional to (<em>gr</em>)^(1/2). The flow rate is proportional to this speed times the cross-sectional area, hence proportional to <em>vr</em>^(2) ~ g^(1/2)r^(5/2).</p>
<p>The time it takes for an hourglass to empty is inverse proportional to the flow rate, hence proportional to g^(-1/2)r^(-5/2). So, for instance, if a certain hourglass measures time <em>T</em> on Earth, it will measure 6^(1/2)<em>T</em> on the Moon (because the Moon's gravity is about one-sixth that of Earth). Hence a 1-minute timer on Earth becomes about a 2.5-minute timer on the Moon.</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Flow rate = Q ~ g^(1/2)r^(5/2), Total time = T ~ g^(-1/2)r^(-5/2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Consider this: how long would it take in zero gravity? Infinite time right? So now we have two data points, one in 1g, and one in 0g. Now based on those two alone we see that there does appear to be a relationship between gravity and hourgalss time, and a seemingly exponential one at that. Nothing better than a little thought experiment!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Non scientific but logical answer.  Since nothing falls at zero gravity everything will fall slower at lower gravity, meaning then that the hourglass would have to be calibrated for a specific gravity. In turn then, an hourglass calibrated at sea level would be inaccurate at high altitudes. FWIW, Captain Morgan has helped me see the gravity of this situation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
