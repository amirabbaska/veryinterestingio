		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons, one they're selling a smell, something that doesn't translate well over tv, print or radio. Second it's a smell, you either like it or you don't. </p>
<p>So what they're selling is an image of a lifestyle. For example Axe products are mostly marketed to young men, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WzTSE6kcLwY" target="_blank">buy their own products</a>. So axe commercials are, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfJJeVHt57o" target="_blank">wear this</a>, get lots of hot chicks fawning over you. Because that's what a young man (generally)wishes for. </p>
<p>Colognes that are marketed to older men, like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWkxd9KJ1uk" target="_blank">Polo</a> are mostly purchased by women. So the guy is always some suave fit guy who lives an active lifestyle, does cool things, and always loves the his woman. If you are male, what appeals to you in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soAO14BXAZU" target="_blank">commercial</a>? Probably almost nothing, you probably have very little interest in seeing a shirtless, fit, good looking guy. This commercial has a lot more interest to women, sophisticated well dressed guy, who looks even better at home. </p>
<p>Women's perfumes pretty much all sell the same fantasy. Wear this, and you'll have the perfect date with the perfect guy.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me be pretentious for a minute. One thing you have to bear in mind is that perfumery is an art form, and a lot of perfumers will sit down with the aim of not only making something that smells nice, but with the goals of any other artist in any other medium - expressing themselves, evoking an emotion or an experience. For example, I defy anybody to smell L'Air du desert marocain and not immediately have an image blow up in their head of those huge National Geographic spreads of the desert at night. </p>
<p>A fragrance might have a more concrete idea like &quot;tropical flowers, in abundance&quot; or &quot;figs with milk&quot;; or it might be something totally abstract, like Après l'Ondée which is called &quot;after the rain shower&quot; and smells pallid and sad and like a rainy morning, as described. Still, even without high aspirations (sometimes people will just sit down and go &quot;I want to do something cool with this almondy aroma chemical I like&quot; or &quot;okay, let's do a rose soliflore, but a modern one that won't make our target audience think of Grandma&quot;) I think most fragrances have a mood, the same as the most basic still life or landscape. &quot;Figs with milk&quot; could evoke comfort and health and sort of that New Age spa kind of vibe, or you could want to drown the wearer in honey and incense to accent the fig and make them feel like they're dying of decadence on a Mediterranean villa somewhere. Or you could make an astringent, bracing men's fragrance that accentuates the notes in a fig that come from a real plant, a fragrance that reminds people of the sap and leaves of the tree, like taking a walk among wild figs in nature ... you know, you can do a lot here. This is often how perfumers like Jean-Claude Ellena or whoever will approach their work.</p>
<p>This is the most representational that fragrances can get and I'm using that idea to illustrate a point, but for instance I smelled something called Safran Troublant once that paired saffron and vanilla and the smell was so weightless and so smooth that I couldn't smell it without thinking of a gliding motion ... you see, it has a mood, a feel. How you could represent that in a commercial? I don't know - figure skaters, ribbons of silk. You'd get close, at least. If you showed images of people climbing a mountain in a storm that would have nothing to do with what you got out of the fragrance at all.</p>
<p>So, you have the mood of the fragrance, or the mood they're aiming for, anyway. I wouldn't really take the fruity floral kind of fragrance (imagine that sugary crap put out by Justin Bieber and Lady Gaga's brands, for instance - that mood is just &quot;sexy, approachable, girlish, fun&quot; and not anything too complex, but it has a mood nonetheless) and advertise it with a lot of sturm und drang, same as a museum curator wouldn't put Van Gogh's sunflowers in a room full of paintings of Christ being tortured. It's just not what the fragrance is like.</p>
<p>You could say - well, a fragrance is just something that smells decent. Sure. And Monet's Woman with a Parasol is just a chick with an umbrella. Can you imagine Axe on a sixty-five-year-old professor of literature? The mood is wrong.</p>
<p>(Honestly, the more realistic answer is that a precedence was set a few decades ago with Calvin Klein's ads and now people in advertising feel like they can have fun and do something weird. But fragrance, being the most abstract form of art, is naturally going to lend itself to this.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ha. I write commercials for a living so maybe I can give you some insight. (Agency side representing many different companies.)  </p>
<p>First of all, throw all logic out the window. Don't try to build a foundation of reason and assume marketers do the smartest most logical thing to maximize their profits. They'd like to think so, but no. This is too subjective. Often the personality of the marketers making decisions plays a larger role than data or who they're marketing to.  </p>
<p>Each product category like automotive, fast-food &quot;Quick Service Restaurants,&quot; fashion, etc has a particular culture that's been built up over the years. There's an expectation of what an ad should be and they all (generally) try to mirror each other with small differences. Occasionally, someone has the guts to try something really different but most people generally just want to keep their jobs and feed their kids.  </p>
<p>This is why each car company does ads where they just rattle off car features in voiceover but also do &quot;brand&quot; ads that mix things up. Shoes used to be about technology until Nike set a convention that it's more about athleticism. Think about how every jewelry commercial is the same.  </p>
<p>So with fashion/perfumes they need convey a sense of luxury and upscale-ness. Somewhere down the line, someone decided that a cryptic, artistic approach would be appropriate and it must have worked well enough. Their boss liked it. It set a convention and was duplicated. It evolved over the years into what you see today. </p>
<p>That's why these damn perfume ads don't make sense across many different brands at many different companies.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People have addressed commercials that appeal to demographics, like axe or what not, but don't seem to have touched on the real weird stuff you're asking about.</p>
<p>These ones seem to me to exploit the same things that artists and musicians often do.</p>
<p>With clever word selection, combined with certain images and sounds, you can give someone a really strong impression and make it stick with them.</p>
<p>This seems to rely on a few things. </p>
<p>The first is things that have very broad associations, things that imply space, grand scenes, atmospheres, etc. The second is associating these with physical sensations and body stuff. The third is making it contradictory to some degree. Basically you want to string together words in a way that imply an enormous amount of other things, associate them with the body and sensations, and give the impression that they somehow fit together when they really don't. Then of course associate that with your product or brand. Stuff like this seems to get stuck in the brain way better than other things. I speculate the brain is constantly trying to reconcile it's model of the world with it's model of the body, so introducing very vague and broad things that touch on both make it get stuck churning over the nonsense data, which makes the product more memorable.</p>
<p>For example, take this lyric from Far From Any Road by The Handsome Family:</p>
<p>From the dusty mesa
A looming shadow grows
Hidden in the branches
Of a poison creosote
She twines her spines so slowly
Towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin
My fingers ran with blood</p>
<p>To me this song is very haunting, with the music and so forth of course. It implies broad open spaces, it's ominous, it implies both the beauty and violence of nature, it touches on sex/gender on a primal level, it's very textual with body and touch references. It implies some kind of broad unity and mystery of things, but you don't really know exactly what it's getting at, it's an impression that's difficult to articulate or categorise.</p>
<p>Dunno if any of that helped or made sense but there you go.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because you can't transmit smell over TV, and perfume doesn't really smell like much other than perfume.</p>
<p>If I show bacon sizzling in a pan on TV, your might not be able to smell or taste it, but you can imagine it pretty easily.  But if I show you a bottle of perfume, you have no idea, and most people who are super serious about fragrance don't have the vocabulary or experience to under a description like &quot;notes of orange, gunflint, flint, vetiver and benzoin.&quot;</p>
<p>So advertisers are kind of handicap when it comes to describing their product, so they have to get creative.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
