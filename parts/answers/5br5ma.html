		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Worked on a somewhat similar documentary and basically boils down to:<br><br><em> Telephoto lenses, which help you zoom in so you can stay far away.<br></em> Camouflaged hide-outs. These are often placed long in advance so the animals get used to them, the camera operators would live nearby or just in the hide-out. <br><em> Lots and lots (and I mean lots) of footage. Luckily most animals of the same species look similar enough that they could easily show different takes and different animals and you won't know (editing also helps this magic along)<br></em> And the biggest secret of them all: they often stage stuff if the animals are trainable or non lethal. Bit of special effects and voila, you wouldn't know the difference. <br><br><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jan/08/bbc-staged-nature-hidden-kingdoms" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jan/08/bbc-staged-nature-hidden-kingdoms</a> is a good example of why it is kept a secret, as you want your audience to think the footage shown is real. If they know that 1 shot is fake, why wouldn't the other shots be fake. Oftentimes what the filmmaker wants to show does happen in real life but is just nearly impossible to get on film within reasonable time. Although I imagine a production like Planet Earth has enough budget and time to just send out camera-operators and let them film until they get something cool.<br><br>EDIT: some formatting.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Cameras planted and running and left far away from humans won't bother the animals, and these days, you can store a ton of footage on these cameras, as well as control them and their rig remotely.  I wouldn't be surprised if they also had a more serious mobile power solution than the standard camera battery, and might have even taken some steps to de-scent the equipment.  <br><br>Beyond that, it's like regular hunting: scout the area and learn the patterns of the wildlife and where they will reliably hang out, and park your gear there and wait.  Wildlife videography, like big game hunting, is always an exercise in patience.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I heard David Attenborough say something along the lines of: the cameras are placed where they know at some point that species will be and they turn on and start recording the moment they detect movement.  Don't take it as fact and I'm sure there's more to it.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>It's also worth keeping in mind that the footage shown isn't necessarily put together in chronological order. Scenes of a snake chasing an iguana can be broken up by cuts to a single snake slithering. We assume that it's the same snake but that's not necessarily the case.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
