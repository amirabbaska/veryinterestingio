		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I make wildlife documentaries. This is an answer that I cut and pasted from a previous thread. I can't really say too much about long lens stuff cos I specialise on invertebrates. But for them what you do is use a mixture of sets and wild shot footage. You have certain things that you can't film in a studio and other things that you can't film in the wild. </p>
<p>This is an example of the <a href="https://youtu.be/qX6d7fDbJp8" target="_blank">former</a></p>
<p>And this the <a href="https://youtu.be/obS9hlkbRXA" target="_blank">latter</a></p>
<p>Say you want footage of the inside of a nest. You won't be able to get this in the wild without disturbing the animal. So you need to construct a specially made tank that will allow them to be calm relaxed and go about with their normal behaviour, but also allow you to light it and get good camera angles.</p>
<p>The footage of the wasp in the tunnel in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ySwuQhruBo&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">film illustrates</a> this. What I did was cut a sample tube in half, fill it with sand so it looked natural. Then stuck it to the side of an opti-White glass tank. Kept it in the dark till the wasp got used to using it, then once it had I just filmed away.</p>
<p>Another big thing is editing. You can use careful editing to make it look like the animal is seeing something that is not actually there. For example; the scene of the harvest mouse in Planet earth two, when it is being hunted by a barn owl. The mouse was almost certainly shot in a set and the owl in the wild. The two bits of footage were edited together to make it seem like the owl was hunting the mouse. When in reality they were probably shot days if not weeks apart. </p>
<p>Edit: I thought I would include a link to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjrEKGUcWUg&amp;t=" target="_blank">this video</a> which has a sort of making of bit at the end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of the shots are done in a studio mock up. If I remember correctly the scene in which the polar bear is giving birth to cubs. I'm sure there are a few more, but most of it is just waiting around for the shot considering planet earth 1 and 2 took roughly 10yrs to film each. </p>
<p>Edit: Some examples, Not Planet Earth specifically but BBC/David Attenborough documentaries. </p>
<ul>
<li>Tragopans - a kind of pheasant purportedly living in a Chinese forest - actually filmed in a wildlife park in Somerset for the series Wild China</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>clown fish shown hatching from eggs in David Attenborough’s Life series in 2009, in the ocean were in fact filmed in a tank built by Swansea University as part of a research project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a chameleon in Attenborough’s Life in Cold Blood in 2008 shown in the forest actually filmed in a studio as were leopard geckos shown mating in the desert</p>
</li>
<li>a stalk eyed fly, described as lying “dormant on the forest floor” in Life in 2009, was filmed not in a south east Asian rainforest but in a BBC studio</li>
</ul>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you got DVD at the end of each episode they show how they filmed some parts. It includes, helicopter(drones later) shots, hidden cameras, motion activated cameras(for snow leopards), people hiding for few days in small spaces filming through hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an example I know of where in order to get close enough to tigers and film them hunting without disturbing their behaviour they attached a camera to the top of an elephant and rode it around filming that way. </p>
<p>The tigers don't care about the presence of the elephants and adding a human/camera on top didn't seem to change this!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
