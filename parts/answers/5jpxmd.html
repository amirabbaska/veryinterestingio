		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both flu and chickenpox are viruses. However, the chickenpox virus is fairly stable, and once your body has 'learned' how to fight it (by making antibodies that kill it effectively) it then 'knows' how to kill it quickly the next time it enters the body.</p>
<p>However, the flu virus mutates rapidly, so you rarely get the same strain twice. This means the body is starting afresh each time you get the flu.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Getting the flu four times a year is abnormal. If you're really getting the flu four times a year, and not exaggerating, then that could be the symptom of something more serious. If you haven't already then you should go see your doctor and discuss this with them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chicken pox doesn't really change much. Flu however, there are many different strains and they're constantly changing. </p>
<p>Imagine it like this. A guy walks up to you and sucker punches you. You recognize him when he walks up to you in the future, so you can just punch him first. Now imagine he has a brother who wears disguises. You never really know it is the brother until you get sucker punched.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>long story short it is a different type of flu every time. the flu mutates very quickly sometimes in as little as 3 transmissions until it reaches a new strain. Chickenpox doesn't mutate nearly as fast and once you get it once your body can fend it off the next time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
