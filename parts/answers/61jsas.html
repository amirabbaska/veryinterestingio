		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe this is actually a thing? Atlantic Salmon also frequently have warnings put out about parasite risks. <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Livewell/homehygiene/Pages/salmon-parasite-warning.aspx" target="_blank">The NHS publishes warnings in the UK</a> about it. </p>
<p>Now you can get sushi-grade fish, of course, but that's fish that has been flash frozen to kill any potential parasites in the fish. That can also be done with Pacific salmon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work in an industry servicing Atlantic breeding farms and I can tell you, salmon here is not, in any way, parasite free. I would regularly see salmon swimming around with large pieces of skin and flesh missing. They do have methods to kill off the parasites in the breeding rings, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What information are you basing your question on?</p>
<p>99.5% of Atlantic Salmon is Farmed salmon. There is no longer a commercial Wild Atlantic salmon fishery. </p>
<p>Pacific salmon is Wild. There is a large fishery in Alaska, BC, Washington, Oregon and California. </p>
<p>Atlantic Salmon are more susceptible to disease because they are raised in Pens. I believe there biggest challenge is Sea Lice, which they are sharing with the Wild Pacific Salmon (not good).</p>
<p>Wild Pacific Salmon is as good as it gets. Salmon truly support the whole ecosystem of the West Coast and I will be eating salmon I caught off the west coast of Vancouver Island last summer for dinner tonight. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
