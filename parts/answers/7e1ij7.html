<p>The volume inside the event horizon at a given time is not well-defined. For some observers, the volume is infninte. For others it is finite and is equal to what you would expect (the volume of a sphere of radius R). And for some observers (like those who hover outside very far away) the volume is not even defined. The only number that is well-defined is the surface area of the event horizon, which is the same for all observers and equal to 4piR^(2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR: yes, sort of. But forget about the rubber sheet analogy.</p>
<p>The notion of the volume of a black hole is quite tricky. To talk about volume you need to talk about a portion of space at a fixed time, and &quot;at a fixed time&quot; is not straightforward when relativity comes into play, because it depends on who exactly is measuring time.</p>
<p>The problem is essentially that the interior of a black hole is a piece of spacetime; you cannot just take the &quot;time&quot; out of it. Now, normally this isn't a problem. A ball which is just sitting there also occupies a region of spacetime, because time always moves forward. But no matter what the ball is doing it is always possible to move in such a way that the ball is at rest with respect to you: even if the ball is being affected by all sorts of crazy gravitational or electromagnetic fields and moving all over the place, you simply hold on tight to the ball, ignore all the havoc around you, and measure its volume. In more sophisticated terms, there is always a (hypothetical) observer for whom nothing changes with time, at least as far as the ball is concerned.</p>
<p>Inside a black hole, it is not possible to do this. Everyone and everything must fall towards the singularity, so it is not possible for someone to just stand still with respect to the black hole and measure its volume like it is with the ball. So one possible answer is that there is no unique well defined notion of the volume of a black hole.</p>
<p>However, there is kind of one way to define what it means to take the interior of the black hole at a fixed time. Mathematically, the problem described above can be expressed as saying that inside the event horizon there is no timelike Killing vector to form spacelike hypersurfaces. However, there are spacelike Killing vectors closed under Lie brackets, which means that they are integrable, so in a sense the inside of the black hole can be covered with spatial sections which are the closest we're gonna get to taking the black hole &quot;at a fixed time&quot;. And, for the punchline, each of these hypersurfaces has infinite volume.</p>
<p>Conclusion: whether or not the volume is infinite or whether it is actually well defined is really a matter of definition. I believe that if you must assign the word &quot;volume&quot; to <em>something</em>, then yes, it is infinite. But the situation is much more subtle than the rubber sheet would have you believe, as is always the case.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
