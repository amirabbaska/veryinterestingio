		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I once wrote a longish answer, but since that thread has been deleted, here is a slightly adapted version of that explanation:</p>
<hr />
<p>The short answer is that many materials often appear darker when it is wet, because the water reduces the amount of diffuse reflection from outermost layer of that material. Since how &quot;dark&quot; we perceive a material to be depends on how much light it reflects towards our eyes, the net effect is that the object will now seem darker.</p>
<p>As a good example, we can look at fabric (e.g. cotton), which under high magnification looks <a href="http://aldpulse.com/sites/default/files/TUe%208.jpg" target="_blank">something like this</a>. As you can see the fabric is made up of a bunch of irregular micrometer sized fibers, the gaps of which are usually filled by air. Now what is important for the optical properties of the material is that the fibers and the air have different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Refractive_index" target="_blank">refractive indices</a> (about n=1.5 and n=1 respectively). This mismatch between the refractive indices gives rise to a lot of scattering, and because the length-scale of the variation is on the order of hundreds of <del>microns</del> nanometers (similar to the wavelength of visible light), the specific mechanism at play will be so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mie_scattering" target="_blank">Mie scattering</a>. Mie scattering has the property that light of all (visible) wavelengths is scattered more or less equally and it's the mechanism for why say paper appears white (as well as clouds or milk for that matter). </p>
<p>The net effect of the description above is that when air fills the pores in the fabric, you will get a lot of scattering events, which will result in a lot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffuse_reflection" target="_blank">diffuse reflection</a>. Now when you add water, the water molecules will displace the air inside the pores, and this is important because water  has a refractive index (n=1.3) closer to that of the fabric (n=1.5). Because you are reducing the refractive index mismatch, less light will be scattered, which means you will get less of the hazy reflection you get from dry fabric. Instead, more of the light will either be simply transmitted through the fabric, or it will bounce around in the fabric/water layer due to a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_internal_reflection" target="_blank">total internal reflection</a> <a href="http://imgur.com/ieX3QoH" target="_blank">as shown here</a> and eventually absorbed. The net effect is that the material will appear darker. As an aside, this is the exact same reason why <a href="http://timholtz.com/wp-content/uploads/a/6a00e39827d9ad8833015434440b5a970c-800wi.jpg" target="_blank">paper appears more transparent when wet</a>, since less scattering leads to a greater transmittance of light through the material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water cowering the rough surface of the stone makes a smooth layer on it, and the light reflected from the front surface of this water layer is dominated by specular reflection. Watching the surface at the proper angle at sunshine ( equal to the angle of incidence of the light) the surface appears very bright, otherwise it looks dark. Still there is diffuse reflection and scattering at the stone surface, but the irregularities of the stone are surrounded by water now. Reflection, both specular and diffuse, and scattering too, depend on the refractive indexes of the reflecting surface and of its surrounding, and the higher the difference between them the higher is the reflection. Your stones are dark by themselves, I mean that they would appear dark grey, almost black, when polished. I think the material is some kind of silica, and the refractive index is about 1.45-1,6. The refractive index of water is 1.33, that of air is 1. In case of dry stones, the difference between the refractive indexes is high, and the difference is much lower when the pores of the stones are filled with water.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thorough, correct answer in pdf form, from the point of view of physically based rendering: <a href="http://graphics.cs.yale.edu/site/sites/files/Wet.pdf" target="_blank">http://graphics.cs.yale.edu/site/sites/files/Wet.pdf</a></p>
<p>tldr: it's not only the water at the surface that's important, or the water that's absorbed into the material, but in fact both are important.  At the surface, you get some total internal reflection at the air water boundary, darkening the material (note the incorrectness of many other replies in this thread claiming that specular reflections are inherently darker; they are not).  Inside the material, for porous materials anyway tiny air pockets will be filled with water instead of air, which alters the scattering profile to be more forward scattering, causing light to penetrate deeper into the material, leading to more chances for it to be absorbed.  This is also why wet paper looks more transparent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>When you wet the material, you increase the number of paths photons can take so fewer of them hit your eye so the material looks darker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
