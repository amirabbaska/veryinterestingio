		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh, OK, I understand your problem.</p>
<p>First a bill's proposed, and it goes to the relevant committee to be reviewed, drafted, or kicked to the curb. </p>
<p>Once the committee decides how the bill will be worded, THEN the House of Representatives or the Senate (depending on where the bill originates) votes on it - publicly.</p>
<p>If the bill's passed, then the OTHER part of Congress (either the Senate or the House) also gets to vote on it, publicly, often editing the bill in the process.</p>
<p>THEN, if it passes, it goes back to the originating part of Congress (in our example, the House).  </p>
<p>If the revised bill passes, then the President signs it into law.</p>
<p>If it doesn't, it doesn't become law.</p>
<p>Of course, the House (in our example) may decide to tinker AGAIN with the revised wording, in which case if the revised revised wording's passed, it goes back to the Senate.</p>
<p>Lather, rinse, repeat. </p>
<p>So yeah, the &quot;secret&quot; part is just at the very beginning.  Not generally a big deal, unless the House and Senate don't read what's in the bill before they vote on it. Which happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Teekno and /u/refugefirstmate have the basic answers, but here is some additional information:</p>
<p>The US Constitution sets a few basic parameters for this:  (Article I, Section 5) </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Each House shall keep a journal of its proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such parts as may in their judgment require secrecy; and the yeas and nays of the members of either House on any question shall, at the desire of one fifth of those present, be entered on the journal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So there is no Constitutional requirement that anything other than the final votes on bills be public.  And indeed the full Senate did meet without the public being able to observe for the first few years (the first public gallery opened in 1795).   In the modern era, by Senate rules, almost all proceedings of the Senate are public and televised.   However, every few years <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_sessions_of_the_United_States_Senate" target="_blank">the Senate does meet in secret session</a>.  In the modern era, votes are always in public.</p>
<p>Likewise, by Senate rules, almost all committee meetings are open to the public.  (Usually, but not always, at least one of those committee must vote &quot;yes&quot; on a bill before it can be considered by the full Senate.)  In practice, the only major exception to the open meeting rule are when a Senate committee is considering matters related to military secrets.  Thus, the Senate Intelligence Committee meetings are usually closed, not open.  Nonetheless, when the Senate Intelligence Committee votes to propose a bill to the full Senate, by modern tradition they publish a public report and that report says which Senators voted in which way. </p>
<p>Note: Even closed sessions of the Senate and its committees typically have a stenographer (official recorder) present.  So future members of the Senate can look up what the previous Senators did.  As well, one day, such proceedings can still be revealed to history word for word, once it no longer poses a risk of exposing military secrets. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lobbyist here,</p>
<p>Okay so this bill was about the new cybersecurity program with as a security program tends to be hidden in secrecy so that you can not simply find the experts called to testify - like me (I was not called to testify for this particular bill). The reasoning for this is that in some committees (intelligence, defense, defense appropriations, and some select committees) routinely deal with classified information and the people called to testify (give information under oath) about the impacts of the proposed program or to recommend changes this will likely include lobbyists from most major cybersecurity companies, software and hardware developers as well as the electronic freedom foundation. </p>
<p><strong>The testimony helps the congressmen understand what exactly the impacts or problems are of the bill so they can change them and send a better more complete bill to the floor to vote. As a side note lobbyists testifying here are under oath and at penalty of perjury if they knowingly lie as well as the setting being very similar to a court room and testifying there.</strong></p>
<p>On to the smaller issues that you perceived as crooked you are half right. The opposition that was in the toilet almost certainly wanted to be there. If someone needs &quot;political cover&quot; to not oppose and abstain they will often simply not show up or excuse themselves from the vote. Senators have a staff of about 30 with 2-3 who tend to helicopter around them in and out of meetings who can take notes for them so debate can continue if a Senator leaves. However, if a vote is upcoming in committee (you know when a vote is scheduled) and a Senator has to leave the committee chairman will call a recess (just like in a court room) to allow a break for ten to fifteen minutes or even a week if necessary (health problems). </p>
<p>As a short aside the chairman can call a vote - this is considered very bad faith - with members missing if a quorum is present (a minimum number of participants from the group - usually just over half) and the bills or amendments passing is based off of those who are there so long as the minimum number of Senators are present. </p>
<h1>TL;DR: The meeting is handling classified information and that is why the committee room was sealed and secret, and the Senator wanted to be out of the room for political cover most likely.</h1></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
