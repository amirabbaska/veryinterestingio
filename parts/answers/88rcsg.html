		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good detective work. My wife's sister died in a motorcycle accident in Toronto, Canada. She'd changed her name, and had been largely estranged from her family for decades. There was no family in her home town anymore. My wife changed her name and we live a long way from their home town in the US.</p>
<p>Somehow that Canadian detective figured out that my wife was the deceased's sister. He would have had to dig through many years of records, received help from police in Ontario, Texas, California and Utah to track down my wife.</p>
<p>It took about 8 hours before the police in our town rang our doorbell to give us the news.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The police will investigate the identities of the victims. This can be done through identification found on them, the registration of the car, fingerprints, dental records, etc. Once they know who the person is, they will contact their family (called next of kin) and let them know what happened. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is one of the lesser known responsibilities of law enforcement. I've seen officers remain with the family for 8+ hours, it can affect everyone involved. If the family lives outside the jurisdiction of where the fatality occurred, the police department will contact the city where the family lives and they will conduct the notifications.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
