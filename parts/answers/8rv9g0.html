Inside carbon dioxide builds up, carpet and vinyl leech chemicals, mold spores are released, trash releases smells, and other chemicals and smells build up.  Your ducts are probably filthy too.

<p>Air conditioning doesn’t really do much to remove pollutants afaik. The filter will remove dust, and the removal of humidity may make it feel less “stuffy”, however I would imagine many smaller particles will go right through the filter, so it’s mostly just a comfort thing.</p>
<p>I recall reading that Britain added a rule to their building code recently to require that houses exchange their air with the outside every so often. It used to not be a problem, but as houses started being better sealed to save energy, it was also trapping pollutants inside and causing other issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
