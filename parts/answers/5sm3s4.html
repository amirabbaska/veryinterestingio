		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is an emergency failsafe where the boro√± control rods are suspended by electromagnets. If there is a power failure, or any other disaster, they drop into the chamber and kill the chain reaction. So nothing happens... 99% of the time. You can get a fukashima situation, where things are not up to code, and you get a leak, and then everyone gets slowly poisoned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, the plant wouldn't blow up, in a massive nuclear explosion.</p>
<p>It's actually very difficult to create a nuclear explosion, and you need some pretty exact conditions for it to go.</p>
<p>Pretty much the worst that could happen is radioactive contamination, and spread of radioactive materials over the local area + radio active particles spread over a much wider area.</p>
<p>Read up on the Chernobyl Disaster if you want an idea.  That wasn't an air-strike, but it was basically caused by an explosion in the reactor.  Effects, assumning your air-strike could actually hit the reactor, would be roughly similar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A) The core stays intact, only the cooling is affected: the reaction will be shut down automatically by the control rods and/or loss of coolant(moderator). If sufficient cooling can not be guaranteed, the core might melt and thus release radioactive material to the environment.<br />
Result: Potentially a lot of work cleaning up, especially the molten core. If cooling can be sustained the effects will be minimal.<br />
B) The core is hit directly and &quot;destroyed&quot;: The reaction will break down due to lack of moderator and/or because the fissile material is distributed over a large volume.<br />
Result: Lot of work cleaning up, especially the uranium distributed all over the environment.<br />
It might be easier and &quot;safer&quot; (in terms of guaranteed results) to attack a chemical plant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear engineer here. </p>
<p>The jet impact will not impact the reactor directly. The core will shut down, but the cooling systems may be impacted by the fires caused by jet fuel. </p>
<p>Every nuclear plant in the US complies with the b5b rule, which requires procedures and portable equipment for ensuring you can restore core cooling during this situation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to offer a thought about how unlikely this situation would actually occur.
Anyone who has the ability/technology to conduct a high precision airstrike would probably not do so because it doesn't offer any immediate tactical/strategic advantage. While we are allowed to attack &quot;Works containing dangerous forces&quot; under certain scenarios, it would be more advantageous to either occupy such a facility, or prevent its power from being distributed (such as the infrastructure the power travels along) </p>
<p>The risks associated with an airstrike would outweigh any gain, to any rational military commander. However, and most fortunately, those people who aren't concerned with mass collateral suffering don't have a real capability of causing that much damage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
