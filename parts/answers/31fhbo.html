		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I often go to the animal shelter in my city to take the dogs out for a walk. There was this adorable american bull terrier (or something like that) that the owner had kicked out of his car in a parking lot. The animal shelter named him Spooky for some reason and the dog would NOT listen to that name, he'd drag me through the park while I called his name to no avail. At one point the animal shelter put his picture on their facebook and one lady freaked out because it was her dog who she gave to a aquintance (who then left the dog in the parking lot). She refused to pick up the dog because she didn't want to pay for his stay (130euros). She said in the comments that his real name was Neo. Next time I took him for a walk he was pulling the leash again, dragging me behind him until I yelled 'Neo, stay!'. As soon as he heard his name his ears perked up, he started to waggel his stumpy piece of tail and stayed right next to me the entire walk, amazing sweet dog who got adopted a few weeks later :)</p>
<p>Edit: I've found an old picture of Neo :) <a href="http://imgur.com/gh6J1hA" target="_blank">http://imgur.com/gh6J1hA</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some dogs are smart, some are dumb as shit.  Had a chow/wolf hybrid that was damn smart, fucking stubborn too.  He had a couple nicknames but answered to Reggie and only answered to the few people he liked.  You could tell him to go find people if you taught him their name, go patrol outside too.  Difference between &quot;go outside&quot; and &quot;go get 'em!&quot; was a sight to see, he'd tear ass outside ready to kick ass.  Remembered everybody good or bad, was best buddies with the gas meter reader, loved kids, nice dog.  We lived in a decent area but for a couple years there were lots of break-ins and criminal shit going on.  Three burglars running from the cops hopped in our yard, dog took a kicking, tore them up pretty good &amp; cops got them.  Another time some crazy asshole hopped the fence and tried to break-in, dog tore him up pretty bad.  Guy came back over a year later, this time dog hopped the fence and tore him up.  That dog beat some ass in his 15 years, damn good dog.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dogs are capable of recognizing their names, and discerning it from other sounds.  Recent animal behavior studies have found that dog's brains behave in much the same way our brains do when someone says our name.  It appears that they are able to recognize that their name is not just another sound that someone is making, but is meant to specifically identify them.  </p>
<p>Edit: Fun fact -- cats have been shown to do this as well.  The research suggests that cats can also tell when you're using their specific name.  The reason they often don't react?  They don't care.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I'm talking to my dog he reacts when I say his name, and if I'm talking about him and say his name in the middle of a sentence, he'll look up at me. </p>
<p>My dog is not the brightest dog either, I mean I love him to bits but damn. If I watch a video and someone knocks on the door on screen, he'll run to the front door barking. If there's a dog barking on the TV, he'll run around the house looking for it. </p>
<p>On the flip side, I'll swear he's been lying on the couch, facing away from me (big corner suite) watching TV, and when someone on screen has thrown a ball his tail wagged. Lovable idiot. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ive had this discussion about words and things with my neighbor who owns a 22 year old Senegal Parrot. In my opinion is reacting to a word or sound really any different than how humans interact with speech? We hear a word and understand it's meaning. Animals may not understand on a deeper level like humans do when it comes to speech but I do believe they do understand certain meanings. One example is my friends bird will say goodbye when you tell him you are leaving. Does the bird understand goodbye? Well he uses it appropriately and even if it is a learned behaviour there is some type of cognitive recognition of how goodbye is supposed to be used.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
