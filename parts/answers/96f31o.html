		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>on the scale of the solar system, the sun is small enough it can largely be considered a point source. Now since we are starting from earth, which is in orbit around the sun, any satellite launched will also be in orbit around the sun. as long as something is orbiting the sun, it wont actually crash into the sun, just move in a ellipse around it. in order to actually crash into the dot that is the sun, the spacecraft would need to basically stop being in orbit and instead be in free fall. This requires shedding ALL of the lateral velocity, which earth has a lot of.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Earth orbits the Sun with about 30 km/s. To reach the Sun (or get very close), you have to cancel all this speed - accelerate backwards by nearly 30 km/s. That is too much for rockets. In addition to a very powerful rocket you need tricks like fly-bys at the inner planets to reduce your tangential velocity.</p>
<p>At the distance of Earth, the escape velocity from the Sun is 42 km/s (&quot;exactly&quot; sqrt(2) times the orbital velocity). To escape, you can accelerate forwards by 12 km/s. That is something rockets can do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a misconception about orbits. </p>
<p>Someone once told me if they ever somehow got stuck on the international space station, they would just strap on a parachute and “jump down”. </p>
<p>The thing is, orbits spin you away from the earth. You can’t make it to a lower orbit by jumping towards the earth. You need to rocket yourself in the opposite direction of the spin. </p>
<p>A further or closer orbit is determined by how fast you are going. Slow down a little and you are still orbiting, just at a lower altitude. </p>
<p>So if you did what that person told me was their plan, you’d barely make a dent in your speed and just circle the globe until your air ran out or you hit something. </p>
<p>Same idea with earth’s orbit. You can’t just jump at the sun. You need to cancel out the orbit to move closer. We are far enough away that one direction is easier than the other. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
