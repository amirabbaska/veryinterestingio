As it's labeled here, an electron gun injects a negatively charged beam into the exhaust in order to prevent the static charge you're talking about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially, after the ions are shot out, there is usually some form of electron gun that makes the plasma neutrally charged thereby conserving the voltage balance.  If you don't do this, you will have problems with the ions come no back and effectively negating any thrust that you initially produce.  Of course this is a bit of a simplification, but should nicely illustrate the point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The electrons are shot out separately from the ion stream and they end up meeting up with the ions and recombining with them.</p>
