<p>You can have baryons with uud, udd, uds, etc. Thereâ€™s six quark flavors, combine them any way you want.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the number of quarks in a hadron:</p>
<p>Quarks are held together by the strong interaction. Unlike particles charged under the electromagnetic interaction whose charge is fixed and never changes, a particle charged under the strong interaction can have one of three charges: red, blue and green. Antiparticles have the corresponding anticharges: antired, antiblue and antigreen. </p>
<p>Neutrality under the strong interactions means either a grouping of all possible charges or a pairing of a charge and an anticharge. Hence, you get baryons and antibaryons (three quarks of three antiquarks) or mesons (quark-antiquark pair). Pentaquarks (basically a baryon and a meson bound together) have also been observed but are highly unstable.</p>
<p>Baryons and mesons can be made up of any flavour of quark aside from the top quark, which decays before it can form a bound system. The uud combination is the only stable one, and udd is stable in a nucleus.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
