		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a songwriter, I'll just say that it's more difficult than you might imagine to accidentally create the same melody as someone else. This may be surprising since many of the most popular songs in the world use the same 2-3 chord progressions. There's a comedic team that does a medley of all the songs that use the Canon in D progression, and it's striking just how different the melodies are from one to the next, but they all work perfectly with the music.  </p>
<p>Now, sometimes you will get a similar melody for a few notes, sometimes you'll notice you're doing it, sometimes you won't. It wasn't until after I recorded a song for an album that I realized our chorus had the same three notes from the line &quot;Take On Me.&quot;  A few people joked about it but mostly not, because the rest of the song is so totally different, and it's three notes. It happens.</p>
<p>Even if you wrote a chorus with the exact same chord progression and tempo as another song, the chances of accidentally writing the same melody even for a few notes in a row is astronomical. If two songs sound similar enough to be copied, they probably are.  The thing is it can be unintentional. I heard a song in a store yesterday, no idea who or what it was, but it was hip-hop. The hook was catchy. 30 mins later I found my brain writing a song in another genre around that chord progression, though I had forgotten what the melody sounded like. I decided to forget it just in case more of the melody I was dreaming up was from that song than I meant it to be, and even if it was, nobody would have ever put the two together if I'd released it.</p>
<p>One funny story though, in regards to music and not vocal melody, Back in about 2005 I wrote an arpeggio riff that I played with guitar tapping; it was a breakdown-outro to a song. We recorded a demo of it but ended up leaving the song off the record we were writing because the rest of the song wasn't very good. Fast forward 11 years and the first half of that riff is now the theme for the Daredevil show on Netflix.  I still plan on using that riff in a song though, because it's good, and I wrote it first, dammit.  But do I think the composer copied me? Even if we'd released the song to the public, no, I would not think that.</p>
<p>Here's my riff: <a href="https://instaud.io/UNr" target="_blank">https://instaud.io/UNr</a></p>
<p>Here's the Daredevil theme, in the same key, no less: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFYFh8w4758&feature=youtu.be&t=17s" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFYFh8w4758&feature=youtu.be&t=17s</a></p>
<p>Edit: funny thing, I heard the same melody from the beginning of this part in a classical song on the radio today. </p>
<p>Edit 2: I just remembered another funny story, tangentially related. While writing that same album I mentioned, I had decided that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qvlJ-OJVFik" target="_blank">Escape from the Bomb House by Less Than Jake</a> was a great song and I would just rip it off. This happens fairly often too, and what I mean is that I liked the vibe of the song, I liked the chord progression, I liked the way I felt when I listened to it, and so I wanted to try to get as many of those same things together in a new song. This would probably mean using the same tempo and maybe some of the same chords, but that I'd fool around using that song as a base and eventually it would turn into something new. This is often how songs are written anyway, I'd end up writing something new while learning something else, so I decided I would do it on purpose this time.</p>
<p>Well anyway I get my guitar out and start figuring out how to play the song and am surprised to find that we had already written a song with almost the exact same chord progression from start to finish! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIykLzlIHNw" target="_blank">Stitches by Much The Same</a>  It's not exactly the same and it's in a different key, but if you're musically inclined you'll hear that if you removed the vocals and put it in the same key, the chord progression in the verses and choruses are almost identical.  The reason this is related is because despite these two songs being similar, and me being a big fan of one as we wrote the other, the melodies are worlds apart.</p>
<p>Of course I could not try to write another song with almost the same progression for the same album, so I dropped that idea. That brings us to now, when we are writing our newest album, and it turns out that two of our new songs, written by the same guy, are almost the exact same chord progression as each other, in the same key, enough that as we're learning them I keep getting them mixed up.  Like so similar the way those two Nickelback songs can be played on top of each other.  But they're both really good in their own way, and nobody would be likely to notice the similarity unless they tried to learn them on guitar, so whatever. =)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>you don't. </p>
<p>basically, copyright law is against <em>copying</em>; if you come up with the exact same melody by yourself, then it's fine, as long as you can prove that. </p>
<p>to prevent people from abusing this, there's a rule that if you've had access to (heard, for example) a previous creation (in this case, the song) and your work is similar to that previous creation, then it will be presumed that you did copy and you have to prove you didn't (not easy). you can also be found to have &quot;subconsciously copied&quot;. </p>
<p>balancing this is the rule that if you didn't <em>intentionally</em> copy, you won't be required to pay damages, only enjoined (ordered by way of injunction) to stop infringing the original copyright (so you can't sell your song etc.)</p>
<p>so if your song sounds similar to a popular one, you probably will be stopped from doing much with it even if you didn't consciously copy, but you won't have to pay crazy sums or anything unless you obviously intended to copy and profit from the original. </p>
<p>edit: there are some other replies that say you can't copyright a melody. this is untrue; there is one copyright subsisting in the lyrics and another in the melody. this is why song credits list the songwriter/composer separately.</p>
<p>second edit: the first edit is true in the UK and Australia. there's a comment somewhere here which apparently says that that's not the case in the US, but I can't tell for sure (don't know much about US IP law).</p>
<p>third edit: some people are asking &quot;what about beats/chord progressions etc.&quot;</p>
<p>basically, there's this concept of an idea-expression dichotomy in copyright law. copyright protects expressions, not ideas. to illustrate, if I told everyone to write a love story, they would probably come up with fairly different things. the idea here is &quot;love story&quot;, but each writer has come up with a different <em>expression</em> of that idea, and each individual expression has its own copyright.</p>
<p>the simpler an expression, the closer it is to the idea, and the more difficult it is to prove infringement of the copyright protecting that expression. the reason is that if you protect the idea, you basically give the holder of the copyright a monopoly over <em>every single expression of that idea</em>. so, in my love story example, that would mean that if I had copyright in it, I would be the only person who could ever write love stories, or allow anyone to.</p>
<p>stuff like chord progressions and beats are very, very close to ideas. for example, the simple I-IV-V-I can be played slow or fast, loud or soft, on the trombone or the glockenspiel, in A Major or F# Major, etc.. when you step so close to an idea, you would have to copy someone more or less wholesale to be liable for copyright infringement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a professional musician, and I have an issue with Deja Vu where I often believe the things I write or play, I've heard before. The thing I and my mates have found is that there is always a 90% chance someone has played the same progression of notes, chords, or rhythms, but rarely the combination of the three. So it is highly likely that there are chunks of songs that sound really similar all the time. But most of the time, the connection is never made, nor do people WANT to make it made. Much like politics, it's not illegal to be unaware. If it looks like you are copying large chunks of lyrics and music, there are unwritten rules about whether or not you get sued; like when Van Halen was informed that their song &quot;Jump&quot; sounded really close to an Australian 70s band, they just said &quot;Well, oops.&quot; The pursuit of any dispute was tossed because &quot;Jump&quot; is a million times more famous and popular. So, technically, if you do accidentally copy a riff note-for-note, just become the most popular version of the song.  There is a website that makes a list of a lot of &quot;Suspiciously Similar Songs&quot; and most of them make no mention of lawsuits. <a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SuspiciouslySimilarSong/Music" target="_blank">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SuspiciouslySimilarSong/Music</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a pretty real worry for a lot of songwriters, who have to consider carefully if they've actually come up with something new, or if they'e suffering from cryptamnesia where they've simply forgotten where something came from.</p>
<p>Paul Mccartney famously spent weeks shopping his melody for 'Yesterday' around people in the music biz, seeing if anyone had heard it before.</p>
<p>Even if it does happen, there are ways for them to amicably handle any claims through the music industry's crediting and royalty system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't, and it happens often. The same thing happens in literature as well - Isaac Asimov once wrote a short story very similar to one which existed, and it so happened he had that book in his personal library although he may have never read it. </p>
<p>Generally speaking the done thing in this situation (and the only legally sound thing, unless the other person is kind rather than greedy) is to give royalties despite the fact that you've done nothing wrong - which is what Asimov did, and many other artists who've been in that situation.</p>
<p>This is similar to how people have been punished for plagiarism for having accidentally typed a sentence which has been typed before - it does happen, although in that situation you're kind of fucked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
