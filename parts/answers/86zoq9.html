<ol>
<li>
<p>Insect muscles are actually strikingly similar to vertebrate muscles!  But some insects that have very fast wing beat frequencies ( think bees, flies, some beetles) have specialized &quot;myogenic&quot; muscles.  The major difference between these muscles and our own is that normally one nerve signal corresponds to 1 muscular contraction.  But these insects have evolved specialized muscles for which one nerve pulse can initiate multiple contractions thereby increasing  the contraction speed.</p>
</li>
<li>Insects do seem to have proportionally stronger muscles, this boils down to a fundamental constrain on the power of muscles as they get larger.  Usually a muscle's contractile force is limited by the cross section area of the muscle (this has to do with the number of sarcomeres acting together).  So as a muscle gets wider the cross section area is pi*radius^2 (note the square on the coefficient).  But as muscles get larger the mass of the muscle scales with the volume of the muscle (mass ~ radius^3).  So as muscles get bigger the power scales to the square of the radius and the mass is proportional to the cube of the radius.  This means that a small insect like an ant has a lot of power per small amount of muscle compared to a relatively larger animal like a human</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a physicist I can only argue that all smaller animals are proportionally stronger, since muscle strength depends on the crossection of the muscle, which scales roughly with the square of the size of the animal, while weight scales roughly with the cube of the size. Hence the smaller the animal the easier it is to be stronger in relation to it's body wheight. As to how their muscles are structurally different I don't know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, insects have muscles. They are very much the same as ours in general structure, using elongate multinucleate skeletal muscle cells containing actin and myosin proteins to contract. Same as humans. This similarity is likely due to a common ancestry for all muscle cells across widely divergent groups of animals. <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/06/120628145626.htm" target="_blank">See this article</a>. Muscles evolved long ago, and all arthropods (including insects) and vertebrates diverged from these ancestral animals.</p>
<p>Because insects have an exoskeleton, how the muscles work in terms of their mechanical operation is slightly different, but they are still used in antagonistic pairs (pairs of muscles that allow a limb to both flex and extend).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.studyblue.com/notes/hh/biceps-brachii-causes-flexion-elbow-triceps-brachii-causes-extension-elbow-so-aan/026121362896562487" target="_blank">In humans, the inner arm muscle flexes the limb</a></p>
<p><a href="http://ib.bioninja.com.au/_Media/insect-leg_med.jpeg" target="_blank">In insects, the inner leg muscle extends the limb</a></p>
<p>The reason insects can carry proportionally more weight has to do with their small size alone. This is explained by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square%E2%80%93cube_law" target="_blank">&quot;square-cubed law&quot;</a>. When applied to this question, it tells us that muscle strength is based on the cross-sectional area of the muscle and scales roughly with the square of an animal's size, while weight depends on volume (and gravity) and scales roughly with the cube of an animal's size. So smaller animals can lift more multiples of their own body weight.</p>
<p>It may be easier to understand with some math (just be aware that this is proportionality, not an equality):</p>
<pre><code>bodyWeightLiftRatio = muscleStrength / bodyWeight</code></pre>
<p>which is (roughly):</p>
<pre><code>bodyWeightLiftRatio = bodySize^2 / bodySize^3</code></pre>
<p>And if you simply that:</p>
<pre><code>bodyWeightLiftRatio = 1 / bodySize</code></pre>
<p>In other words, how much of your own body weight units you can lift is inversely proportional to your size. This is also why there is an upper limit to the size of land animals. At some point, they can no longer support their own weight.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a zoology standpoint I can try to explain this. All animals have muscle cells. Insects are very complex (phyla arthropod)! They have an exoskeleton, which is quite light and they have segmented bodies (think of our arms and legs, but repeat joints that can move independently of the other). The exoskeleton provides this hard layer between the soft tissue that allows it so their muscles aren't doing much work to support their bodies so they can hone in on lifting. (It helps here that their bodies are so light) Segmentation allows for better motility too with the connection of hard and soft tissues. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>3rd year medical physiology student in the UK</p>
<p>I’m currently doing a dissertation titled “how passive muscle forces in the metathoracic leg of Schistocera gregeria change with ageing”. Essentially my work is looking at how much passive force is generated and stored in the hind leg of a desert locust without any neurological input. The work involves dissection of the hind leg from the thorax of an adolescent 5th instar locust and an adult locust and measuring how the muscles and the force generated by them passively without signals firing to the muscle, effect the resting position of the limb in space, through dissecting muscle and tendon tissue in the Femur of the insect.</p>
<p>Much like a human a locust has the majority of its muscle mass located in its hind (lower) legs with the rest of the muscle being banded around the abdomen to contact and relax to allow for breathing by flowing air through small holes many species of bugs have called spiracles.</p>
<p>There are 2 main muscle bodies in the hind leg which are the Extensor muscle (making up 66% of total leg muscle mass) and the Flexor (33%) and these muscle groups are made up of actin and myosin filaments similar to that found in humans. Filaments of these structural proteins overlap using essentially the same biomechanical means as a human, through calcium mediated binding and unbinding of myosin and troponin heads on these filaments to contract and relax the muscle.</p>
<p>That being said, the muscle in the leg weighs only 1/20th of the total locust’s weight yet it is able to jump on average, for adults in ideal conditions with their wings clipped to prevent flight (dry and hot, around 37 degrees Celsius) about 2.5m, which is almost 40x it’s body length! That’s like a 6 foot tall person leaping half an Olympic 110m hurdles track in 1 bound.</p>
<p>How is this possible? Well a substructure in the leg called the Semi-Lunar Process, located at the Femoral-tibia joint, can store vast amounts of kinetic potential energy due to being made of a special kind of cartilage, prior to a jump.
Before the initiation of the strong kick, a locust contracts both its flexor and extensor muscle’s, which in turn compresses the semi-lunar process  horizontally (much like how a human and flex their forearm to the upper-arm at 90degrees and harden both their triceps and biceps muscles, except the locust leg is “co-contracted at its most flexed position). </p>
<p>Sudden relaxation of the flexor muscle releases all the energy Stored in the semi-lunar process, which the extensor muscle fully contracts, flicking the tibia into the ground at tremendous speed and extending the hind leg, which makes the locust leave the ground feeling the force of as much of 20G’s as it does this! </p>
<p>TLDR; Locust leg muscle is highly similar to that of humans in terms of biomechanics and protein makeup, however the addition of a sub structure known as the semi-lunar process allows for explosive release of kinetic potential energy, a structure humans lack, which enable them to jump many times their body length whilst having the same equivalent leg muscle mass compared to total body mass as humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
