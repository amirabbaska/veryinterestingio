Because two of the branches are very short, they can lie next to each other, creating the appearance of a Y under a microscope. However this is a coincidence! The name &quot;Y&quot; was chosen because it follows X, which was originally thought to be the sex-determining chromosome.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Y_chromosome" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Y chromosome was identified as a sex-determining chromosome by Nettie Stevens at Bryn Mawr College in 1905 during a study of the mealworm Tenebrio molitor. Edmund Beecher Wilson independently discovered the same mechanisms the same year. Stevens proposed that chromosomes always existed in pairs and that the Y chromosome was the pair of the X chromosome discovered in 1890 by Hermann Henking. She realized that the previous idea of Clarence Erwin McClung, that the X chromosome determines sex, was wrong and that sex determination is, in fact, due to the presence or absence of the Y chromosome. Stevens named the chromosome &quot;Y&quot; simply to follow on from Henking's &quot;X&quot; alphabetically.</p>
<p>The idea that the Y chromosome was named after its similarity in appearance to the letter &quot;Y&quot; is mistaken. All chromosomes normally appear as an amorphous blob under the microscope and only take on a well-defined shape during mitosis. This shape is vaguely X-shaped for all chromosomes. It is entirely coincidental that the Y chromosome, during mitosis, has two very short branches which can look merged under the microscope and appear as the descender of a Y-shape.</p>
