		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Turkey produces and transports a significant amount of oil. Most of the effort in securing this oil is to ensure that nobody steals it or disrupts its delivery, but very little infrastructure exists to ensure that illicit oil is not being added to the system.</p>
<p>Before oil ever makes it into a pipeline or a ship, it has to be transported from its site of origin to a terminal. There are small ground-based wells all over the region and their production is not well regulated. A small operator can simply overreport production and then send a tanker of oil from a different, illicit well and take a sizable kickback for very little work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your two questions are related to two very lucrative areas of the black market. Your answers will have to be in broad strokes, because if details were so well known, then it wouldn't be a very effective black market.</p>
<p>Where is the oil going?
The majority of oil that ISIS sells actually gets sold within Iraq, while some does make its way around Syria, Turkey, and Iran, especially to Kurdistan areas. These areas have long had established smuggling routes for things like oil (from trying to establish a Kurdish state within Iraq etc.) The reality is that some of the &quot;opponents&quot; of ISIS are buying this oil indirectly, though likely with some knowledge of where it comes from.</p>
<p>They may make AS MUCH as 3 million a day, but the proper estimates are around 1-2 million. That isn't really that much in the big picture. </p>
<p>Who sells the oil?
ISIS individuals sell the crude oil at a discounted rate (about 25% or less normal market value) to brokers. These brokers are the ones who resell this oil at about double the value they purchased it to more legitimate local sources and communities where it can be refined and used very cheaply. ISIS from these same brokers can buy refined oil/gasoline to use and resell in their territory, in addition to the hard cash they receive.</p>
<p>Why can't their opponents stop it?
That needs two answers:
1) Stop creation of the oil - They can. That is extremely easy, but the U.S. and others do not want to do that because of the immense loss of infrastructure destroying oil wells and refineries under ISIS control would cause in the long run. Also, a lot of smaller communities and especially those under ISIS control rely on these sources of income. There would be an incredible amount of regional hardship to just destroy the oil production.
2) The smuggling and selling - It is hard to do because there are a lot of small deals going down and it is a lot of ground to cover and monitor. It also is because, unfortunately, some of the regional players who are &quot;opposed&quot; to ISIS are not willing to crack down because if people in their country are getting oil at half the price or better for heat and what not, the reaction to losing that outright or facing drastically higher prices is not ideal.</p>
<p>Hopefully that covers your basic question. I will respond to the arms market one in an edit. That is a totally different ball game, though I have a little bit more knowledge on that front so hopefully I can help you understand. If you have any need for clarification just ask.</p>
<p>EDIT -
The ISIS arms situation is not simple, nor something we have an excessive amount of information about right now. In short, they get their weapons and ammunition in two ways: 1) Captured from Iraqi and Syrian military bases and outposts, and 2) Buying it on the black market.</p>
<p>The first one is kind of well known as an issue, when Iraqi units several months ago were just surrendering their posts and equipment, a lot of which is from the U.S. and quite advanced. That said, ISIS is not actually USING most heavy or high-technology stuff they capture, instead just destroying it. That's for two simple reasons: They cannot operate it (not trained how, tanks are not just some car) and they cannot maintain them (parts and mechanics are lacking). </p>
<p>What ISIS prefers is the standard militia group's bread and butter, small arms and light weapons. These can come from a lot of places, but we know that Syrian fighters and indeed ISIS have likely gotten support through back-channels from Gulf countries. They either export arms directly, or acquire it in Croatia or other MAJOR black market arms exporters in Eastern Europe and it lands in Turkey. Moving it across the border into Syria is then not difficult.</p>
<p>The private and black arms market is incredibly complicated and incredibly, well, immoral. Money talks, not your ideology. That is how they are getting continued support. Governments may be opposed to ISIS (or at least say they are), but black market business certainly is not, at least in some cases.</p>
<p>The combination of captured arms of Iraq, Syria, and illegal arms from Croatia (some made in the U.S.) and Saudi Arabia/Gulf States has made ISIS very heavily armed with a wide diversity of weapons which are dangerous, but they cannot use them all so to speak.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Wall St Journal had a really good article about this recently.  I don't know if this answers all of your questions but it gives a good timeline of what takes place.  If you have WSJ access the article is here: </p>
<p><a href="http://online.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-funds-push-into-syria-and-iraq-with-labyrinthine-oil-smuggling-operation-1410826325" target="_blank">http://online.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-funds-push-into-syria-and-iraq-with-labyrinthine-oil-smuggling-operation-1410826325</a></p>
<p>If not, here are some of the highlights:</p>
<p>&quot;<strong>The route begins with oil fields run just a few years ago by Western energy giants and now controlled, along with fuel-smuggling operations in Syria, by the Islamic State</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>The militants truck oil drawn from those fields or stolen from pipelines to rudimentary refineries</strong>, according to Syrian human-rights activists, Western and Turkish government officials, and a Syrian businessman involved in the trade.</p>
<p><strong>The refined products are sent to the Turkish frontier, where they're hauled over the border by trucks, horses or mules</strong>, according to these accounts. <strong>Fuel has also been floated across rivers on rafts or pumped through underground pipelines before finding its way to markets across southern Turkey.</strong></p>
<p>Initially, Turkey largely turned a blind eye to the illicit fuel trade, which ramped up at the start of the Syrian uprising in 2011 <strong>along smuggling routes that have existed for decades.</strong></p>
<p>Even as the Islamic State, also known as ISIL or ISIS, solidified its control of the trade, Ankara shied away from an overly aggressive stance. The militant group has been holding 49 Turkish diplomats since June 11 and has released videos depicting grisly executions of battlefield prisoners and hostages, including the beheading of two U.S. journalists and a British aid worker.</p>
<p><strong>Oil fields it controls are producing an estimated 100,000 barrels a day</strong>, or about 3.2 million gallons, according to analysts and a Western official familiar with the operationsâ€”about as much as Sudan.</p>
<p><strong>Much of that is refined and smuggled out to neighboring countries. The revenue can bring in as much as about $2 million a day</strong>, estimates Luay al-Khatteeb, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center.</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, the Turkish military says security forces have confiscated more than 3,540 gallons of fuel, over 2,300 meters (1.4 miles) of <strong>pipe used for smuggling fuel, and other equipment at the Turkish-Syrian border. </strong></p>
<p><strong>The fuel emerges from fields in eastern Syria once operated by France's Total SA and Royal Dutch Shell, which both left the country in 2011 amid spiraling violence. </strong></p>
<p>In late 2012, the Western-backed rebel group the <strong>Free Syrian Army took control of the Deir ez-Zor fields, and then the Islamic State seized them this year.</strong> Representatives of the foreign companies that once operated there say they have no information about the state of the fields now. But <strong>many local employees stayed on, keeping the oil pumping as the facilities changed hands between rival factions</strong>, according to Syrian activists in the region and recent video of the facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Crude from these fields, as well as oil stolen from tapped pipelines and from other fields across the country, is processed into low-quality fuels, including diesel, in a number of makeshift refineries in Islamic State-controlled Raqqa province</strong>, according to human-rights activists from the region and the businessman involved in the trade.</p>
<p>The largest of these plants is near the town of Akrish, the location of a major pumping station along a pipeline transporting oil from fields in Hasakah province.</p>
<p>In 2012, Syrian businessman Mohamed Dada saw an opportunity. He said he spent about $860,000 buying Turkish- and Iranian-made equipment to build four small refining plants near the Syrian border town of Tal Abyad. Earlier this year, however, Islamic State militants seized the Tal Abyad refineries, according to Mr. Dada and Ibrahim Muslem, a human-rights activist familiar with the region. Mr. Dada, who now lives in Turkey, says his equipment was moved from Tal Abyad to neighboring Tal Suluq, a town located at a major crossroad between eastern and western Syria.</p>
<p>Several rebel groups, including the al Qaeda affiliate Jabhat al-Nusra, held sway at different times in Tal Abyad, but Mr. Dada and other Turkish and Syrian businessmen ran the operation, he said. He didn't pay the rebels, but promised to buy crude from some of them. He said his drivers often had to pay for access to rebel-controlled roadsâ€”anywhere from $500 to $1,000.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Dada said his plants are still operating, but they are under the direct control of Islamic State militants</strong>, based on conversations he's had with people still working there.</p>
<p>Mr. Dada, who estimates that he lost about $2.5 million, including the money he sunk into the plants, pipelines, depots and five tanker trucks, said about a third of his former employees work at the new location, but the rest fled to Turkey.</p>
<p>&quot;Abu Luqman decides who gets the oil,&quot; Mr. Muslem said.</p>
<p><strong>At Mr. Luqman's discretion, smugglers pay for fuel and load it into tanker trucks. Refined products from the Akrish refinery are driven more than 200 miles to Syrian villages near the Turkish border</strong>, according to Mr. Muslem. <strong>The fuel from Mr. Dada's operations was also being trucked to Turkey when he was in charge. Now, though, it makes its way to Islamic State-controlled parts of Iraq</strong>, including Mosul, Mr. Dada said.</p>
<p><strong>In Syrian towns along the Turkish border, trucks are unloaded and some of the fuel is repackaged into smaller containers, according to the Turkish military, local residents and drivers. Some makes its way into Turkey in small, plastic jerrycans, which mules carry over a maze of roads. in largely unpatrolled hills and olive groves</strong></p>
<p>Some of the fuel is driven through legitimate border crossings, hidden on trucks or farm equipment, like tractors, that pass back and forth across the border legally. <strong>Turkish authorities have also found underground pipelines</strong>, some as long as 3 miles (4.8 kilometers), under the hilly border. In a Sept. 9 raid, the Turkish military said it confiscated fuel from a 300-yard-long underground pipeline.</p>
<p><strong>Smugglers also load up rafts with diesel-filled jerrycans and float them across the Orontes river</strong>, near Hacipasa. <strong>Once across the border, it is sold by residents in the southern Turkish towns of Hatay province at local markets for discounts of as much as 30% to legitimately sourced diesel</strong>, according to drivers and Hatay residents.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This will get lost, but as someone who has worked extensively in conflict minerals I know this applies. </p>
<p>To be hones it's done in the way that conflict minerals are brought to market. </p>
<p>For example, say you owned a nickel mine in South Africa. I show up and go hey /u/notBrit I got 80 truck loads of tin from the Congo, but see I can't sell it on the open market for various reasons, how about you buy it from me for 1/4 or 1/2 the market value and we say it came from your mine? You go, hey that is great, sounds good and draw up some paperwork showing how you got an extra 80 truck loads of Tin from your mine over the last quarter.  You sell this tin to some smelter (which aggregates Tin from around the world) that sells it to GM, which has all this fancy paperwork showing that its Tin came from South Africa and is conflict free and has absolutely no trail to the 10 million dollars in new arms that Congo Warlords just bought with a illicit tin sale. </p>
<p>That actually happens in real life.  </p>
<p>So, in this case, some guy goes to a refinery or another oil field or a sympathetic company/country/friend and goes &quot;Hey, we got some high grade oil that we need to sell but we can't sell it on the open market, want to buy it at 50% markoff&quot;  </p>
<p>This guy does not know if it comes from ISIS, Iran or some OPEC country which needs a little extra cash on the side, some Saudi Prince who wants another villa, a country trying to buy arms that wants to do it on the down low ect (all valid sources of discounted oil) so he says sure and voila a few tankers of oil show up a day extra in the 100-1000+ tankers that show up daily to that refinery and no one has any idea.   This is basically how resources that need to be sold are sold on grey markets around the world. No one asks questions because as a refinery which is already making a pretty close profit margin, a few tankers of oil @ 50% world price helps a lot. Not to mention the paperwork needed to validate these sales is laughable and is all that is required to bring it to Western Markets. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
