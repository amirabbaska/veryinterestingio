		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Singaporean here, thought I wanted to share a bit about the Asian perspective on this. </p>
<p>FYI, we're a multiracial country, Chinese, Malay, Indian and Eurasians. I'm a Singaporean Chinese (we form the majority of the population), so I can try to speak for my demographic, although some values are shared across races. </p>
<p>We usually stay with our parents sometimes even after we're married for a few reasons. We're only reasonably expected to move out after marriage. </p>
<p>Firstly, houses in Singapore don't come cheap, because land space is super limited. And if you want to get government housing (from the Housing Development Board), you have to apply for that and wait years before you get the keys to your house (also you only can purchase HDB apartments if you're married). Even then, housing's still not cheap. We have financial schemes like the Central Provident Fund to help us out, but there are other issues, too. Basically, it's ~not easy~ impossible to find a house when you're a youngish adult unless your family's shitting money. </p>
<p>Secondly, Asians value filial piety a lot (something something Confucianism). Living with your parents means you care for them. Moving out before marriage is kind of a stigma, like you're trying to get away from your parents - that sort of thing. Again, unless family is super rich and has different ideals and values, this would be different, but I'm talking in generals. Around 18 is still a very young age for us, too. As long as we're studying (and even during our first years in our first jobs), we're still our parent's children. With Singapore's focus on education, more and more of us are studying for longer periods, and slower to find jobs, especially in the current economy. Plus, all guys have mandatory national service so that's another extra 2 years staying with the parents. </p>
<p>I think the main difference between my Asian culture and an American one is 1, land space and 2, different values on life. </p>
<p>More land space = more (financially accessible) houses. Purchasing more houses = better economy. </p>
<p>Also I think I saw in a few other comments about individualism. I obviously can't speak for Americans, but it is clear that Asian and American values are very different. Moving out means being financially capable and growing out of your own. It may even be filial piety in a Western sense - no longer living off your parents and being a responsible human. It seems like an important moment of being/becoming an adult. </p>
<p>Edit: found out that you can purchase a HDB apartment if you're over 35 or your parents have passed on. Basically some other conditions to ensure that everyone has a roof over their heads regardless of financial/social disposition. And grammar.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rugged Individualism. It's the concept Americans have hard wired in our brains. The mark of being an adult is going out on your own and providing for yourself. It's a sense of pride and accomplishment to leave the safety of your parents house and pave your own road to success. This mindset has its advantages, as well as some disadvantages. Moving out is an extension of the mentioned &quot;rugged individualism&quot; but there are several faucets to this concept. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some aspects of American culture are that you can strive to be/do anything you want. Another aspect to that is going out and doing it. There's a very 'can do' attitude that doesn't always fit with staying at home and perpetuating the family unit. </p>
<p>People don't live in the same area (let alone the same house) their whole lives, they move to new places, explore new opportunities, and build the life <em>they want</em> for themselves. Not necessarily the life their parents (and grandparents) have laid out for them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
