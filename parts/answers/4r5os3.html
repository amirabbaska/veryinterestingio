		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Daydreaming brain and sleeping brain states are quite different from one other. </p>
<p>We have a brain structure, more accurately, a type of neural network formed in parts of the brain, called the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network" target="_blank">Default Mode Network</a>&quot;.</p>
<p>This network, linking several parts of cortical areas and the limbic system, which are known to be involved in sensory experiences.  When this network is active, as we learned from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18400922" target="_blank">Buckner et al</a>, the individual is not focused on outside stimulus, but instead is turned inside, hence the daydreaming. (More accurately called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind-wandering" target="_blank">Mind-wandering</a> ) When this default network is active, it provides its own stimulation. In layman's terms, it's entertaining us, but we are not far away from our wakeful state.</p>
<p>Sleeping, on the other hand is a complex state of entire organism that plays a key biological role such as building up or the repair of immune and muscular systems as well as other syntheses. To be absolutely fair, we are not crystal clear on how the sleeping mechanics of the brain interacts with each other. However, we know that mostly by virtue of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ventrolateral_preoptic_nucleus" target="_blank">VLPO</a> and thalamus of our brain, a cornucopia of neurotransmitters are controlled, which is assumed to help our brain switch between sleeping and wakeful states. When sleep occurs, a variety of signals of wakefulness are interrupted and most outside stimuli is blocked, which is quite different from what happens in the state explained before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an electrophysiological feature that's shared between non-exploratory waking behavior (e.g., drinking water, spacing out) and NREM sleep, in every mammal studied so far: hippocampal sharp wave / ripples.  Brief (~50-200ms) cell firing bursts with a ~150Hz oscillation in region CA1 of the hippocampus, involved in memory formation/consolidation.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
