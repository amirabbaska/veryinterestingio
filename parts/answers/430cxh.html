<blockquote>
<p>You're right in that shaking your hand out after hurting it doesn't actually relieve pain, but the vigorous motion seems to block the most intense stuff from really registering as painful. This is all because of how our nerve signals communicate sensory information to our brain. While understanding and treating pain is a massive part of modern health care and a sub-field with a lot of room to grow, what's needed to answer your question is fairly straight forward.</p>
<p>When you slammed your finger in the door, you(most likely) felt the immediate pain of the smash and then a rising, duller pain that comes on after a second or two. This is because pain nerves come in two general types; a thicker neuron with a sheath that transmits intense pain signal quickly from a small radius around the receptors in your skin, and a thinner neuron that more slowly transmits pain signals from a more general region of your body. When pressure is put on the skin, the faster pain signals can be physically blocked from reaching the brain while the slower ones pass through. </p>
<p>So how is this all related to shaking? By quickly shaking your fingers around, you are subjecting your fingers to g-forces as they are in a constant state of acceleration and deceleration, which could potentially provide enough pressure to dull some of that initial intense pain. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gate_control_theory" target="_blank">Gate Control Theory of Pain</a> provides a model for why extra stimulus dulls the pain response. I'm struggling to remember the specifics because it was only a small part of my degree. The link will explain it in greater than ELI5 depth but I'll try summarise.</p>
<p>Pain neurons also have an inhibitory neuron that prevents pain from being transmitted to the brain. It basically tells the pain nerve to shut its stupid face. In the presence of a noxious stimulus (pain), the signal is passed to the brain and you feel it, much to your disappointment. However, non-pain transmitting nerves can turn on the inhibitor that shuts up the pain nerve.</p>
<p>So you do something genius-level like smash your finger with a hammer. Why, I don't know, but you did it and we're stuck with that now. All of a sudden the pain nerves light up and start sending signals to your brain saying, &quot;HOOOOOLY SHIT THAT HURTS!&quot; Then your brain freaks out and starts shouting, &quot;QUICK MUSCLES, START WAVING MY GOD DAMNED HAND AROUND! YEAH! LIKE THAT, BUT HARDER!&quot;</p>
<p>Then all these extra nerves trying to send information to the brain start turning on the inhibitor for the pain nerves. They're trying to say, &quot;Shut up for a second, we have to tell the brain about how the fingers are whipping back and forwards. It really wants to know for some reason.&quot;</p>
<p>So that's about it. Probably not the best analogy but it gets the point across.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It's kind of like a safe guard. Here is an <a href="http://i.imgur.com/hpqyKrW.gifv" target="_blank">example.</a>. If you can imagine a bug on theirs hands or something hot, this action will remove it most likely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
