		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>William James explained the difference between voluntary and involuntary attention. Voluntary attention requires effort - an example is concentrating on a demanding task like driving in traffic. But anything effortful can make you tired. Cognitive psychologists don't have a good idea exactly what inside of you is &quot;getting tired&quot; but we use a term called &quot;cognitive resources&quot; as a metaphor for the whole thing. The idea is that this kind of effortful attention drains those resources.<br />
In contrast, involuntary attention requires no effort. In voluntary attention you have to decide what to attend to and how to respond. In involuntary attention, something just grabs your attention and holds it. No decision making is required. It has been compared to a state of fascination.<br />
Many have used these ideas to explain why taking a walk in the woods feels restorative, because you can stop using those &quot;resources&quot; and just let yourself explore.<br />
Spacing out could easily be seen in the same light. You are not doing anything in particular, so you are resting and restoring those so-called &quot;resources&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Spacing out is basically meditation.  You are allowing your conscious mind to rest. It also acts as a reset, since your mind may be stuck in a loop of thoughts.  Like, maybe you're anxious/stressed that you have an exam.  You want to study, but your place is dirty.  You want to clean, but can't because you need to be studying.  You know you're running out of time, because you have an exam.  Repeat.  </p>
<p>There's a lot of information out there about the benefits of meditation. The benefits of meditation in relieving stress and improving concentration are well documented.  <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/meditation/in-depth/meditation/art-20045858" target="_blank">Here's Mayo's article, but there's a lot out there</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's one of the rare times when you're conscious that your brain is just allowed to rest. Thinking is healthy, but imagine if you walked or jogged endlessly. Oddly, we typically try to &quot;rest&quot; our brains from shifting it from one brain demanding activity to another (e.g. stop working to read an article, watch a video, talk to someone, etc.). &quot;Spacing out&quot; is necessary for healthy brain function and increasingly people have formalized/incorporated this in the form of some sort of regular mediation practice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always had trouble initiating the same feeling of &quot;spacing out&quot; when I've tried to meditate. As a bonafide hypermanic, any attempt at forcing &quot;spacing out&quot; just creates an vacuum for anxious thoughts to rush in. </p>
<p>Most times &quot;spacing out&quot; just kinda sneaks up on me. How to get it to come around more often?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
