		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Baldness is caused by something called DHT (dihydrotestosterone). It is a byproduct of testosterone. It causes finer hair and a receding hairline. Because men have more testosterone, they have more DHT. Some men are more susceptible to DHT which is why they get male pattern baldness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>DNA, the blueprint for your body, comes from your parents. You get 23 chromosomes from your mother, and 23 chromosomes from your father. These are mostly matching pairs, with the exception of the chromosomes that determine your biological sex (remember that for later).</p>
<p>Each of those chromosomes contains many genes, and in most cases your chromosome pairs are slightly redundant -- you'll have two copies for almost every gene. You may have heard the idea that some genes are &quot;dominant&quot; or &quot;recessive&quot;, which determines which copy of each gene is actually used in your body. The dominant genes are used, and the recessive genes are mostly ignored.</p>
<p>Remember how we said those 23 chromosome pairs <em>mostly</em> match? There is one important difference. For women, the 23rd pair is two X chromosomes (XX). For men, the 23rd pair has only one X chromosome (XY).</p>
<p>Baldness is largely determined by genes on the X chromosome. It's recessive, so very few women will go bald... but men only have one copy of the X chromosome, which means that it will always be expressed even if it's recessive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an X-linked trait (linked to the X chromosome). The X has areas on it that control the Y. If your one X is programmed to go bald, you will go bald. Women need interaction from BOTH X chromosomes in order to go bald.</p>
<p>So women need to have a bald father, and a mother with at least one baldness-linked X chromosome. A man just needs a mother with the baldness gene.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
