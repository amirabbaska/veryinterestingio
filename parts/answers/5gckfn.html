		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know so much about why pepper is much of a basic condiment. BUT.. salt is a whooole different story. One thing I've learned from cooking is, SALT, is everything.  Salt does not make things salty, well technically it does. but what it really does is when applied to any food, it creates a  chemical reaction between the salt and the food to a certain degree pertaining to how much salt you put. This is why if you put enough salt it has that perfect flavor and too much will just flat out make it salty. So to put things to perspective, salt is there to add more flavor to your food if need be. Pepper I believe is more of a preference if you want a little more spice to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are curious about salt get the book Salt by Mark Kurlansky and prepare to have your mind blown.</p>
<p>Salt was not as abundant as it is today and it used to be much more valuable. Cities were built on the salt trade, people were paid in salt (ie the phrase &quot;he is worth his salt&quot;, also the word salary is derived from the Latin sal meaning salt), you could not go to war without salt. </p>
<p>Salt is why Chinese brine extractors were drilling bore holes thousands of feet down 500 years before the first oil well in America was drilled at just 60ft.</p>
<p>People in England proudly lay waste to the landscape, pulling brine from underground untill sink holes started appearing, boiling it untill the skies were black from soot, in pursuit of the purest, whitest, finest salt.</p>
<p>Every fisherman was also a salt farmer. Months on end farming salt in the heat of the tropics, then sailing to far away seas near lands unknown where fish were so plentiful they could be scooped out by bucket.</p>
<p>Today things are the opposite. White salt is almost freely available where impure salt (eg. pink himalayan salt) is highly prized. Salt isn't needed for fishing anymore but fish are scarce. </p>
<p>Its really an interesting book and you won't look at the salt shaker in the same way again!</p>
<p>Dono about pepper. </p>
<p>Edit: to actually answer the question:
Firstly, salt intensifies the flavour of your food, so it makes sense to keep it where you eat.</p>
<p>Secondly, as mentioned salt used to be very valuable so keeping salt on the table was also a display of wealth. It was sometimes kept in ornate dishes and handled with special customs.</p>
<p>Some cultures do not have salt at the table or even use it directly in cooking. Much of Asia uses salty sauces such as Soy sauce or fish sauce.</p>
<p>Dono about pepper. </p>
<p>Edit 2: since this has ballooned - salt was so valuable for two reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you didn't have a cold storage place or it wasn't winter, meats and vegetables had to be salted to stop them going rotten. Therefore a large portion of food had to be salted, especially for campaigning armies or navy ships where even fresh food was hard to access. Nowadays  we have much less demand for salt due to refrigeration and canning/packaging technology/freeze dry etc.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Salt is not easy to make or get to. Sea water is only 3.5% salt and evaporation take a long time. Boiling it takes a lot of fuel. Salt is corrosive and will damage your metal containers. </li>
</ol>
<p>Satisfying the huge demand for salt with limited production capacity means it had high value. Supply and demand people!</p>
<p>Please stop asking about pepper.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a hugely complicated technical and sociological question, but the culinary answers are actually pretty simple:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Salt is unique, as a seasoning. Not only an essential nutrient, it is also a preservative, and one of the few seasonings that actually penetrates the outer layer of food and changes the fundamental flavors. At a molecular level, salt suppresses &quot;bitter&quot; flavors much more effectively than covering them up with sugars or &quot;sweet&quot; flavors, and does it without &quot;masking&quot; other flavors. Salt brings out deeper and more subtle flavors, and makes things taste more like they are, so to speak. It intensifies, mellows, and deepens other flavors, long before it makes food taste &quot;salty&quot;. This is what distinguishes it from, say, basil or orange-peel, as a seasoning.</p>
</li>
<li>Black pepper is only slightly less unique and versatile. Also a preservative (although much less potent than salt), black pepper contains piperine, which is one of the few fat-soluble chemicals with a significant flavor effect, which means it can &quot;soak into&quot; food as most other spices cannot. Similar to salt, it can bring out a subtle depth, richness, and intensity of flavor without imposing its own.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, most spices and seasonings are kind of &quot;added flavors&quot;. Salt and black pepper have the unique attributes of amplifying and intensifying existing flavors in different ways. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So I actually learned about this as an undergrad in biology l, as many have stated before me salt has always been highly prized for a number of reasons but as far as condiments and seasonings go as a whole you will find that the amount and types of seasonings change with latitude.</p>
<p>I will try to find the paper we read on the subject but basically as one gets closer to the equator the amount of seasoning drastically increases and are generally more intense flavors like garlic, chile's and onions. This was part of an evolutionary biology study but basically in warmer climates like those found along the equator and in tropical areas there is a much higher prevalence of diseases caused by different microorganisms and that in essence seasoning was used as a way to prepare food and kill any potentially pathogenic organism.</p>
<p>The paper goes on to test the effectiveness of the more common seasonings found at different latitudes and came to find that many of the bolder seasonings did in fact have a strong antimicrobial effect. Additionally you will also find that as you move away from the equater seasoning becomes much more mild. That's why if you think about a lot of the more traditionally spicy foods they are found along the equator. it also makes sense evolutionarily speaking that plants that have defenses to the common types of microorganisms found in the areas in which they grow and in turn would be utilized by humans to season their food with.</p>
<p>edit:
So I found the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi-sbHlyd7QAhWj0FQKHQ6gBGkQFggaMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.utm.utoronto.ca%2F~w3bio152%2Fwebpage_fall%2Flab_files%2Flab_02_spice.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHlJjY7dJGAqbTknND8Ktq38ATazg&amp;sig2=ikTXtRnCQwIIU-Y_jUVU5w" target="_blank">paper here</a> , one of the other aspects the paper considered was in regards to the average number of spices in a recipe increased in more temperate climates as well as the overall composition of the spices changed. its a short read and very interesting if you get a chance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt is biological. Your nervous system uses electricity. Electricity cannot travel through pure water, it needs needs something like salt to do that, and small amounts of salt are non-toxic. Without salt your brain would shut down and you'd die. So we evolved to crave salt.

<p>Pepper is cultural. It is native to India and only grows in tropical regions so once apon a time it was really expensive stuff in a place where it couldn't be grown or easily shipped--like Europe. Garnishing your food with black pepper was, at one time, a status symbol comparable to eating ice cream with 24-carat gold flakes on it. Which, by the way, people do.

<p>Pepper basically said, &quot;I'm a big deal, not only can I afford food, I can put black gold on it.&quot; Also, pepper was literally called &quot;black gold&quot; in its hayday. Today pepper is popular for the opposite reason. It's cheap, readily available and perhaps most importantly, it's expected.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
