As opposed to the Marxist idea that that sort of private ownership is bad and the people (for which read the state) should be the primary investor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was in Cuba recently, and by far the strangest thing to me was the total absence of capitalist symbols. Everywhere else I've been in the world, no matter how culturally different, has the same capitalist symbols. At first, it was unsettling--simply because I'd never experienced any like it before and I couldn't quite put my finger on what made everything feel so strange and different. But the feeling quickly changed from unsettling to refreshing as I saw how it was possible to have a society that isn't constantly bombarded with corporate symbols and manufactured expectations. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Unlike people in this post are saying, it's not because it's &quot;more efficient&quot; or &quot;because it actually works&quot;. It's due to a lot of historical events. Capitalism is global because capitalism countries won the ideological war against the other systems, to put it simply.</p>
<p>The Bourgeoisie won over the French Revolution and changed the world's politics because of that. They adapted the previous representative system that kings used to listen to people into the modern concept of representative republic (more on it in this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8vVEbCquMw" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8vVEbCquMw</a> ). In the process, they also obtained control over the means of production (such as lands), and the system they devised also excluded most of the population from the political process.</p>
<p>Having control over the means of production gives the controllers A LOT of power over other people's lives. Economic power and political power are directly correlated, and capitalism favors the concentration of economic power in the hand of a few. That creates a vicious cycle, where people with more power can acquire even more power. If you try to overthrow them, you'll find yourself fighting against the monopoly of force. It's beneficial to the people in power for the system to continue operating, and that's why it still operates, and why there's so much propaganda on &quot;it working properly&quot;.</p>
<p>I know people will come and say &quot;ok, so if communism is better why didn't it won over capitalism on the USSR?&quot;. That also has some historical explanations: Marx himself believed that capitalism made industrial development a lot more efficient, and when he talked about implementing communism he was talking about doing it in fully developed industrialized countries. Russia was an agricultural country back at the times of the revolution (and yet, in just some years, it was about as industrialized as the rest of the world, in a much shorter timestamp). Nevertheless, communism is also the control of the means of production by the hands of the <em>workers</em>. USSR had the means of production in the hands of a <em>representative republic</em>, which can be easily be controlled by private interest. The actual workers were still alienated from the value of their work. That is, USSR's communism is not that far away from the capitalist system, and some social scientists, such as Noam Chomsky, call that system a &quot;State capitalism&quot;.</p>
<p>Why do I talk about propaganda? Because capitalism doesn't &quot;work&quot;. It just generates value in the hands of a few and drives industrial progress towards that goal, but that by no means is inherently good. We're all seeing the effects of the industrialization on the environment. We all see that people still die of hunger every day. Unemployment rates are getting to an absurd point, because industrialization is driving automation for efficient profit, and that has as a consequence that less people need to work.</p>
<p>I don't wish to imply communism is the solution for such problems. I think my point is that a good economic system should be fit for people in general, and not for those in power. Communism tries to address that, but it has its own set of criticism among other socialist authors (such as Bakunin, Kropotkin, or Bookchin).</p>
<p>Rojava has an interesting experiment in a truly democratic society, inspired by the work of Bookchin, where economy is planned to benefit people in general, not just private interests. It is working well, even if you consider they are in a state of war against the daesh.</p>
<p>EDIT: I'm having to argue over and over and over and over again on how socialism doesn't imply central planning, and I'm tired of it, so please, PLEASE, read about more socialism models than the USSR model. Please. This is an example: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_planning_(economics" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_planning_(economics</a>)</p>
<p>It's by no means the only one.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Thanks for the gold, anonymous stranger! I believe I could have worded this answer a lot better if I had more time for research, but my point is that most capitalist apologists completely ignore both the moral grounds for capitalism (which Weber did a great job on writing about it) and the historical reasons on why it became so pervasive (which Marx and Chomsky also wrote very well about).</p>
<p>EDIT 3: while I consider myself an anarchist (not a communist or marxist - although I do like Marx's historical analysis), I find it funny that, even though I explicitly stated that I don't wish to imply communism is the solution for the problems of capitalism, most capitalism advocates are still insisting in pointing that &quot;communism failed and capitalism is better&quot;. So... thank you to prove you have not read the post, I guess?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It kind of isn't. The most powerful country in the world, the US, is capitalist, but that doesn't necessarily mean it is the defacto best. There is no such thing as a purely capitalist system, just as there is no purely command based system. All systems are mixed,such as in how the US the government regulates certain industries, or in China how people have access to currency to act according to their wants. No system is &quot;best&quot; but politicians, and others might try to convince you a certain system is better than others. The truth is that every nation has different needs and values, they're system will reflect that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So economic models are really models of power and ownership.</p>
<p>Without any structure, ownership is based on what you can protect. If you have a tool, and you set it down, and someone takes it, you don't have a tool any more.  If you scare or befriend them into not using it without permission and giving it back when they're done, you own it.</p>
<p>As societies grow, social relationships do too. Now instead of someone not taking your tool because they are afraid of you, someone doesn't take your tool because they're afraid that everyone will dislike them when they discover that they've taken your tool, and they need to cooperate with society to survive.  But still, not every tool belongs to someone, some things belong to everyone, and it's more important that people take care of those things. </p>
<p>As societies grow apart and fracture, you get groups that are independent of eachother.  If another tribe takes your tool, they aren't afraid of the repercussions of everyone in your tribe hating them. But for their tribe, they've just got a new tool.  Now instead of individuals scaring or befriending individuals, tribes will scare and befriend tribes.  Maybe a militia is formed, and people from a hostile tribe are attacked or scared away when they try to steal your tools.</p>
<p>But maybe not everyone wants to, needs to, or is capable of fighting in the militia. Some people have their safety and belongings protected by the people who will fight.  Those who fight feel that this elevates them to a position of power within the society.  They start to use that power to demand service.  If they are not served, then they can fight the people who aren't able to fight back, or they can simply stop protecting them.  This leads to a more feudal society where the serfs work for a lord in exchange for the lord's protection. </p>
<p>Now the world is filled with different societies, and the world is a very big place.  Lords are powerful, they have a lot of surplus.  Some people can travel far away to trade things from their homeland for things that are very unusual in their homeland.  Lords don't really want to do this, they're wealthy already, they're more or less safe and comfortable, so they let someone else do this.  Market forces emerge, as these rare items trickle back and the wealthiest want to make a show of them.  A class of people called merchants start to develop. </p>
<p>Lords fight amongst eachother for land and power, but cultures develop around those lands, and as threats from outside the culture start to come, these culturally similar lords may start to unite under a single banner as a country to protect their way of life from foreign invaders. </p>
<p>Unity within a country leads to stability, and as countries, even more feudal countries, with a small merchant class, start to become stable, the lack of fighting brings more wealth.  In conflicts between countries, the more stable countries have an advantage, which leads to a stabilizing effect on their enemies.   Descending into infighting is a great time to be pillaged by your enemies.</p>
<p>In the way that the serfs are ruled by a lord, the lords are ruled by a king, or similar head of state. All countries prefer peace because a war is harmful to both them and their enemy, leaving them open to attack by a 3rd party, but they are still at odds with eachother so they instead battle through mercantilism, or essentially, strategically trading to enrich your country and weaken your opposition. This sees the merchant class grow even stronger, and develop into it's own real class. You can't survive strictly on your lords when your country's prosperity relies on the efficacy of your traders, so they become legitimized. </p>
<p>This is the start of the emergence of capitalism. While we were being all mercantile, relative peace and competition leads to some technological advancements, particularly in terms of the steam engine.  This allows for more complex technology that can mass produce goods.  Instead of tools, there start to exist complex machines that need complex infrastructure to support them. Not just anyone can get these machines, they are rare.  So wealthy people are the ones who get the machines, and just compensate people to operate them.  Using a sewing machine is far more efficient than sewing by hand, but an individual could not buy a sewing machine nor would they have the capability to sell like a factory could. This leads to another subdivision of classes, the capital owners, and the labor.</p>
<p>Another big thing that happened at about this point was weapons like guns were developed, which allowed a man to kill another man easily without putting himself at risk.  In the past you couldn't carry bows around in the streets.  We also had urban migration as efficient factories could produce enough to support a lot of people in a small place.  Mass production led to things like newspapers and radios so information spread quickly. </p>
<p>People started to communicate with eachother and organize, and were upset at the fact that the few people holding capital (like the factories) could take advantage of everyone else, and started to argue that the state should hold the capital, and be controlled by the will of the people.  This idea is communism, and a number of countries tried it.  The people in power don't like these kinds of ideas so this led to instability and war. </p>
<p>Now some countries managed to install communist governments. They seized private ownership of capital.  But there is a problem with communism and that is that it is run by people.  Even a benevolent communist leader is just not smart enough to make the correct decisions for millions of people.  This leads to people being hurt by the system, their personal or unique needs not being attended to.  The leader must also delegate this authority because he can't personally distribute wealth to the population so he must ask thousands of people to each distribute wealth to thousands of people.  But he can't personally manage thousands of people, so he must ask someone to manage dozens of people, who each manage dozens of people, who each manage dozens of people, who each distribute wealth to thousands of people.  But even if the communist leader is benevolent, he loses control as it goes down the chain, and some of those people down the chain realize that if they skim a little off the top for themselves, it won't be noticed, or they won't be caught. </p>
<p>On the capitalist side changes to technology happened so rapidly that new technology would outpace old technology, and shrewd investment into new technology, or development of new technology could take you from being a laborer to owning your own means of production.  This made the system seem more &quot;free&quot;.  You could make the transition from the labor class to the capitalist class through hard work and smart investment. </p>
<p>On the communist side, the issue becomes one of delegation.  When you consider the problem, what if rather than having multiple layers of potentially corrupt bureaucracy, you just let the individuals manage their wealth.  Then you don't have the inefficiency of trying to manage thousands of people to deliver wealth to millions of people.  You have millions of people delivering wealth to themselves.  The state might still seize ownership of the means of production and try to make decisions about who must work where, but rather than trying to leave the planning and organization of distribution to millions of people to a single head of state and his delegates, you leave those decisions in the hands of the people, and make more broad decisions. </p>
<p>Capitalism is pretty standard because across the globe, machines and factories make a lot of goods that individuals can't, and it takes a lot of work to make factories and machines.  So someone needs to convince people to build factories and machines, and they pay to convince them to do that.  Since they pay to convince them to do that, they want to own the factories and machines, and get a return on their investment.  Even in communist countries like China, where the government has taken public ownership of a lot of industries one way or another, it remains a somewhat capitalist model because someone is in charge of managing that capital, and is typically well compensated for it. </p>
<p>This is really very similar to feudalism.  Those in power promising to protect the others, and the rest providing wealth to those with power.  In many cases it seems more &quot;fair&quot; because there's not as much killing, and not as much politics.  If you make enough money, you can start your own business, you can run it well, and you can become part of the other class.</p>
<p>This progression happened because technology is changing, so people who were strongly invested into old technology might be wealthy, but aren't immediately able to take advantage of the newest technology. You might have cornered the market on saddles, but when the automobile is developed, it doesn't matter. </p>
<p>Right now, technology is changing though. The first big change is the Internet, and that allows a company to have access to the entire world market very easily.  Instead of thousands of companies selling to billions of people, you might have one company selling to billions of people. This concentrates wealth within a very few people.  This also means that the barrier to compete with these people raises as high, and we lose that fuzzy feeling of the &quot;american dream&quot; sort of promise of class movement.  In the industrial revolution, more technology meant you could make more things, but you still needed people to do it.  Modern technology means that in many industries you need fewer and fewer actual humans.  This brings a shrinking of the labor class. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
