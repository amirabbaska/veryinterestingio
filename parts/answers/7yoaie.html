		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of all of the following things:</p>
<p>Frame rate of 24 frames per second (with a shutter speed of double the frame rate at 1/48)</p>
<p>Cinematic aspect ratio (Widescreen)</p>
<p>Fantastic and purpose built lighting for the scene</p>
<p>High dynamic range image capture </p>
<p>Cinematic color grading and contrast adjustments</p>
<p>Edit: I forgot lenses and everyone suggesting it in the comments to my post are completely correct. You can do it with cheap lenses, but fantastic lenses really do add to the look.</p>
<p>Edit 2: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/7yoaie/eli5_how_do_movies_get_that_distinctly_movie_look/dui9efj/" target="_blank">more detail about these points in a following comment here</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a cinematographer.. and while these comments are somewhat accurate, the simplest and most fundamental answer is dynamic range.</p>
<p>Yes lighting, framing, sound etc is extremely important, but the real film look you refer to is the dynamic range (data caught in the very highs and lows of the image).</p>
<p>Edit: I have had a lot of people contacting me to see my work, for tips on becoming a DP, and generally disagreeing with my point.</p>
<p>Here is my showreel:
<a href="https://vimeo.com/208863503" target="_blank">https://vimeo.com/208863503</a></p>
<p>Most of this was filmed with pretty cheap cameras.. some shots even with very dated Canon DSLRs which are no longer made.. and I’d like to think most of it is quite filmic, so yes, dynamic range isn’t EVERYTHING - but I feel it’s important. I.e if you were to take an Alexa outside and match it to the iPhone’s field of view, same framing etc, the thing that makes the Alexa look so sexy is the dynamic range.</p>
<p>Secondly, a lot of people have mentioned ‘aspect ratio’. This is confusing;</p>
<p>The CinemaScope LOOK is far more important than just adding black bars over footage. You can see in my showreel that the whole thing is in 2.35 aspect ratio, but only a handful were actually anamorphic. I cropped everything to that ratio though to keep it consistent - and I guess it does add a cinematic illusion - but it is just essentially throwing away information and I wouldn’t really encourage it, even though I used to do it all the time.</p>
<p>Thirdly, for aspiring cinematographers and filmmakers; go out and shoot ! Practice, learn, and improvement will be an  inevitable byproduct..you need passion (as with anything) to continue with it, and grow. I am still very small time and ‘amateur’..I have a long ways to go.</p>
<p>Watch. Be inspired, and develop your own creative flair.</p>
<p>Ps. A lot of people are also asking who I admire..
If I had to choose one person whom I felt really advanced cinematography as an art form, I’d probably choose Jack Cardiff; His frames are really particularly crafted, with amazing attention to detail. He also respects colour and light to the highest degree, which of course trumps dynamic range, colour grading, aspect ratio and all the other technical nonsense we’re talking about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Watching an extremely poorly lit movie like that will give you an appreciation for just how much work goes into properly lighting a scene.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To caveat off the original poster. Why is it that tv shows and soap operas look so different? Different budget? Different cameras? Different style of cinematography? I’ve noticed for years and I just can’t figure it out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I'm in the UK, watch US sports frequently but when a game is live in London, on TV it doesn't look the same as when in the US?
