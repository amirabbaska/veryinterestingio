		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do you not see dead ones? You should go outside sometime!</p>
<p>That said, nature is pretty good at recycling its waste! There are many animals that will eat other dead animals. Especially in the summer this process goes incredibly quickly.
Where I live, we have many rabbits, mice, squirrels, foxes and different kinds of birds and those are just the animals I know about because I see them every day. I would be surprised if many of these animals actually survive to die of old age. I imagine most of the squirrels and rabbits end up as fox lunch while the one or two dead and decaying foxes I have seen usually had crows and all kinds of insects all over them.</p>
<p>Still, rabbits and such probably retreat to their lairs if they are sick/old. They will feel vulnerable and as they do, they hide in their holes and nests and hollowed out trees, where they will then quietly die and once they have (and sometimes before) other animals will start eating them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think most of the previous comments have accurately summarized why, though I'd like to add that often times, city maintenance workers may clean up/cover corpses. Anecdotal example: A squirrel was hit by a car just outside of my house. It was moved onto the sidewalk by a concerned passerby (no sense in letting scavengers become roadkill as well) and then the next day, I watched a city maintenance work cover the corpse in soil. <a href="http://audubonportland.org/issues/hazards/buildings/faq" target="_blank">The Audubon Society of Portland</a> says that the reason why you don't see piles of dead birds from window collisions is because predators &amp; scavengers get to them first (crows, cats, coyotes, gulls, raccoons, sometimes dogs, various insects etc.) and because the corpses are cleaned up by the city.
There's also aspects of bird biology that make them less likely to be found as corpses: <a href="https://ornithology.com/why-dont-you-see-dead-birds-laying-around/" target="_blank">they tend to be lightweight and have low body fat, and relatively thin skin, and hollow bones, so they decompose much more easily compared to mammals</a>--plus when they hit the water, they float, so they're still accessible for scavengers as well as whatever bacteria live in the water.</p>
<p>None of the sources are peer-reviewed journals or anything like that--hopefully this answer still helps, in the case of birds specifically, in North America!</p>
<p><em>Edit due to /u/spideyosu's comment:</em> Originally I included a reference to a spurious study that estimated that domestic cats cause about a billion bird-deaths a year, and included that as a cause for the relatively low number of bird corpses you see.  It turns out that since it's <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/13.7/2013/02/03/170851048/do-we-really-know-that-cats-kill-by-the-billions-not-so-fast" target="_blank">pretty difficult to figure out how many cats even have access to the outdoors at all</a>, it's by extension basically impossible to estimate the actual number of birds that killed by cats per year. Also important is the consideration that cats' safety in general might be jeopardized if they gain too much infamy from unreliable data (which I cited by mistake, and have deleted from the original text. I apologize!)</p>
<p><em>Edit To Add</em> Something else that I didn't think of, but that other comments have alluded to, is that it might just be that we don't see the bird corpses because birds, being for the most part capable of flight, are probably more likely to die in places where we'd never be able to see them unless we spent a lot of time walking around and in between houses (thanks to /u/s1mmeh for that consideration!). Birds that seek refuge in trees, between houses, or up in the nooks and crannies of buildings would probably never be found by passerby. I imagine that's what <em>might</em> be happening to the pigeons near where I live, if they're not picked off before they die by hawks/falcons or something.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
