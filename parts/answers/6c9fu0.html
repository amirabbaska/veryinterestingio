		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be more accurate to say: &quot;The energy from a photon released by a fusion reaction in the core takes about 1 million years to reach the surface.&quot; They start as gamma ray photons. Due to the density they only travel a short distance before colliding with a particle and being absorbed. That energy is re-emitted (sometimes as multiple photons with less energy each) then re-absorbed by something else. That random process continues until an energy-excited particle near the surface finally releases a photon that escapes into space.</p>
<p>Consider the game &quot;Plinko&quot; as an analogy for this. The million year figure is a statistical approximation, not a measurement.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of replies saying the photons get absorbed and re-emitted later. This is only a part of the answer, and is  true in the radiative zone around the core. Above this, there is the convective come, where the energy is mainly transported by convection. The plasma in this region gets heated from below and starts rising to the surface, where it eventually releases its energy again as radiation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just plain wrong. The Sun is not transparent, except for a very thin layer on the outside. One might say &quot;it takes a million years for a photon to make it out of the Earth's core&quot; as well, or some other number, and it would make just as much sense. What is meant is that it takes that long for the thermal energy in the core to make its way to the surface. The predominant mechanism for thermal energy transfer inside the Sun is radiative but that doesn't mean that one single photon is bouncing around making its way to the surface. Rather, a photon will hit an atom or electron and accelerate it, then later that atom or electron will emit a photon and in that way the thermal energy from the core will eventually filter out to the surface, cooling off along the way though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Plenty of people already wrote about the million years claim. I'll just add on the &quot;how do we know it's the exact same photon&quot; thing. Simple: we don't. Even more: we <em>can't</em> know it and the claim doesn't even make sense. Photons are bosons, which means that apart from a handful of obvious physical properties (energy, direction, polarization) they are <em>literally the same</em>, in the strongest possible meaning of the word. There is no way to distinguish photons with same quantum numbers. None, nada, the nature itself doesn't distinguish them, and we can prove it by studying their statistical properties. It's not some peculiarity of the photons, all quantum particles obey this law. For each one there is but a handful of parameters that distinguish them, and a part from that they are physically the same. An electron in your room isn't different in any sense from an electron inside the sun, they could swap places and nobody would ever notice. This manifests in the symmetry properties of solutions to the equations of quantum mechanics. For electrons (and other feemions) this leads to the Pauli exclusion principle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
