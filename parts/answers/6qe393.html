		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cells used by the body to detect blue light in order to regulate the production of melatonin are separate from the cones that we use for our vision.  These light detecting cells are called intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells and in some cases these cells can regulate circadian rhythms even when a person is completely blind... so being color blind wouldn't prevent blue light from affecting sleep patterns. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p>These findings suggest that a normal trichromatic  visual system is not necessary for light-mediated neuroendocrine
regulation.     </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question based on some of the answers here - are there known examples of people who do not have working copies of the receptors for blue light that are tied to our sleep cycle - in the same way that someone can not have a set of function red cone cells, or green or blue?</p>
<p>Could this cause narcolepsy or similar conditions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
