		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other things which do have that transition zone of &quot;syrupy&quot; (e.g. syrup) are much more complex substances than water.  Inside them, there are many different types of molecules - hydrocarbons, sugars, fats, actual cells, etc. - which contribute to a gradually changing viscosity.  Water, however, is (for our purposes) just one, uniform molecule, so we see it melt and freeze at a specific temperature.</p>
<p>In chemistry, those other things which have a gradual viscosity change would be called something different - a solution, a suspension, or probably a combination with all the many different actual substances that make up that syrup, honey, molasses, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There actually is, it's given the term &quot;slush&quot; and refers to a bunch of small ice crystals that are 'suspended' in near-freezing temperature water in the same way mud can be suspended in water and make it soupy. These can flow downhill in a much-slower-than-normal-water flow, although they're not sticky and they can't pull or stretch out like, say, molasses can.</p>
<p>But the answer as to why water doesn't get sluggish <em>all by itself</em> is because of its chemistry. The molecules in water are one of a gas (water vapour, not relevant here), liquid (standard room temperature) or solid, and the transition between those last two is an either-or sort of yes-no thing. </p>
<p><strong>Either</strong> a molecule of water is in liquid form and behaves among other similar molecules like a liquid that can easily slide and flow and move around, <strong>or</strong> it's locked into a solid crystal like a needle of ice or a bit of snow.</p>
<p>Other chemical compounds such as many oils behave differently when they experience temperature change, or have a mix of chemicals in them that contribute to such a behaviour change (maple syrup's an example), but water keeps to this simple one-sort-of-state model.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water's bulk properties are determined almost entirely by the hydrogen bonding and, due to the simplicity of the molecule, all of the hydrogen bonds have a similar potential.</p>
<p>This results in very abrupt phase transitions because when the average kinetic energy is high enough to break the H-bonds then any particular molecule has the same potential to constantly break and reform them (i.e. be in a liquid state), but once it drops below, suddenly any molecule has the same potential to be H-bonded to an adjacent molecule (i.e., be in a solid state).</p>
<p>If you look at something like various simple alcohols, they also have a hydrocarbon tail, which gives more ways for the molecules to interact with each other.   So when it's cold enough for <em>this</em> particular interaction to be stable, there's still <em>that</em> other one that's going to keep everything moving.   Thus an increase in viscocity.  And then length of the chain matters.  If you have both methanol and isopropanol in a dry ice bath, the iso will be visibly syrupy while the methanol is pretty much the same as room temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This answer might be slightly tangential to what you're trying to get to, but temperature <em>does</em> actually affect the viscosity of water.  This is why pouring hot water into a mug sounds subtly different than pouring cold water into a mug.</p>
<p>That said, the difference in viscosity is rather slight compared to substances generally thought of as &quot;syrupy&quot;.  (See other answers for explanation of crystals, and pure vs suspended substances)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone else said that it's because &quot;syrupy&quot; liquids are still liquids - they fill their container like a liquid.  There's also there's no temperature point where water goes from liquid to syrupy. it's not like a continum like gas to liquid to solid is. it just depends on the make up.</p>
<p>Just a fun fact - some people can't drink liquid water due to medical reasons such as a poorly working neck muscles so they have classifications of liquids. These are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Thin liquids - Basic water and coffee, juice, milk,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nectar thick - the level of OF thickness is similar to hot syrup since if you stick a spoon it in and take it out the liquid will just run off the spoon but the liquid doesn't splash like water when you pour it. It just is thicker </p>
</li>
<li>Honey-like - so it's like honey. If you dip in a spoon and the liquid doesn't come all the way off and coats the spoon, its honey-like level thick </li>
</ol>
<p>If you get to like a pudding consistency it's no longer a liquid </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
