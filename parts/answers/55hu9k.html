		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you look through a screen door, and focus on that screen door itself, you basically see one color in each opening in the screen.  You still see what's behind the door, just in a sort of pixelated way.</p>
<p>Now, if you look through two layers of screen doors, you see a poorly distorted picture because in the closer screen door you're not only seeing the colors in each opening of the door that's further away, you're also seeing the that second screen too. This throws off what you see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of what others have mentioned about moire patterns monitors can look messed up because of refresh rate. Your monitor is actually flashing light over and over really fast, &quot;refreshing&quot; the image on screen. Depending on the shutter speed setting on your camera you'll be able to catch the monitor refreshing/flashing over and over. </p>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> I should mention this was a much bigger issue with CRT monitors/tube tvs. but it's <a href="http://i.imgur.com/sQOVZUa.mp4" target="_blank">still an issue</a> on LCDs. OPs probably just seeing aliasing/moire.</p>
<p>shutter speed causes some pretty neat effects:</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/IrgPBIwUAyk?t=19" target="_blank">here is</a> an example of a cameras shutter speed causing a flicker effect on a flourescent light bulb that the human eye sees as constantly on.</p>
