		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Johnson:</p>
<p>Johnson meaning the penis appears to be part of a group that uses a proper name, in this case based on 'John', to give a slang name to the male genitals. Others of the type include John Henry, John Thomas, John Willie, Master John Goodfellow, Sir John and Uncle John. And there is john itself:</p>
<p>1914 T.S. Eliot ‘Fragments’ in Inventions of the March Hare: O daughter dear daughter I think you are a fool / To run against a man with a john like a mule.</p>
<p>The first use of johnson is mid-19th century:</p>
<p>1863 W. Cheadle Journal 2 Feb.: Bitterly cold; neck frozen. Face ditto; thighs ditto; Johnson ditto, &amp; sphincture vesicae partially paralysed.</p>
<p>The first uses of this 'proper name' form seem to stem from the 16th century jockum, here used in one of the earliest collections of criminal slang terms:</p>
<p>c.1566 Harman Caveat for Common Cursetours: There was a proud Patrico and a nosegent, he tooke his Jockam in his famble, and a wapping he went.</p>
<p>Jockum led to jock, which is still found, typically in old school rap lyrics, although its original use is much older and serves for both sexes:</p>
<p>a.1790 H.T. Potter New Dict. Cant (1795): jock private parts of a man or woman.</p>
<p>Jack, as used for penis, also appears to have similar roots in a proper name, but in fact puns on the standard English jack, a device for lifting. Thus:</p>
<p>1604 Dekker Honest Whore Pt 1 I i: [He] taught her to play upon the Virginals, and still his Jacks leapt up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dick:</p>
<p>The word connoted a person of questionable character long before it became a nickname for the penis. For example, in the 1665 satire The English Rogue by Richard Head, an unsavory character is referred to as a &quot;dick&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;The next Dick I pickt up for her was a man of a colour as contrary to the former, as light is to darkness, being swarthy; whose hair was as black as a sloe; middle statur'd, well set, both strong and active, a man so universally tryed, and so fruitfully successful, that there was hardly any female within ten miles gotten with child in hugger-mugger, but he was more than suspected to be Father of all the legitimate.&quot;</p>
<p>An 1869 slang dictionary offered definitions of dick including &quot;a riding whip&quot; and an abbreviation of dictionary, also noting that in the North Country, it was used as a verb to indicate that a policeman was eyeing the subject. The term came to be associated with the penis through usage by men in the military around the 1880s.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
