		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scientists (myself included) are still trying to figure this out. The current evidence suggests Neanderthals exhibited handedness and it appears to be roughly the same ratio as most modern humans: ~ 90% right handed. However, hand preference, that is consistently using one hand or the other for a particular behavior, has been found in several of our closest living relatives like chimpanzees and bonobos. But these apes are different from humans because they do not consistently use the same hand across different tasks whereas humans do. In short, it looks like handedness has evolved in the last few million years of our evolution but is likely at least half a million years old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That doesn't necessarily mean that handedness evolved before our ancestors split from Chimps', but it's evidence that handedness is an old trait.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't comment so much on primates but horses supposedly have a dominant side. Idk if this is based on training or if it's really dominant. They are generally considered to be left hoofed, but this might be because people are generally right handed and work on that side. </p>
<p>I would lean toward horses/animals having a dominant side because they often seen to seem lead with the same foot when they start walking from a neutral stance. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually ran a highschool experiment entitled &quot;Puppy paw preference.&quot; In my research after conducting my own designed experiment I found that a similar experiment was conducted around 1960s that found that certain species of dogs preferred their left paws over their right and more female than male had a paw preference. Most male dogs used both paws equally when retrieving a treat than their female counterparts.</p>
<p>This might, and I use this loosely, infer that most animals can develop a dominant hand preference and as such could develop this through generations through an epigenetic response, aside from nurture based responses between child and parent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rich Palmer at the University of Alberta tackles this question in his lab.

<p>Long story short is that handedness has evolved in lots of species, not just primates.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
