		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we wake up in the morning we tend of have high glucagon levels, glucagon is a hormone that replenishes the our blood sugar level so that we don't feel Hungry and fatigued in the morning, however of we eat the night before our body responds by thinking, Hey! We already have some sugar, no need to raise our hormone levels and take the energy from the reserves. Due to this we wake up with lower blood sugar levels than if we wouldn't have eaten causing the sensation of Hunger.</p>
