		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer is no. The SR-71 used a combined cycle turbine ramjet. However, you couldn't put a scramjet inline without some serious flow conditioning to get it cool enough to use.  </p>
<p>Also, it's not really practical to slow down air from hypersonic to subsonic speeds, except until recently where there's been some work (I think in the UK) in magnetohydrodynamics that rapidly extracts energy at an intake to slow and cool the air even up to Mach 7 or so, then reinjects the energy at the outlet.  </p>
<p>The ramjet/turbine idea is, for most intents and purposes, the same as an afterburning jet engine. However, putting a scramjet inline doesn't work, as you can't get the air fast enough. The current SR-72 approach, as far as I can tell, uses a parallel system where the scramjet ignites at hypersonic speeds. The big problem before was how to get a jet going fast enough to <em>start</em> a scramjet. SR-71 maxed out around Mach 3.8 due to the inlet cone geometry ingesting the Mach cone at full extension, and at that point less than 10% of the thrust was coming from the turbine (vast majority of air was diverted around the engine to the ramjet/afterburner). </p>
<p>Finally, nothing can do this at sea level because the air is too dense and maybe too hot. You'd probably melt the aircraft and definitely require a lot more power. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Slowing down supersonic flows compresses them and raises their temperature. The idea behind a ramjet is to use that as the compressor section of a jet engine, and then re-expand then gases after further heating with combustion to have them leave faster than they entered.</p>
<p>This doesn't work with subsonic flows, which is why ramjets don't work at slow speed and you need a turbine.</p>
<p>In both cases, the turbine and the ramjet, the operating regime is limited by the temperature of the air after compression. Too hot, and the engine won't survive.</p>
<p>The idea behind a scramjet (a Supersonic Combustion ramjet) is to not slow the air down below Mach 1 before combustion, thereby not raising the temperature as much. That lets it handle higher-speed incoming air.</p>
<p>So if you operate your scramjet by first slowing down the incoming air, you've removed the point of using a scramjet in the first place, and reintroduced all the operating limits of turbines and ramjets.</p>
<p>You can actively cool the air, but it's complicated. No one has done it in production, AFAIK. Design concepts like this include the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SABRE_\(rocket_engine\)" target="_blank">SABRE rocket engine</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_air_cycle_engine" target="_blank">Liquid Air Cycle Engines</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precooled_jet_engine" target="_blank">precooled jet engines</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe someone could get the concept to work on paper, but getting this into the air seems expensive, expensive to run, and unreliable.</p>
<p>As soon as the air left the first jet portion, the air would be way too hot and fast for the next engine's input. Also, if an engine gets the compression cycle wrong, the air in the engine will push out the front instead of streaming out the back, which needs to be dealt with 3 times. The turbine blades are also shaped to accept certain wind speeds too, so if this being used for fast acceleration, it quickly becomes unuseful.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Would you use the bellows to induce additional airflow, or use a cappable turbine to cap the intake and reduce volume? </p>
<p>Saving levels often is a good practice yes, especially before critical stages and boss fights, but I'm not sure what this has to do with jet engines - are you playing a Jet engine game?</p>
<p>Edit: I've got it, I think I understand! You're slightly late for St. Patricks Day, but I now understand you want to stay at a comfortable temperature while playing a video game (and saving often) while wearing a turbine cap (such as a propeller beanie, a ballcap with a propeller blade on top), and blowing into a musical instrument featuring bellows (clearly you mean bagpipes).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
