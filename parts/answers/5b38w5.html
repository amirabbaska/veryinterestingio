		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some answers are getting pretty close, but I just want to chime in.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A disorder is any derangement of function. This is an extremely broad term, but it is commonly used to describe psychiatric conditions, <em>e.g.</em> generalized anxiety disorder, major depressive disorder, schizoaffective disorder. The term does not apply <em>exclusively</em> to psychiatric conditions, but it tends to be used as such.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A disease is also any derangement of function, and is also an extremely broad term. It is more commonly used to describe obviously organic problems, such as Crohn's disease or Lyme disease. Note that diseases can be neoplastic, infectious, autoimmune, degenerative, <em>etc.</em> In other words, cancer (neoplastic) is a disease, just as pneumonia (infectious) is a disease, just as multiple sclerosis (autoimmune) is a disease, just as osteoarthritis (degenerative) is a disease. Note, however, that disease <em>also applies to psychiatric conditions</em> such as those I mentioned above (major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, schizoaffective disorder).</p>
</li>
<li>A syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms^1 that is seen together more frequently than you would expect by pure chance. For example, Down syndrome is characterized by intellectual disability, macroglossia (large tongue), single transverse palmar crease, and a long list of other things. We know that Down syndrome is caused by trisomy 21, but it is still a syndrome. Another example would be Cushing's syndrome. This is a state characterized by central obesity, red abdominal stretch marks, round face, and some other things. It can occur when a physician gives a patient too many steroids accidentally (iatrogenic), or when a patient has a tumor that secretes steroids in large amounts, or in a variety of other circumstances.^2</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> <em>Disease</em> and <em>disorder</em> are technically synonymous, but <em>disease</em> often implies organic derangement and <em>disorder</em> often implies psychiatric derangement. <em>Syndrome</em> is a collection of signs and symptoms seen together frequently. All diseases are disorders, all disorders are diseases. All syndromes are both, but not all diseases/disorders are syndromes.</p>
<p>^1 A medical sign is something that can be observed by the physician objectively, such as hyperreflexia (increased reflex amplitude) or hypertension (high blood pressure). A symptom is something the patient experiences subjectively, such as nausea or pain.</p>
<p>^2 Interestingly, when a patient has Cushing's syndrome due to a pituitary tumor secreting steroids, this is known as Cushing's disease. Cushing's disease is <strong>one cause of Cushing's syndrome</strong>.</p>

<li>A <em>disorder</em> means that your body is not functioning normally</li>
<li>A <em>disease</em> means that your body is not functioning normally, and science understands the specific process that led to that state. Everybody with the same disease undergoes the same basic process. There may be variations, but the underlying process is the same.</li>
<li>A <em>syndrome</em> is a collection of symptoms. There is no guarantee that 2 people who have the same syndrome actually have the same underlying bodily process producing their symptoms. </li>
<li>Example: both syphilis and depression are disorders. Syphilis is a disease - science knows how it happens. Everybody with syphilis has been invaded by the syphilis organism. Depression is a syndrome - the process that causes depression is not clearly understood, and there is no guarantee that any 2 people who have &quot;depression&quot; actually have the same underlying physiology. </li>
<li>Example: a few hundred years ago, if you had a fever and were coughing up blood, people might say you have &quot;hot blood coughing up syndrome.&quot; Today, we know that some people with this syndrome have lung cancer (a disease) and some of them have tuberculosis (a different disease) and some of them have other things. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physician here. In practical terms, there is no meaningful difference between the common usage of the terms &quot;disorder&quot; and &quot;disease.&quot; These can generally be used interchangeably. Some conditions such as &quot;bipolar disorder&quot; have stuck to a particular word, but it could just as well have been called bipolar disease. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at the words closer it becomes slightly easier.</p>
<p><strong>disease</strong> - &quot;dis&quot; - &quot;ease&quot;, whatever takes your body and makes it not at ease. This is how people can say something like &quot;depression&quot; is a disease, or &quot;obesity&quot;. </p>
<p><strong>disorder</strong> - &quot;dis&quot; - &quot;order&quot;. Whatever disturbs what is normal. Mental disorders are a good way to look at it, because they're not always harmful. But they are outside of whatever we define as the normal.</p>
<p><strong>syndrome</strong> = &quot;syn&quot; - &quot;drome&quot;. Syn here effectively means &quot;with&quot; or &quot;grouping&quot;. It's a group of symptoms. Lupus (from the show House) is a great example. We don't know what causes it, we don't even necessarily know if all Lupus is the same. But we know it has xyz symptoms, so we we group it all into one thing.</p>
<p>Edit: Lupis</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A disease is an anomaly in your bodily functions that results in health issues. This is what doctors treat.</p>
<p>A syndrome is a collection of signs and symptoms that are caused by said disease (things like fever, tireness, pain, skin ailments etc etc) and you typically use syndromes to describe a disease.</p>
<p>A disorder what the disease causes to the body.</p>
<p>For example, a disorder resulting from lung disease is respiratory failure or coughing fits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
