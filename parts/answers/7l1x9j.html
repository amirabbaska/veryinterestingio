		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not yet! But many theories in physics posit that extra dimensions are curled up in a circle very tiny so that we can't directly interact with it, but &quot;particles&quot; that exist in these circles would have observable effects. I believe other theories deal with &quot;extended&quot; or &quot;large&quot; dimensions like x, y, and z that we're used to too but don't have access to, but I am at least baseline-familiar with the curled dimension idea, so let me focus on that.</p>
<p>To visualize this better, we need to clarify what's meant by a dimension. In simplest terms, dimensions in general in a theory (by which I mean not just spatial or time dimensions!) means &quot;parameters we need to specify to describe the system as well as we need to.&quot; A flat piece of paper is considered 2-dimensional in a 3D space (let's forget about thickness of paper for now). Why? Because to specify any point on the paper, I just to invent need two nontrivial coordinate axes (e.g. not just &quot;backward&quot; and &quot;forward&quot; along the same line) and figure out what the coordinate value of my picked point is. The most obvious way to do this is cartesian coordinates, with a grid imposed over the paper and just count grid spaces. Even a lattice on this paper, where spaces in between the lattice points are not allowed, exists in 2 dimensions. So the dimensions can be continuous or discrete.</p>
<p>Consider also the surface of a sphere, like an ant running on an orange. How many dimensions does this have? One is tempted to say 3, since a sphere sticks out in 3 dimensions -- it's one step up from a circle. But in fact, if the sphere really is a sphere, it has constant radius, and we only need to specify two angles to pick any point on the surface, like a latitude line and a longitude line. Thus the sphere's surface is also 2D. If our ant can burrow into the orange and eat toward the center, then the radial coordinate is no longer fixed and this ant suddenly lives in a 3D space.</p>
<p>Suppose now I'm standing in a room. My position is once again like I'm standing on a piece of paper, so my range of motion is 2D, right? But suppose that where I'm facing is now a relevant parameter to what I want to study in some theory. That is, my orientation along a 360 degree circle is now important for some reason. That's an extra dimension to our theory, not literally spatially, but in that to fully describe a state I need to actually tell you what direction I'm currently looking as well as what point I'm standing out. More abstractly, one might consider other parameters as extra dimensions (e.g. temperature, pressure of the room, number of other people, but these are not <em>spatial</em> dimensions).</p>
<p>My orientation in the room is an extra spatial parameter in this theory. But if you're looking from very very far above the room (with no ceiling) like in a helicopter, you can't discern what direction I am facing very well; it's just too far away to resolve, since I'll look more or less like a point. That is, the circular &quot;orientation dimension&quot; describing part of my position is not really visible to you, since the radius which it effects is basically the width of my body, much smaller than the distance from me to you. But if I start spinning quickly in a pirouette, you may not be able to notice directly but it might have consequences on, for example, how I move around the room, and perhaps you could deduce that there's an extra relevant component to how to describe me which is &quot;tucked away&quot; in the smallness of that extra component -- the dimension is &quot;compact.&quot;</p>
<p>What I'm depicting is a non-literal analogy, but effectively the idea of curled up dimensions is that to describe particles or fields we would need to specify not just x, y, z, and time coordinates but also extra positions along these tiny circular curled dimensions, effectively just specifying an angle for each of them. Particles existing as stable fluctuations around the circle are often called Kaluza-Klein modes.</p>
<p>(One might ask: &quot;how do we know these extra dimensions are circles?&quot; To which the answer is, we don't, but they're the simplest starting point for extra compact curled dimensions. A sphere or something similar could also work but requires more involved descriptions. One might also ask, why not have a square or triangular or even a crazy shape for the extra dimension, to which we would say any of those shapes can be deformed back into a circle with appropriate coordinates, so it's all equivalent to a circle anyway.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no actual, empirical data for the existence of higher dimensions, however, there are theories that predict their existence. Hereâ€™s one example: In 1919, a guy named Theodor Kaluza was studying general relativity in five dimensions, he noticed something that was really interesting. If you take a type of 5 dimensional space time and look at it in 4 dimensions, it reduces to 4 dimensional general relativity and a modified form of the Maxwell Equations. In the theory, we live in a 4D spacetime on the surface of a circle, which is the 5th dimension. The behaviors of this circle are expressed in our world through electromagnetism. The theory was more or less disregarded for a very long time, and was only thought of as a mathematical anomaly, but once string theory came about, it became very useful to be able to add very small, curled up dimensions, because of the need for extra dimensions in string theory. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is possible to <a href="http://klotza.blogspot.com/2015/11/what-do-we-know-about-extra-dimensions.html" target="_blank">look for observational constraints</a> given a hypothesis about how they interact with our world. For example, you can posit that they modify Newtonian gravity at small length-scales, and use experiments of Newtonian gravity to rule out any extra dimension (of that type) larger than about 50 microns.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I am an ex-physicist and currently a differential geometer, so not very familiar with string theory, but I have a vague mathematical hunch for why our universe &quot;should&quot; be 3+1 dimensional: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_theory_of_the_Lorentz_group" target="_blank">infinitesimal symmetries of 3+1 dimensional Minkowski space (where special relativity takes place, and the model space for general relativity) form the &quot;smallest&quot; complex simple Lie algebra</a>, sl(2,C). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
