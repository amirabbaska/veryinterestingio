		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad is a project manager for a developer. I asked him this question a few weeks ago. Here's what he said:</p>
<p>I would think it is a combination of a lot of the items the article mentioned plus many other items. There is a current lack of skilled labor which is forcing contractors to work overtime to complete projects. Also, our government regulations and review, paperwork processes keeps getting worse. The states control many of these projects but they have to meet federal guidelines to get federal funds. Double government control. Double the paperwork to get plans approved and get paid. Doesn’t help. (I have a small project right now for 1000’ of new city sewer. I need Delaware City, Delaware County, Orange Township, Army Corp of Engineers, and OhioEPA approval. And I’m paying for the work, no government funds.)</p>
<p> </p>
<p>One thing that was mentioned many years ago. Public projects here are awarded to the lowest bidder because of the government. However, in much of Europe and Japan, they are awarded to bidders who provides best warranty. More care taken to complete work and much less work needed to make changes because you can reuse existing base.  May cost more to build initially in Europe, but much lower costs in future. Low bidder here figures they will make it up on changes. In US, we don’t care because we will just replace it… Lower bidder has to make profit so they hire lower skilled and less productive.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>There is a culture growing in construction trades to care less about others work. Trade A (electrician) doesn’t care about another Trade B(plumber)'s work. If Trade B does something that is in way of Trade A, they just cut through it and then don’t tell anyone. Eventually Trade A has to come back and fix. And at end of day, they don’t finish what they are doing, they just leave. Then next day they have to inevitably rework some portion of work they did yesterday.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And I think our geography may play a role. Workers have to travel further because we are much more spread out. Makes for unhappy workers which equals unproductive workers.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know I am late in responding but I work in the construction industry in both U.K. And USA.  Brief synopsis :</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>More regulation / red tape in the us.  Permits are more complicated, inspection process is more rigorous whereas the U.K. Once you have planning permission and building regs plans approval your contractor is essentially self regulating their construction work and quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The U.K. And Europe has been doing it longer and has more construction case law, which people have learned from.  The process in the U.K. Is more streamlined and relies more on upfront reviews of design, cost and feasibility using cost and project managers as a key part of the design team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The U.K. Government in the 90's funded research into improving construction (Egan and Latham reports) and the result has been 20 years of turning what was a very adversarial industry into a collaborative partnership approach.</p>
</li>
<li>I would like to add that the us construction industry pushes more boundaries than the U.K.  There is no such thing as cannot be done.  The cost managers focus on cost in the U.K. often dilutes design (not the fault of the CM just the result).</li>
</ol>
<p>The people I have have worked with both sides of the Atlantic are equally passionate, the lazy guys are equally lazy, the demo guy's all drive range rovers, the architects all wear turn ups on their trousers and clarks desert boots.  Differences are slim.  The U.K. Has just got a bit more upfront process in place, is a bit more self regulatory and a bit less likely to push boundaries.</p>
<p>Both could learn from each other though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
