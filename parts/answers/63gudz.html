		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While we are closely related genetically, it's worth noting that humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor between 4-13 million years ago.  In that time, both branches of the taxon have developed wildly differing tool cultures. Human language and chimpanzee language are tools.  There is no inherent genetic component.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, humans aren't even of one mind on smiling. <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/dept/advising/american_culture/social_skills/nonverbal_communication/reading_exercise.htm" target="_blank">This article</a> from Rensselaer Politechnic has an interesting article on differing uses of the smile in non-verbal communication:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A smile may show affection, convey politeness, or disguise true feelings. For example many people in Russia consider smiling at strangers in public to be unusual and even suspicious behavior. Yet many Americans smile freely at strangers in public places (although this is less common in big cities). Some Russians believe that Americans smile in the wrong places; some Americans believe that Russians don't smile enough. In Southeast Asian cultures, a smile is frequently used to cover emotional pain or embarrassment. Vietnamese people may tell the sad story of how they had to leave their country but end the story with a smile.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has some basis in body language development, I believe. For chimps or many animals, 'smiling' is baring the teeth, which is a defensive posture. It's a way of saying 'don't antagonize me'. It is like unsheathing a weapon, in part because they actually do use their teeth as weapons.</p>
<p>Humans, by contrast, do not use our teeth as weapons because they are poorly designed to be used as weapons. Human body language over thousands of years has developed to be concentrated on our highly mobile facial muscles. While we do take some body language cues, most of our expressions are in our faces. While smiles mean different things depending on culture, they are not viewed as a threat because they are not typically used as weapons except in the most dire circumstances </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The baring of teeth in chimpanzees is a not-so-subtle gesture that says &quot;if you try and hurt me, it'll cost you&quot;. It's not a threat of murder so much an appeal to a sense of self-preservation in the other. It's a common gesture, too. Nearly every species has a threat response, and a number of them involve the baring of teeth. </p>
<p>What does that have to do with human smiles? At some point in our history, the baring of teeth, combined with an upward curl of the mouth's corners began to mean &quot;I'm not so bad, we could be friends&quot;. We do, however, still retain the baring of teeth in expressions of anger, fear, disgust and joy. The baring of teeth seems to heighten the effect of the expression.</p>
<p>That might be the key to this question. If baring teeth in human expression is merely an enhancer of the underlying expression, then chimps may be baring their teeth as an enhanced version of an underlying appeasement gesture that has no exact analog in humans.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd like to point out that while chimpanzees grin to show fear and anxiety, it's not always in response to some negative stimulus. Excitement, both good and bad, can elicit a similar grin, such as when they see a particularly favorite treat. There may be some subtle differences between the types of grins, but a need for understanding the context of the grin is important when determining the &quot;emotion&quot; being displayed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
