		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a breed of goat that does this, no one knows 100% why but the running theory is that they have deficiency in an ion channel. This prevents the &quot;go&quot; signal in neurones connected to muscles from reducing during times of stress. so when the animals are frightened they have constant active muscle neurones and so their muscles all contract at the same time and they seize and fall over.</p>
<p>There are other theories about their muscles not clearing calcium properly however I think there was some group studies showing a link to ion channels in the nerve cells.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's only a certain type of goat that does that. They're generally bred that way then included in herds so that if a predator comes, that one collapses and distracts it while the others can get away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not sure, but I know reptiles tend to have this response as a defense mechanism. It's a general feature of the limbic system, which mammals inherited, but mammals typically have higher order brain systems which override this and promote actions like fleeing. Humans have even higher order brain systems that can enact &quot;self-soothing&quot; to override the flee response. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
