		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TC, I just want to clarify, midazolam is not an analgesic, it's an sedative used for conscious sedation. Why it's so painful is because of the potassium that they overdose you with that stops your heart. Anyone that has ever had to receive potassium via IV (also known as a K-rider) can attest that it burns like crazy.</p>
<p>Just an FYI</p>
<p>But I agree, lethal injection is pretty bad.</p>
<p>Edit sedative not anesthetic. My bad</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few corrections to your predicate assumptions.</p>
<p>First, lethal injection isn't unreliable.  The drug combinations used by certain states are simply not achieving (or capable of achieving) the appearance of an undistressed execution.  This is largely because a number of states have be unable to source or properly utilize paralytics in connection with KCl and/or a sedative.  Additionally, most times, the problem isn't that the drugs are ineffective, the problem is that the personnel administering the drugs are incompetent -- largely because real medical personnel rarely will actively participate in an execution.</p>
<p>Second, midazolam isn't a painkiller, it's a hypnotic sedative that causes, among other things, anterograde amnesia. It's anything but weak or ineffective for its purpose.  .5mg/kg IV and you experience and remember nothing.  Had it, seen it, trust me, it's lights out as far as the patient is concerned.  Sure, you'll get the odd person who appears to be conscious and talking, but believe me -- the lights may be on, but nobody is home.</p>
<p>Third, and most important, the continued use of lethal injection is a consequence of the US legal system.  &quot;Lethal injection&quot; is judicially approved as a concept (regardless of whether it's being implemented properly) and inert gas executions are a relatively new idea for humans, and the states have no incentive to go through the universe of litigation that switching to that would require.  Simply put, it's easier for them to proceed with an inefficient execution that is judicially approved than one that is, almost certainly, easier, cleaner, and more humane.</p>
<p>Honestly, if the US government really wanted to do lethal injection correctly, and couldn't get an RN or MD to participate, the most humane way would be an intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital.  Strap the victim down, bang in the shot, and he's dead in five minutes with no pain whatsoever -- and it's almost impossible to screw up.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;There seem to be more humane ways.&quot;</p>
<p>There would seem to be more humane ways than to put someone in prison for decades, allowing them useless appeal procedures while they know that one possible outcome is being put to death in front of a crowd of onlookers, spending very large amounts of money on ensuring their rights are taken into account in the most minimal way that is acceptable.</p>
<p>I am not sure the system is built to be humane, and I think it sometimes fails both the convict and the surviving victims of the crime they have been pronounced guilty of.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because in the death penalty there is an element of vengeance. The convict is supposed to suffer to some extent. </p>
<p>A Dutch tv programme devoted an episode on trying to figure out the most humane way to execute someone. This turned out to be the hypoxi chamber, a closed chamber where you can slowly deprive the convict of oxygen. You would actually become very happy just before the lights go out. They tried it out as well up till where it got life threatening and confirmed this feeling. When they tried to gauge interest in the US for this setup, there was none, because it was too humane.</p>
