<p>There's an article about the actual meteorite itself.  I assume this excerpt from it is the basic reason why is never got popular but I'm not sure -</p>
<p>&quot;These claims were controversial from the beginning, and the wider scientific community ultimately rejected the hypothesis once all the unusual features in the meteorite had been explained without requiring life to be present.&quot; </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

There's another less known result from a Viking mission that found organic compounds on Mars but it's still seen as controversial at best and contamination by Earth-life at worst.   </p>
<p>None of those are widely accepted by the scientific community as firm proof that anything ever lived on Mars. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/273/5277/924" target="_blank">original scientific article about the Allan-Hills-84001 meteorite by McKay et al. 1996</a> is listed with &gt;1000 citations on scopus, which means that the research is very well known. Bill Clinton's speech on the matter was broadly covered as well.</p>
<p>The main findings about the meteorite are:</p>
<ol>
<li>origin from mars (determined via gas composition of enclosed gas bubbles in comparison to gas analysis from the Viking missions on the mars surface) </li>
<li>presense of carbonates (proof for flowing water at 0-80 Â°C, determined via O2 isotope analysis) </li>
<li>presense of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (marker for decayed biomass on earth; yet abiotic origins are known as well) </li>
<li>'nanofossiles' (rod-shaped, 50-200 nm; potential fossiles yet the size is very small; earth-based life would not be possible at this scale; erosion is now considered as an explanation for the 'nanofossiles')</li>
</ol>
<p>From my understanding the scientific consensus is that these observations are not enough to proof life on mars because the observations can also be explained by abiotic processes. </p>
<p>The conditions for life (as we know it) were better in the past when the climate on Mars was warmer and there was flowing water on the surface. However, no conclusive evidence was found for past life on Mars. For example, no higher organic molecules have been detected by the Mars landers which carried gas chromatographs (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiosity_(rover)" target="_blank">Curiosity</a></p>
<p>The most promising lead for present life on mars is the detection of methane in the marsian atmosphere <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103504002222?via%3Dihub" target="_blank">[1]</a><a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5917/1041" target="_blank">[2]</a>. The methane might be of microbiological origin yet abiotic origins are possible as well (i.e. a reaction of olivins (minerals) with hot water and subsequent Fischer-Tropsch synthesis or slow release of methane from methane clathrates formed in the Marsian history). An isotopic analysis of this methane, which is only present in trace amounts (&lt;40 ppm) in the atmosphere and constantly degraded by chemical reactions, would indicate whether microorganisms are the source. For a better perspective - the detected methane amount could be released by about 2000 earthian cows.</p>
<p>Mars is far away and mission are expensive. So far, the results of all missions that searched for life on Mars have been negative or inconclusive. Future missions (e.g. drilling and sample return <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/" target="_blank">[3]</a><a href="https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/psa/exomars_rsp" target="_blank">[4]</a>) could bring new observations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
