<p><a href="https://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/words.html" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link to a little experiment you can do.  All you have to do is identify colors in all the samples you are given.  There are 2 conditions.  Time yourself to see how long it takes</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because our brains don't choose. Reading isn't something you have a choice to do or not.</p>
<p>Things that we learn to do are largely unconscious and out of our direct control. Like, we can't choose how to run, our brains just move our legs in the way they've learned to. And once you've learned to read you can't help but understand words when you see them. Learning literally rewires your brain so it just it whenever it sees the right kind of patterns.</p>
<p>So to not read subtitles you have to actively try and keep from looking at the part of the screen with the words on it. Which is actually harder than it sounds because <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade" target="_blank">our eyes are jumping around all the time and we don't realize it</a>. So you have to actively fight two natural habits to avoid reading, which is a lot of work, especially to do it constantly through an entire show or movie.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When I'm reading subtitles, I'm not actually consciously reading. When I think about it, I see the words, but what's actually happening is that I'm hearing the words in my head in the voice of the person speaking...I don't know if that even makes sense. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I only use them for times when I cannot understand the spoken dialogue.  Brits are sometimes hard to understand depending on their dialect, and they use words which I do not recognize.  Sometimes the music drowns out the dialogue.  Some directors like to let everyone speak over each other  (Suck it, Altman!).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
