		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only can DNA exist as a salt, but this is pretty much its standard form in the solid state. In an aqueous medium, DNA exists as a conjugate base with negatively charged phosphate groups stabilized by a bunch of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterion" target="_blank">counterions</a> that are floating around in the solution such as Na^(+). When you precipitate the DNA (e.g. as is most commonly done through the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol_precipitation" target="_blank">addition of ethanol</a>), these cations will bind to the phosphate groups and the DNA will precipitate out as a salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Interesting tidbit: The salt of inosinate (RNA monomer, equivalent for the present question) is a common food additive. One of the many umami flavor molecules. I think it was discovered by the same guy who first found MSG.
It is likely that the neutral molecule is an internal salt - phosphate deprotonated and the base ring is protonated. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
