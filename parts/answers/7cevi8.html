		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birth control pills are doses of hormones, specifically estrogen and progesterone.  </p>
<p>The relatively large dose of estrogen prevents the pituitary gland from noticing the &quot;natural&quot; spike of estrogen that signals the pituitary to secrete the hormones that cause an egg to be released from the ovaries.  It's like turning up your music really loud so you don't notice your phone ringing.  </p>
<p>The progesterone also affects the hormone signals for egg release (albeit through a different mechanism) as well as makes the uterus inhospitable for both egg implantation (in case one is released and fertilized) and sperm motility (by thickening the mucus in the cervix to make it harder to swim through).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typically, there are two ways the pill can work: based on estrogens, or based on progesterone-like substances. In general, both those strategies work by sending false signals to the reproductive system, using substances it uses to know when it should stop trying to reproduce.</p>
<p>Let's start with estrogen-based therapies.</p>
<p>For that, we first need to understand how ovulation works. During ovulation, different eggs all over the ovaries start a &quot;race&quot;, like an election race, in which they rally other non-egg ovary cells around them. Those cells secrete estrogens to the outside, which are a signal to other eggs to stop trying to mature. Eventually, one egg has so many cells around it, that the amount of estrogen they are secreting is so large that prevents any other egg from trying to mature. That egg has won ovulation that month.
&quot;The pill&quot; is just a large dose of estrogens, which send the signal to eggs that there is already a winner, so they don't try to mature and be secreted into the uterus where it could be reached by sperm.</p>
<p>Then, there are progesterone-based therapies.
Progesterone is secreted in large quantities when a fertilized egg is implanted in the uterus to grow into a baby. In a very simplified way, progesterone-based therapies, are just telling the ovaries and uterus that there is already a baby in the making, so we don't need another one.</p>
<p>Most contraceptive pills use a combination of both strategies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hormones in the pill stop ovulation. No ovulation means there’s no egg hanging around for sperm to fertilize, so pregnancy can’t happen.</p>
<p>The pill’s hormones also thicken the mucus on the cervix. Thicker cervical mucus makes it hard for the sperm to swim to an egg — kind of like a sticky security guard.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the simplest terms, some pills are hormone doses that emulate levels of a pregnant woman. This essentially tricks the body into thinking it is pregnant and it will therefore not release an egg to the possibility of fertilization (in a pseudo pregnant state the body would have no reason to release an egg because it thinks it is already pregnant)</p>
<p>Consequently this is also why some girls experience symptoms on the pill that are the same as that of a pregnant person. Things like clear skin, tenderness of certain regions, weight fluctuation etc</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
