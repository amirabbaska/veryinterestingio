		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a lot of different types of headaches, and like almost every trait, both genetic background and environment play in role. It's also a hard question, because some of the most common types of headache, including migraines, are not perfectly understood yet.</p>
<p>For example, there is a heritable component to frequent migraines: <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253157/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3253157/</a> but there usually isn't a single gene difference that predisposes people to them. Some of the identified genes that may contribute involve chemical signaling systems in the brain, which fits with one theory of migraines that says they are caused in part by overactivity of certain areas of the brain. Women are more likely to get them than men, in part because of cycling changes in hormone levels that influence neurochemical signaling as well. I haven't read up on this much for other types of headaches.</p>
<p>Among environmental factors, things like poor posture that leads to compressed nerves, consistent sleep deprivation or stress, certain dietary triggers, sinus infections, etc. could all lead to more frequent headaches, and each individual will differ not only in how much they experience these things (based on lifestyle) but also on how sensitive they are to them (which may be partly genetic or epigenetic in itself.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Migraines and headaches are symptoms of so many things that it's like asking why some people get stomach aches more than others. Sometimes it's a medical condition, sometimes it's how they are handling stress, sometimes it's an allergy or intolerance to foods, chemicals, stimuli, environment. Could be hormonal. Dehydration. The cause of headaches is endless, so it almost infinitely varies person to person. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People with anxiety disorders (poor at coping with stress, or self-critical) tend to have a lot more tension headaches - not surprising since they also tend to have a lot of chronic muscle tension in the neck and shoulders.</p>
<p>Edit: also, if you wake up with headaches and/or dry mouth and you snore, you might have sleep apnea.  Get it checked out - untreated, it has some nasty consequences.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
