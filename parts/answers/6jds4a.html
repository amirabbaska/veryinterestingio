		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toys that shock you contain (typically) a capacitor that is charged by the battery, and then discharged, releasing the accumulated charge.  Although all the current coming from the toy comes from the battery, it has been used to build up charge in the cap that can release at a higher voltage and current than the battery would do by itself.</p>
<p>The toys may use something different, like an induction coil, but the basic principle is the same - they extract more current over a shorter time.</p>
<p>Reddit loves a good half-baked analogy so: Consider comparing sitting under a leaky tap for an hour, vs filling a bucket from that tap for an hour, then pouring it on yourself - the basic result is the same, but the bucket provides a much faster delivery of the water, and a much faster change of state as a result - one that is probably more noticable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those toys include a voltage multiplier curcuit which brings the voltage up to a point that a shock is possibly noticed.  Very similiar to a electric ignition lighter in characteristics.  Knowing the ohms law relationship V=iR, your skin is R and fixed around 500k ohm.  If you can make V go up you are also increasing i. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the resistance between the two leads and the voltage. If the resistance is too high or the voltage too low, you won't get any current flowing and thus not feel it. The voltage is pretty much set by the battery or the toy you are using and the resistance determined by where your hold the leads on your body.</p>
<p>For instance, touch your <em>finger</em> to the leads of a 9V battery and you feel nothing. Touch your <em>tongue</em> to the leads of a 9V and you'll get a nice jolt. Your tongue has a much lower resistance than you finger does.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
