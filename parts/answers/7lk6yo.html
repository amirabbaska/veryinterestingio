		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever the glass is rapidly cooled during the tempering process there are these air jets that blow cool air on the glass. This creates distortions in the glass that are almost invisible, until you put on polarized glasses. Different automakers have different (patented) patterns or cooling methods to reduce this distortion. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tempered glass has stressors built-in. You can see them with polarized   sunglasses. The built-in stress is what causes the window to completely shatter into small pieces when the window is damaged in any way. Even a scratch may cause enough damage to shatter the window.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
