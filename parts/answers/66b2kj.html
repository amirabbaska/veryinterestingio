		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons to why we like a song and most of them are cultural and have to do with our experience. I'll start with an example: a person from India who has mostly listened to ragas will find Beethovens 9th symphony very boring and flat and find all symphonies very simialar while a westerner will find ragas are a complicated series of rithms (bars can have a time signature of 17/8 and stuff like that) and eventually also find them all very alike. That's because the complexity of each kind of music es based in different parameters and all the dynamics of a certain music are only perceptible by a trained listener.</p>
<p>Also, the fact that you can associate certain sounds with emotions like happiness or melancholy or suspense, has to do just with what you have taught yourself by listening and associating sounds with images/situations/emotions all your life, but you are not born with this associations. </p>
<p>Also, a song as we know it was developed no more that 300 yeas ago. Medieval music was just one melody but the concept of armony, the understanding of the relations between music notes sounding at the same time was not part of western culture. Then the renascence brought polyphony, but as a series of melodies (contrapunctus) that don't produce &quot;chords&quot;, they produced a complex net of sound that to us sounds kind of flat because it has no harmonic direction, it goes nowhere cuz there is no one melody more important than the other. </p>
<p>With the arrival of the reform of the church and the baroque there was also a big aesthetic change, there was an intention to make music less complicated and get the message home (religious). So just then the concept of harmony/melody was created. This concept is what we call the tonal system. It was brought to perfection by the musicians of the classic period, exceptionally good example is Mozart, he just knew the system up and down.</p>
<p>Then later the romantics and expressionists created music that would go further than just sound good or happy or sad, they wanted to create music that would express complex emotions like anxiety or terror so they created a database of relationships between music and complex things that now is the basics for all the music you hear in movies, parts of star wars sound track is a rip off of Stravinsky's rite of spring. </p>
<p>So that said, nothing can be true about our preferences, but given that we like &quot;melodies&quot; over &quot;chords&quot; that create a &quot;harmony&quot; because of all our cultural background, I would suggest with not much certainty that the art of creating a good melody is in the ability of the composer to do good musical phrasing.</p>
<p>For example, if i writhe only short sentences you will find what I wrote rather boring and annoying. If I write big complex sentences you will also find it annoying. A good writing mixes short and long sentences. In music, phrasing is the ability to understand the timing for starting an idea or a melody and finishing it. </p>
<p>On the other hand, we have the tonal system deeeply learned in our heads, so we expect things to follow this aesthetic rules. Then again, if you only follow the rules and you just make music that doesn't challenge the listener then you get bored, but if you are all the time making a fool of the listener and never do what he expects then you will annoy everyone.</p>
<p>tl;dr: It is a cultural learning we are not born with the understanding of what is a song. In the end, a good melody has to do with good timing and the right playing with the listener expectations (in my opinion).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
