		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Abdominal Tension</strong>
Stress tends to cause a great deal of tension in the abdomen. That tension can tire out abdominal muscles and squeeze organs in a way that creates a feeling of ache or pain.</p>
<p><strong>Digestion</strong>
Stress affects hormone levels, and hormones are used to aid digestion. When you're stressed, your body's hormones start to cause your digestion to suffer, which may lead to bloating, intestinal pain, and more.</p>
<p><strong>Irritable Bowel Syndrome</strong>
Anxiety has been linked as one of the most likely causes of irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. IBS occurs when your body's gastrointestinal system is no longer processing foods correctly, and it can cause stomach discomfort even without anxiety present.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, our nervous system is super connected and feeling bad mentally can contribute to feeling bad physically. The blood flow in your body, breathing changes, etc. because of your mental state can make you feel worse as it's not your baseline. Maybe someone else can expand on the evolutionary benefits. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
