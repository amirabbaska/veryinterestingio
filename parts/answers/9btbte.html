		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This phenomenon called “<em>Negativity Bias</em>” has an evolutionary hypothesis behind it: Negative experiences and traumas often carry a much higher survival cost (like death) that typicially far outwieghs the potential benefits we might gain from positive experiences.  And so our brains, the hypothesis goes, are wired to be more sensitive to negative experiences, such as through vivid memories and rumination.</p>
<p>In short: on the whole, the wisdom to be learned from negative events tends to be more valuable to our breeding chances than the wisdom that might be learned from positive experiences.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in our modern society we have largely conquered our hostile environment and so this negativity instinct no longer serves us so well as it once did.  In fact, it can cause us a lot more harm today than good.  It tends to leave us with a lot of emotional baggage later in life that can really weigh us down and can even provoke self-defeating behavior patterns.  </p>
<p>Our natural tendency to obsessively ruminate over past traumas and mistakes can cause depression, insecurity, addictive escapism, anger problems, sociability disfunction, career problems, etc.  It takes a lot of counter-instinctual emotional maturity and mental discipline to stop ourselves from dwelling too much on mistakes and regrets and instead to focus on positive aspirations, optimism, and hope.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis is an important factor. It couples stress responses in the body to the brain (among other things). This enables the hippocampus to store the stressed memory better. This is a more biological examination. Although there are valid answers already posted on a more psychological and evolutionary view. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's common to hear world-class hall of fame athletes discuss their career after retiring and talk about how some loses still hurt. </p>
<p>Brett Farve said he rarely thinks about his great plays, but his bad plays are always there for him rewinding. Farve was known on the field as someone who could forget his mistakes immediately and continue to play in his high-risk manner even after making horrible mistakes, (when most players reel it in and tend to play it safe.) But in the long run, it's the bad losses and the interceptions that haunt his memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emotion is a <em>huge</em> modulator of memory formation and recall. </p>
<p>Strong emotional states (good or bad) tend to heighten the vividness and durability of memories formed while under their effects. </p>
<p>If there is a bias towards negative thoughts and reflection it may be due to our evolutionary past. </p>
<p>It seems clear that resting on one's laurels and being overly comforted by past successes could be problematic if taken to the extreme. </p>
<p>On the other hand, obsessing over past failures and potential threats/danger might convey some benefit. </p>
<p>While this is not a pleasant subjective state to exist in, it nonetheless lowers the chances of ending up tiger food (if there's a realistic chance of that happening). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, negative experiences about something that was positive to begin with. You got the job you always wanted? Yay!
Fast forward a year: Now you're not so happy about getting the job, maybe a coworker is annoying etc, and you can no longer feel the joy, even though you know you were happy when you got it, and you know you wanted it. It may feel accomplished(?) but the good feelings and mood about it is no longer there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
