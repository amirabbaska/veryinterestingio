		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not necessarily. Was the chicken cold or warm? Sometimes, they'll mark down the chickens to half price as they approach their sell-by time.</p>
<p>Some items are sold as &quot;loss leaders.&quot; A loss leader is an item that is sold at a loss, but typically in such a way as to draw people into the store.</p>
<p>A whole cooked chicken is often on of these loss-leaders. They draw hungry people into the store at dinner time, assault them with a delicious smell, and then conveniently place a large variety of high-markup side dishes right next to the chickens. </p>
<p>This often has the effect of enticing people into buying more than they otherwise would (don't go shopping when you're hungry, etc) and making <em>more</em> money for the store than if they had just sold the item for profit.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the Walmarts in my area charge $4.99 for their whole roasted chickens, so it's possible that you simply found one during some sale or deal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to earlier comments about the price possibly being a loss-leader or on sale, a few facts about chicken production.</p>
<ul>
<li>Broiler chickens can be raised from egg to 5lb market-ready bird in just 5 weeks.</li>
<li>Forty years ago it took 10 weeks to achieve a 4lb bird.</li>
<li>A parent breeder chicken can start laying eggs at 24 weeks old and lay around 150-180 fertilized eggs per year.</li>
<li>A broiler chick is worth about $0.36 and weighs just 44g.</li>
<li>On average a broiler consumes 9lbs of feed (cost of around $1.50) by the time it reaches maturity at 5 weeks.</li>
<li>The cost of processing a broiler chicken is $0.18 per pound, that's the sluaghtering, defeathering, cleaning, etc.</li>
<li>The wholesale price of a broiler chicken is $0.53 per pound.</li>
</ul>
<p>Assuming you bought a 5lb chicken, that'd still be near wholesale price.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Economics of scale can make it pretty cheap to crank out a lot of products (chickens included) once you've gotten over the initial investment in a big chicken farming setup.</p>
<p>It's also possible that walmart or someone else along the way could be using the chickens as a &quot;loss leader.&quot; IE, they're not making money on the chicken, but now you're in the store buying stuff that they <em>do</em> make a profit on which makes up for it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's either a mark-down being sold at or below cost to limit the loss that Wal-Mart has to take on it or it's simply <strong>loss-leader.</strong></p>
<p>Loss-leader is when a store sales an in-demand item for less than they can make a profit from it (hence the loss) in order to get you into the store (hence the leader, getting you into the store). They do so knowing that they can then get most people to buy so much other stuff that they end up with a profit by the time you leave the register. </p>
<p>&quot;Black Friday&quot; is the ultimate example of loss-leader - all those &quot;doorbusters&quot; are offered in the hopes that once you get into the store you will then do a large part of your holiday shopping at the merchant. <strong>BTW</strong> - closely related to loss-leader is <strong><em>bait-and-switch,</em></strong> where only a few units of an advertised sales item exist so that you are enticed into buying something similar but always costing more. This is why several states (like my own, California) have laws saying that unless an item is being discontinued or clearly marked as clearance, they must issue you a rain-check to buy it at the same price once restocked (most stores make sure that things like big screen TVs sold as Black Friday deals aren't restocked until <em>after</em> Christmas to discourage this). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chickens for eggs and chickens for meat are not the same type of chicken. Egg chickens go into mostly animal feed and low end chicken products.</p>
<p>An egg laying chicken is scrawny and doesn't have much meat. Meat breeds are bulky fat ass chickens and actually are kinda crappy layers.</p>
<p>Many foods are loss leaders. They sell for less than production cost. Turkey is a huge one. A day old turkey chick costs more than a 20 pound turkey at the store. Hell a lot of stores literally give away the turkeys around the holiday. Spend x amount of money here over some period and get a free turkey. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
