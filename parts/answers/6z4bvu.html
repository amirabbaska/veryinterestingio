		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I understand, the production of melanin is somewhat related to testosterone. During puberty, there's a concentration of testosterone in that area, so the skin darkens. It's also why pubes tend to be darker in colour than the hair on your head. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of what you think of the penis being tan is an illusion. It looks darker because it is all shriveled up while flaccid. All the melanin is closer together making it appear tan/darker. If it gets hard, it won't have that appearance. </p>
<p>I don't see why the penis would get damaged if it got tan, it's thinner skin but not all that different. But I cannot imagine the fucking agony it would be to have a sun burned member and have an absent-minded boner during the day. Nor being woken up in the morning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
