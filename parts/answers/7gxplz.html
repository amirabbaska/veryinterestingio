For example if you have a particle in an excited state with one lower-energy state (the ground state), the time-dependence of the wavefunction is something like exp[iEt/<del>h</del>], where E is a “complex-valued energy”</p>
<p>E = E<em><em>0</em></em> - iΓ/2.</p>
<p>E<em><em>0</em></em> is the actual energy of the excited state, and Γ is the energy width. </p>
<p>If you calculate a probability density for a wavefunction of this form, you get something proportional to</p>
<p>exp[-Γt/<del>h</del>].</p>
<p>Notice that this is not an imaginary exponential, which is an oscillating function. This is a <strong>real</strong> exponential function, and it decays with time. This is the exact same exponential decay that you see in radioactivity.</p>
<p>So the probability density for finding the particle in the excited state decays exponentially in time; it doesn’t instantaneously change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
