		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>FM and AM manipulate radio waves in different ways (frequency versus amplitude) to encode the sound being transmitted. Ultimately, though, each station on FM radio has six times the bandwidth as AM. More bandwidth means more nuanced sounds are possible. Think of it like drawing with 48 colors versus only 8 colors. </p>
<p>Plus, because of how FM works, it’s less susceptible to interference than AM, so you’re also generally getting better clarity to begin with. </p>
<p>Edit: several people have asked questions about why FM/AM can't occupy other bands, e.g. move FM lower to increase its range.  <a href="https://www.ntia.doc.gov/files/ntia/publications/2003-allochrt.pdf" target="_blank">Here is a cool chart of the US' current radio frequency allocation</a>.  There's other reasons, but one big reason we can't just move the bands around is that nearly every sliver of wavelength is already being used or reserved for something else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are some reasonable answers here, but none of them capture the essential reason.  They all talk about the difference between AM and FM, but not why FM sounds better.  Here's an ELI5:</p>
<p>Commercial FM radio sounds better because it gets more of the radio spectrum.  The reason it does is an accident of history.</p>
<p>When a transmitter transmits radio waves, they go, well, everywhere.  It works by shaking electricity up and down in a rod (an antenna), and that sends out waves at a particular pitch.  If you want to think about it like sound, think of a tuning fork in a room, singing out at a particular pitch by moving air up and down.   Receivers contain tunable tuning forks that shake up and down in response to the waves that hit them.  </p>
<p>Radio receivers then have to <em>decode</em> the shaking to create a signal.  AM radios measure how &quot;loud&quot; (strong) the incoming waves are, and use that strength to figure out where to place the speaker cone.  The transmitter makes its wave signal stronger and weaker very quickly, and that moves your speaker in and out very quickly, making sound.  FM radios measure the pitch of the incoming waves.  The transmitter adjusts its main tone slightly higher pitched, then lower again, and like that.  That makes the receiver move its speaker cone back and forth, and that makes sound. </p>
<p>So far so good, right?  Well, if there is more than one radio station around (hint: there are hundreds), they all work at slightly different pitches.  You adjust your receiver so it only resonates to one particular pitch, and then only one station gets received.  There's a whole branch of the government that sorts out whose radio transmitters are allowed to use which pitch (frequency).  Each station gets a range of radio spectrum it's allowed to use. </p>
<p>So here's the deal.  The lower the pitch, the less information there is in the signal!  Huh?  Well, if you have more than one radio station, you can't cram them too close together in pitch.   If the main pitches (the big kids call them  &quot;carrier frequencies&quot;) of two different radio stations are too close to each other, then receivers can't tell the two stations apart, and the sound that comes out of each receiver will be a mix of the two stations.  So you have to separate the radio stations' carrier frequencies.  The amount you have to separate them in pitch is about four times the number of times per second your speaker cone has to move.  So if you want to transmit high pitched sound at, say, 10,000 vibrations per second, you have to keep your stations more than about 40,000 vibrations per second apart in pitch.  AM radios transmit between 600,000 and 1,600,000 wave fronts per second, which limits the number of stations you can fit in the radio band.  The difference between those two numbers is about a million vibrations per second, so you can fit about 25 stations into the band if everyone wants to broadcast moderately high fidelity sound.</p>
<p>FM radios transmit at about 100,000,000 (100 million) wave fronts per second.  The band goes from 88 million to 108 million wave fronts per second.  The difference between those numbers is 20 million vibrations per second, so the FM band carries 20 times as much information in total as the AM band does. (thanks, /u/zed857!)</p>
<p>Instead of adding more stations (you could fit nearly 400 AM radio stations into the FM band!) we cut up the band into larger chunks.  Since each station can transmit over a band 15 times wider than an AM station, it can send 15 times more information into your receiver.  The receivers use that in two ways:  (1) with FM coding, which reduces noise; and (2) to transmit stereo (which uses twice as much of the radio spectrum as mono) and higher frequency sound (which doublesthe spectrum usage again:  AM is actually limited at something like 7.5 kHz, and FM goes to 15 kHz).</p>
<p>AM radio stations generally sound sort of washed-out and flat, because the highest pitch they can transmit is limited by the rules for radio transmission!  It's only about 7,500 cycles per second, which is not quite 4 octaves above middle C on the piano.  AM stations literally aren't allowed to transmit higher pitches than that. </p>
<p>FM radio stations have clearer sound because they can transmit higher pitches (like the difference between a telephone and a CD), and also because they can use even more of the radio spectrum to reduce the amount of background noise in your receiver.</p>
<p>AM came first because it's easier to make an electrical circuit that works a million times a second, than one that works at 100 million times a second.  Down in what we now call the AM band, there's just not a lot of room and technology like FM doesn't make much sense.  The whole AM band could only support about 5 FM radio stations operating at the same time.</p>
<p>When radios that could operate at 100 million times a second became common, everyone settled on the FM standard instead of using the same AM technique that was useful earlier -- because there's plenty of &quot;room&quot; up there at 100 million cycles per second.</p>
<p>If an AM station had the same bandwidth as an FM station, it could transmit sound just as clear as FM(!)  But AM is more susceptible to some kinds of interference (like lightning or electric motors) -- so FM was the natural choice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of radio waves as being light emitted from a flashlight. Now the AM flashlight, Amplitude Modulation, is basically a white flashlight that changes in intensity or brightness to transmit the signal. An FM flashlight, Frequency Modulation, is a flashlight that always has the same brightness and intensity, but it changes color to transmit the signal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>&quot;If you can imagine instead of a radio tower there is a giant lightbulb. This is essentially the same thing electromagnetic energy but instead of being in the radio part of the spectrum it is in the light part of the spectrum.</p>
<p>With the AM (amplitude modulation) lightbulb the signal would be varied by adjusting the brightness of the light. With the FM(frequency modulation) the light would change in color to produce a signal.</p>
<p>If you were trying to see this signal through static, say a bunch of trees it was be much easier to see what color was coming through than how bright the light was.&quot;</p>
<p>and the wonderful first comment underneath that, from /<a href="/user/TheRealBigLou" target="_blank">u/TheRealBigLou</a></p>
<p>&quot;At first I thought this was more of a metaphor but didn't really explain AM/FM. But then I realized that with visible light, amplitude IS brightness and frequency IS color.</p>
<p>This is brilliant!&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some of the answers here have focused on the fact that FM has more bandwidth than AM.  This is true, but it's not the whole picture.</p>
<p>FM stands for Frequency Modulation.  The frequency you tune on a radio is the <em>carrier</em>.  Signals are <em>modulated</em> onto the carrier.  FM modulates the signal onto the carrier by changing the frequency of the carrier slightly from its nominal value.  In order to detect an FM signal, the receiver has to &quot;look&quot; at the carrier, figure out how far it is from its nominal value, and create a value based on that.  Millions of these numbers create a waveform which is the original signal--the music that was played at the station.</p>
<p>AM stands for Amplitude Modulation.  The carrier wave is simply louder or softer to reflect the signal.  The receiver merely tunes to the carrier &quot;averages&quot; it to reconstruct the signal.</p>
<p>OK, now consider what happens when interference is introduced.</p>
<p>In FM, a change in the amplitude of the carrier due to interference has almost no impact on the signal.  Take a thunderstorm, for example.  Lightning throws a broad spectrum of EM into the atmosphere, which plays havoc with AM because some of that EM is at the same frequency as the station.  Because any amplitude changes in the carrier represent signal, you hear lightning on AM.  The lightning is still putting signal in the FM band, band but you don't hear it because adding a momentary pulse of 100 MHz isn't the same thing as creating a slight variation in the 100 MHz carrier to which you're tuned.</p>
<p>When FM does have interference on it, it's slight variations in frequency.  It turns out that the human ear is less sensitive to subtle variations in frequency than it is to sudden shifts in amplitude.</p>
<p>To make it short, FM doesn't simply have more bandwidth.  It's an inherently more robust way to transmit audio for human ears.</p>
<p>Where AM shined was in the old analog TV signals.  The audio was FM, but the video was mostly AM (not sure how the sync was transmitted).  The result was that when TV signals were weak, they were &quot;snowy&quot; but still watchable.  FM video would have made analog TV receivers unnecessarily complicated, and weak signals probably would have had more of a sudden drop-out effect like you get with weak FM radio stations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
