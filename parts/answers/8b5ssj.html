		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it has to do with a thing called &quot;arc distance&quot;</p>
<p>you don't see heights and lengths, you see how much of your cone of vision an object takes up. a 1 meter long object 1 meter away from you will take up ~53 degrees of your vision. another meter stick 1 meter beyond that would take up ~28 degrees of your vision. </p>
<p>the math is the geometry of an isosceles triangle, where the non-equal leg is the object being viewed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's linear, so a 1m ruler at 1m distance will appear the same size than a 2m ruler at 2m distance.</p>
<p>You can measure buildings that way. If a building is say 1000m away, you put aruler at 1m from your eye and see how high the building his on the ruler. Say you get 30cm (0.30m). You then know the building is 0.30m*1000m/1m=300m tall.</p>
<p>It's an application of <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercept_theorem" target="_blank">intercept theorem</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to deal with ratios here.</p>
<p>Let's say you have a meter rule 10 metres away from you. You then place another meter rule 100 metres away from you.</p>
<p>If you want to know what the &quot;height&quot; h of the second meter rule is when measured against the first, use the ratio h/10 = 1/100.</p>
<p>The rule is that the ratio of the perceived height to the distance you're measuring the perceived height at is equal to the ratio of the actual height to the actual distance. This is because they form similar triangles. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine standing directly in front of an object. Now imagine a triangle with one vertex at the side of the object, another vertex at the middle of the object and the 3rd vertex is at your eye.</p>
<p>You've just formed a right angled triangle. You also know the length of two sides. One side is as long as the distance between you and the object. Another side is half as long as the object is wide (since we have one vertex in the middle and another at the edge).</p>
<p>With this setup all it takes is some simple trigonometry, which we learn quite early on, to calculate the angle at the vertex that's sitting at your eye. Now since this angle covers half of the object, you multiply it by 2 to get the angle covering the whole object.</p>
<p>From now on it's quite simple. Let's say you have a 90 degree FOV, and the calculation above resulted in a 45 degree angle. It would mean that an object of that size, at that distance would fill up 45/90=50% of your vision.</p>
<p>It sounds hard, but if you reason it out a little bit at a time, none of the pieces are terribly hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
