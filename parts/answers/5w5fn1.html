		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laundry gets clean via the <em>forcing of detergent water and rinse water through the fibers repeatedly</em>. Eventually a build up of minerals from water accumulates in and around fibers, trapping dirt inside. This interferes with the cleaning process, especially with hard water. Towels feel scratchy as a result, so you resort to adding fabric softener. Fabric softener can accumulate in fibers too. A cup of vinegar added to rinse water will help prevent mineral build up and keep your laundry soft. You might even want to allow the vinegar to agitate and mix well into the rinse water and soak everything for 30 minutes. Don't worry, any residual vinegar smell will be gone when the laundry is dry. A vinegar rinse will help inhibit the growth of mold and mildew, which is what you smell in the thrift store. Sunlight kills microbes, so try hanging your blankets outdoors in the sunshine before storing them away. Store in a old pillow case on a ventilated shelf or buy a bedding storage bag with a zip closure. Don't pack things too tightly in your closet or in a box. Ventilation is your friend. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you don't wash them before storing, the bacteria and mold reproduce.</p>
<p>If you wash them and don't rinse them enough, the left over soap rots.</p>
<p>If you wash them and store them in boxes, they take on the smell of the boxes. Especially true if you use the same box over and over.</p>
<p>Last but not least, organic fibers break down over time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Towels and blankets smell after being stored for some time is because of the oils and skin cells that are deposited during use. Even the best laundry soap and bleach will never fully remove these things. What you are smelling is old body oils. Everything is clean but not everything can be removed. Over time your textiles will break down and deteriorate. I'm currently getting my masters degree in textile conservation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
