		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This effect only happens in matches that contain trace amounts of metal such as iron. For example, some match heads will contain some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III\)_oxide" target="_blank">iron (III) oxide</a>, i.e. the stuff in rust. This scattered iron oxide will have rather weak magnetic properties. However, when you burn the match, carbon present in the match can reduce the iron oxide to metallic iron:</p>
<p>Fe2O3 + 3C -&gt; 2Fe + 3CO</p>
<p>The metallic iron you get is ferromagnetic. As a result, the entire match will be much more strongly attracted to a magnet after burning. You can see a nice demonstration of this change in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WiPwGRELgA0" target="_blank">this clip</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
