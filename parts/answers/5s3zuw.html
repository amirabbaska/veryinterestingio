		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it's not known exactly what that limit is. Elements are defined by the number of protons in the nucleus, and larger nuclei are unstable and quickly decay (the biggest synthesized nuclei decay in fractions of a second). Eventually it is thought that instead of briefly forming a nucleus and decaying, really big nuclei will just have protons and neutrons &quot;drip&quot; away. Instead of being comparatively little <a href="http://klotza.blogspot.com/2016/01/cool-calculation-minimum-neutron-star.html" target="_blank">nuclear binding energy</a>, there will be none.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer is more nuanced than a simple yes or no. Theoretically there should be no limit, you keep smashing nuclei together to form higher and higher number elements which will decay faster than we would ever hope to detect them.</p>
<p>A more appropriate question would be, would we still consider it to be an element if it didn't stick around long enough to be detected, measured etc. for example if you scattered a proton off a Pb atom, for the fraction of a second which the proton interacts with the Pb nucleus (through elastic/inelastic scattering), would you consider it to be a Bi isotope or just a proton scattering off a Pb nucleus?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The good news is there is a theorized &quot;island of stability&quot;, where super heavy elements will actually become more stable again with high enough mass, and then tail off again into decreasing stability/half life. We are yet to observe this however.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is the stability of larger nuclei in any way influenced by the planet/environment they happen to be on? I kind of get the concept of nuclear binding energies, but are they susceptible to any other outside influences? In short, could we artificially emulate an environment whereby nuclear decay would slow down?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Piggybacking off of this topic, but how possible is it that aliens could have spaceships and stuff made of out matter that we've never seen? Is it possible that their civilization found a just of stuff off our periodic table that's easy to make and is stable?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
