		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to Wikipedia, which is absolutely not a doctor by any stretch of the imagination:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fetal alcohol syndrome usually occurs when a pregnant woman has more than four standard drinks per day.  Milder symptoms have been found with two drinks per day during the early part of pregnancy. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_alcohol_spectrum_disorder" target="_blank">source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Historically, people would be drinking &quot;small beer&quot; (small beer is beer made from grains already used to brew a batch of beer), which is about 2% abv compared to today's 5%+.  So the beer wasn't as alcoholic, and didn't cause as much of an issue as drinking a similar volume of beer would today.</p>
<p>Also, never forget that fetal alcohol syndrome was absolutely a problem in the past, even if not directly caused by the really weak beer they were drinking:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By 1750.... A letter was written to Parliament voicing
concerns about the gin problem and stating that, &quot;too often the
cause of weak, feeble, and distempered children, who must be,
instead of an advantage and strength, [become] a charge to their
country.&quot; <a href="http://www.come-over.to/FAS/congress.htm" target="_blank">Source</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Personally, I think history makes a fuckload more sense when you believe that most people in any position of power before 1800-ish were kinda drunk all the time and were born with some combination of inbreeding and FAS.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You may have fallen prey to the &quot;good old days&quot; media syndrome. Just because something is being reported on significantly today doesn't mean it was rare in the past. Our ability to figure out what's causing problems, and to spread messages has increased vastly and is often responsible for this lopsided instinct.</p>

<p>This report mentions discussion of &quot;weak and enfeebled children&quot; due to a &quot;gin drinking epidemic&quot; in 1714. It's fairly safe to say fetal alcohol syndrome has always been present, but it's likely it wasn't understood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Small amounts of alcohol aren't harmful to a baby, but large amounts are.  The problem is that nuanced positions like that are hard to get across in a public health context, since what's small depends on physiological features of the mother, and people naturally have differing opinions of how much is a small amount of alcohol.  It's a lot easier to get across the message that you shouldn't drink at all, which has the downside that women don't get to enjoy a drink now and then, but the upside of far higher compliance and many more healthy babies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First off, in olden days beer and wine were weaker and water more dangerous. Spirits were largely unheard of through much of human experience. But there were notes about distilled spirits causing children to be born with problems. </p>
<p>Now, drinking an occasional drink or two during pregnancy is probably alright. Your liver does its damn job.</p>
<p>Early on in development though, the fetus is especially vulnerable to birth defects, and every mother is different. Defects are also more likely if the mother drinks every day. </p>
<p>&quot;Don't drink during pregnancy&quot; is easier and more failsafe advice than &quot;Only a drink or two, try not to drink every day, and drink even less or not at all early in pregnancy&quot;   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is precautionary.</p>
<p>While it is believed that up to one drink a day is not harmful, many people have difficulty controlling their alcohol intake.  One drink turns into &quot;just one more&quot;, and suddenly you are in dangerous waters.</p>
<p>As a matter of public policy, saying no alcohol has a better outcomes than saying just one drink a day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
