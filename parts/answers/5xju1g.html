		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The radio frequency spectrum is a finite resource. If we &quot;run out of space&quot;, we're out of luck. But certain <em>portions</em> of the spectrum, allocated by agreement to specific purposes can and do &quot;fill up&quot;.  In that case, new national and possibly international regulations have to be written to reallocate portions of the spectrum involved.</p>
<p>Each portion of the [Radio Frequency Spectrum] (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_spectrum</a>) from 3 Hz. to 3000 GHz. (3 THz.) is allocated for use (or non-use) international agreement under the auspices of the International Telecommunication Union.</p>
<p>Each parts of the radio spectrum is apportioned by the ITU for different radio technologies and applications; some 40 radiocommunication services are defined in the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU_Radio_Regulations" target="_blank">ITU's Radio Regulations</a>.</p>
<p>The drafting, revision and adoption of the Radio Regulations is the responsibility of the World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) of the ITU, meetings of which are typically held every three or four years, most recently in Geneva in 2012.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We would suffer congestion, that's all.  If it got  bad enough, we'd adjust something, as usual.  </p>
<p>Spectrum is sort of finite, but not all communications have to be wireless.  And because of propagation, a lot of spectrum can be geographically repeated....  we did this (and still do) with the AM radio and FM radio bands.  We did it with cellular radio in the AMPS mobile phone strategy.  </p>
<p>A lot of data is low bandwidth.  A lot of data is carried on wires or can be shifted to wires and have only short distances covered by wireless.    There's directional methods, too, where antenna polarization is used to send separate signals on the same carrier frequency, as was done (and still is) on satellites.  </p>
<p>The  spectrum keeps getting bigger, and more efficient, too.   Digital signal processing (DSP) lets us put thousands of digital carriers on a single signal, and signals can co-exist on the same frequency using spread spectrum techniques.  </p>
<p>A lot depends on a lot, so to get better responses, maybe expand your question a little?  What's your concern?  Did you read somewhere that we're running out of spectrum?   Or is this just a general question?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We won't ever run out of space on the radio frequency spectrum, per se.  Instead, the radio frequency spectrum, or parts of it, will become over-saturated with signals.  Over-saturation causes the fidelity of the signals to decrease - i.e. what is received matches what was sent less and less.</p>
<p>There is a band of frequencies where this has sort of happened and there are a TON of things that are done to work around it.  That band of frequencies is around 2.4 GHZ which can be used without a license.  Here's just a few of the things in that band: </p>
<ul>
<li>Microwave ovens</li>
<li>Wireless Home Phones</li>
<li>Wifi</li>
<li>Bluetooth</li>
</ul>
<p>Since we can't see radio signals, the best way to visualize everything is to think of light.  A basic radio signal is like an incandescent light bulb - casting light in all directions a short distance.  Saturation would be like having too many light bulbs on in one place.</p>
<p>One method of dealing with saturation is shielding.  Microwave ovens so that it can cook your food better.  In our light analogy, this would be like putting the light bulb in a room so that we can see the light when in the room but not outside the room.</p>
<p>Another method is limiting power to what is needed.  Your wireless home phone only needs to work within the confines of your home.  Your bluetooth devices only needs to work within the confines of your person.  For both devices, the power is set to work well in the expected range and that's it.  In the light analogy, this would be like having a dimmer switch so that you can adjust the amount of light to what you need and no more.</p>
<p>Modulation of frequency, amplitude, and/or phase.  Wifi makes use of all these type of modulation.  When the signal is good (little/no interference), it can combine these to deliver information faster.  When the signal is not a good (minor/major interference), it can use these to deliver information with more fidelity.  The reason these method can work better with interference is because the signal is encoded in the modulation rather than the radio wave itself.  In our light analogy, this would be like everyone having white flashlights and using colored flashlights for communication.</p>
<p>Directional transmission is another way of handling saturation.  Cell phone towers typically have 3 directional antennas that each cover 120 degrees.  The main reason to do this was to handle 3 times the signal with each tower.  The other reason was that directional antennas can transmit further because they are more focused.  In our light analogy, this would be like using flashlights instead of incandescent bulbs or lasers instead of flashlights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's an interesting question, because in the U.S. we are about to have a major restructuring of the band of frequencies between 600 and 698 MHz, mandated by Congress. This affects primarily television broadcasters and wireless microphone users. What is most likely to happen is that more efficient digital technologies will be developed &amp; used for each type of service, meaning each type of service used (individual tv channels, microphones, etc) will require a significantly smaller slice of spectrum than prior technologies. For instance, wireless mic manufacturer Shure has developed a technology that will allow you to run 47 (wow!) digital wireless microphones in just 6 MHz of radio spectrum. That's an impossible number-vs-spectrum with traditional analog wireless microphones. The trade-off is distance: it's short-range, i.e. ~30 meters, IIRC. But that's plenty for most applications. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy-channel_coding_theorem" target="_blank">Shannon limit</a> places a strict bound on the amount of information you can send through a given amount of spectrum.</p>
<p>However, if you use a smart enough radio, with antennas spread out through space, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIMO" target="_blank">MIMO</a> lets you multiply the data rate by the number of antennas.  In theory, this multiplier can be arbitrarily high.</p>
<p>Traditional radio is like an LED pointed at a photocell; MIMO is like a camera pointed at a TV.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
