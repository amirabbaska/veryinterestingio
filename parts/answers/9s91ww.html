		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Dr. Gabor Mate's book &quot;When the Body Says No,&quot; he explores, with scientific rigor and literature review, how harboring emotions is tied to many different diseases.  Carrying emotional stress, even at a subconscious level, causes the body's stress response system to always be switched on.  Our bodies continuously produce the stress hormones: cortizol, adrenaline, and/or others (if memory serves).   These hormones then flow constantly or frequently in our bloodstream for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>We evolved with our stress response system for short bursts of energy, to win a fight, to escape a predator, to paralyze, freeze, and hide from terror.  Lives filled with constant financial stress, housing/food insecurity, living with abusers (parents/spousal/elder), childhood trauma (see the ACES Study) routinely trigger our stress hormones.  These hormones eventually pickle the most susceptible organs/systems in our bodies as defined by genetics and our lifestyle and are linked to: dementia, ALS, alzheimer's, cancer, arthritis, inflammation, IBS, crohn's disease, acne, asthma, osteoporosis, fibromyalgia, other autoimmune disorders, ADD/ADHD and more...</p>
<p>TLDR: Yes and it is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the best sources of information on this topic, IMHO, is Robert Sapolsky's work on baboons.</p>
<p>They all eat and exercise similarly, and their natural biology isn't worlds different from human biology. He studies stress hormones, cardiovascular health, etc. in long-term studies of their behavior and blood work.</p>
<p>Baboons that don't express aggression, in his studies, have worse health outcomes, associated with the negative effects of long-term elevated catecholamine levels.</p>
<p>His book, <em>Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers</em>, is a good and accessible pop-science treatment of this overall topic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
