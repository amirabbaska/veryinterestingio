		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are doubtlessly quite a few, here's a start:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Komatiite" target="_blank">Komatiitic flows</a>. These are a type of volcanic flow involving low-silica magnesium-rich lava. Komatiites had a distinctive composition, were high-volume, very high tempearture and low in volatiles. They used to produce large sheets and are associated with nickel deposits. Their production required the earths mantle to be hotter than it currently is. Most are af Archean age (&gt; 2.5 billion years) with a few slightly younger stragglers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another obvious one would be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banded_iron_formation#Relation_to_atmospheric_oxygenation" target="_blank">Banded Iron Formations</a>, especially Algoma types. BIFs are laminated sedimentary deposits rich in iron oxydes, and the source of most iron production today. These were related to the great oxygenation event and are pretty much all formed in the Proterozoic (2.5 to 0.54 billion years ago.)</p>
</li>
<li>Planetary glaciations of the <a href="http://authors.library.caltech.edu/1015/1/KOPpnas05.pdf" target="_blank">&quot;Snowball Earth&quot;</a> type. Imagine the icecaps growing all the way past the tropics and meeting at the equator ... Latest one ended about 580 million years ago, and we haven't seen another one since.</li>
</ul>
<p>A comprehensive list could undoubtedly be done, but it would require work...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/01/07/the-fantastically-strange-origin-of-most-coal-on-earth/" target="_blank">Coal formation.</a> It can still happen, but the Carboniferous era was pretty much a one-shot deal for producing useful amounts (&gt;90% of total reserves) of high-quality coal.</p>
<p>Lycopsid trees (which incidentally look like something by Dr. Seuss) had just invented lignin, a major polymer in modern wood. It took a while for decomposers to fully catch up and figure out how to break down this new polymer fast enough to keep up. Enormous amounts of dead trees that could not rot piled up until they were buried or burned in massive forest fires. Quite a lot of coal started out as charcoal from those forest fires of dead rot-proof trees.</p>
<p>Decomposers eventually learned to keep up with lignin, and it's still around as part of the wood in every form of plantlife you'd consider a tree. Nothing like the Carboniferous will ever happen again unless trees invent a new inedible polymer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Larger astaroid impacts - I leave on the US eastcoast and what most people here don't know is that the Chesapeake Bay is a large impact crater (the southern portion is). Obviously elsewhere there are others that shaped the world we live in. Now, the solar system is pretty cleaned up, and we just get the occasional overblown scare (for the latest check Phil Platt's Bad Astronomy website, where ever it lives now) .</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the carboniferous period, the oxygen level in the atmosphere was quite a bit higher than it is now (35% by volume vs. 21% now).  It is speculated that this led to immense, raging, forest fires, the likes of which we do not see today.  Even swamps and high moisture vegetation were speculated to be able to burn in that level of oxygen.</p>
