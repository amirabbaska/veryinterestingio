		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, ER small animal vet here</p>
<p>My question is how do you envision the results of your study to be implemented on a clinical, private practice level? For example do you expect all dogs over a certain age to be put on rapamycin prophylactically? Have there been any contraindications you have identified? Does treatment continue, escalate, or discontinue once patients invariably develop chronic disease (CKD, valvular degeneration)?  Does treatment continue when short term incidental disease is diagnosed (UTI, pancreatitis, etc)?</p>
<p>What MOA do you propose causes the desirable effects of rapamycin related to aging?</p>
<p>Are dogs with genetically known high risk for disease included in the study and do you propose rapamycin decreases risk of developing these diseases? Example DCM in dobermans, mast cell disease in boxers, disk disease in dachshunds. </p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time to respond.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

We just put down one of our dogs and towards the end she just seemed forgetful, like she never quite understood what's going on or what she's doing. If so, is there anything Dementia in other mammals can teach us about Human Dementia?</p>
<p>Also, when does the Interventional study start? I have a dog who's currently 5 that seems like he would be a good candidate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
