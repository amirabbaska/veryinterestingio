		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The issue here comes down to the type of verb &quot;am&quot; is acting as in each context. </p>
<p>&quot;Am&quot; is the present tense of the verb &quot;to be&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;To be&quot; and all of its conjugate forms function differently than other verbs in the English language. To be can be an active verb, an inactive linking verb, or an auxiliary verb, depending on its form and context. </p>
<p>In the sentence &quot;I am.&quot;, the verb &quot;am&quot; is serving as an active verb, in the transitive, which means it links directly to the subject. In this context am is synonymous with &quot;exist&quot;, and so the sentence is complete. </p>
<p>However, in the contraction &quot;I'm&quot;, the am is no longer synonymous with &quot;exist&quot; and so the sentence isn't complete. The contraction &quot;I'm&quot; uses the auxiliary form of the word am. Auxiliary verbs are verbs that require other verbs to form a complete sentence. In the colloquial usage, &quot;I'm&quot; almost always precedes an active verb and a direct object.</p>
<p>&quot;I'm going to the store.&quot;
&quot;I'm driving there later.&quot;
&quot;I'm thinking about what to make for dinner.&quot;</p>
<p>This is why &quot;I'm&quot; cannot be a complete sentence on its own. Same verb base, different usage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a relevant answer taken from <a href="https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/500/is-there-some-rule-against-ending-a-sentence-with-the-contraction-its" target="_blank">Stack Exchange</a>. (Go there for better formatting and more detail. I take no credit.)</p>
<p>This is covered in the Cambridge Grammar of the English Language (CGEL), as it turns out, in Chapter 18, “Inflection Morphology and Related Matters”, section 6, “Phonological reduction and liaison”.</p>
<p>The form ’s, representing either has or is, along with ’m (am), ’re (are), ’ve (have), ’ll (will), and ’d(had or would) are called <strong>clitics</strong>, and they are a variant of what are known as <strong>weak forms</strong> of words, which are pronunciations of words like a, have, from, you, etc. (about fifty in total) with a reduced vowel, such as schwa.</p>
<p>In the discussion of weak and strong forms, CGEL points out that there are certain grammatical contexts that require strong forms, and one of those contexts is something called stranding, where the object of a phrase is preposed (moved before the phrase). These are examples they give of stranding requiring strong forms:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>a. <em>Who did you give it</em> [to <strong> ]?<br />
b. <em>We’ll help you if we</em> [can </strong>].<br />
c. <em>They want me to resign, but I don’t intend</em> [to __].</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In each of these cases, the word in the brackets has a weak form, but it cannot be used in this context because its object has been stranded. Of course, in written English, there is no difference between weak and strong forms—it’s only a spoken difference—but clitics are distinguished in written English, and the restriction on weak forms also extends to clitics. (There are additional restrictions on clitics, but they are not relevant to this discussion).</p>
<p>So, thus we can say that the second is in the sentence <em>It is what it</em> [is __] cannot be reduced to either a weak form or to a clitic because of the restriction to strong forms in cases of syntactic stranding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Although technically 'I'm' is a contraction of 'I am', there are differences in usage.  'I'm' is less formal, and is is universally followed with more words which describe what you are, usually an adjective (eg, 'I'm tall').</p>
<p>For instance, if I you asked me if I was a reddit poster, I could say 'I am', but I couldn't say 'I'm.'  Conventional usage allows the 'I am' to refer back to the previous sentence for context in describing what I am, but it doesn't allow 'I'm' to.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where the convention came from, but it's how they're used.</p>
<p>PS: it's worth mentioning the same convention applies to other contractions.  If I ask if someone is going to drive to work, someone can reply &quot;they will&quot;, but they can't reply &quot;they'll&quot; on it's own - they'd have to say &quot;they'll drive&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In &quot;I am&quot;, the emphasis is on the word &quot;am&quot;. The shortened form can't be emphasised, so it can't replace the word &quot;am&quot; in that sentence.</p>
<p>In Dutch, you have the same thing with the pronouns &quot;jij&quot; and &quot;je&quot;, which both mean &quot;you&quot;. But the second one also can't have emphasis on it. So if you have an exchange like </p>
<p>&quot;Who has to do the dishes?&quot; </p>
<p>&quot;You.&quot;</p>
<p>You'd have to use the first one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
