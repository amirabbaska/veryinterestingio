		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In evolutionary terms, vegetable items are available in great abundance, but salts, sugars, fats and proteins are far more difficult to obtain. Fast forward to today in the developed world, our bodies are still programmed to seek out these foods and assume that we will get plenty on vitamins ,minerals and fiber from our environment. </p>
<p>Edit: replaced these with vegetable for clarity</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A craving for a specific food is a behavior that must evolve in order to be effective, and our food landscape has changed a lot in the last few thousand years such that evolution hasn't caught up to it. Imagine what your ancestors probably lived like 10,000 years ago: They were nomadic peoples who's behaviors were similar to apes of today. Now, while foraging, they probably came accross foods like what we eat today-- say, a head of Parsley-- and grabbed it. But, Parsley is not very calorically dense-- and our ancestors were hungry. If they didn't get enough calories, they died-- and that meant no offspring, and no you. So, they evolved (or rather, their ancestors evolved) a craving for nutrient-dense foods. Sugar, in sufficient quantity, can be tasted in proportion to prevalence-- and an orange has more sugar than a head  of parsley, so we began to crave sugar. The same became true of fat, which has more than twice the calories per gram than sugars. Salt, too, was a rarity-- but unlike Sugar and Fat, provides no calories-- but nonetheless, we need it to survive.</p>
<p>But, we came across oranges and avocadoes rarely, and parsley quite often-- so while we need the stuff in parsley that fat and sugar lack, it was never in short supply. So, what advantage would a parsley craving yield? none.</p>
<p>Now, salt is a bit trickier. There are very few naturally salty foods, but there is a good bit of salt in calorically dense foods like meat and eggs. These foods spoil easily, and can contain unpalatable, bitter components-- but they are so nutrient dense, it was worth it to our ancestors to risk it. So, if salt was present, it would prevent tasting bitter foods-- which is why a sprinkle of salt on grapefruit (plus sugar) makes it taste tremendously better, without tasting too salty. But we also had to, in the process, evolve taste receptors for salt-- and cravings come along with that.</p>
<p>Today, fat, sugar and salt are the abundant foods. If a human developed a craving for antioxidant rich foods, and therefore avoided cancer and was more likely to reproduce, they might pass along those cravings to their kids-- but for now, we haven't evolved to our new diets. And the advent of modern medicine makes it unlikely we ever will through natural means.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A large part is because people are terrible at cooking vegetables. Seriously, if someone did to a steak what your average person does to broccoli there'd be a lynching. Boil to mush? No, you steam those motherfuckers then mix with garlic, sesame oil, toasted pine nuts, and strong tangy cheese. </p>
<p>Plain boiled carrots? What is this? Do you want people to hate food? What you do is you brown some onions, squeeze some lemons, add a little sugar and butter then put in your carrots to steep until they've absorbed enough of the delicious flavour and become sharp spears of exploding deliciousness. </p>
<p>Fuck, you can take onions -just onions- and make something that tastes like warm happiness if you give it a little care and attention. Same with tomatoes; chop them fine enough, add a little oil and oregano then fry lightly. Shit's delicious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are tons of bacteria in our gut that give us cravings for the foods that we already tend to eat. These bacteria take up shop living on whatever we throw their way (they are such troopers for that). In the case of vegetables, we even depend on the existence of these bacteria to properly digest and absorb all that planty goodness. Mutualism at its finest! A lot of kids grow up without a diet rich in vegetables and instead turn to other foods to get their calories. Lets be honest, the vegetable group is just really boring, especially to kids. Sugar and fat is so tasty and our body needs it for its loads of energy (they are also relatively cheap in comparison to the vegetable counterpart). These children that take on diets consisting of other, non-vegetable, foods will now grow up with intestinal bacteria specifically designed to thrive in the environment they have been given. Research shows that these bacteria can really impact your diet choices and even interestingly enough, mental state of mind and behavior. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fruit and vegetables were relatively plentiful whilst humanity and our predecessors were evolving. What's not plentiful is very high calorie foods which is why humans find that sort of food so delicious, it's something that we'd have very rarely before we developed agriculture, even afterwards it wasn't common.</p>
<p>But now we have access to that food all the time, but the senses aren't dulled to it, so we still have the same appetite for it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
