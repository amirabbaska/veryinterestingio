		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stability--shoulder mounted cameras are much more stable than small handheld cameras).  The difference is significant enough there is a cottage industry making shoulder mountings for those tiny cameras.</li>
<li>Controls--gopros have a fixed fish eye lens) large cameras can often zoom like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bos2ZTGNZc" target="_blank">this</a>.  While news cameramen don't often use the zoom lens in a shot, they often use the different focal lengths available.  </li>
<li>Battery life--The large shoulder mount allows a battery that powers the camera for several hours.  </li>
<li>Storage--The large camera allows storage of several hours of high quality video.</li>
<li>Video quality--While both might shoot a 1080p signal, the news camera keeps <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Colorcomp.jpg" target="_blank">most of the data</a>.  Cheap cameras drop most of the captured color data (like the image on the left while the large one can keep an image like the one on the right.  For viewing footage, both are usually good enough, but the images on the left will show if they are heavily edited or color graded (made to exactly match colors of other footage).</li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some nice to have features like better mikes, better cabling, and much better viewfinders that all require more space.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Retired camera op here: There's still the matter of mass.  While smaller, lighter equipment is great for less effort packing around in the field, a full size-ish camera has the advantage of increased mass which makes for smoother, steadier image capture when you're working handheld.</p>
<p>Any little movement shooting with a lightweight rig will tend to result in a shaky picture.  With a heavier camera the small movements are somewhat cancelled because of the effort to move the larger mass.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Getting all the right pieces required to make professional video for news requires certain things: high quality lens, plug-ins for video and audio on separate channels (ins and outs), a decent viewfinder that actually shows an image of what you’re recording accurately...</p>
<p>But the most important is a shoulder-mount ENG (electronic news gathering) style camera.  </p>
<p>The reason shoulder-mount is still the most popular is because of the improvisational nature of the news.  You have to react to anything at any moment.  A DSLR gives a film look with a creamy background when shooting video, but the controls are laid out to be more still photo-friendly.  This makes it so quick adjustments I can make with my ENG camera are often buried in menus on a DSLR.  And without more expensive and time consuming gear, shooting with a DSLR without a tripod is not exactly steady video.   With an ENG, my shoulder and my body can stabilize my shots and I can keep shooting while adjusting settings and keeping my shot stable and in focus. This feature is a must for live TV whereas I can’t look down at my DSLR settings in the middle of a live shot while zooming and pulling focus.</p>
<p>We use DSLRs, but as a second or third camera for big interviews.  I honestly use my tripod as much as I can, but there’s several key moments where you NEED to shoulder the camera or tripods are not allowed.  And without a tripod/mount, any smaller cameras are inferior to ENG shoulder-mount cameras in live situations, sports, improvising, and any time where major adjustments to settings have to be made while walking backwards (confrontations, perp/court walks, politicians).  Those examples are the bread and butter of news.  So, don’t expect to suddenly see DSLRs out in the field with news crews.  Shoulder mounted is king.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Those bulky cameras also have a lot more features that smaller cameras don't always have, eg. The ability to have 4 different audio channels, SDI out for live hits, dedicated toggles/switches/buttons that allow the operator to quickly adjust settings on the fly. They are also fairly robust and hold up better to abuse when you have to use them everyday. Plus it gives you more of a presence when out shooting news, cops and fire are less likely to give you a hard time when you have a big news camera with you.</p>
