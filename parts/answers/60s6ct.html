		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on what type of Librarian you are talking about.</p>
<p>Librarians assistants are generally just the people who learn about librarian functions and are the people who put the books away, do general checkout functions, so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Librarians, are generally like supervisors. They oversee the librarian's assistants and do daily work such as general supervision, overseeing a libraries general functions in addition to just checking out books, and organizing the Libraries overall day to day affairs. Ordering new books, processing new releases, so on and so forth...</p>
<p>Librarian Managers are usually overseeing multiple installations, or even non-traditional library resources. Sometimes Museums will have libraries or specialty function libraries such as University libraries. Also, this is where you will start to get into special functions such as document maintenance, archival and care. Larger institutions such as University libraries have VERY LARGE collections, spanning 100s of thousands of pieces, in multiple different departments, more than 1 single Librarian and their assistants can adequately manage.</p>
<p>Then you have Librarian Directors. When Libraries get so large that they have multiple departments, you need a Director level, who typically will be overseeing the business side of opening and maintaining either large University Libraries, or entire systems of local libraries. Take a single City... You could have 20 or more libraries within a system that serves that city, as well as manages several school library's contents and local municipal libraries. You'll have 1 Director, Several Managers, and at least 2-5 Librarians per library itself. </p>
<p>That level of staffing, needs proper management. So when you are getting your Masters in Library Science, some of the courses are also business management skills as well as advanced Librarians systems classes. Document restoration, special documents care, archival systems... these are not simple procedures that can just be taught on the fly, several years of education is needed to make sure that not only does the library stay properly stocked, but also that you can handle the challenges of maintaining books, relics, artifacts and everything else that may walk in your door.</p>
<p>edit: In addition to my normal post, like I said there are many other positions inside libraries that require specialized training and having someone that has been properly trained is a necessity, regardless of how much you make.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Edit:</em> I appreciate the gold, but if anyone else feels compelled to gild my comment, please consider donating that money to your local library or to <a href="http://everylibrary.org/" target="_blank">EveryLibrary</a>. Libraries are going to need all the support we can get in the coming years!</p>
<p>I am the youth services librarian at a small city library. Well, technically my position is listed as library assistant so the city can pay me less, yes I make less than 50k, but that's a whole different issue. The point is I have the duties of a librarian and have the degree to go with it regardless of what my position is actually called. I don't currently have it with me at home, but tomorrow when I am at work I can pull up my job description from when I applied for the position. It is four pages long. </p>
<p>As a youth services librarian I need to plan programs for youth from newborns to high school. I run storytimes two to three times a week that require extensive knowledge of early literacy practices. In spite of popular belief, storytimes are not just reading books to kids.  In addition to weekly storytime programming, I also develop and run other programs aimed at youth of various age groups. This includes things like STEAM programs for elementary aged students and community outreach programs at the local schools.</p>
<p>I am responsible for developing the collection of books and media for all youth, newborn through high school, and making sure that the collection meets the needs of my community. Collection development is not just buying new books, but also weeding old materials and cultivating the collection to reflect the community it serves.</p>
<p>Summer reading is a huge thing at nearly all public libraries. Guess who is responsible for planning and organizing that? Yep, me. </p>
<p>In addition to all that, I need to do things like write grants to ensure that we get extra funding for special programming and events that we might not be able to fit into the budget otherwise.</p>
<p>I also provide reference assistance to all library patrons. People underestimate the value of reference librarians in the age of google, but we can be a huge asset in finding the information you need and making sure that it is from an accurate and reliable source.</p>
<p>Since I knew I wanted to go into youth services, many of the classes I took gave me that early literacy training that is essential to making sure I am successful at my job. I also took courses in collection development, cataloging, copyright, and research methods. We learn how to not only find information, but also figure out what that person is actually looking for even when their questions aren't clear. </p>
<p>There is so much to being a librarian that people don't really see. They think all we do is shelve books and check them out and in, but a lot goes on at your library to make sure that it is actually the valuable asset to the community that it should be.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a children's librarian who got hired without having a masters.</p>
<p>I have a bachelor's in elementary education and worked as a classroom teacher and a school librarian for several years.  When I applied to this position, it said &quot;MLIS preferred&quot; (MLIS is the librarian masters) but it didn't require it.  Luckily the hiring manager valued experience over the degree.  Some hiring library directors are sticklers for the degree.  The board of trustees still wants me to get my MLIS in the future, but they aren't pushing too hard.  </p>
<p>As a children's librarian, the majority of what I do was covered under my education degree-- running story times and programs and whatnot.  I also have a decent understanding of children's literature and choosing appropriate books for each child's level from my education experience that I believe outshines what someone would learn at library school.</p>
<p>Where I lack knowledge is in collection and budget management.    I'm responsible for developing the children's collection-- seeing holes in the collection and filling them, knowing which old books to weed and which to keep, managing the budget to create the strongest collection possible for the money, etc.  I also have to manage the program budget, find and apply for grants, seek donations, spend donations appropriately, etc.  For those things I still ask for help a lot from the degreed librarians I work with, but I'm learning quickly on the job.</p>
<p>I definitely wouldn't be able to do some of the functions of our reference librarian without some higher learning.  She manages our catalog and has to know and apply certain algorithms to keep it searchable.  She also collaborates with other libraries to keep our collection balanced and relevant.  Finally, she acts as the historical preservation point person for the town.  She catalogs, organizes, and properly stores town documents and historical records and has to be able to find and access relevant information quickly when it's needed by town and state committees and government officials.</p>
<p>When it comes to research, she is able to find obscure things most others can't due to her knowledge of databases and where to look.  She has college professors come in asking for help because, while anyone can search google and find how to make a chicken dinner or get information on the civil war or whatever, it takes skill and a knowledge of where to look and what to search for if you're trying to find something more obscure.</p>
<p>We have discussions within my library all the time about whether a masters is actually required or whether it serves as more of a gate keeping thing to keep the profession &quot;exclusive&quot;.  It's probably about 50/50.  Higher learning IS required for many parts of the field, but not all.</p>
<p>Personally, I'd like to see it switch over to a bachelor's for general librarianship with master's degrees available for the more specialized librarian fields.   I'd also like to see more hands-on and internship-based learning rather than strictly theoretical classes.  Many newly-graduated MLIS students have never actually worked in a library and, while they know all the theory, they don't have the day-to-day skills being a librarian requires.  But right now it's mostly tradition that's preventing that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am a librarian/archivist (my title is librarian but I'm actually an archivist in a public library) who got my MSLS last year.  While I honestly wish librarianship was more of an apprenticeship, I do apply things I learned in grad school in my job.  I also worked in libraries before attending library school and I found I was nowhere near prepared to be a professional.  Library school isn't just shushing and cat petting.  I took management, legal issues for librarians, and digital preservation course in addition to the traditional reference, information organization, and collection development.  I also took classes in archival description and arrangement, archival appraisal, and metadata which are very applicable to my job.  I also help my patrons navigate copyright issues that are quite complex when you work in an archive.  These are skills I probably wouldn't learn in an apprenticeship situation unless I had a librarian dedicated to teaching me those skills.  My professors were those dedicated librarians basically.  I despised library school but as a professional, I see how it's useful.</p>
<p>Edit:  This blew up overnight and I have a lot of interesting questions in my inbox that I am happy to answer when I get home from work today.  Also, thanks to whoever gave me gold but I would prefer you spent your money on causes that help libraries out.  With slashes to the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, libraries are at risk of losing all of their federal funding in the next budget.  Organizations such as Every Library and the American Library Association are working hard to advocate for themselves in this time of crisis for libraries.  Please consider supporting them in their fight.  And please call your representatives and fight for the issues you care about.  Consider adding the NEH and IMLS to those issues you don't want to see slashed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know that no one will read this comment, but I would like to add that my mother is the Librarian of a small town (pop. 8000) and holds the title of Librarian - which is just as you described. Her job is more managerial than anything else, she basically just oversees to the operation of the library, and ensures that it runs like clockwork.</p>
<p>Also, her degree is in social work, with a minor in English, and it is a Bachelor's.</p>
<p>I guess the point I am trying to make is that a Librarian in the particular position she is in - with the responsibilities she has - the powers at be are looking for a person that possesses the social intelligence of dealing with a wide range of people, from the homeless that come in to use the free computers/internet to dealing with the general public at their board meetings or whatever. And of course, book smarts and a passion for books and learning. Especially with children, as she has spearheaded many programs at the library for disadvantaged students. She wears many hats, and they all fit her perfectly.</p>
<p>Also, I would like to add that our particular library, like most (of the kind of library my mother runs) is so very important for the community as a whole. It is a resource that is used by the poor and the wealthy alike. A few months ago I walked into a reading section where a local homeless man was involved in a passionate argument with one of the wealthiest men in town, I wasn't able to catch the whole discussion, but it was over Proust. It was beautiful, something that you don't see every day.</p>
<p>It is a SAFE PLACE for people to come together and take in the cornerstone of civilization - knowledge. And knowledge doesn't discriminate between rich and poor, young and old - these things don't matter, which is why discussions that are held in libraries are soooo fucking cool.</p>
<p>Also, a few of the children get-togethers at libraries --- sometimes (sadly), they have nothing to do with books or learning. Remember the thing about &quot;safe space&quot; I brought up? A library is one for children. Children that don't have a nice home or caring parents to look forward to after school. Going to a library can be a great excuse for these kids to get out of their situation, if only for a little bit.</p>
<p>I know know how most libraries are funded, libraries of this size anyway. I know that donors play a huge part though, so I encourage you, I implore you to please support your local library.</p>
<p>That place that you pass by every day, wondering why it still exists because &quot;hey we have the internet now&quot;, represents so much more than the books on the shelves. It is an integral part of the community. Like how a hospital provides an extension of life, your local library provides an extension of purpose.</p>
<p>edit: Wow! Thanks for thinking this was gold worthy, kind internet person! I honestly thought this would just be buried along with the other hundred replies to the OP. If anyone else thinks this stuff is important, I beg you to take that reddit gold money and donate it to a library in need, preferably the library in your own community. Like I said above, many poor people utilize the resources at the library because they are free, and the library is an open and safe place to be. We, as a society, can only benefit from a more educated public. There is absolutely no downside in your average person learning about art, engineering, or philosophy. Educating breeds better societies, more altruistic people, and a better community for all.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
