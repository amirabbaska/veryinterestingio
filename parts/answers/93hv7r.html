		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lava lamp uses a heater at the bottom of the lamp - this means that the bottom of the vessel is warm, but as you move away from the heater (towards the top of the lamp) it cools down.</p>
<p>The 'lava' inside the lamp is a certain type of wax/oil that is chosen for the way it interacts with water - when cold it is heavier than the water used in the lamp and sits at the bottom, then when it warms up it expands, which makes it slightly less dense than the water and lets it start to float upwards. As the lava reaches the higher levels of the lamp it then starts to cool down until it becomes more dense than the water, sinking back down again.</p>
<p>The lava moving is this cycle constantly repeating - blobs of lava heating up enough to rise to the top, then cooling down enough to fall to the bottom where they will be warmed again and rise up... Because the lava is liquid and doesn't heat uniformly, it then takes on the organic appearance with different blobs all being at different stages of this process, combining and splitting as they heat and cool slightly differently on the top and bottom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oil and wax that have similar densities, but different thermal expansion coefficients.</p>
<p>Wax is heated by a hot bulb in the bottom, causing it to expand, reducing it's density.</p>
<p>The wax expands faster than the oil, so it eventually becomes less dense than the oil and floats.</p>
<p>The lamp continually loses heat to the atmosphere though (they're warm or even hot to the touch), so the top is always cooler than the bottom. At the top, the wax cools down enough that it's denser than the oil, and it sinks again to repeat the process.</p>
<p>Because they're both fluids, this happens in blobs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mix is paraffin wax, carbon tetrachloride, and mineral oil that will be labeled as “material” in this post.</p>
<p>Temperature is a gradient, meaning the distance from the origin of the source will have a decrease in temperature. The lamp fixture heats up the bottom where the colored material starts. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy from said material increases as well. The material expands (analogously like boiling water) allowing it to float to the top where the temperature is lower. After some time, the energy dissipates from the material and it gently floats back down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paraffin wax is melted then mixed with perchlorethyline (brake fluid) to give it more viscosity. The liquid solution is water with antifreeze and dish soup added in small amounts. The antifreeze is there to just ensure the sealed vessel does not freeze. The dish soap affects the surface tension of the water to wax. Soap causes wax to break up to the separate balls and chunks that then join back together. More soap=smaller chunks. The vessel is then placed over the heat source (light bulb) when the mixture heats it rises, melts, and morphs shapes. Reaches the top, cools and falls. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Differential thermal expansion coefficient.</p>
<p>Basically, almost all things expand as they hear up. Certain things expand more than others. </p>
<p>The “lava” in the lamp has a higher density than the hydrocarbon solution in the lamp when cool. But, heat it up and it expands (it’s volume increases). But, because you can’t create mass this way, it’s density decreases. The decrease is great enough enough that it is now less dense than the liquid around it. </p>
<p>Thus, it floats to the top. However, the top of the bottle is cooler than the bottom so the “lava” cools and floats back down to the bottom.</p>
<p>Of course, mixed in with this are convection currents (hot material rises, cools, and falls back down again) which helps the effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
