		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Excerpts from neurosurgeon Henry Marsh's book &quot;Do No Harm&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>“Each brain tumour is different. Some are as hard as rock, some as soft as jelly. Some are completely dry, some pour with blood – sometimes to such an extent that the patient can bleed to death during the operation. Some shell out like peas from a pod, others are hopelessly stuck to the brain and its blood vessels. You can never know for certain from a brain scan exactly how a tumour will behave until you start to remove it. This man’s tumour was, as surgeons say, cooperative and with a good surgical plane – in other words, it was not stuck to the brain. I slowly cored it out, collapsing the tumour in on itself away from the surrounding brain. After three hours it looked as though I had got most of it out. The operation continued until I had removed all of the tumour without injuring any of the surrounding vital architecture of the brain.”</p>
</li>
<li>“This type of tumour (solid haemangioblastoma) is the only time in brain tumour surgery that you have to remove the tumour ‘en bloc’ – in a single piece – since if you enter the tumour you will be instantly faced by torrential bleeding. With all other tumours in brain surgery you gradually ‘debulk’ it, sucking or cutting out the inside of it, collapsing it in on itself, away from the brain, and thus minimizing damage to the brain. With solid haemangioblastomas, however, you ‘develop the plane’ between the tumour and the brain, creating a narrow crevice a few millimetres wide by gently holding the brain away from the surface of the tumour. You coagulate and divide the many blood vessels that cross from the brain to the tumour’s surface, trying not to damage the brain in the process. All this is done with a microscope under relatively high magnification – although the blood vessels are tiny, they can bleed prodigiously. One quarter of the blood pumped every minute by the heart, after all, goes to the brain.”</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes they aren't. Tumors can sort of grow &quot;roots&quot; which tendril out into the brain, and any of these being left behind would result in recurrence. In this case they remove the bulk of the tumor and continue chemo/radiation to knock out what remains. Trying to go after those tendrils would require excision of the surrounding healthy tissue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in neurosurgery as someone that monitors the integrity of the nervous system during such surgeries. Many of the top comments touch on the main points. I'll add a bit to what others have contributed. First, it depends upon the tumor. Some tumors have rigid edges and some are more fluid filled. Solid tumors (an example is a hemangioblastoma) have a consistency similar to a meatball (from observation, I can't touch the tumors!) and often they'll radiate the tumor to kill off some of the tissue. This results in a barrier between the healthy brain tissue and the tumor itself. Think about a frozen water bottle that is about halfway melted. The liquid water in this analogy is natural cerebral spinal fluid, which is like blood for your brain, while the ice is the tumor itself. If you were to have a very steady hand, a microscope, and a hot pair of tweezers, I bet you'd be able to pick out the ice without melting the plastic bottle itself—the healthy brain tissue in this analogy.</p>
<p>For less solid tumor, such as the glioblastoma that John McCain died from, the boundaries blend with healthy tissue. In these cases, surgeons must define and prioritize the areas along the edges of the tumor while defining how they might affect the quality of life versus how long the patient stands to live with that portion removed. For example, if a tumor grows along the &quot;motor strip,&quot; a thin band of brain tissue that sits under where the bar of headphones would rest atop your head, the patient stands to be paralyzed in certain areas. This is because as the surgeon removes those parts of the tumor, they may be taking parts of healthy brain tissue with it. This is where my job comes in. Surgeons are able to trace a thin metal rod along the border of the tumor. As they alternate tracing the borders and removing tumor, I repeatedly send a current from my machinery into the probe. I also have needles in various muscles along the patient's body. If let's say, needles in the patient's shoulder show me &quot;electrical twitches&quot; when I pass electricity through the metal rod that the surgeon is holding on an area of the tumor that may be near where your cowlick (callick??) of your hair lies, that tells him something. That tells him that if he removes that part of the tumor, the patient stands to lose the ability to lift said arm. We often stimulate like this continuously throughout the surgery and I talk to the surgeon about how much weaker has become that &quot;electrical twitch&quot; in a specific area (let's say the shoulder). This informs him of how much of the tumor he/she can safely remove.</p>
<p>This is just ONE aspect of many that go into tumor removal. Search for BrainLab and Stryker tumor imaging technology to see some other cool stuff.</p>
<p>Source: I do my described work everyday. I also monitor spinal surgeries, spinal cord tumors, etc.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do damage the brain. It's just that the human brain is remarkably resilient and can often recover from partial damage.</p>
<p>After brain surgery, people typically lose the ability to speak, some lose the ability to walk, and much more. Over time, many people slowly regain abilities and are able to function as normal human beings again, because the brain has a remarkable ability to learn and grow and adapt to missing neurons. However, many people never fully recover from brain surgery in that their brain function is permanently diminished.</p>
