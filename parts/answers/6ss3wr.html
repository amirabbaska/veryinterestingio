		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You ask them. </p>
<p>How do you convince bodybuilders to get recorded? How do you victim's to get recorded? How do you convince anyone to get recorded? </p>
<p>Most documentaries about freed criminal revolve around either their experience in prison or what led them to be in prison (and its usually something negative about the situation). If you ask someone who believes they were wrongly convicted to talk about their wrongful conviction to educate others, then a lot of them will talk about their negative experiences. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey cool I do this for a living. I'm a Producer/Shooter for documentaries and have landed interviews with some dangerous folk.</p>
<p>I'm actually starting production on a docu-series on hate crimes in America and have some interesting interviews coming up.</p>
<p>There are quite a few ways this happens.</p>
<p>Ideally you have an in or connection of some sort that can vouch for you. That's usually huge, but difficult depending on the project.</p>
<p>If not, first you have to find them, usually they don't want to be found. Luckily I work with a wondeful team of researchers who do this part for me most of the time. Once you get their contact, then you basically just ask and explain that you are a journalist/documentary filmmaker who wants to get their side of the story out. One of my colleagues just went on a fishing trip with a subject so they could talk and convince him to be interviewed on camera. It's all about trust and explaining that their story and perspective is worth telling, and that if they don't do it, people will never know it. It's tricky, it doesn't always work. Some people just don't want to talk on camera and will avoid your contact and depending on how badly you need that specific person you usually just fiind someone else who fits the credentials. If you really need that person you work at it for a long time sometimes establishing the trust.</p>
<p>Then you just gotta do it. I'm a pretty friendly guy so once people meet me in person it tends to get pretty easy, I can usually get people talking in a relaxed way that will help them open up a little more comfortably.</p>
<p>Edit: Some really good questions coming in. Will try to answer them all but I'm prepping for a shoot this weekend so I'll have to come back for some</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR Criminals are people. People want to be heard, they don't think they are evil. You just have to gain their trust, make them trust that you won't reveal their identity.</p>
<p>It's not as difficult as people assume.</p>
<p>I always explain to people when they ask about this that even &quot;dangerous&quot; people aren't usually crazy. When thinking about murderers, drug dealers, smugglers, and other general criminals the violence associated is usually targeting a specific group (rival gangs, police, etc)</p>
<p>When I interviewed some gang leaders in Brazil they were actually happy to talk about the issues affecting the favelas and their way of life. They felt like they were the good guys protecting their neighborhood.</p>
<p>In one instance I walked into a neighborhood in Istanbul and had a bunch of masked men hold molotov cocktails up to our faces while threatening us for trying to film. The next day we had a local call a shop associated with the guys and they apologized to us and invited us to have drinks and do the interview.</p>
<p>I know one guy who actually went to get drunk and stoned with some militant extremists for a few days so that they would trust him (potential ethical violations for sure)</p>
<p>But that being said, it is hard sometimes. In my experience black hat hackers are the hardest to get on camera because these people tend to be smarter than your average criminal and won't risk breaking OpSec for a TV spot.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Researcher here.  It's dangerous but basically you have to show them you're honestly not going to turn them in.  There are data collection protocols and legal protections for researchers to study criminals and crime.  Essentially, the government can't force you to hand over information that is deemed confidential through research.  It's called a certificate of confidentiality, but there is still some debate as to how much it can protect you legally.</p>
<p>Good research protocol will obtain only the necessary information and avoid or later destroy unneeded sensitive information.  We don't want to harm those we study and are ethically bound to protect subjects.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How does Louis Theroux do it?  By people trusting him.  Why do they trust him?  Because they've seen him with other people.  He doesn't take in an agenda, he really listens, he probes but does so gently, he introduces topics to allow the interviewee to expand upon.</p>
<p>If you feel you're going to get listened to and not exploited, it's easier to open up than a sensationalist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
