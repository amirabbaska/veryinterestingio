		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well ... it happened before, of course, and within the previous few hundred thousand years no less ... litterally within human memory, during the last ice age. The Lascaux paintings are documentary evidence from that time period.</p>
<p>Just as global warming leads to rising sea levels as the ice caps melt, global cooling is the mechanism linked to sea level decrease and growing icesheets.</p>
<p>When the last glaciation was at its height the area between Alaska and Kamtchatska was above sea level, and formed a landmass known as Beringia. Sea level went down 100 meters relative to the present. The ancestors of American Indians and Inuit crossed that land bridge on foot, as did a lot of wildlife that went either East or West. The shores of southern Spain and France were covered by subarctic tundra-like vegetation, and the icesheet reached all the way down to Central Park and Wisconsin.</p>
<p>And the effects of a climatic regime where such a sea level decrease would occur would be those of going back to a global ice age ... much of currently inhabited Europe, Asia and North America would become uninhabitable, as 2-3 kilometer thick icesheets came thundering towards the equator (geologically speaking). Areas amenable to agriculture would shrink due to a shortened growing season. Inhabitable areas would migrate closer to the equator, and shrink. Economies would collapse, massive socio-economic disruptions, extinctions, possibly our own, would occur ... yadda yadda yadda, as they say... it would be apocalyptic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of focus is on global warming and ice ages but there can be many many factors in sea level changes.  In fact, sea level have dropped in the past few years -<a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/a-scientist-explains-the-mystery-of-recent-sea-level-drop/" target="_blank">once in 2010-2011</a> and again recently over the past year.  That doesn't mean that the rate is dropping over all, just that there are fluctuations.  </p>
<p>You might be interested in <a href="https://www.e-education.psu.edu/earth107/node/907" target="_blank">this website</a> that shows graphs regarding the mean sea level over thousands of years.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of practical effects, falling sea levels leave harbors high and dry.  Wetlands might increase in area, as they follow falling sea levels and colonize more coastal areas.  Though it'd be a race between them and developers.  You'd get less coastal flooding in currently developed areas, but more worries about ships hitting rocks.  Shallow coral reefs would be exposed and die off/shift to atolls.  Below the waterline, the effects on coastal ecosystems would depend on how fast the shift happened, although I'd expect that most ecosystems could keep up with the changing sea levels and shift downward if things were changing on a span of decades to centuries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the timeframe.</p>
<p>Assuming it was &quot;just&quot; sea level changing and not some other dramatic climate shift most coastal cities would gradually expand twoards the new shorelines, or dredge out harbors/channels where appropriate.</p>
<p>Basically the inverse of what cities will do with sea level rise over the next few hundred years with a levee here, some land-fill or sea walls there. Meters of change all at once would be devastating, but a meter over 3 or 4 lifetimes isn't really anything to frett too badly over.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
