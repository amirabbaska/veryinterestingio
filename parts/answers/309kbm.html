		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chris Hadfield's book <em>An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth</em> talks about the medical isolation Astronauts undergo before heading to space.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.space.com/6628-routine-quarantine-helps-astronauts-avoid-illness-launch.html" target="_blank">This article</a> states that 10 days before launch, they're screened for illness and cleared for quarantine if good. Quarantine lasts a week to allow latent symptoms to surface. </p>
<p>So it's still possible to get sick, but NASA and the Russian Space Agency try to minimize this risk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Head colds actually significantly impacted Apollo 7, the first manned Apollo launch.  All three astronauts developed head colds during the course of the 11-day mission.  They became snappish and irritable, and refused a number of orders from the ground.  The blame for this &quot;mutiny in space&quot; is mostly placed on mission commander Wally Schirra.  One of the original Mercury 7, he was NASA's most senior astronaut and the only person to fly in all three manned rocket programs: Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo.  When he began refusing to cooperate, his two crewmates followed his lead.  Experiments outside the scope of testing the new capsule were scrapped, one of those &quot;live from space&quot; TV interviews was refused, and the entire mission took on an air of stubborn negativity.  Everything came to a peak before re-entry: the astronauts were supposed to put their helmets on, in case of depressurization.  But the astronauts, with head colds and fearing burst eardrums, wanted to be able to pinch their noses to equalize their sinus pressure as they landed.  They ended up disobeying a direct order to put their helmets on, and Schirra basically told the flight director to go to hell.</p>
<p>None of the three astronauts flew again: Schirra retired, while the two younger astronauts kept their jobs but were permanently grounded.  Schirra actually used the experience to star in commercials for a cold remedy.</p>
<p>For later missions, I'm unaware if illness has ever significantly affected performance.  However, there have been recorded infections: at least 29 according to <a href="http://science.time.com/2012/10/22/dont-sneeze-in-space-when-astronauts-get-sick/" target="_blank">this article from 2012</a>.  These can potentially be serious, as zero gravity is a terrible place to get sick.  For reasons we don't really understand, the immune system is significantly weakened in zero-g, while pathogens are strengthened.  And the aerosol cloud from a sneeze doesn't drift to the ground like it does on Earth - it just flies outward, to land on and stick to all the instrument panels and such.  Infection control in space is serious business.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For sure - this is a big concern with space travel (especially as the possibility of travel with non-specialists gets closer). Your immune system may operate differently in space, though exactly how is not well-understood. On top of obvious things like radiation, things like zero-gravity may affect your body in complicated ways.</p>
<p>There are a few research efforts starting to look into these kinds of things, e.g. I think <a href="http://www2.lbl.gov/lsd/People_&amp;_Organization/Scientific_Staff_Directory/Pluth_Lab.html" target="_blank">this woman</a> is beginning some work on animal models of the effects of space travel on the immune system. There are other people who are trying to figure out how you can manufacture antibiotics while in space, since carrying lots of supplies can be quite heavy and you obviously don't want to run out of medicine / food / fuel / etc. <a href="http://vcresearch.berkeley.edu/faculty/adam-arkin" target="_blank">This guy</a> is doing some cool research along these lines.</p>
<p>I haven't studied any of this myself, but I'm a graduate student at Berkeley and an editor for the <a href="http://www.berkeleysciencereview.com" target="_blank">Berkeley Science Review</a>, and we've been working on a piece on space travel / space health that'll probably be out in the next month or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't read the other comments to see if it's already been mentioned but we (NASA) are actually doing an experiment over the next year on two twins, one in space orbiting earth, and one on earth in order to see the effects of prolonged exposure to the tundra of space on the human body. We are hoping to get a better idea of what might happen to the brave men and women that travel to Mars in the not so distant future.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
