		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you are a public figure or you are involved in a matter of public concern -- and media outlets are -- then there are some rules that apply to a suit for defamation no matter where in the country you are:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You have to prove a high standard of intent. This standard is misleadingly called &quot;actual malice.&quot; What it means is: you need to prove that the person knew the statement was false, or that the person was reckless with regard to its falsity -- i.e., there was reason to know the statement was false, and the person didn't care whether it was false or not. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to prove that the statement would be taken as a factual statement, not a statement of opinion. You can't defame someone with a pure opinion or an interpretation of true facts. To be actionable, the statement must imply something about a matter that is provable true or false. And the statement has to be such that a reasonable person would listen to the statement and think a specific false assertion was being made. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You need to prove that you, specifically, were defamed. A person cannot sue for defamation of a group. Only individuals can be defamed. So, saying that a particular news organization lied is something that might be actionable, but saying &quot;the media lies&quot; is not actionable unless you can tell that some individual news organization is meant by that statement.</p>
</li>
<li>You need to prove damages in a suit for defamation. That means you need to show how the statement hurt you, and how that harm is reducible to money. For a news organization that usually means showing lost profits. As you can imagine, it would be very hard to prove that one of Trump's statements was the direct cause of any lost profits for a news organization today.</li>
</ol>
<p>Others have mentioned the difficulty in suing the President, but that isn't likely the reason. The president can be sued personally. The difficulty is mainly in the discovery process, which is likely to be held up by the President's schedule. But a defamation suit does not necessarily require much discovery from the defendant. It is the public statement that forms the crux of the suit.</p>
<p>More likely, there simply is no point to suing. You would have a hard time establishing liability and a harder time establishing damages. You would waste a lot of money and time for nothing. A news organization that did that would also hurt its own reputation with the public.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not slander when there is truth to the statement. There have been times when CNN, MSNBC, and FOX  have jumped the gun and gotten things wrong. Those examples could be used in court and the case would go out the window. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is really hard to sue the president for anything. The sense behind this law is so his political enemies can't just tie him down with lawsuits. For serious things the president can be impeached but that is a major political event. The system assumed presidents would be sensible adults. This may have been misguided. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be fair,  a lot of news outlet are 'fake' already,  maybe not in the sense they're purposely misleading (although some of them are) but more so in the sense they are biased in the news they report and often omit or glance over news that doesn't fit in with thier image or political views. </p>
<p>It really takes an intelligent person these days to uncover their own truths. </p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>A few sources from a few varieties, as I'm sure I'll get some down voters. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not worth either parties time to go thru a lawsuit. As mentioned it's difficult to sue the president for anything. Yes technically Trump is probably slandering them but I think then u can also say they are slandering Trump in return with repeated negative remarks and cherry picking of facts and alot of other things the biased media does. I think in a sick twisted way Trump and the media are happy with the constant childlike bickering between them. The media don't care about being slandered. They care about viewer ratings and $$$</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
