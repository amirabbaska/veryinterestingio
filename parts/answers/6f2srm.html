		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this question may be better understood addressing all four modes of language: reading, writing, speaking, and listening.</p>
<p>While reading and listening to a language involve the intake of information, speaking and writing involve the output of information.</p>
<p>These &quot;output&quot; modes are exceptionally more complicated than &quot;intake&quot; modes, because proper language output demands that grammar be at least moderately adhered to. In other words, you have to understand the structure of a language to actually form sentences.</p>
<p>Reflecting an everyday example of the question, pick up a book by one of your favorite authors, especially someone with a distinct style of writing. Can you write (output) like that person? You might not even fully comprehend all of the words that they use, and almost certainly couldn't replicate their writing style. However, it is likely that while reading (intake) them, you understand the text just fine.</p>
<p>Now to translate that theme into the question, replace the forms of relative intake and output. Someone familiar with the speech patterns, core vocabulary, and contextual clues of a foreign language can understand what is being said, but will likely be unable to reconstruct the language themselves, which is the essence of actually speaking it.</p>
<p>Also remember that intaking (reading, listening) a language utilizes context, where outputting (writing, speaking) does not benefit from this.</p>
<p>As a final point- and I could make more, but this should suffice - note that most foreign languages have pretty radically different accents associated with their words (and if you don't think so, try to imitate full sentences). Intonations, letter pronunciations, and speech patterns all fluctuate so much from one language to another that it's likely the case that an individual has grown accustomed to hearing and understanding foreign speech without ever speaking the language enough to even correctly mimic the words. This is especially true of children who grew up with the language in the household but who haven't learned to communicate in it.</p>
<p>I hope this clarifies a few things.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ah haha! Another question I can answer. </p>
<p>Think of it as the difference between taking a multiple choice vs. free answer test. What makes it harder to speak is because all the cues we take from the media or person expressing information are missing whenever we try to express our own opinions. When we take a multiple choice test, we have the cues of the question and answers to help us find an answer. With free choice, we lose a lot of what we can use to guess the correct answer.</p>
<p>When I'm at the fish market, and the fishmonger says the word <em>yu2</em> (rising tone), from the context around me at the fish market, his profession, his products, and my mission (buy fish) all help me guess that he must mean é±¼ or fish. </p>
<p>If I meet someone on the side of the road and they say <em>yu2</em> is delicious, well, I don't have as easy a time figuring it out because there's less to go on to surmise the answer from what I know about them and the environment where we're speaking. </p>
<p>When you're speaking, what makes it hard is that you have to do note than just passively receive the information, you have to form it yourself. It's like watching a baker bake a cake, and then you try next. You get the concepts and everything behind it not performing it  becomes so much more difficult because not only do you have to do what you've been taught, questions you didn't have before spring up, causing you to slow down or never unable to express yourself. In addition, most people don't have the right skills to get them out of a language jam, like describing the item I'm an accurate way. So, compared to a road block in your native language where the entire map is revealed after exploring the area for a while and getting all your fast points, you're starting at level 1 with maybe a few slivers of the map revealed not knowing how they all intersect and join together. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neurologically speaking, there are two distinct areas of the brain for language.  Broca's area is used to produce language, and Wernicke's area, which is used to understand language.  fMRI studies have shown that Wernicke's area is similarly active during native and foreign processing, but Broca's area is activated a bit differently in native and foreign speech production.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are lots of nuances in speaking languages.  Many languages have sounds that you don't here in other languages (that phlemmy sound in French comes to mind).  Your brain can recognize these sounds and knows the meaning, but reproducing them takes practice. Your attempts might be unintelligible to someone else</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
