		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple things that go into being a superstar in any field. The superstar is someone who can combine all these things. Their trainers will often have specific skills in one particular area but not the whole package. Moreover they will have skills that make them a good trainer that is not necessary for being a superstar. </p>
<p>I'll give you an example from MMA. Even though they have a primary skill A MMA fighter needs to have training in a wide variety of disciplines to compete. Moreover, the MMA fighter doesn't need to be the best in the world at any one particular thing. They may have a boxing trainer, a judo trainer, a jiu jitsu trainer in addition to a strength and consitioning trainer. Each of these people may have never been in a MMA fight but they understand that component very well. </p>
<p>A trainer may also be someone who understood one part of a game very well but didn't have other gifts that allowed them to compete. Maybe they got injured or didn't have the requisite size or athleticism. Example: Kevin Long is the Mets hitting coach even though never played in the major leagues. He was by all accounts a good hitter in the minor leagues but he injured his wrist and decided to retire. Of people good at hitting he seems to be really good at coaching other players. People who work with him seem to all praise his coaching ability. Often people who were superstars make horrible managers because they had all the natural talents and don't know how to connect with any player or competitor who didn't. </p>
<p>I'll give you one last example from my life. I taught myself computer programming and computer science and I'm a software engineer for a living. I studied math in college (for reasons) and I was decent at it but decided not to go to grad school for math. I would never ever be a superstar in either field. It I'm waaaay better at computer programming than I am at math. I'm a bunch better teacher at math than computer science. I couldn't even tell you how I learned how to code, i just got a book and did it at 9 years old. I can absolutely guide you through learning calculus, set theory, linear algebra and a few other fields of math. If you need someone to teach Calculus I'm not a bad choice because it didn't come naturally to me at 9 the way programming did. On the other hand I know plenty of peofessors who studied way more math than I did who can't teach for shit. They are brilliant, they know the material but they don't know what to do when someone doesn't get something as simple as Calculus without trying. </p>
<p>The only superstar I would reliably say should teach Calculus (though I imagine there are others) is a superstar in physics, Richard Feynman. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being good a coaching usually does not correlate with being the best at the sport. It is usually harder for someone naturally gifted at the sport to teach someone that sport. Allot of really talented players don't like to be told what to do but most of them don't reach the top due to this.</p>
<p>Allot of times when your naturally skilled at something you don't need to use proper technique since your raw skill is so much better then your average persons skill. When you are the average person you are forced to learn the techniques at a much higher level to compensate for your lack of ability compared to more skilled competitors. This lets you have a much more advanced understanding of the technique. The talented person who relied on raw skill to win at lower levels of competition may start to struggle as the competition reaches higher levels as the competitors now all either have better techniques or also have more raw talent.
This is where a good coach can really help make a star with allot of raw talent into one of the best in the world by helping him improve with his more advanced understanding and knowledge. </p>
<p>Lets take for example Mike Tyson in boxing. Some good qualities to have in boxing include Punching power Stamina Speed Resilience. The trainers job is not to be better then Mike at those thing but to teach him how to use those qualities better and get even better at the things he excels like teaching him better footwork to allow him to use his power and speed more often.
The trainer will also analyze and try to correct holes in his game. For example maybe Tyson always circles to the right after throwing a jab which leaves him open to counters. The coach correct that making him get hit less often.
The trainer can also show him subtle things like foot position or slight deviation in hand movement that will make him punch even harder and faster.
Another aspect the trainer can help the athlete with is to keep him focused on his training diet lifestyle etc.</p>
<p>Once the athlete realizes how many times the trainer is right and the benefits the trainer has to his game and how much better he is performing after following their advice they will put their trust into them and start obeying listening to them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the ability to coach is different than the ability to perform at a high athletic level.  </p>
<p>Being a top athlete, first and foremost, requires you to win the genetic lottery and have natural athletic talent.  There are plenty of people who were just as good as top stars and worked just as hard, but they were a few inches too short, a few steps too slow, or got hurt at the wrong time.  They fact they didn't make it as big doesn't mean they know less.</p>
<p>In fact, superstars have a pretty poor track record as coaches.  When you solved most of your problems by being bigger and stronger and faster than everyone else, you don't have much to offer the average player.  It is the player who had to make the most of their lesser talents who understand the game well enough to be coaches.  If you look at the NFL, there aren't many great QBs in the coaching ranks...there are a whole lot of backups, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just because they didn't have the ability doesn't mean they didn't have the mind for it. It's the same reason many MLB managers were backup catchers and NFL head coaches were backup QBs. They learned the sport but never had the skill set to match their mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Being good at something doesn't mean you understand why you are good at it or what you can do to get better at it. That's what coaches and trainers are for. They don't personally need to be able to perform at a high level to have knowledge of what is required to do so.</p>
<p>To give a sports example, let's say you can suddenly throw a baseball 90 mph. That's great but how do you do it in a way that you can control where the ball goes? How do you throw even faster? You need coaches and trainers to tell you and they can obtain that knowledge independent of actually throwing a ball themselves.</p>
<p>Now certainly some athletes are more self-aware than others of what they are doing or knowledgeable about biomechanics and physiology but even then there are going to be specialists (coaches and trainers) who know more or can provide a different perspective (since there is more than one way to be successful at an athletic activity).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
