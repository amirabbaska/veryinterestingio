		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In case you couldn't tell, this is a complex topic.</p>
<p>What you describe as hearing the root of the chord as interchangeable with the full chord isn't always the case. Western Music (the European tradition) is built on a system of harmonic function. The goal is to get from your tonic (the primary note) to dominant (the fifth note of the key, which functions as the yin to tonics yang) back to tonic again, like taking a journey. Tonic is home, dominant is the store. You start at home, go to the store, and come back. Each chord with in a key has a function, or job, in getting you through that journey.</p>
<p>Through the common practice period (Bach, Mozart, Beethoven), we have created a series of expectations that are learned through hearing them a lot. Certain chords create tension that have expected resolutions. As the various musical lines move through these tensions and releases, certain notes become more important than others. This process tends to highlight roots of chords.</p>
<p>In non functional harmony, it's much harder to hear the roots of chords as the chords often become more complex and the normal tension/release relationships of functional harmony get left behind.</p>
<p>As was also mentioned, every note you hear contains many notes within it. These notes follow a very specific pattern known as the over tone spectrum. As you go further into the over tone spectrum, the ratio between the frequencies of the over tone and the fundamental become increasingly harder to calculate. For instance, the first overtone is the octave above the fundamental. These have 2:1 ratio, creating a very pure sound where the wave peaks line up often. Your 2nd overtone is a fifth above that and has a ratio of 3:1 to your fundamental and 3:2 to the 1st overtone. Still pretty clean. The next over tone is another octave, so 4:1. The next one is a third above that, which is a 5:1  ratio (giving your major chord a ratio of 6:5:4 in it's closest interation). Eventually these start getting silly, like 27:23 once you account for octave displacements, which signifies that the notes spend more time out of sync than in sync. Most of your prominent functional chords stay to the first 6 overtones, which represent the first four distinct pitches to show up in the over tone spectrum. So there is a physics explanation, but it gets clouded by chord extensions and chord voicing pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Edit: a commenter reminded me exactly how to find the ratios, so I edited the information to reflect that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is kind of a chicken or egg problem. </p>
<p>Do our brains perceive harmony to correspond to roots because of some physical interaction in those frequencies? Or is it because our system evolved that way and we're just trained to think that way? Or did the system evolve to be that way because of something physical? </p>
<p>You see the dilemma.</p>
<p>Realistically it's probably a bit of both, but the evidence that other systems of pitches don't have the same concept of harmony, and our system has changed significantly in the last 3-400 years, and that you can change the actual frequencies pitches correspond to and get the same effect, leads many to think this phenomenon is cultural or otherwise learned from how we've made music for the last few centuries. </p>
<p>There are also some really interesting theories that have to do with information entropy in how we select interval relationships and gravitate towards particular harmonies, but that's kind of an out there theory that isn't very widely accepted. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of wrong answers here and couple that are right but don't go into a lot of detail. So I'll weigh in with what I know (which is a lot. I'm an engineer who studies fundamental and functional harmony in my free time) and hope I don't get completely buried by popular answers.</p>
<p>The reason why this happens is because of the constructive interference between the sound waves of the notes being played. This means that there are various points in time where the root waves of all three notes being played (assuming a major triad) are at the exact same point of their motion at the same time.</p>
<p>Let's assume a textbook structure of an A major chord based on the harmonic overtone series. This consists of:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A (440 Hz)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E (1320 Hz)</p>
</li>
<li>C# (2200 Hz)</li>
</ul>
<p>This means that the sound waves of each of these three notes take a specific time to complete a full wave. The amount of time being:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A (1/440 = 2.2727 miliseconds)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>E (1/1320 = 0.757575 miliseconds)</p>
</li>
<li>C# (1/2200 = 0.454545 miliseconds)</li>
</ul>
<p>So every single time the base wave of your A note completes a full wave, the base wave of your E note will have completed exactly three waves and the base wave of your C# note will have completed exactly five waves (3x0.757575 = 2.2727 and 5x0.454545 is also 2.2727).</p>
<p>This interference causes the wave of your A note to be strengthened on every single repetition, where the wave of your E note is only strengthened every third repetition and the wave of your C# note is only strengthened every fifth repetition. This is what causes your A wave to stand out to the ear as the &quot;root note&quot; even when it's not the highest, lowest or loudest note.</p>
<p>When different octaves of the same notes are used this interaction still happens but they happen between the overtone waves of your three sound waves, rather than between the base waves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think a simple way to explain what you might be experiencing is one of several factors: Either you're hearing the root (the lowest note) or the highest note, because these are easiest to pick out with your ear and this becomes especially noticable in the context of progressions where your ear wants to follow that note on it's way (usually down). Another explanation could be the particular voicing of a chord, where the tonic note (Such as the C of a C chord) is repeated more than once as an octave and as such has more presence in the sound. Lastly, there's the more complex idea of the harmonic series. Where in a note contains sympathetic frequencies on top of the fundamental. So for example if you were to play a C note on a piano, while you mostly hear the note &quot;C&quot; as the fundamental harmonic frequency, that C note also contains all the notes for the full C major triad. You can experiment with this more on any instrument with vibrating strings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What we think of as one &quot;note&quot; is in fact lots of notes. When you pluck a string you're not just getting one single note or frequency, but a mix. One of these is the largest and biggest, the one which the string can vibrate with easiest - this is the fundamental frequency, and makes the loudest sound.</p>
<p>However, on the same string there are other vibrations, and these come in a mathematical pattern called harmonics. They are smaller and quieter, so we don't hear much of them, and they add to the instruments &quot;timbre&quot;, that is the general quality and texture of the sound. </p>
<p>The reason chords &quot;work&quot; is because the additional notes you play are causing all the smaller vibrations to overlap in exactly the right pattern to match the harmonics. </p>
<p>For example, the fundamental frequency of middle C is at 244Hz. The first harmonic of this is E, at 320Hz. If we played the E note in addition to the C note, these two frequencies overlap and create a much richer, harmonious sound than the two notes indivudually. </p>
<p>To answer your question: in this example, we're considering the harmonics of the C-string, so it is in relation to the fundamental frequency of 244Hz. Everything we add that correctly overlaps with the harmonic frequencies has it roots at that number, so the overall sound is like that of the C note, just far richer. If we did the harmonics starting at E as our fundamental, it would be a different pattern, and our ear would instead pick out the fundamental frequency of E being richer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
