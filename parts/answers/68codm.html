		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few differences between nucleons and Δ^(+)/Δ^(0) baryons.</p>
<p>Their spins are different (1/2 versus 3/2). As a result, their masses are <em>very</em> different, because the strong force is spin-dependent. Another difference is their isospin.</p>
<p>The nucleons form an isospin-doublet (T = 1/2) while the deltas form an isospin quartet (T = 3/2).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer your question directly, nucleons and delta baryons have different spins (1/2 and 3/2 respectively).</p>
<p>To answer more generally, the particle you get at the end when combining quarks depends on more than just the quark content. It also depends on spin, as above, and also something weird known as &quot;isospin&quot;. Some nucleons and delta baryons have the same quark content, but they have different spin. As another example, the neutral pi meson and the eta mesons have both the same quark content and the same spin, but different isospin (1 and 0 respectively).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
