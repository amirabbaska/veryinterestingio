		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Way too late to the party but I literally did my human nutrition MSc dissertation on how cooking methods alter nutrient content so figured I'd contribute anyway, especially since that info hasn't been of much use anywhere else up to now! Microwaves don't radiate your food, as many believe, they simply excite water molecules which then transfer that energy (in the form of heat) to the rest of your food. This is therefore a fairly innocuous cooking method, and other than warming it up / denaturing proteins it isn't going to do an awful lot to your food. It's also pretty good for preserving micronutrient content for this reason.</p>
<p>EDIT: Some people had further questions, so I've uploaded my literature review <a href="http://docdro.id/5RPiQ9c" target="_blank">here</a> if anyone else is interested.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, microwave ovens distort chemical structures in foods.  The heat from the microwave energy causes proteins to uncoil and change their shape, causing their texture and flavor to change.  This phenomenon is known as &quot;cooking&quot;, and is the same whether you microwave, boil, bake, or fry food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No. The only thing a microwave does is vibrate atoms/molecules with certain vibrational frequencies, which heat's them up. It's the same kind of waves your wifi, cellphone, radio etc. use, it's just a different wavelength and strength.</p>
<p>I know it isn't customary to post youtube links in this sub, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp33ZprO0Ck" target="_blank">this guy</a> explains the whole concept quite well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nah, you gotta go higher up on the EM scale before there is enough energy to do anything but make common materials warm up. The only difference between cooking with microwaves or IR light is how far it penetrates different material. Microwave frequency is chosen due to a useful mix between penetration and absorbtion which causes heat. If you go higher, it penetrates materials better but less is absorbed so less heat is generated. Go lower and more energy is absorbed but it penetrates much less so the surface layers get really hot but deeper down it remains cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All microwaving does is cause the water molecules in your food to vibrate. This vibration is heat. It won't create any toxis or unhealthy things that aren't already present.
Because of this, putting in a ceramic plate won't heat it up much, but straight water will get very hot very quickly</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
