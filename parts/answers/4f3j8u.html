		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say you have an extinct volcano with a big caldera at the top (a large pit). At the bottom of the pit is a boulder. It will take so much energy to get that boulder up to the edge of the caldera, but once you get it over, the boulder will roll down the entire volcano releasing many times the amount of energy.</p>
<p>This is the same concept for explosives.</p>
<p>Instead of gravity and hills, we are working with bond strength. The bonds in C4 are pretty strong, so random energy from just sitting around is unlikely to break them and even a surprising amount of physical shock. However, if you can put enough focused energy into some of the substance, the atoms become free to bond in a different configuration and when they do, they release more energy than it takes to break them up. Much of this energy goes into breaking up other bonds in the immediate area, those atoms recombine into other molecules, release a bunch of energy, and continue the reaction.</p>
<p>The easiest way to trigger the initial breaking of bonds is to use a primary explosive (e.g. a blasting cap) but an electrical current can also do the trick.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since simple explanations have been given, I'll give a detailed explanation broken up into parts for the sake of the reader. Despite, this, however, it will remain extremely oversimplified, because chemistry is hard:</p>
<p>C4 is an explosive. Explosives work by converting chemical energy (the energy stored in molecular bonds) into thermal and mechanical energy. This is how they do what they do. We will try to understand how they do so in this post.</p>
<p>But, first of all, you have to understand how bonds and work and how energy works in relation to bonds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1) <a href="http://www.adweek.com/files/blogs/overly_attached_computer.jpg" target="_blank">Bonds - The Universe's Overly Attached Girlfriend</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you make a molecule by mixing a bunch of atoms together, they don't just cuddle up next to each other and follow each other like kids in a line at school, they kind of get &quot;glued&quot; together. This glue-like thing is called a bond. There are multiple types of bonds, and you probably became <em>very</em> familiar with a particular type of bond in high school chemistry - the covalent bond, which is the most common bond you find in nature, generally speaking.</p>
<p>Covalent bonds effectively work by making atoms share an electron - so atom A and atom B bond when atom A and atom B share one of their electrons between one another instead of each of them having their own completely separate set of electrons. <strong><em>For the sake of simplicity</em></strong> our explanation here will assume that all bonds in question are covalent, because it's a useful and easy to understand basis, and you can generalize to other bond types from this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>2) Bond Energies - Because If You Hold On Tightly Enough, He Can Never Leave You</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, to keep molecules together, the bond has to do a lot of work. Think of it this way - in any sample size of stuff you choose to look at, any two atoms next to each other are most probably going to be headed in different trajectories. This means that if you want to keep two things you have bonded together...well, together, you have to use some energy to keep them snuggled up tight by pulling them back together. This is called a binding (or bond) energy, which is the energy contained in a bond.</p>
<p>Remember that, for our simplistic purposes, we've defined the bond as the sharing of an electron. In our example this means that each atom will be tugging at that shared electron with a certain amount of strength, doing a certain amount of work, and we can consider this shared work the bond energy. Bond energies are essentially what create the strength of bonds. The strength of these bonds differ from compound to compound and the stronger the bond, the more binding energy is contained. To break the bond and return the molecule back to its constituent atoms (or smaller molecules), you need to break these bonds, and in doing so you release the energy contained in these bonds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>3) Making and Breaking Bonds - Shotgun Weddings and Shotgun Divorces</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, you can't just break a bond for free. Nor can you form them for free. Again, using our electron example, this makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Atoms are surrounded by electron clouds on their outside, and because electrons will repel one another (as they are both negatively charged and like repels like in electromagnetism), this means you have to do some amount of work to overcome this repulsion and force the electrons close together enough that the positive attraction between the positively charged nuclei and the electron you want to share (because opposite charges attract in e&amp;m) is stronger than that of the repulsion by other electrons, allowing the electron to be safely shared.</p>
<p>Likewise, once you already have a bond, you have the nuclei holding on to this electron with a certain strength, and you have to impart the atoms with enough energy that you can overcome this attractive force and force one nuclei sufficiently far away from the electron such that the energies repulsing the previously shared electron from the split off atom's electron cloud are greater than the attractive forces between the nucleus and the electron, meaning that the split off atom can't just suddenly re-establish the bond.</p>
<p>So, you have to do some work to either break the bond apart or to create a bond. In a very simplified sense, we can consider the energies required to do this the activation energies, which is just the energy required to get a chemical reaction (which essentially just means the making or breaking of bonds between two things) to happen. Again, these activation energies differ from substance to substance, and breaking and creating bonds for any given substance generally cost different amounts of activation energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>4) Explosives - Stability and You...All Over Those Walls</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, what makes explosives special? Well, explosives have comparatively low activation energies, but comparatively high bond strengths (and thus bond energies). This is precisely what makes them unstable. In stable substances you have the exact opposite scenario - comparatively high activation energies, but comparatively low bond energies.</p>
<p>This means that for a stable substance, like a bar of steel, you put have to put in a <em>lot</em> more energy to break up bonds and change things than you get out of breaking the bonds, so you have to continue to invest energy into the process to keep it going.</p>
<p>Unstable substances on the other hand, get a <em>lot</em> more energy from breaking the bonds between them than you use to break them. This means that this energy can go somewhere else other than just breaking the bond, and this excess energy is released as thermal (heat) and mechanical (sound waves, shockwaves, etc.) energy. This released energy can then go on to continue feeding the reaction and releasing even more energy to keep the reaction going without you constantly needing to pump energy into the reaction just to keep it going. In a simplified sense, think of it like this: you create heat by breaking a bond, some of that heat goes back to heat up another bond and causing it to break too, and so on, and so on.</p>
<p>However, breaking individual bonds yields virtually no usable energy (on the scale of ~eV, which, in layman's terms, is like trying to remedy your starvation by eating an atom of food). So to get anything really usable out of it, you need to have this reaction happen to a <em>lot</em> of molecules in a very short amount of time. And one way to do this is to essentially trigger a chain reaction. So, if each bond breaking creates enough energy that you double the amount of bonds broken in each successive step, you get a scenario where you have 1 =&gt; 2 =&gt; 4 =&gt; 8 =&gt; 16, and so on bonds being broken with each and every reaction after the first. This is what makes explosives go boom - because each bond allows you to break more and more bonds, and this ends up releasing lots of heat and mechanical energy that destroys things.</p>
<p>Also note the rather obvious point that you generally you don't start off by just setting off one or two events. You start by setting off events on the order of Avrogado's Number, give or take a few orders of magnitude. So you have something on the order of ~100 sextillion, give or take a few orders of magnitude, particles starting off your reaction. With the relationship mentioned above (or, in some cases, even more, because...chemistry).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>5) So What the Bleep's With C4?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In short, chemical composition is why C4 is so stable compared to TNT. Different chemical substances will react differently to different stimuli, and some methods of transferring energy are more effective in certain chemical compositions than others. For example, it is a hell of a lot easier to transmit energy using steel than, say, using rubber. In a similar fashion, some substances behave differently under different temperatures, pressures, etc. than other substances.</p>
<p>Also, different chemical substances release their energies differently because of how they chemically interact. Explosive A and Explosive B might release the same <em>net</em> amount of energy, but Explosive A might release a significantly higher <em>proportion</em> of that energy as <em>heat</em> energy, which would make it particularly good at melting things (e.g. thermite, which technically isn't an explosive, but that's besides the point here), while Explosive B might release a higher <em>proportion</em> of that net energy as <em>mechanical</em> energy, making it better at blasting things away (e.g. dynamite). This is why some explosives are better suited at some tasks than others, hence why we don't use C4 for blasting mines, and why we don't use mine-blasting explosives for blasting buildings.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ADDENDUM - Avoid Writing While Sleep Deprived</p>
</blockquote>
<p>ADDENDUM: I wrote this while rather sleep deprived, so, unsurprisingly, I left something out. Simply stating that breaking bonds releases energy is an oversimplification of what is going on. What is actually going on is that you invest energy into breaking the bonds, and the broken up pieces then form new bonds that release energy. Why is this true?</p>
<p>Well, recall that we said that making bonds have an activation energy. This is because to get things to bond you need to get them excited enough and move them around so that they overcome the repulsion between their electrons. This means that you have atoms in an excited, higher energy state than you would normally. However, once you have a bond, you have a stable configuration, which means that the atoms can go back down to lower energy states without breaking the bond - and they do exactly that. This is why <em>making</em> bonds can <em>release</em> energy. However, as stated before previously, sometimes you need to invest more energy into breaking bonds than you have to into making the bonds, and these are reactions that you constantly need to pump into energy too.</p>
<p>In the context of what I said, it means that the energy created when forming new bonds between the now split molecules releases more energy than you took to break the initial chemical bond.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay <a href="https://youtu.be/-zX-gz1lRt0?t=34s" target="_blank">imagine a room full of mouse traps</a>. (bear with me). And you know if you can just set one mouse trap off, that it's going to snap up in the air, land, set off another one, and that will set off 2 more, and those 2 will set off 4 more etc etc until the entire room is full of exploding wood and mousetrap parts as they fly around in a chain reaction. </p>
<p>Now imagine that first mouse trap is INCREDIBLY STABLE. It won't go off if you step on it. It won't go off if you hit it with a hammer. It's like the worlds most insensitive mousetrap. You literally can't set it off even if you set it on fire and destroy it. </p>
<p>That is what C4 and many modern high explosives are. They have incredible amounts of stored energy, but the activation energy needed to set one off is huge. </p>
<p>So to set off this chain reaction now imagine you have a slightly weaker mousetrap but when it goes off it's very likely to set off one of the more stable mouse traps. This is your detonator cap. And the pencil you throw at the trap and run is the detonation cord. </p>
<p>Now in reality C4 is useful not because of how much energy it can store, but because of how quickly it can release it. Something like Amfo may contain more energy by weight, but it tends to be 'slower' which can actually be a good thing when you really need to push hard on something like detatching rock from a mine face in mining operations. The Amfo is slower so more of it's energy has time to push against the rock around the explosion. </p>
<p>C4 is very fast, and it might release it's energy so quickly that the rock doesn't have as much time to shatter and get caught up in the blast. Like hitting a car with a hammer will dent it, but pushing a car with your hand won't dent it but it can move it.  </p>
<p>In any case, the chemicals in C4 have high potential energy meaning that you have a fuel and an oxidizer. The two of them rapidly combine to form new chemicals which have less stored energy and may take up more room (like converting a solid into a gas). So you have a high energy substance converted into a low energy substance so the excess energy has to go somewhere, and that somewhere is expanding gas, heat, and explosive energy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>C4 was meant to throw in a bag, walk around, in war, possibly being shot, or lit on fire, or bouncing around in a truck etc. Its EXTREMELY stable right up until its not. It wouldnt be much use to a soldier if it blew up when you shot it, would it? What if their bag got shot? You can walk around, run around, climb walls, fall over, get shot at, etc with C4 in your pocket. Can confirm, have done it. You can also walk around with a primed shot (C4 with blasting cap and everything) in your pocket. Again, have done it. This shit is crazy stable until you do what needs to be done. No, shooting it doesnt work. No, a flamethrower doesnt work. I've heard of the guy stomping burning C4 in Nam and I'm crazy skeptical. Trucks burn down with this shit in it and nothing happens. I definitely haven't placed a charge in a building that was set to be burned down on a time delay with a cap and watched the building burn with the shot in it and then going off literally exactly when it was supposed to, not being effected by the fire at all. </p>
<p>5 years as EOD and just trying to quell some of the ridiculous questions going on here. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
