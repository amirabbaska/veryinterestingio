		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolutely, this is how most electric motors work. They have a coil of wire around the magnet, and adding a current makes the magnet attract or repel other magnets on a part that spins freely.  (unless i misunderstood your question!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You cannot create continuous motion using permanent magnets. They do not <em>generate</em> any energy, merely store it, like springs. You can make something vibrate for a while, until that energy gets dissipated and it comes to equilibrium, exactly like the spring pendulum in a watch winding down.</p>
<p>You can generate motion with electromagnets, but that's because you have an outside source of energy (chemical reactions in a battery, mechanical motion of a generator, light from the sun, etc.) which is powering your motor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For example....an electric motor?</p>
<p>In your device you probably need to find a way to create an Alternating Current of 1-10 cycle/second (AKA Hz.)  Common household current is 60  Hz. This is probably too fast to make your device operate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
