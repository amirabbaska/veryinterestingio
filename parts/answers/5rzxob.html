		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the best things Dodd Frank happened was the creation of the CFPB. They are an agency with the monumental task of keeping mortgage companies from making predatory loans.</p>
<p>Remember no income qualifying, interest only loans? Yeah, you could qualify someone for that, bury the details in paperwork, sell it to someone who doesn't fully understand what they just signed, and in three years when their interest rate adjusts they can't afford it. They go late on payments &amp; get foreclosed.</p>
<p>That's not even the worst type of shit. Imagine a loan that can actually get bigger over time rather than smaller. They're basically foreclosure machines. Those existed, they're finally almost gone, but they're probably coming back. </p>
<p>Who protects consumers from stuff like that? The CFPB, created by Dodd Frank. They make sure mortgage companies follow the new laws meant to prevent loans like that which caused the foreclosures that caused the financial crash.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a fun one.</p>
<p>In the 1990s to 2000s, we had the rise of a type of financial instrument called a derivative. Clinton's administration, then Bush's administration, flat out refused to regulate them because banks were making money on them. If you haven't noticed, the department of the Treasury and sometimes the SEC are revolving doors for bank executives. Many of these derivatives had complicated names and lengthy legal contracts, but on the surface they were just banks gambling with your money, <em>e.g.</em> if the price of this commodity I don't own goes down to this value, you give me this much money, but if it goes up to this value, I owe you money.</p>
<p>These derivatives were mostly unregulated and opaque to the consumer or regulatory agencies, but they played a large role in the financial crisis through swaps. Swaps are generally a way of gambling to reduce risk by trying to offset the risk to others. The party who is doing something risky offers a monthly contract to another party who, if the risky thing they're doing falls apart, agrees to pay for the original party's losses. The other party gets paid to assume this risk, but sometimes the other party doesn't even have the money to pay the original party back for the failure of the bank's risky gamble (2008).</p>
<p>Dodd-Frank sought to regulate these to make sure that the issuance of these derivatives was clear to the government and public, and that people weren't gambling more money than they possibly could have in them (margin requirements). They also added a lot of new rules to help prevent banks from gambling with your money. Unfortunately for the banks, this all ends up being very expensive.</p>
<p>Trump wants to tear out all the requirements of Dodd-Frank that make banking expensive. Banks like it because it gives them greater profit margins. People like it because they make more money in their investments. The risk is that the banks will start gambling too much and lose more money.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One aspect that stemmed from Dodd-frank was the department of labor's ruling that investment advisors have to act in their clients best interest. More often than not, advisors do act in their clients' best interest, but there are several that do not.
One example is qualified annuities. Annuities are a very expensive investment that serve a very specific purpose. They are a tax deferred investment, similar to an IRA. Advisors were selling annuities inside IRAs, which often doesn't make sense because it does not add any tax benefit. It isn't always the right or wrong thing to do, but it is one of the most expensive investments that pays the advisor the most money. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We should add that heavy financial deregulation is <em>yet another</em> area where the US is doing something that no other advanced country in the world wants to do (See also: Healthcare, criminal/drug policy, strict two party governance, ...).</p>
<p>So either all the other countries in the world haven't realized how great US policy actually is, or the rest of the world is looking at the US and thinking &quot;Why the %<em>#</em> are they doing this to themselves? Again!&quot;.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on which it is?  (Serious question)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Once we had rules banks had to follow. Those were repealed, and in not following the rules the banks causes the 2008 recession.</p>
<p>New rules were put into place to prevent the same kind of stuff from happening again.</p>
<p>Now, they want to take those rules away. It's likely going to cause another recession, but these people don't care, because they will make a lot of money in the process.</p>
<p>By the way, the recession led to record profits because once you sabotage everyone's pay, you don't need to increase it again until you start running out of people who need jobs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
