<p>'Antiseptic' refers to any substance which is administered topically on <em>living</em> tissue to do same. Its mechanism of action is generally limited to the area upon which you apply it. Think hand sanitizer or iodine.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Definitions vary according to context.  The definitions that I use are:</p>
<p>An 'antibiotic' is a naturally-produced compound that specifically kills microorganisms, usually bacteria.  Examples would be penicillin, tetracycline, etc.</p>
<p>An 'antibacterial' is a synthetic compound that specifically kills bacteria (an 'antimicrobial' would kill microorganisms).  Examples would be ciprofloxacin, sulfamethoxazole, etc.</p>
<p>An 'antiseptic' is a compound that kills all living cells.  Examples would be bleach (hypochlorous acid), ammonia, alcohol, etc.</p>
<p>That is, the specificity is important.  Antiseptics kill more than just bacteria, so they often are as useful as a medical treatment.  That is, you can take penicillin for an ear infection and it won't hurt your cells... but you can't drink a bottle of bleach for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Other people use different definitions.  I've heard people claim that an antibiotic is specifically a medicine.  So, for example, triclosan (the most common 'antibacterial' in antibacterial soap) is not an antibiotic because it is not used as a medicine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
