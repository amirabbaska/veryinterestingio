		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kind of vaguely responding to several points here. I'm in neuroscience, so this is slightly cross-field for me, but it's close enough that I deal with it (and the things that affect it) regularly.</p>
<p>While IQ tests are not effective around the center of the bell-curve, that is not the point of this question. An IQ of 70 most definitely means something relevant, and not just that someone is bad at taking the test.</p>
<p>IQ tests (the major ones that are still used--Weschler, Stanford-Binet, CAS, etc.) have a LOT of time, effort, and in some cases grant money dedicated to ensuring that different thought processes don't immediately and irreparably screw a person who takes the test. They tend to provide the correct answer in some way--be it by multiple choice or strong implication in the question--and the test is less focused on accuracy and more focused on speed. Essentially, they are ideally designed so that everyone can get many questions right, but at different rates.</p>
<p>This notably does mean they are incredibly poor at providing accurate scores for sufferers of ADHD, but there are a couple of IQ tests explicitly intended in conjunction with ADHD.</p>
<p>An IQ of 70 is two full standard deviations below the median. This is not &quot;bad at the test,&quot; this is &quot;moderately impaired cognition.&quot; Someone above mentions that IQ does not correlate strongly with wealth--but this only applies above the median. Below the median, an IQ of 70 gives you a strong correlation with lower wealth, based on the functional impossibility of certain high-speed, high-cognition jobs.</p>
<p>An IQ of 70 gives you a moderate correlation with earlier morbidity and mortality. This one kind of speaks for itself, and is mostly explained by the fact that something else likely caused the impairment on a biological level that will cause other problems down the line. Also, since low IQs correlate with lower income, and lower income correlates with earlier mortality/morbidity, there's probably an easy common-cause.</p>
<p>In general, someone with an IQ of 70 is likely to work a lower-paying, more physically oriented job, and have less success (a lot, as in likely not to finish at all) in school. They are, to be quite blunt, markedly less intelligent than most other people.</p>
<p>IQ tests are not good at telling who is the smarter of two average people. IQ tests are VERY good at identifying either incredibly strong or incredibly weak cognitive abilities at the narrow ends of the bell curve, and at two standard deviations away, 70 is pretty extreme.</p>
<p>As for social and emotional ability, IQ doesn't directly tell anything at all. It can be said that many mental disorders that cause high or low IQ scores can also cause emotional or social problems (Savant syndrome gives high IQ scores, regular autism or various mental retardations give low) but those are common caused, not intrinsically linked.</p>
<p>IQ honestly gets an unfair rap most of the time. If you let it do what it's good at, it's a fairly effective measurement. If you try to make it an end-all determiner of how good a person is, it's worthless.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a neuropsychologist, so doing IQ and interpreting them is kind of my daily activity. There are some ways to calculate an IQ, the most used in my country is a Weschler Intelligence Scale. </p>
<p>You have to understand 2 things when reading &quot;an IQ of 70&quot;. </p>
<p>The first one is statistically : like /u/ManicOppressive wrote, &quot;2 full standard deviations below the mean&quot;. It is basically the lowest-scoring ~2% of the population. In other words, 2 persons in a random group of 100. So an IQ of 70 is not directly a measure of cognitive function, but more of a &quot;where are you compared to other people of your age?&quot;.</p>
<p>The second is what is measured. In the last scale, there are 4 &quot;independent&quot; indices. Verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, processing speed. </p>
<p>You can have low results for the four indices, but in reality, the more frequent situation is at least a few differences between indices. It is generally difficult to interpret as a &quot;global IQ&quot;, but some professionals do it anyway.  Just to illustrate : if you take an IQ in a non-fluent langage, you will probably have very low result in the verbal comprehension and working memory indices, but not necessary in the perceptual reasoning indice. In this example, your measured IQ will be low but your &quot;true&quot; intelligence would be average.</p>
<p>Yes, it is not the most frequent situation (in theory, you shouldn't do or interpret an IQ in another language), but you can have a similar result with a lot of issues that doesn't necessarily affect your ability to reason, formulate good idea, or think. E.g. When you have a speech or (not corrected) hearing impediment, when you didn't learn to read, when you have a visual or understanding impairment, when you didn't receive a good education, when you have an impaired attention/concentration, memory limitation,... It will not necessarily be as low as 70, but you will score below than average. Does this mean that you are stupid?</p>
<p>So IQ is not a direct measure of your ability to think or feel. Even if it can generally show a large panel of cognitive limitations, it is an indirect measure.
I have seen incoherent psychotics or highly socially-impaired ASD scoring average, and &quot;average&quot; adults (with a job, a wife, friends, etc) scoring low. </p>
<p>The real questions are : </p>
<ul>
<li>What is intelligence, and how can we measure it?</li>
<li>What is necessary to be a (fully) functioning adult in our society?</li>
</ul>
<p>The short answer : IQ is not perfect for measuring &quot;intelligence&quot;, and &quot;intelligence&quot; is not what most people think. But IQ is good at what it measures (see again /u/ManicOppressive's answer).</p>
<p>Don't hesitate to ask me any questions about it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
