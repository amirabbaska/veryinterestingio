<p>I think it's a way for a dog to identify who is who as well as understand chemical signatures of a person to judge your health, current mood etc.</p>
<p>It's also something they do the same way human babies constantly hold onto things and grab things, it's part of them exploring. Dogs don't have hands so they use their mouths, nose, ears and tongue to explore, identify and classify. It is important to teach a dog to not bite but remember as puppies they don't bite down hard deliberately but to grip you like a baby does with his hands so don't get too angry when they do it, just remember to give them their shots before you let their teeth near you.</p>
<p>A dog could remember a specific person by a particular characteristic smell, taste, voice and touch. Unlike us which we use our eyes to distinguish who is who and remembering names and personalities. </p>
<p>Heck dogs could even remember the sound of the way your feet hit the ground and know exactly who that is as well as the type of sound you make when you close your car door. This is what people confuse with the dog's sixth sense, dogs use every sense in very unique ways that it surprises people that dogs can tell exactly who is coming from the parking lot to home without even having to see far off in the distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is similar to asking the question: Why do people cry? Dogs will lick faces for a variety of reasons just like a humans will cry for a bunch of different reasons. Puppies specifically are likely trying to learn about you and the world around them. Human babies also do this, if you think about the first house you lived in and the floor there I bet you can remember how it tasted. Puppies also lick the faces of their mothers to trigger a regurgitation reflex so it is possible they are trying to communicate that they are hungry.</p>
<p>Dogs in general will also lick a humans face for a variety of reasons. The salt on humans skins is often enjoyable to dogs and they lick it for this reason, they could be curious about your feelings as their noses and mouths are sensitive enough to sense chemical differences in a stressed human or a happy human. It could be that they are submitting to you, or it could be that their owner when they were a puppy indicated that they liked getting licked and so the dog continued to do so as a learned behavior.</p>
<p>here is a link explaining other reasons as to why they lick:<a href="http://pets.thenest.com/dogs-lick-humans-faces-5892.html" target="_blank">http://pets.thenest.com/dogs-lick-humans-faces-5892.html</a></p>
<p>TL;DR:
Dogs lick for lots of reasons, puppies mostly out of indicating hunger and exploring the world around them like all babies do. In short: because they're good dogs, Brent.</p>
<p>Edit 1: Was not expecting the ton of response from the floor licking thing. Yes I do remember what the floor in the first house I lived in tasted like. It was a carpet though I have almost no recollection of the house in general. Many people (though not all) will be able to remember this or something similar because it is one of the first memories that forms a negative experience and tell the brain 'Yeah. No. Don't ever do that again.' So it forms a very strong permanent memory. If you don't remember either you didn't care what the floor tasted like so that negative reaction isn't there, you have forgotten because brains are weird and awesome and complicated, or your parents kept you from doing it in some fashion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Licking to show affection is a functional behavior that puppies learn from their mother and littermates. Maternal licking and licking among littermates helps strengthen family bonds. A dog licking your face is expressing his affection for you and trying to strengthen the familial bond he has with you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Licking the face (self) is a sign of stress -- be that eustress (oh boy, yay!) or distress (oh boy, oh no!). </p>
<p>Licking is often an appeasement gesture.  Appeasement is not submission in the out-dated 1970s idea of wolves. Appeasement is more like &quot;Here I am, no threat, you can stop doing the thing I don't like.&quot;   A dog may lick you if he is nervous about something or someone, including you. It's a deescalation social gesture, much like how humans raise hands out in a in front wide &quot;hey, it's okay, no worries&quot;.  We do this subconsciously to indicate our hands have no weapons, they are not in a position to throw a punch.  Dogs also turn heads away, yawn, shake their heads, or scratch to help relieve stress. </p>
<p>Licking can, of course, be due to taste such as lotions and sweat.  Many dogs like to lick humans fresh out of the shower and seem attracted to the body wash remnants. Do not allow a dog to lick lotion, especially medicated lotion or sun lotion, off your hands or face.</p>
<p>Like humans, dogs can develop OCD behaviors. Some classic dog OCD behaviors include a frantic attempt to 'catch' light that never ends, escalating to more and more diffuse light sources, and licking /gnawing at an existing wound, creating a point of infection that does not heal.   It's important to interrupt and redirect any start of OCD type behavior and to consult a behaviorist as soon as possible if a dog can not be easily distracted from tail chasing, light chasing, or licking. The behavior can become consuming without intervention. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a wolf pack returns from the hunt, puppies run up to lick their chins, which triggers an involuntary reflex to regurgitate part of their meal. The pup, either at the weaning stage or older (but still not ready to join in hunts), gets a prechewed meal - basically baby food - plus an infusion of gut microbes to help pass along beneficial digestive and immune-aiding bacteria.</p>
<p>Pack members who don't want to share - either because they don't like the pups, or aren't closely related - won't let the pups lick their faces, obv.</p>
<p>If a puppy licks your face, he is partly asking for nourishment, and partly checking to see if he would be protected &amp; fed by you - just like when you seek kisses from a loved one (part oral fixation/nipple replacement, part communicating the affection to both of you).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
