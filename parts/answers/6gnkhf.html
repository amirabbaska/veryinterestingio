		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason as clouds and fog, both made of water, which is also transparent in liquid or in pure vapor form. Tiny suspended droplets cause light to diffract and when you have million of microscopic little lenses suspended in the air then that's the effect you get.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The fog is from the water vapor in the air. Obviously, because it's so cold, it doesn't really stay in the gas phase, but all of the water particles cool so quickly that they don't have time to form large water droplets, so they instead form a very fine mist, which also freezes into this thick white fog. It's like ice fog.</p>
<p>I can't find much info on how dry ice behaves in an atmosphere with 0% relative humidity, but I bet there wouldn't be any fog.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As said, the fog is condensed/frozen water vapor not the CO2 itself. For a demonstration of this, put dry ice in some other liquid containing no water: 100% alcohol, nail polish remover, etc. You'll get lots of bubbling, but no fog!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're right in that water usually needs to heat up to form a vapor. The responses here are accurate as well but I'd like to try explains it myself. </p>
<p>As others have already stated:
The fog from dry ice is actually caused by water vapor much like clouds are made from water vapor.  There are hundreds to millions of tiny water droplets suspended in the cloud that refract and bend the light as it passes through which is how the white color is created. </p>
<p>How it happens:
Water in the air condensing at the surface of the dry ice and then being carried away by convective currents. Imagine a cold glass that accumulates condensation. That's what's happening at the surface of the dry ice and why you don't need heat! But as the dry ice sublimates (changes from solid to gas) it creates a kind of CO2 gas current that blows the moisture away. This happens at a very small scale so the moisture droplets are incredibly  small. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water vapor is also transparent. However, in the atmosphere steam typically, though not always, involves some amount of condensation into tiny water droplets. CO2 is also invisible, but CO2 from dry ice is so cold that it also condenses small water droplets in the atmosphere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
