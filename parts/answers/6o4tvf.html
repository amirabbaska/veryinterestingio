		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>seeing in the dark requires having built up a stock of the <strong>rod</strong> pigment <em>rhodopsin</em> in the retina, which takes time. retinal pigments are sensitive to light in that they change shape (bleached or isomerized) when they intersect a photon. the retina then has to do work (basically transport the isomerized molecule to other parts of the retina where chemical energy is expended to change it back step by step) to turn that changed molecule back into pigment. rhodopsin is extremely sensitive to light (basically a single photon will do the job), but if there's only a little light getting into the eye, then after a few minutes you'll hit an equilibrium where the pigment is being restored at about the same rate as it's being bleached.</p>
<p>but if you let a <em>lot</em> of light into the eye (e.g. daylight), then <em>all</em> of that rhodopsin will get bleached, your rods will be totally useless, and it will take many many minutes in the dark to restore the pigment.</p>
<p>meanwhile, for bright light conditions you have a different set of pigments used by the <strong>cone</strong> photoreceptors; these pigments are rather insensitive (need many photons to isomerize), so even in very bright light they can maintain the isomerization / recharge equilibrium. but they are useless in dark conditions, since there aren't enough photons to activate them.</p>
<p>upshot is that when you go into bright light conditions, your dark-vision pigments get rapidly bleached and you transition immediately to the insensitive cone system which basically always has a stock of pigment ready because it's hard to bleach it all; when you go back into the dark, the cone system is useless but it takes time for all the super sensitive rod pigment to recharge.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to the other comments:
Your pupils are a way to control the amount off light getting into your eyes. If it is bright they shrink and it is &quot;easy&quot; to make the pupils very small and therefore only let a bit light in. But if it is dark the pupils can only become so big and let light in. So if there is not enough of it that won't do too much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
