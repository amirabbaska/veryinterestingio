		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Specific keys and modes carry emotional cues independent of culture. The brain just reads them as jubilant, sad, angry, tense/scared, etc innately. Now these are then reinforced by culture in the way the people around us react and what we choose to play the music with as well and at a point this cultural component may be larger that the base, but the base is still there. Your child is likely picking up on these base cues as well as your reactions to it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer: culture.</p>
<p>Your daughter has probably picked up on cues from you and your wife, including facial expressions, tone, mood, other media such as TV, etc. that would teach her that sad songs are sad. (As an aside, it used to be thought that facial expressions for basic emotions were universal, but the psychological literature on that seems to be reversing course. Now it's believed that earlier research on this topic was flawed in a number of ways, and that even our understanding of a &quot;sad&quot; face is learned).</p>
<p>In other cultures, musical scales and tones are strikingly different, and what we consider as &quot;sad&quot; would not be so there. For example, take a listen or look into common Indian scalar patterns. Even in our own Western culture this has changed. Plato has a thorough description in the <em>Republic</em> of what sorts of music is appropriate in his utopian city. He describes the various modes and gets rid of certain ones that he states are too sad and depressing, but the modes he wants to get rid of are more aligned with our modern major scale.</p>
<p>Edit:
Came back to add a source, good book on the topic. To counter the other argument, it's definitely not innate (at least not entirely and not in the simple way &quot;innate&quot; implies). Zero modern research on the topic would support this view. Even neuroscientific research on fmri scans wouldn't argue that knowing sad songs are sad is innate (they would however argue that sad songs might appear uniquely in the scans, but the context has to be there). Anyway, here's a good read that also goes through a bit of the history on the recent literature. There's definitely a bias here, since Barrett has been doing research on this for decades and would obviously want to argue for it, but a lot of recent psychology still meets her part way:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Have you considered that she simply <em>doesn't like</em> that type of song? You're assuming a sad song makes her sad. How about assuming that she likes some types of music and not others. After all, crying is pretty much the only way she has to express <em>anything</em> right now.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
