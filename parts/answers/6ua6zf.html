		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a choice made in the design of a building...</p>
<p>Originally it had to do with longevity and reliability of the materials - if you look at steel, the rust that forms when it is left exposed is detrimental - as it rusts the material degrades and gets thinner and weaker until it fails. So steel needs maintenance and protection to last long term (such as bridges being painted, or having steel encased in something like concrete to protect it). The green of bronze however is actually helpful - initially it is nice and shiny, then degrades to the green colour we commonly see, at which point that green layer has created a barrier around the metal, so it doesn't degrade any further. So once it reaches that point it needs relatively little maintenance and upkeep - great for a feature dome at the top of a roof you don't really want to have to access regularly.</p>
<p>It is also worth remembering that most of these structures are traditional ones, built when technology and materials were far more limited, so the green roof was a small price to pay to be able to actually build the structure that may not have been possible with other materials.</p>
<p>Nowadays it mainly comes down to architectural reasons - it will be used to give a certain look and design to a structure that the architect desires.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, architects know their roofs are going to turn green. It makes buildings look classy and old. Sometimes they'll even chemically treat a new copper roof to get that verdigris color (it even has a cool name) without having to wait fifty years for it to change naturally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>they have known it turns green for thousands of years.</p>
<p>its even called verdigris, which came from verte de gris ( from verte de grece), meaning green of greece.</p>
<p>i believe it was used as far back as 300-400 bc</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On sculptures this is called a patina and is intentional. You can treat the metal to prevent oxidation sometimes with coatings or slow it or speed up oxidation with different textures. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
