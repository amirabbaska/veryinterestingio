Not looking to trump your current designer. Willing to volunteer my service if you ever find yourself in a pickle. PM me.</p>
<p>Edit: Please don't interpret this as a shot at your current design. It is not. Sometimes it's hard to find people who value design as a real contribution; I want to help and it's the only thing I have to offer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
