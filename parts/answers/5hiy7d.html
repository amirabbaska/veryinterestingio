		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>During embryo development there are lateral and midline structures.  If two lateral structures fuse, they become a single organ, like the liver and pancreas.  The heart starts as midline tube that folds on itself.  Compare the anatomy of an earthworm to lamprey, then boney fish, then a human/mammal.  This is very simplified.  Evolution does not favor efficiency or effectiveness, it only favors what worked in the last generation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Regarding the heart: From a mechanical point of view two small pumps is harder to manage because they &quot;fight&quot; each other rather than complement each other.  You would need a pretty complicated set of check valves and timing.  However, one could consider our heart to be two pumps and having a set of check valves, so perhaps we do have &quot;two&quot; hearts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our body plan, and that of most animals more complex than star fish, obeys bilateral symmetry. This body plan has lots of advantages in terms of complex motor behaviour and interactions with other animals. Bilateral symmetry means we have two of any peripheral structures, but only one of any midline structures. This is due to the way the bilateral symmetry body plan evolved. You can learn more by reading up on embryology.</p>
<p>Anyway, so the question isn't 'why do we have two of X?', rather it's 'why do we only have one of Y?'. As you can probably predict, it's because our single organs are midline structures. So why is the liver on the right? Because it starts off as a midline branch of the gut, and as the human embryo develops, it gets shifted over to the right.</p>
<p>Importantly, we don't have two lungs/kidneys because of redundancy, as any injury that would destroy one of these structures would have been almost universally fatal before modern medicine. Similarly we don't have only one liver or spleen because of efficiency. In fact the liver is made up of a great many segments, and both it and the spleen sometimes exist in two or more seperate parts. All our organs are more or less as small as they can be to perform the task for which they evolved. It would probably not be more energy demanding for our liver/spleen/pancreas to exist in multiple parts, but it simply wouldn't provide any advantage, and so they have remained solitary, as that's the way they originally evolved as midline structures.</p>
<p>TLDR: evolutionary chance played out in our embryological development.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Two lungs or two kidneys work together and decrease effort and load on both devices.  Two hearts causes pressure defibrillation unless the two devices are synchronized, which can't evolve because the middle step is a fatal condition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
