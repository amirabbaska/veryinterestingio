		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tickling that causes laughter can be caused by touching several sensitive spots, such as armpits or the neck, which are &quot;hidden&quot; or otherwise vulnerable parts of us. The somatosensory cortex of the brain is responsible for picking up these touch signals, and sending them to the cingulate cortex, which makes sense of them. Laughter is genetically meant to be some sort of a defense mechanism; we're programmed to think that when someone touches these sensitive spots on our body, that it will cause some sort of harm to us. Keep in mind, our body systems still function in a primitive manner: to ensure survival. When the touch signal is basically harmless, signals are sent back to the sensory cortex, to evoke laughter, which is practically a &quot;false alarm&quot; sign that nothing was wrong, to decrease any form of stress. The old, primitive reason of laughter is to provide a relieving sense. Which is why comedy, involving unexpected jokes and one liners, makes people laugh. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I seem to remember reading somewhere about how being ticklish on certain parts of your body (belly, neck, armpits, etc) was actually an evolutionary thing that developed to teach children to learn how to protect their vulnerable spots on their bodies.  I dont know if that's true or not, or if that explains the laughing part, but it makes sense to me.  It's like, our bodies made it fun to learn basic self defense when we're young or something</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it is believed that touching the body in that way is inappropriate. Because beliefs are not only believed in the brain, but in the entire body (a belief is a certain uptightness).</p>
<p>Doing/saying anything that is believed, MIGHT trigger laughter, which is basically the relief of the belief: in that moment is realised it is just a belief and is not believed in that moment.</p>
<p>Now with tickling, if you are ticklish (meaning you believe it's inapropriate to touch a body in that way), that belief is instantly challenged, so you can do two things: either continue to believe the belief and thus get VERY scared and as a result aggressive and violent (run away/defend yourself), or relieve the belief, which is laughter.</p>
<p>You can pretend like you don't believe it (pretend you are loose and not uptight), which may go unnoticed from afar. But when the entire body is challenged, it is impossible to hide a belief/uptightness.</p>
<p>example: you might tell me that you're a very loose, confident, live in the moment kinda guy, but if I tickle you and you laugh, I know you're faking it. (which I'll know anyway because it's so easy to see through bullshit if you're not pretending yourself: I am aware that I'm very uptight and I don't hide it when it matters/is confronted).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ticklish spots typically are also vulnerable spots - so it makes sense for evolution to give us a simple self defense course. When we are tickled the unpleasant sensation makes us try to defend these spots on our body, but usually tickling takes place in a rather playful setting. So one theory is that we actually laugh to encourage others to tickle us, so we learn how to defend these areas better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
