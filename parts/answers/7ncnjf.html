		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sound you're likely hearing is partial discharge or corona discharge, not the sound of the frequency of the electricity (unless you're listening to a transformer). It's the noise that air makes as electricity jumps through it, basically baby lightning, for power companies this is a problem for polymer and oil based insulation (ceramics don't mind) as it degrades their ability to resist the voltage. You can't hear this on low voltage since there isn't enough 'pressure' on the electricity, you could however hear the frequency of the electricity in something like a microwave transformer or a electric motor that is stalled. The higher the voltage, more humid and if there is a sharp point can all make it louder, so have a listen to it on a humid night and you might even see it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's oxygen molecules being charged with electricity. When the charged particles give back that energy they emit light and with a high enough charge the energy transformation of these particles can also be heard as a buzzing sound. </p>
<p>The extreme example would be lightning - particles charged up to a million volt that will make a big boom when discharging, that is the thunder you will hear accompanying the lightning bolt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m pretty drunk but I think it’s sudceptance! The negligible flow of charge across insulators and air! If it weren’t so small it would be a mother f’er for engineers to calculate as it’s very temperature, humidity, and site (type of Insulator) specific. That humming is called “corona” because it actually glows like a crown at night. Well very faint.  I’m probably wrong. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are talking about frequency and current and it's too abstract for an ELI5 answer. If you slow down the buzzing, it sounds like a spark. If you've ever heard static electricity sparking and repeat that faster and faster, it turns into that buzzing sound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
