		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Severing the corpus callosum would not totally destroy your proprioception since that is at least somewhat handled by your cerebellum, so at first and certainly over time you would understand where your limbs are at all times.  Just because the largest tract in the brain is severed it doesn't mean you just have two separate brains now, the vermis of the cerebellum is still there, maybe information would even eventually learn to cross over lower in the brain stem.  The brain is amazingly elastic sometimes!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They still can do basic motor tasks involving coordination, not complex (for a while, anyways). Basically, the corpus callosum connects both hemispheres of brain, this makes it easier for us to use our coordination more efficiently. So they still can do these functions, but it's two different sets of motions and thought processes. </p>
<p>Use an example of tying your shoes. When you tie your shoe, you don't think for both your hands, you just act and think of the action of tying your shoes, and act.
They on the other hand, have to have two different thought processes for each of their movements, as they can't connect the motions together properly.</p>
<p>These motor functions are simply more complex and complicated, rather than impossible</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a tangentially related question: Once your brain is split, which half is &quot;you&quot;? Is your conscious selfstream shunted to the right or left hemisphere? Does the other hemisphere become a distinct individual or is it just a non-sapient meat computer?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are other direct tracts that link the two hemispheres without having to pass through lower brain structures.  The corpus collosum is only one of three such &quot;commisural fibers&quot;.  They can do some of the work that the CC does in normals.</p>
<p>Everyone on this thread should look at the drawing of a coronal section (What you'd see if a samurai standing to the side of me hacks my head in two with a downward strike) in the link below. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to remember that the cerebellum contains more than half of the neurons in your entire brain, and is largely responsible for &quot;quieting&quot; unwanted or unwarranted neural signals. This &quot;mini-brain&quot; not only coordinates but &quot;cleans&quot; motor signals in the brain, allowing us to have smooth and coordinated motions. </p>
<p>We can thank our cerebellum for any kind of fine motor control, motor memory/learning, and general motor control. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
