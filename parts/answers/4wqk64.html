		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a number of notable differences, <a href="http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ijsl.1990.issue-82/ijsl.1990.82.71/ijsl.1990.82.71.xml" target="_blank">apparently</a>. While there seem to be very few minor phonetic changes, there are changes in vocabulary, the generation of neologisms, and syntax.</p>
<p>To quote wholesale from my reference:</p>
<blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Some differences are noted in the phonetic and phonological fields, and much more serious and wide-spread divergence is found to have occurred in semantic and stylistic areas as well as in the area of vocabulary. It is also noted that Pyongyang speech is intended to sound, and actually does sound, extremely provocative and militant to speakers of Seoul Standard, due, no doubt, to a combined effect of harsh words and expressions coupled with extreme stress and intonation.</li>
<li>A systematic, all-inclusive, and politically motivated language policy has been conceived and carried out unilaterally in North Korea ranging from the writing system, standard language, and language purification to dictionary compilation and spelling rules. As a result, the Seoul Standard language has hardly changed in many aspects, whereas the North Korean language has departed considerably from the traditional norm, that is, from Seoul Standard, thus speeding up the linguistic divergence between the two Koreas.</li>
<li>The underlying factors for the South-North linguistic divergence are found to lie in (i) the geographical as well as sociocultural separation of the two Koreas and (ii) the radical, politically motivated language policy adopted and pursued by the North. In particular, the official introduction of the Pyongyang dialect as the so-called standard 'Cultured Speech', in violation of the traditional Seoul Standard, is very significant in that it has accelerated language divergence by polarizing the standard language in Korea.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In lexicon, absolutely. As you can imagine, a lot of new words have entered the South Korean lexicon with the increase of modern technology and globalism. (Think of all the words &quot;modern&quot; Latin users have to coin for use today... The Romans didn't have iPhones or computers.) The North is incredibly isolated and this has retarded the development of certain types of new words while a strict language policy has encouraged others.</p>
<p>The biggest differences are things like vocabulary, style, and semantics. A linguistic analysis of newspapers in N. Korea reports:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Obvious differences between the two languages include the lack of use of honorifics &amp; the lack of slang or jargon in South Korean papers. The language of Lotong sinmwun appears to be a more accurate reflection of the spoken language</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is likely the result of an &quot;active, normative, and politically centralized language policy&quot; of the N. Korean government. Basically, N. Korean might be changing from active meddling from political and ideological motivations. It's all very interesting. A recent analysis of textbooks has shown, however, that things like morphology and syntax have changed little (in fact, this study also suggests that there's far smaller variation in loan-word origin than many other studies claim).</p>
<p>Talk about language is often a superficial discussion about culture, nationalism, and ethnicity. Check out the threats made around South Korean adoption of &quot;new&quot; words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A spokesman for the North Korean Linguistics Institute warned on Wednesday that the efforts of the current South Korean rulers to &quot;obliterate the pure spoken and written Korean language through a random use of foreign and mixed languages&quot; would invite &quot;stern punishment by the nation&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What's at stake here is not just language, but cultural heritage.</p>
