This will tell you the last time the soil was exposed to light, giving you an approximate date of burial and a minimum age of it's creation (unless it was napped underground by mole people, it was crafted before it was buried)</p>

<p>EDIT: Since people seemed interested, here's a video of my class collecting an OSL sample using a Gidding's Soil Probe.  The soil is extracted by pushing a tube into the soil hydraulically, the tube is lined with an opaque plastic tubing, which is sealed on the bottom end as it is pulled up (the center soil is what is tested anyway), we pull core after core until we get to the depth we want, then seal that sample up to be sent off for testing.  We were pulling a sample of point bar sand, to help date meander scars, to sequence the river's progression in a cutoff sequence. <a href="https://scontent-1.2914.fna.fbcdn.net/hvideo-xap1/v/t43.1792-2/10664174_10100774497418024_739870371_n.mp4?rl=1500&amp;vabr=923&amp;oh=28ed92e41765b4714d9cb4c697166429&amp;oe=549E6F21" target="_blank">Here's the Video</a>  (HEADPHONE WARNING: LOUD)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a really good question, and gets into the method of radiocarbon (or other isotope) dating. You don't date the rock, because that doesn't tell you much. You would date the wood (Handle), or the leather it's tied on with, etc. Then you don't know when the hammer was made, but you know when the tree grew (Date the hammer was made + 0 to 200 years), or when the cow was alive (date the hammer was made + 0 to 20 years). As for just rocks that we see as a hammer, they use contextual information at the site to date the artifact (What layer of rock/soil was it in, and how long did it take for the stuff above it to accumulate it. When were the other objects at this site made. Etc.) So, I guess the long answer is, you don't know when the hammer was made, but unless someone used 10,000 year old leather to make a hammer, then you at least have a pretty good guess.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<blockquote>
<p><strong>How do they know how old it is?</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The article mentions that the flake was found in ancient river deposits in a meander scar that was closed off from the river between 1.24 and 1.17 million years ago.</p>
<p>On broad, relatively flat floodplains, rivers can “meander” – their channels shift.  As river bends become tighter and tighter, eventually the river cuts through to take the shortest path, and the previous path—which was a tight bend—gradually becomes silted in and cut off from the river channel.  This produces horseshoe-shaped lakes called “oxbow lakes” that eventually fill in, and are referred to as “meander scars.” You can see lots of examples of these on Google Earth around the Mississippi River in the US.</p>
<p>Because the river eroded through lava to produce the meander where the flake was eventually deposited, and because that meander was later cut off by another lava flow, we can bracket the age of the tool.  Lava can be dated by several types of radiometric dating, most often potassium-argon dating.  A radioactive isotope of potassium – 40K-- decays to stable argon.  The half-life of 40K is around 1.2 billion years.</p>
<p>So, the age of the deposits in which the flake was found are known because we know the ages of the two lava flows that are associated with those deposits.</p>

<p>there are a number of different ages being thrown around. You have the actual age of the surrounding rocks; you have the age of the deposit of the surrounding rock (that is, when was the surrounding rock, regardless of how old it is, was depositedin the location in which it is resting); you have the age of the rock from which the tool was made; and you have the age of the tool itself. It's difficult to determine the last stated age with absolute certainty; however, by looking at the other three ages, you can determine a minimum age for the tool. The thought process is that the tool was fashioned and deposited in the surrounding rocks at or about the same time. Therefore, the tool has a minimum age of the time in which the surrounding rocks were deposited. To determine the other ages, geologists can look at rock strata, or radiocarbon dating if necessary. Geologists typically can pinpoint a rock's age simply by where it sits in the earth's crust. The tricky part is that man exerts unnatural forces on rocks and relocates them to places you would not expect them to be. That tool could have been taken from an ancient outcrop and left in a river bed that set into layers 1.2 million years ago. The rock may be 300 million years old, but it got deposited into a layer of a river bed that is 1.2 million years old. If we presume it was not buried but rather, just left by the wayside, we have to assume the tool is at least 1.2 million years old. Hope that helps.</p>

<p>Im a geologist that works with finding tools made by the Aboriginal people of Australia. I am not an archaeologist but I do work along side one. My ability for identifying tools comes because I am a geologist and I can spot rock fragments that have formed through processes other than natural weathering and erosion.</p>
<p>This part of the article is what you need to know:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We observed markings on the flake that clearly suggest it had been struck with force by a hard hammer or other stone tool, making it highly unlikely that it was shaped by natural processes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A rock that has been shaped due to striking will be different from one formed naturally. Usually it will have finer edges and evidence of pressure scars from the impact site. Sometimes the edges are partially serrated. They also look out of place which is where this part of the article comes in:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This quartzitic flake was then dropped on the floodplain of an active river meander. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure rock material could have been transported to the floodplain but you would see a large amount of similar material there. When I find artefacts like this its almost always (99.9%) of a rock type that is not found nearby, and therefore sticks out. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had been studying the sediments in the meander bend and my eye was drawn to a pinkish stone on the surface. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only that, but the shape and size of a rock fragment determines how far it has travelled from its source. Further from the source and the fragments will be smaller and more similarly shaped (sand, for example). Closer to the source and the rocks will vary in both size and shape (eg. a broken boulder in many pieces)</p>
<p>You can see in the article that this rock fragment is quite angular and rather large, which is different from the usual small sediments or rounded rocks you would find in a floodplain/river meander.</p>
<p>Hope that is easy enough to understand :)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some great comments, but I think it should be stressed that all the data has to match, before anyone claims anything.  If one test says the hammer is 1 million years old, and the other says it's 12 million years old, but the soil it was found in was only ten thousand years old...well, there's a problem.  Someone has to explain all that, and back it up with proven methodology that can stand the rigors of repetition and peer review.  I sometimes think people forget the amount of work involved in getting things like that out there.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good answers here. It should also be pointed out that certain rocks actually change chemically in a very specific and predictable fashion when exposed to air.</p>
<p>Namely obsidian undergoes what is called obsidian hydration. Basically the surface of a piece of obsidian will develop a band of changed material on the surface. The depth of the band will tell the investigator how long ago the surface was exposed. And in a chipped stone tool, it will indicate when the chip was made. It isn't a perfect science. The investigator does have to know some variables like historical temperatures. But it does give reliable number, if those variables are accounted for.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
