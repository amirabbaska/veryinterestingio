		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would be more accurate to say not drinking enough water is bad for your skin.</p>
<p>We are composed mostly of water but there's many ways that water is pushed out of our bodies--urine, sweat, breath, saliva, amongst others.  That water needs to be replenished.</p>
<p>When it isn't, your body prioritizes mission critical organs for rehydration with what little you get.  Skin is not a high priority organ.</p>
<p>When you hydrate well, however, your skin gets to return to the amount of water it needs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Drinking a lot of water is not good for your skin. Drinking the correct amount of water is good for your skin (and your whole body for that matter) because your bodies essential chemical reactions only take place when dissolved in water and have the right balance of electrolytes. Drinking too much water can make the concentration of electrolytes too low and drinking too little water can make the concentration of electrolytes too high.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
