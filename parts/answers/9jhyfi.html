		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't my specific area of research so I might be missing some key findings, but the answer seems to be yes, both behaviorally and neurally, although we also have many of the same processing advantages for very familiar faces (see discussion of this at the end of the post):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We're faster at recognizing our own faces compared to either familiar faces (of friends) or unfamiliar faces, even when they are inverted, whereas inverted familiar and unfamiliar faces are equally difficult to recognize (<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/17470211003611264?casa_token=pJekisSAb_YAAAAA:aXYwUZE-tUBbluC1ysrgafqHJ6RcWFYXi2jz2ywmEkoYeU03xIwS5kVAwfuVJT2Y3QCsM7L0OZASw4I" target="_blank">Keyes &amp; Brady, 2010</a> &lt;- pdf!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We process highly familiar faces (including our own) more rapidly than those of strangers as measured by response time in a visual search task where you are shown a number of face images and have to say whether a target face is present or not (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Frank_Tong3/publication/12834940_Robust_representations_for_faces_Evidence_from_visual_search/links/53cfe1420cf2f7e53cf839ca/Robust-representations-for-faces-Evidence-from-visual-search.pdf" target="_blank">Tong &amp; Nakayama, 1999</a> &lt;- pdf!). Although more recent work (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.147.9671&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Devue et al., 2009</a> &lt;- pdf!) suggests that familiar faces hold attention longer once they are already focused on and make it harder to disengage during a search task so you spend more time looking at them, rather than the effect being due to enhanced processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Seeing your own face captures your attention while doing another task, but not more so than seeing other, highly familiar faces (<a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/42275913/u190843274Devue_Bredart_2008.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1538152206&amp;Signature=cmynWm4ANfg2G8DlYl3LIVRHxOY%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DAttention_to_self-referential_stimuli_Ca.pdf" target="_blank">Devue &amp; Bredart, 2008</a> &lt;- pdf!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We're faster at recognizing frontal pictures of our own face rather than profile pictures. There is no difference in reaction time for unfamiliar faces. This suggests that familiarity with seeing our face from a specific viewpoint affects face processing / representation (<a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/713754410?casa_token=vA9QBrEN8KkAAAAA:n8PyrqIWxqEiG9a6Rp4aSWYWxupKDm8aWtIA4CaVBn-xaR4B2c9zP65P8cbHplV7sB-95ozEVEmtQwA" target="_blank">Laeng &amp; Rouw, 2001</a> &lt;- pdf! ; <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/p2901?casa_token=_67fGuo_hk8AAAAA:BRaWRdpdl_MvUnO1xgAB-VVoQ8J-X6iEeJ2nvujVkAJCu_vvFFfKEI95LQlpLJ7_ZPw6u1mBJAUoOHU" target="_blank">Troje &amp; Kersten, 1999</a> &lt;- pdf!). This is supported by the fact that we think mirrored pictures of ourselves are more representative than non-mirrored, while the opposite is true for pictures of our friends (<a href="https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03197695.pdf" target="_blank">Rhodes, 1986</a> &lt;- pdf!), although it might be the case that we use slightly different cues (e.g. asymmetrical features like moles or hairstyles) for our own faces vs. those of our friends since we sometimes see pictures of ourselves (non-mirror-reversed), but we almost never see mirror-reversed pictures of our friends (<a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1068/p3354?casa_token=npBN_FHwNlgAAAAA:NnFQTU8j0RS6Rr1DSBFHyqyfVM5VFWMUEAOaTYo--06y3Zijgl2L4kiJd0EWGOZY3PFit9FXUIWNe-o" target="_blank">Bredart, 2003</a> &lt;- pdf!). </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some studies have found unique patterns of brain activation to one's own face vs. both familiar and unfamiliar faces (<a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4083/3f3e65ed7a910351ddf1c4cded5fb2d4e6d6.pdf" target="_blank">Keenan et al., 2000</a> &lt;- pdf!; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0278262609001778" target="_blank">Keyes et al. 2010</a> ; <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/43911052/Recognizing_ones_own_face20160320-14736-ipatxt.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1538152568&amp;Signature=D6Mf5DrOLQVgNoLuOn12oOHxYew%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DRecognizing_ones_own_face.pdf" target="_blank">Kircher et al., 2001</a> &lt;- pdf! ; <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/1d13/83a6bea09deddfd5a173c829cc607d9a621a.pdf" target="_blank">Platek et al., 2006</a> &lt;- pdf! , <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899308016648" target="_blank">2008</a> ; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393208005095" target="_blank">Platek &amp; Kemp, 2009</a> ; <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.659.5844&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Uddin et al., 2005</a> &lt;- pdf!), particularly in right frontoparietal areas, possibly connected to mirror neuron system (for reviews, see <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/828a/b00c644ea7f2164b385b6a705567da20891b.pdf" target="_blank">Uddin et al., 2007</a> &lt;- pdf! and <a href="https://orbi.uliege.be/bitstream/2268/85119/1/DevueBredartC%26Cpostprint.pdf" target="_blank">Devue &amp; Bredart, 2011</a> &lt;- pdf!). These areas seem to be specific to self-face recognition, as opposed to being generally related to self-identity (e.g., recognizing one's name) (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811908003029" target="_blank">Sugiura et al., 2008</a> ; <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811910000509" target="_blank">Miyakoshi et al. 2010</a>). </p>
</li>
<li>The right-hemisphere preference is supported by some behavioral work that found that we're faster at responding to our own face when making responses with the left hand (controlled by right hemisphere) rather than the right (Keenan et al., <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393299000251" target="_blank">1999</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393299001451" target="_blank">2000</a>). Furthermore, modulating cortical activity in areas in the right, but not the left hemisphere using rTMS impairs self-face recognition (<a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.665.2609&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank">Heinisch et al., 2010</a> &lt;- pdf! ; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lucina_Uddin/publication/6420954_RTMS_to_the_right_inferior_parietal_lobule_disrupts_self-other_discrimination/links/00b7d5215b6285dbd9000000.pdf" target="_blank">Uddin et al., 2006</a> &lt;- pdf!). However, responses to other familiar faces show a bias for a different visual field than those for self-faces (<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393204000454" target="_blank">Brady, Campbell, &amp; Flaherty, 2004</a>), suggesting that perhaps familiar and self-faces are represented separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of the studies linked above suggest that whether the effects are specific to our own face vs. face stimuli to which we've been exposed to many times seems to vary depending on task. Note that this is a little tricky to tease apart when looking at patterns of neural activity: you can compare activity to many different instances of familiar faces vs. unfamiliar faces and show a difference between average response to one vs. another. That would indicate that the difference is not likely due to any one particular face, but is a categorical distinction that we make. That's been found in plenty of studies (see below). It's trickier to do a comparison between one's own face and other faces. If you just have one image of your face, then the difference in response might be due to that particular image, as opposed to a categorical distinction. Even if you have many images of one's own face taken at different times and from different angles, they are still going to be more similar to each other than images of familiar faces of different people, so it wouldn't be surprising if you found a difference in activity. I'm not sure what the best way of doing such an experiment would be. I haven't read all of the papers too closely, so perhaps they control for such things in a way I haven't thought of. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
