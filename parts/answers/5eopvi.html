		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Modi made a bold move to counter two significant issues. One, many black market gangsters have stockpiles of cash which they do not declare. Unable to deposit these large sums without paying taxes ended up with many bills getting destroyed as worthless. Two, the Indian Rupee was terribly dated and easy to counterfeit. By forcing an exchange of old bills for new, harder to copy Rupees, India clamped down on counterfeiting rings.</p>
<p>This demonetization is one of the quickest in history. Unfortunately, such swift action caused a number of issues. Merchants would no longer accept ₹500 and ₹1000 banknotes, even within the legal period, for fear they would not have time to deposit them of convert them. Keep in mind that India remains largely a cash-only society. Many poorer people did not have bank accounts into which they could deposit their savings and could not produce sufficient documentation in time to create accounts. Employers started paying people in larger notes in order to get rid of them, leaving poor workers stuck with trying to figure out a way to convert currency. Banks would accept deposits, but limited withdraws. While fine for folks with credit/debit payment and people getting by on daily living, anyone trying to travel or deal with emergencies were left without money in their pockets.</p>
<p>Modi came back within a couple of days, stating that airports, hospitals and a few other agencies would accept the notes for a longer period of time and could no longer refuse the bills for payments. This helped the situation, but stories came to light of people denied ambulance transport (private companies) to hospitals and some companies forcing large payments via credit cards only.</p>
<p>My wife is from India. She happened to be traveling to visit her family when all this broke. The gas stations in the smaller town where her dad lives closed down because they did not want to accept larger notes. They had no means of accepting credit cards. Her sister came in from London and exchanged a considerable amount of money before her trip, in order to shop for antique furniture. She had one heck of a time exchanging money, as she had not had an Indian bank account in at least a couple of decades. It was/is a mess. A necessary move, but still a mess. Imagine taking the two largest notes in your country and giving people one week to deposit them into the bank. Think of how you would do so if you happened to be vacationing in another country at the time. Think of how you would do so if you did not have credit cards and had to do without cash for several days. Think of how you would take off time from work to stand in bank lines for multiple days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The above answer's great, but not really ELI5. I'll try to add a simpler explanation, in case you don't quite get it yet.</p>
<p>Imagine if barely anyone in the US used credit cards or bank accounts. Almost everything is done in cash, and people keep large amounts of cash at home because no one uses banks. Since everything's done with cash, there are very few records of people buying or selling things, and that makes it really hard to tax.</p>
<p>So out of nowhere Obama says 'From now on, $5 bills and $20 bills are, starting in a few weeks, no longer legal to use. New $15 and $30 bills will be used instead.'. So all those 5s and 20s you have at home, that you're not paying tax on? You have to show up to a bank to exchange those for the new bills, or that money wont be worth anything. This is what's happening in India because of their PM Modi.</p>
<p>If someone shows up to a bank with tons of money that they haven't been paying tax on, the government will know something's up. It's also an anti corruption measure. If a politician shows up with tons of money that they shouldn't have, it'll be pretty obvious someone's been paying them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people who are tax evaders or bribe takers or career criminals  do their business in cash, avoiding a paper trail.  This means instead of using banks, they have mounds of physical cash hidden away somewhere.</p>
<p>By requiring people to trade in high denomination bills, it puts those lawbreakers in a bad spot.  Either their cash becomes worthless, or they have to risk exposing themselves to exchange it for the new bills.  If you are a petty government officials who has been squirreling away bribes of years, and suddenly you lose that nest egg, you (and others) are going to think twice about requiring bribes in the future.</p>
<p>It is kind of a big deal, because corruption is deeply embedded in Indian society, and elected officials usually lack the courage to do anything about it, as they fear not being reelected (or they are taking bribes themselves).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eli5: Imagine you need a hall pad in order to get out of class.  Billy and all the other tough kids seem to always have hall passes signed by Mr. Smith.  Other students may also have a few hall passes by Mr. Smith from time to time, but for whatever reason, the tough kids always have Mr. Smith hall passes.</p>
<p>The Principal learned that the tough kids are threatening to beat up other kids in order to get them to hand over their hall passes from Mr. Smith which is why they have so many.  Obviously, they are breaking the rules by doing this.</p>
<p>The Principal decided that every other teacher can continue using hall passes, but since Mr. Smith's hall passes always get stolen and used for the wrong purposes, hall monitors will no longer accept hall passes issued by Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>Normal: High value bills will no longer be accepted by businesses and banks.  While perfectly legitimate people may have these bills, criminals and drug dealers (the tough kids) are more likely to benefit from the existence of these bills.   </p>
<p>If you worked for a week, you could have your earnings automatically deposited in your bank and you'd be fine using $5 or $10 bills when you need it.  </p>
<p>If you sold $10,000 worth of drugs, someone can pay you in cash, but it is much more beneficial and concealable if you received x10 $1,000 bills instead of x1,000 $10 bills.  By restricting the acceptance of high value bills, they are greatly inconveniencing people who profit outside of the law, and thus are discouraging that kind of behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
