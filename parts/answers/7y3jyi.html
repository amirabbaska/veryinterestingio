		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Octopuses have one central brain and eight smaller ganglia, one in each arm.  These &quot;sub-brains&quot; allow the arms to do a lot of complicated behaviors on their own, like reaching and grasping, and may even have a form of short-term memory.  <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-mind-of-an-octopus/" target="_blank">Here is a pretty good article on the subject</a>, and the book it's based on (&quot;<em>Other Minds: The Octopus, the Sea and the Deep Origins of Consciousness</em>&quot;) is also excellent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans who have their corpus callossum (the part of the brain that connects the two hemispheres) severed, actually tend to behave as if there are two people making independent decisions of one another. </p>
<p>This procedure is only used for patients with severe epileptic seizures, because it reduces the risk of a small seizure spreading to both hemispheres and turning into a grand mal seizure, which can be incredibly detrimental.</p>
<p>It's maybe not quite on par with having two full brains, but it is rather interesting behavior nevertheless.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, worms, for example, have microbrains called ganglia, one in each of their segments. They don't compute much and the distance is short between ganglia, so they don't need much of a central processing unit. Humans, on the other hand, have many complex functions, requiring lots of processing across great distances. Coordinating our complex behaviours requires a large, centralised processing unit, aka our brain. But certain functions are still executed by the ganglia in our spinal cord. For example, walking requires timed extension and flexion of different muscle groups. The timing is created by groups of neurons in the spinal cord. They fire in a regular pattern, the correct order and timing of which is regulated and created by themselves. In this behaviour, although the impulse to talk is initiated in our head, the circuitry for walking is actually programmed in the ganglia that we have in the spinal cord. Not exactly &quot;multiple brains&quot;, in respect to having multiple centralised processing units. Although if you had more than one, it wouldn't be central, anyway. We do have different segments of the brain, to a certain extent, specialised in certain functions, though. Like the cerebellum for some types of memory, and motor coordination, or the left temporal and left lateral frontal cortex for language. In this way, we sort of have multiple brains. They each have their own prerogative, but somehow coordinate between themselves. I could kinda consider them separate brains.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
