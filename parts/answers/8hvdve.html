		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Welding actually began as a blacksmithing technique sometime around 2000 BCE in what's now Turkey (then Anatolia). There's a technique called forge welding where the smith heats two pieces of iron in the forge with some flux material to prevent oxidization before hammering the two pieces together on the anvil. No (dangerously) bright sparks or gases involved.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
