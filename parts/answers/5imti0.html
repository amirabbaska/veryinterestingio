		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is one of those questions that is virtually impossible to tell. How would you know without a shared frame of reference. How can you tell if one being experiences time differently to others.</p>
<p>The one thing you can say is that some species have shorter lives and that some also can react faster, but this isn't the same as perception. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a pretty interesting <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/small-animals-live-in-a-slow-motion-world/" target="_blank">study</a> that came out a little while ago that indicates some animals do perceive time passing at different scales. These scales are dependent upon how fast their nervous system processes information. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would think they certainly do, based solely on the fact that reaction times for many animals is much faster or slower than ours.</p>
<p>Even for an individual, our perception of time changes.  I write music, and when I listen back after getting off the treadmill (when my heart rate is at 120+ as opposed to my resting heart rate of 50-60), it almost always sounds slow...  My perception of the tempo of music changes drastically based on my own heart rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are almost certainly animals which react quicker than humans.</p>
<p>I am unable to slap an uninjured and healthy fly no matter how hard I try.  I fair good reaction time, so it's not because I am slow.  I am fairly sure the fly just sees my hand coming from a mile away, spends a few beats deciding which is the best way to escape finishes off doing whatever it was doing, then just moves out of the way of my slow moving, but heavy hand.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
