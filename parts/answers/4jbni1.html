		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hardness is a separate property to Strength and Toughness.</p>
<p>Hardness is the measure of how resistant solid matter is to permanent shape change when force is applied.</p>
<p>Strength is a measure of the extent of a materials elastic/plastic ranges.</p>
<p>Toughness of a material is the maximum amount of energy it can absorb before fracturing.</p>
<p>If you were to look at the bottom of the press you would see scratches left by the diamond, because it is hard.</p>
<p>The diamond breaks because it has low toughness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Unlike hardness, which denotes only resistance to scratching, diamond's toughness or tenacity is only fair to good. Toughness relates to the ability to resist breakage from falls or impacts. Because of diamond's perfect and easy cleavage, it is vulnerable to breakage. A diamond will shatter if hit with an ordinary hammer. The toughness of natural diamond has been measured as 2.0 MPa m1/2, which is good compared to other gemstones, but poor compared to most engineering materials.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most materials with high hardness will have low ductility (making them highly brittle, e.g. diamonds, ceramics, martensitic steel). This implies that while a high hardness material will resist deformation and initial fracture, but once the fracture occurs it is more catastrophic. A highly ductile material (like copper, tin, pearlitic steel, or the clay model in the video) will deform easier (require less force to deform) but are much less likely to fracture and catastrophically break.</p>
<p>There is another measure of a material's structural performance, termed fracture toughness (not to be confused with strength), which is the material's resistance to fracturing. High strength steels and titanium will generally have a higher fracture toughness than other materials.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hardness doesn't mean what you think it means.</p>
<p>In engineering terms:</p>
<p>Hardness - Resistance to deformation, temper or scratching.
Toughness - A materials ability to absorb energy.
Strength - The amount of stress a material can take before it begins to deform.</p>
<p>So basically diamond is a very hard material compared to steel, pretty much no other material could scratch a diamond. However diamond isn't tougher or stronger than steel. For example if you hit a diamond with a hammer it could easily shatter because diamond isn't very tough, if you hit steel with a hammer it won't shatter because it's tough. When the diamond was put under pressure beneath the press it shattered because it isn't strong, put steel under a press it will deform/bend because it is strong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
