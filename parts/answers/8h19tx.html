		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Time crystals start to oscillate (i.e. form the time crystal) when they get a &quot;kick&quot; from the EM pulse - they are inherently non-equilibrium structures. Piezos (all dielectrics, really) don't really change state when exposed EM field. They polarize to minimize the electric displacement field inside by reconfiguring their bound charge, which leads to changes in bond lengths, but this is a equilibrium configuration that vanishes once you get rid of the electric field.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
