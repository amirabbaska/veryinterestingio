		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Instantaneous destruction of the brain would likely not register. It's hard to say definitively, but by basic logic you can see that if a well placed blow to the head can render someone unconscious, then an exploding brain would be unconscious from the start. The brain is also a highly delicate organ, floating inside a pressurized fluid sac encased in bone; it doesn't function well outside a narrow range of ideal conditions. </p>
<p>In the case of the gunshot, it would depend on the location and extent of the damage. There is a report of a person having a railroad spike (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phineas_Gage" target="_blank">Phineas Gage</a>) through their brain with changes in personality and impulse control, but not death. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Average human reaction time, that is to say the time from a stimulus to an actionable response, is on the fast end 150 milliseconds for physical stimulus and on the slow end 250 milliseconds for a visual stimulus.</p>
<p>To put it another way, from the time a physical stimulus reaches your brain, it takes 0.150 seconds for the stimulus to be processed by your brain and register in your consciousness to have an actionable response.</p>
<p>A .<del>556</del> 5.56 NATO round fired from an M-16 travels at 2.8 times the speed of sound. From 100 feet away, it would take a <del>.556</del> 5.56 round <del>0.0003125</del> 0.03 seconds to cover that distance and go out the back of your head. That is <del>480</del> 5 times faster than your physical response time.</p>
<p>If you were shot in the head from a distance of 100 feet, you would basically lose the 1/4 second of time before the gun was fired. You'd be dead before you saw the gunfire. If you had a clear view of their trigger finger and the bolt on the rifle, you would probably never see them pull the trigger and never see the bolt move. The fastest nerve impulses in your body travel through your nerves at a breakneck 200mph. Less than 10% of the velocity of a 5.56 round. <del>I don't know the length of the optic nerve, but assuming it operates this quickly (likely slower) and it's an inch or two long, the nerve signals would still be traveling down it by the time the bullet is hits you.</del> Signals may be in your brain, but definitely not finished processing.</p>
<p>This is an example with a high-energy rifle round that would basically mushify your brain as soon as it touched you. Gunshot wounds to the head have a surprisingly high 5% survival rate. I think total destruction of the brain is more in line with the spirit of your question however.</p>
<p>Even just a simple pressure wave traveling at the speed of sound is several times the speed that nerve impulses travel down your nerves, so they can traverse the diameter of your skull hundreds of times faster than your reaction time.</p>
<p>Explosions and gunshots are fast. If you were standing next to a big bomb while it explodes, one that completely destroys your brain and body, you wouldn't register the explosion. You wouldn't see the bomb explode, you wouldn't hear the fuse click or anything. The explosion travels faster than the nerve impulses down your body.</p>
<p><strong>edits:</strong> Thank you for the corrections strangers! Not sure what happened to my math. My overall point still stands. Getting shot from 100 feet would have the bullet exiting your head long before any of the stimulus is registered by you. The visual information has a 0.03 second lead time and it's hopeless for your brain to process that as it takes anywhere from 0.1 to 0.25 seconds for visual information.</p>
<p>You don't even have a chance of hearing the gunfire as the bullet travels almost 3 times the speed of sound, the bullet would reach you long before the sound waves reach your ears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have answered your question, but I just want to make a note that a lot of suicides by firearm fail, it's not the instant death many think it is. If you're having rough thoughts and considering suicide, please talk to someone. You can talk to me but reach out to friends and family and know that there are people who care about you, even if you may not notice. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed out, it depends. The &quot;instant kill shot&quot; will pretty much only occur in the &quot;fatal t&quot;. The intersection of the T is basically the top of the spinal cord or base of occiput. This is the gold standard for a head shot since it will sever the brain/spinal cord connection and won't allow posturing or other muscle spasms to occur that could actually pull a trigger of a gun or other brief but still strength intensive movement. This is also why some head GSW suicides have 2 bullet wounds. That's not to say that other brain injury won't cause immediate unconsciousness and death eventually, but you can be both breathing and have a heartbeat for a LONG time after a fatal insult, even while unconscious and even without intervention (10 minutes is nothing, 20 common, a longer time not unheard of - without intervention). In fact, it's likely you'll die of asphyxiation from blood in the airway or exsanguination before cardiac arrest from brain disruption. This time generally lasts longest in fully developed but still young people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain wouldn’t be able to make sense of anything because you’d be dead. </p>
<p>Sorry, had to. I love discussions like this that get people thinking about the smallest little details down to the speed of information moving from the eye through the optic nerve and then being processed by the brain. I love it. This is how I learn about things that I never would have learned in school, not my field of study and I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t have talked about this in my HS Biology class. </p>
<p>I am curious to know the other side of this. How does the brain process when there is sever trauma, for instance the .22 mentioned in a previous comment. The .22 would create a tunnel thus interrupting but not destroying the brain. Since the brain has no touch sensory how would we feel that, or would we even really notice? Obviously the skin puncture and everything into the brain would hurt, but may be in shock or the bullet damage is preventing the pain information from reaching the brain.
I’ve heard of people functioning just fine with something stuck in their brain. Someone mentioned the brain only works in a narrow environment, I thought the brain was pretty resilient, am I wrong?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
