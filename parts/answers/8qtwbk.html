		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an interesting and slightly counter-intuitive effect to how confidence, sample size, and population size work. It might be tempting to think that your confidence in your statistical calculations might depend on how big your sample size <em>as a fraction of the population being measured</em>, and for small populations that's a <em>little</em> bit true, but for larger and larger populations, that effect flattens out.</p>
<p>If you have a sock drawer containing ten socks of assorted patterns, and you pull out ten socks and count up their patterns, you can now characterize the contents of that drawer with perfect confidence. You know <em>exactly</em> what percentage of them are striped or polka dotted.</p>
<p>If your drawer instead had eleven socks, and you pulled out ten of them, then your estimates of those percentages could be wrong, but you know it's wrong within a pretty tight margin for error. The last remaining unobserved sock could throw your estimate off by 9% in either direction.</p>
<p>If you tally up ten socks from a drawer containing twenty, then your estimates <em>could</em> be quite far from the actual distribution of socks. Say the drawer contains 15 striped socks and 5 polka dot socks, and you somehow managed to draw all 5 polka dot socks you might look at your sample and say &quot;this drawer contains about 50% stripes and 50% polka dots. And you'd be pretty far off, because the real proportions were 75%/25%. But this is the farthest off you can possibly be, and it's very unlikely that you'd be this far off because of the unlikelihood of getting all 5 polka dot socks in your sample. That's a pretty wild coincidence.</p>
<p>But now let's consider something a little bigger. Say you want to measure the salinity of the ocean. You can take an eyedropper drop of ocean water and measure its salinity, but how do you know this will be representative of the entire ocean? After all, in the previous example you surveyed 50% of the total socks in your collection, but here, you're only surveying a tiny fraction of a fraction of a percent of the total water in the ocean! This might not be intuitive, but you can actually be far <em>more</em> confident in your estimate, based on picking just a few trillion seawater molecules out of the many many quadrillions of molecules in the ocean. In this case it's not a matter of what <em>fraction</em> of the total population you're counting, it's a case of how many individual measurements you're taking, and the number of molecules in that one drop is a <em>lot</em>. If the ocean were ten or a hundred times as big, it wouldn't matter. You could be pretty much exactly as confident in your eyedropper measurement as you were before.</p>
<p>30 isn't really a special number, but it it is a number of samples, <em>assuming you're drawing from an infinite population</em>, which gives a reasonably tight error margin suitable for most research purposes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's nothing magic about the number 30.  It has become the most commonly quoted &quot;minimum sample size&quot;, but not due to any rigorous mathematics.  It's just a number that kind of caught on and keeps getting passed on by teachers, with no solid justification (other than the fact that very small samples cause problems). </p>
<p>For some analyses, 10 will do fine.  Some statisticians will say that you need a sample size of at least 50 to do meaningful analysis; others might quote an even higher number.  </p>
<p>Usually 30 works pretty well if you take steps to make sure that your sample is truly random, which is often harder than one would think it is.  If your sample isn't random, then even a sample size of 30 can give biased results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember 30 being the magic number in behavioral statistics to infer the results of a sample on a larger population. I do want to know if there is some actual mathematical reasoning for this, or if it's just the number they deemed to be the cutoff (like p=.05 being the cutoff for significance)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The idea of the central limit theorem allowing for \~normal distribution with a sample over 30 is fairly week. There isn't really a threshold when you shouldn't consider the degrees of freedom, which is lost following a z statistic. Generally, the greater the size of your sample the better, and there isn't much significant about the value of 30</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
