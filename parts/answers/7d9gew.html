<p>Things can become lodged in the crease between the membranes but lubrication and blinking usually work them out eventually. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably not &quot;askscience quality&quot; but what do you think tears and &quot;sleep gunk&quot; are in the morning? </p>
<p>Your eye as a whole produces fluids to keep the eyeball lubricated and moist, and your eyelids wipe the eyeball like a winshield wiper and remove any dust and debris, and this usually collects (if you're normal) as a hard dried substance at left and right corners of your eye, near your tear ducts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As you tear up the water and the act of blinking clean your eye. Then there is a duct that leads to your nose, that allows the water to leak. That is why when you cry you get a runny nose. Through that hole debris goes through or gets caught and because the sleep gunk we know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The lacrimal canaliculi drains fluid from the eye produced by lacrimal glands. This fluid then enters the nasolacrimal duct and travels down to the nose where it mixes with mucus. So essentially, anything dissolved in the lacrimal fluid will be mixed with your snot</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The front centimetre or so of your eyes are lined by a membrane called the conjunctiva that folds back on itself and lines the insides of your eyelids too.  </p>
<p>So there is a &quot;conjunctival sac&quot; that surrounds your eyeballs entirely and stops stuff &quot;going behind your eye&quot;.  </p>
<p>Blinking is an effective pump for shifting stuff from the base of the sac to the eyelid edge (see other answers for sleepy dust and gunk).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
