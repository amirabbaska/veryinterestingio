		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If a video game is rendering at 60fps, it will be rendering a new frame every 16.67 milliseconds. That's not much time at all.</p>
<p>Cinematic-quality rendering is likely to include calculations that take far longer, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depth of field, which simulates the effect of a camera lens focusing on certain objects in the scene</li>
<li>Global illumination, which calculates light coming from light sources <em>and</em> light bouncing around between objects in the scene</li>
<li>Ambient occlusion, which calculates how much each part of each object is exposed to ambient light in the scene</li>
<li>Deeper physics simulation, including cloth and hair, soft body simulation, far more elaborate particle effects, and so on</li>
<li>Reflections, where shiny surfaces allow you to see the reflection of other items in the scene</li>
</ul>
<p>Games do approximate some of those, but they take a lot of shortcuts to save time. If you can afford a few minutes or hours of calculations per frame, you can do all of these things at a much higher level of fidelity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Games take lots of shortcuts, and will probably never have the level of physics some animated movies get. Disney's movies are insane sometimes. They have crazy accurate physics for snow and even have animated each strand of hair individually for more realistic looks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Video games take shortcuts; sometimes heavy on some post processing technique, or other times a &quot;cheaper&quot; method to achieve the same effect as the big budget &quot;takes months to render&quot; works.</p>
<p>It's comparable to something like a weekly comic strip to a book.  The weekly comic strip has to work to pump out the material on a pretty fine &amp; rapid schedule - a long running comic might have as much content as a book, but the book might have taken as long/longer to produce that single book compared to a single comic.</p>
<p>With video games &amp; animations, it mostly comes down to how high they can crank the quality - a simple analogy is that a video game tends to have limited texture sizes; but the &quot;takes eternity to render&quot; animations would have a much higher texture size available.  Except this difference in quality applies to pretty much everything (ie: render all the hairs, not just use a few polygons &amp; textures).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Films are mostly ray traced.  Ray tracing looks at each pixel in each frame and traces the light ray for each pixel back to its source to figure out what color and how bright that pixel should be.  Ray tracing produces the highest quality and most realistic results but at a tremendous computational cost.  Last I heard, it's generally accepted that real time ray tracing at high resolution just isn't feasible.</p>
<p>GPUs, the specialized hardware that makes games look good, use fancy math and some observations about how we perceive things to cut corners in drawing each frame.  This allows games to run at high frame rates at high resolution, but the trade off is...  well, reality.  </p>
<p>For instance, a ray traced mirror requires no special handling, while a GPU handling a mirror might need to be programmed to reflect a player's face, but only when a player is looking at it, and otherwise just make it look shiny.</p>
<p>All that said, why one game or animation looks better than the other often comes down to the skill, time and budget of the people putting it together.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, to get 60 fps video games cheat, they cheat like a motherfucker, they cheat in every conceivably way</p>
<p>No game bothers with calculating the movement of individual hairs, if they have any hair physics at all. Elsa from frozen has 400k hairs. for reference, a human on average has between 150k and 90k depending on hair color, (this is part of why replicating her haircut never quite works out)</p>
<p>Water? games hardly bother with water unless its a major focus in the game. rendering a single source of reflection doubles a frame's rendering time, so mirrors frequently don't work, and if you enter an area with many reflective surfaces they only render blurs or cheat with pre-renders</p>
<p>Clothing is another good one, almost no video game character has clothing that realistically moves and interacts with the surroundings, it clips all over the place, that's cause calculating on the fly how a dress realistically flaps in the wind is just not feasible</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
