		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The premise of this question is a little flawed. It's hard to say this without evoking somebody's political sensibilities, but when it comes to humans race doesn't really exist like we think it does. </p>
<p>The difference between humans with different skin colors is like the difference between a <a href="https://pixfeeds.com/images/dogs/1280-544481718-chocolate-lab-relaxing.jpg" target="_blank">chocolate lab</a> and a <a href="https://previews.123rf.com/images/skyyblue/skyyblue1205/skyyblue120500019/13446187-yellow-lab-smiling.jpg" target="_blank">yellow lab</a>; when the two mix, you don't get a splotchy dog, but one with <a href="https://animalso.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/lab-chow-mix_2.jpg" target="_blank">a uniform coat somewhere in between</a>. Sometimes <a href="https://gfp-2a3tnpzj.stackpathdns.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Labrador-Mix-Puppies-for-Sale-600x600.jpg" target="_blank">it runs a little darker</a> but the pelt features are the same. </p>
<p>When it comes to phenotype differences along race lines, the features commonly associated with one race are more the result of selective characteristics localizing in one area over time. When somebody is of mixed race, for example <a href="http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2018/01/010418-rashida-jones.jpg" target="_blank">Rashida Jones</a> their features become a mixed bag from their parents, just like any child from a non-mixed parentage. </p>
<p>The real long and short to your question though: Humans never really evolved to have stripes/spots. I mean, <em>techincally</em> we do, but we can only see them under <a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/65092/our-skin-covered-invisible-stripes" target="_blank">outstanding conditions</a> and these would be closer to the phenotype differences we see whenever two parents of any race have a child. That is to say, the nature of these stripes aren't well studied and it's not yet sure if there's any racial significance to them. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human skin tone is determined by a large number of genes. The more &quot;dark skin&quot; alleles (an allele is a particular version of a gene) you have, the darker your skin tone is.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that the tone of your skin is determined by how much melanin - a molecule which makes your skin absorb more light, and thus makes it darker - is produced in your skin. The more melanin your skin produces, the darker your skin is.</p>
<p>Thus, if you take someone with all dark skin alleles, and you mix them with someone with all light skin alleles, the offspring will be half and half, and thus end up with a skin tone halfway in-between.</p>
<p>Of course, in real people, people don't have just one kind of allele - most humans have some mixture of dark and light alleles, with light-skinned populations having mostly light-skinned alleles with some darker-skinned alleles, and dark-skinned populations having mostly dark-skinned alleles with only a few light-skinned alleles, so there will be some variability in the offspring depending on which alleles they got from each parent, but it will generally end up somewhere in-between the parents' skin tones.</p>
<p>Other animals have different ways of getting their fur patterns, so they don't necessarily end up mixing in the same way that humans do. In some animals, fur color is dominant or recessive - that is to say, rather than ending up halfway in-between, having just one copy of a gene is enough to establish fur color. For example, if red fur is dominant to white fur, if you have two copies of the &quot;white fur&quot; allele, your fur will be white, but if you have one copy of a &quot;red fur&quot; allele and one copy of a &quot;white fur&quot; allele, your fur will be the same color as if you had two &quot;red fur&quot; alleles, because just one red copy of the gene is enough to make your fur turn red.</p>
<p>Another reason why you can see weird fur patterns is when it is on the X-chromosome - female mammals have two copies of the X-chromosome, but you only need the gene expression of one of them to function. Thus, one of them will be inactivated at random (this is known as X-inactivation). In animals where fur color is on the X-chromosome, a female animal might end up with different colors of fur in different patches of skin that have had different X-chromosomes inactivated.</p>
<p>It varies a lot from animal to animal; there's no one answer for why they end up the way they do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, because all cells choose to do the same thing. Ie, be pale, or dark, or in-between. This is normally dependant on the gene - the mother's sometimes overpowers the father's, sometimes the other way round, sometimes they work exactly evenly with the other. </p>
<p>Stripes only form when the cells can't decide and some cells choose one, and some choose the other. Which actually does happen in humans, but not with anything visible.</p>
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/BD6h-wDj7bw" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/BD6h-wDj7bw</a></p>
<p>Edit: stripes can also form just because that is the 'colour' they are programmed to be. In which case, just like our skin colour, all thier cells will choose to be whatever stripes according to how dominant the stripes were from each parent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As we have two chromosomes of each one, we have two of each gene (one per chromosome) and they can be the same or different. </p>
<p>When they are both different, there are three main ways in which they can behave:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>One imposes over the other. Say the father is orange and mother is yellow. Is this happened, the kid would be orange or yellow. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They both are activated separately, so with the same example, kid would be yellow and orange (as in your example, it could be stripped, or with yellow arms and an orange face).</p>
</li>
<li>They kind of act together  and the result is a different colour. It can be a completely different colour or, as what happens with us, just a tone in between the skin colours of both parents.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Expression of alleles in the DNA are the same in all animals( both expressed equally forming certain skin shades), however some animals have other alleles that cause a pattern in the skin along which the skin color is expressed differently. Therefore the patterns colours are an effect of two different alleles being expressed in combination.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
