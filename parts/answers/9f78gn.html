		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A shell or ball is what you'd expect if the particles don't collide with each other. This is why you can get elliptical galaxies - stars almost never collide and don't even have close encounters very often, so once you get a ball of stars, the stars will just keep on buzzing around in a ball for a very long time. This is also supposed to be the case for dark matter. The dark matter particles don't really collide with each other, so they just stay in a big puffy &quot;halo&quot; around the galaxy.</p>
<p>However, the dust and rocks and moonlets in a planetary ring <em>can</em> collide with each other. So if you some particles in a &quot;polar&quot; orbit, going up over the north pole and back around the south pole, and other particles in an &quot;equatorial orbit&quot;, going in circles around the equator, then these particles will smash into each other. Unless all the particles are orbiting in the same plane, their orbits will cross and they'll collide. These collisions transfer momentum between the particles, and also get rid of kinetic energy. Eventually, through enough collisions, everything will settle down until you get a disc or a ring. Then all the particles can have nice circular orbits without bumping into each other. (Another way to think of it is this: you can get rid of energy, but you can't get rid of momentum. A ring or disc is the lowest energy system you can get while still conserving angular momentum).</p>
<p>This is true for more than just planetary rings. Gas and plasma particles in space will bump into each other too. So when you get a lot of gas coming together to form a galaxy - or, on a smaller scale, a chunk of gas coming together to form a star - it will also collapse into a disc. For a galactic gas disc, this will collapse to form stars, so you get a disc of stars. For a stellar gas disc, this will collapse to form planets, so you get all the planets within the same plane. It's not that the stars or planets need to be in a disc - neither really is good at collisions - it's that the gas they formed from was in a disc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A given closed system (like a cloud of debris flying around a planet) has a total angular momentum that is conserved. This angular momentum is only in one direction and lies on a plane. So while total angular momentum is conserved in that direction, eventually over time the collision of debris / particles will cause all other directional motion to cancel out.</p>
<p>It's for this reason that the solar system lies essentially flat, or why spiral galaxies are flat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a good answer here about how collisions can quickly reduce momentum to the point where you form a flat disk, but you technically don't *need* collisions to do all of it.  You just need a lopsided distribution to begin with, which then becomes self-perpetuating.  Let me give a simple example:</p>
<p>For simplicity's sake, imagine you had a &quot;ring&quot; comprised of only 3 moons, all orbiting on the same plane.  You now have a 4th moon orbiting at an inclined angle to that plane.  It's true that the *combined* center of mass of the system is the center of the planet, but that only works on average.</p>
<p>Imagine a scenario where the three moons in the plane all end up on roughly one side of the planet during their orbits.  At the same time, the inclined moon passes close to them in its orbit as well.  Yes, the gravity of the planet will still be the dominant force holding the moons into orbit, so no one's going to going flying off into space, but the three little ones will still &quot;tug&quot; slightly on the inclined moon and nudge it closer to them.  In this case, slightly reducing the inclination of the orbit down towards their plane.</p>
<p>As long as you have a lopsided distribution of mass already in a disk or plane, then over time, it will slowly move any inclined orbits closer and closer to that plane.  Collisions help to do this much faster, but it's still a natural process once a lopsided disk-like distribution begins to form.  It's why planets, moons, etc. tend to organically hold themselves into planes and self-correct any wobbles from minor disturbances, even if they never touch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On top of u/Astrokiwi 's lovely explanation, there's probably one more factor.  </p>
<p>Your initial assumption is not correct.  A planet's gravity is not equal in all directions.  If planets were spheres, it would be, but they aren't.  Planets are actually oblate spheroids, 3d shapes made by rotating an ellipse around its minor axis.  Think more lemon-shaped than an orange.</p>
<p>This means that the distance from the exact center of the planet to &quot;surface level&quot; at the equator is greater than that from the center to the same level at the poles, giving the planet a slight &quot;bulge&quot;.  Which means there's also more of the planet's mass around the equator.   And more mass means a greater gravitational pull. </p>
<p>All this means that a planet's gravity is stronger right around the equator.  Right where the disc of the ring system of Saturn orbits.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
