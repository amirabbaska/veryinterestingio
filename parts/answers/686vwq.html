		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A sprain actually doesn't involve any damage within the muscle tissue. A sprain affects the ligaments that connect bones to joints and can vary from a snapped ligament down to just a ligament that has a twist. What I believe you're thinking of is a strain and the easiest way to understand that is to look at a picture of striated muscle tissue and imagine all those little lines as rubber bands, when you strain the muscle some of the rubber bands snap.</p>
<p>[edit] I'm an EMT by the way and we basically treat sprains, strains, and closed non angulated fractures all the same way. The treatment is basically the same, immobilize it, ice it, and go easy on it. If you have concerns go get an X-ray cause that's the only way to be 100% sure if it's fractured </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned before, you don't &quot;sprain&quot; a muscle.  Generally speaking you &quot;strain&quot; a muscle.  When you sprain/strain a muscle you damage the muscle fibres - you stretch, break, bruise, mash, etc the tissue of the muscle.  When you damage the muscle tissue (soft tissues) you will then get inflammation.  </p>
<p>What is inflammation?  It is essentially a fluid.  What's in the fluid?   The fluid consists mainly of a matrix made up of dead cells and repairing or rejuvenating cells.  Initially this matrix of cells is very liquidy - the area of muscle becomes swollen (bigger), hot, painful and difficult to move.  Over time (after about 1 week) the inflammation then becomes thicker and stiffer.  This thicker and stiffer substance is called scar tissue.  This scar tissue has  formed from the initial liquidy inflammation around the injured muscle.  The scar tissue then &quot;patches in&quot; the strain/sprain area of the muscle.    </p>
<p>The scar tissue is just like a scar on your skin, but is like a scar on your muscle.  Your muscle cannot grow new muscle fibers, so it repairs/heals itself with scar tissue that is formed from the initial inflammation.  The whole process, generally speaking, takes about 4 to 6 weeks depending on the severity of the injury.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to add to other well written replies here : in old Latin they would call inflammation caused by events such as sprain as follows : calor (heat) dolor (pain) rubor (redness) tumor (swelling). They are all basically caused by the infiltration of immune cells (white blood cells and others) to &quot;clean up&quot; any damaged tissue or strained muscle that can lead to loss of tissue integrity. Becauseâ€‹ immune cells from the lymph have to squeeze through to get through the cells lining the lymphatic or blood vessels, they cause this swelling followed by fluid from the lymph accumulating as a result. This causes the pain and redness as well. Once they repair the damaged cells they die or migrate back to local lymph nodes subsiding the swelling. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
