		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually modern blueprints are black on white, but the name came from when they were white on blue.</p>
<p>This was because one of the earliest copy process resulted in white lines on blue background.</p>
<p>With architectural and engineering drawings where there a re lots of little details and accuracy is very important, making exact reproductions can be complicated and alternatives such as redrawing the entire thing with a pantograph or similar is not the ideal solution.  This is why such chemical copying processes where used in this area first before better methods that reproduced black on white as black on white where invented.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Originally blueprints were the only way of making copies of technical drawings and the process involved exposing the special paper to ammonia. I imagine that the interaction between the chemical coating of the paper and the ammonia produced the blue color, but I can't tell you the exact reason for it being blue and not another color.</p>
<p>edit: Here is why they were blue:</p>
<p>In 1861, Alphonse Louis Poitevin, a French chemist, found that ferro-gallate in gum is light sensitive.[4] Light turns this to an insoluble permanent blue. A coating of this chemical on a paper or other base may be used to reproduce an image from a translucent document.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah back in the day when &quot;drawings&quot; were drawn by humans. They would be drawn on sepia paper. A type of transluscent, see-thru paper. This would be wrapped on drum style printer that were used at the time which transferred the marked up sepia drawings onto a special reactive paper that was blue in appearance. Alcohol fumes would erase the blue except where the lines were and wallah. Blueprints were made. You could use the sepia to run many copies of the drawing kind of like a an original .pdf
God I'm old.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The process used to make blueprints is called Cyanotype. It works using a greenish blue solution of ammonium Iron citrateÂ and potassium ferricyanide. These 2 chemicals in solution are painted or soaked in to a surface, usually paper.</p>
<p>Next, the design to be transferred is drawn on to transparent acetate film in black. Back before printers and computers engineers used to draw these by hand. The soaked paper and acetate are placed in an exposure machine which blasts the paper with UV light, but the areas which have been drawn in block the light.</p>
<p>UV light makes the 2 compounds react. The important thing about the reaction is that it makes the parts exposed to the light harden and become insoluble in water. The parts that are covered don't react and can be washed away. </p>
<p>Long story short blueprints are blue because the cyanotype process makes <em>blue prints</em>! Simple as that. Nowadays this process is not used in the engineering world because we have fancy computers to do the work for us, but many artists still use it for a particular a e s t h e t i c.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
