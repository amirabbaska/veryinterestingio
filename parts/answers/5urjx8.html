		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers here are correct, but the question is actually much deeper than it might seem, and touches on that which sets Humans apart from Animals. Strap in, because I have insomnia. </p>
<p>Some of the defining features of language proper are that it is arbitrary, infinite, and voluntary.  Some forms of animal communication resemble language in some of these ways, but that actually makes it harder to decipher in most cases. </p>
<p>Language is arbitrary in that the words, sounds, or symbols are not necessarily obviously understood by someone who does not already understand the language. For example, the word &quot;danger&quot; does not convey a warning to a person who doesn't speak english, but the angry barking of a dog is obvious in its meaning. The exceptions to this are called onomatopoeia, where the word phonetically resembles the meaning, and are often used to describe animal sounds, like &quot;bark.&quot; Animal noises and signals that aren't arbitrary are easily understood and imitated by humans to communicate with animals. Likewise, a dog can be conditioned to respond appropriately to commands, but the dog will always understand shouting means anger, happy noises are playful, and quiet noises are calming. </p>
<p>Language is infinite in that you can use as many words, or create new words, to describe a limitless set of meanings. Take the example sentences, &quot;A noble spirit embiggens the smallest man,&quot; and &quot;'embiggens' is a perfectly cromulent word.&quot; Now, even if you weren't familiar with the Simpsons, the meaning of both words can be inferred from context. &quot;Big&quot; is a familiar word, with a familiar prefix and suffix that serve to define the word as &quot;to make one big.&quot; But &quot;cromulent&quot; only has a suffix to indicate it is an adjective, yet the humor of the joke relies on the fact that a person knows exactly what it is supposed to mean. New words and new ideas are the main point of contention that linguists and biologists use to differentiate between human language and  mimicry. A bird might learn to produce thousands of words, but it will never create new words, and will never learn to describe new stimuli. Likewise, the tail positions of wolves might convey a variety of arbitrary meanings to other members of the pack, but those meanings are limited to the pre-defined learned messages. </p>
<p>Language is voluntary in that we choose to say &quot;that's scary&quot; rather than screaming in horror.  Animal mating calls can be arbitrary, and in the case of a mockingbird, theoretically infinite. But the mating call itself is biologically compulsive.  That is, you can induce an animal under the right circumstances to make specific noises. Humans, on the other hand, choose what to say, when to say it, and how to say it. We also choose how to respond to communications from other members of the species. Our developed forebrains allow us to plan and scheme and analyze information in ways that are not available to most species. Thus, we can observe and experiment with animal communication to decipher their sounds and signals in whatever form they take, but that becomes much more difficult if the subject can choose not to cooperate. </p>
<p>All of these aspects actually make it much more difficult to understand foreign communications. Anthropologists spend lifetimes translating dead languages, and it makes discoveries like the Rosetta Stone so precious. Explorers discovering isolated civilizations have relied on visual communication that is not arbitrary, i.e. pointing, gestures, animal sounds, etc, to learn and teach each other's langauge. Simple words are then used to translate complex concepts. &quot;Me&quot; and &quot;you&quot; becomes &quot;mine&quot; and &quot;yours&quot; becomes &quot;I'll trade you this shiny bead for your 1st Edition Holographic Charizard (sucker).&quot;  </p>
<p>Humans have an innate ability to pick up language with minimal instruction, but we lose that ability as our brains develop and our cultural linguistics solidify. But even if we could figure out a way (ethically and logistically) to raise a baby in the company of whales, we would not likely have an easier time unraveling the complexities of different songs. Without a two-way communication, we aren't able to learn or teach the meanings of arbitrary sounds or symbols. We have a hard time even determining if dolphin sounds constitute language because we are limited in what we can observe and convey. </p>
<p>In the fascinating case of Koko the gorilla,  experts disagree on whether she was actually able to combine sign words to create language and describe new feelings, or if she was merely adapting conditioned responses to achieve desires. Unfortunately, Koko couldn't teach us Gorilla because the grunts and hand waving that gorillas use don't convey complex messages. Despite the fact that gorillas don't have a true language, we were still able to learn quite a lot from Koko. We were able to observe Koko trying to teach sign language to other gorillas. We learned from her that gorillas, and likely other animals, have the capacity to learn to communicate in a way that at least closely resembles language. But the closer any natural animal communication is to language, the harder it becomes to translate. Whether it is a visual signals like the movements of an octopus, the clicks and whirrs of a dolphin, ant pheremones, or some other previously undiscovered means of communication, the arbitrary and infinite nature means we cannot guess at the message, nor can we brute force our way towards mutual understanding. </p>
<p>TL/DR: A million monkeys at a million typewriters might write Shakespeare, but they won't understand it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>u/Finleychops has brought up killer whales which is an excellent example of animals using complex and specific languages. Each separate killer whale pod has its own language...Not just it's own dialect, but it's own specific language. This is known because when captive killer whales have been released back into the wild alone, we know from observations that these killer whales are unable to integrate into any wild pod because they are unable to speak the language of a new pod, and vice versa.</p>
<p>We also know that killer whale pods in the wild are able, through their vocal and body language alone, to successfully orchestrate together, very complex symphonies of group behaviour in order to successfully kill large groups of fish. Each member of the pod has specific duties to complete in these group activities in order to bring groups of fish together, to move them from the depths to the surface, and to stun them as a group, and then feed in an orderly fashion. It's absolutely incredible. And they can repeat the same hunting and killing as a group, and change the symphony of body language and vocal language as needed in specific situations, to get the job accomplished. </p>
<p>Scientists have been studying wild killer whale pods for decades in order to decipher their languages but we still don't know how to break down their conversation and translate it into the equivalent of human language, so that we can fully understand what these complex and intelligent groups of creatures are conversing about.</p>
<p>We need a killer whale scientist in here to explain more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't any doubt that certain animals communicate using language to some degree. However, animal languages seem rather arbitrary <em>compared to human language</em>, and there have been decades of research into the sounds made by mammals and birds to identify words or grammar <em>in the sense that we recognize them.</em></p>
<p>Italics above to emphasize the differences there will necessarily be between animal and human hardwiring. A lot of animal <em>communication</em> (which is a broader category than &quot;words and grammar&quot; <em>language</em>) is based on body language, smell, electric impulses or even colour as with certain squid that can change their hue. Bees will &quot;dance&quot; to describe to the hive where they found a load of nectar.</p>
<p>The fact that many animals use senses to communicate that humans don't, or don't even have, requires a special effort on our part to understand mindsets that may be fundamentally alien to ours. That, and we may find that if we at some point are able to talk to, say, dolphins, they might not be interested in conversing about much else than fish.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
