<p>When you first come across something you think it's pretty cool and then it's possible you hype it ups mentally and set an expectation for the amount of dopamine that will be released once you achieve your goal. If the release of dopamine is too low you will end up being sad, if it ends up being higher you will be glad.</p>
<p>Essentially you release the dopamine based on a subject then once you get that subject if it pleases you less than imagined you are sad due to being use to that level of dopamine or less.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People who are not happy, especially those who are just incapable of genuine, self-generated happiness, believe that something else will make them happy. The next toy, the next car, the next house, the next job, the next SO, whatever. It's always some other thing that will cause their happiness. They're not unhappy because they're unhappy people; they're unhappy because they don't have the right external thing. </p>
<p>When they get the next thing, after experiencing a brief &quot;happiness,&quot; they realize that it only makes them happy for a little while. It brings fleeting joy, at best. It isn't an answer, it is merely a distraction. </p>
<p>That thing stops making them believe they are happy, so they need to move on to the next thing. Worse, the first thing reminds them that they can't be made happy by the things they thought would do it, so they want to discard it entirely. </p>
<p>In a child, with a toy, this is understandable and good. Adults should, but unfortunately often do not, grow out of the expectation that the rest of the world should cause their happiness, rather than expecting them to find their happiness within. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A couple of different aspects of human nature come into play:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A case of be careful what you ask for, because when you get it, you may not like it. Like how Rick Perry wanted to be Secretary of Energy, and once he got it found out it wasn't about regulating energy but maintaining a nuclear weapons arsenal. Or how the Republicans wanted to win the presidential election at any cost, but the candidate from their own party that won may do more damage to their party than anyone expected. Or the management position you always wanted, but once you got it you realize the stress of being a manager isn't as personally rewarding as you thought.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Love and excitement of a challenge or power grab, but once you get it there is no challenge to get excited about. Like the guy who hopes to date a specific girl, but once he does looses interest. Or the job acquisition you always wanted, but once you got it, you immediately start looking at your next advancement. </p>
</li>
<li>Insatiable greed. Like once you made your first million dollars, you are drven to acquire more wealth.</li>
