		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Caulking such as horse hair, clay or cloth was poked between the wooden planks to fill gaps. Pitch or tar was applied to the outside to help waterproofing.</p>
<p>Also boats then, like now, aren't water tight. The bilges would always collect some water. Bailers would use buckets to bail out the bilge water. Today this is done with pumps or stern hatches on some small dinghies/yachts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tree resin is an excellent waterproofing agent, and very helpful when binding wood together to create a boat. Sometimes they would use pitch and tar (a resin composite)  instead, but resin was the preferred method for many cultures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tar/pitch was also used; basically painting/caulking the hull until it kept out most of the water (though some would still get in 9/10 times). Also the whole ‘swabbing the deck’ thing wasn’t a big deal because it was dirty; it was a big deal because wet wood swells to a larger size than dry wood, and larger planks means less space between them, which means it’s less likely to let water in, should it get splashed suddenly</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were and are two main techniques of planking. </p>
<p>Carvel is where you fit the two butted sides together with a good fit and as slight a distance between planks as you can and they lay flush upon the frames and present flush to the outside world. Then, depending usually on the size of the vessel, either cotton or oakum is driven in the whole length of that seam very very tightly packed. Once the boat hits water, the planks will swell and compress the cotton which is already in a narrow channel, and the seal will be waterproof. This may take a few hours to days depending on type and state/age of wood and cotton and also length of time out of the water.</p>
<p>Lapstrake or clinker is what you see in Viking ships. The plank above lays over the edge of the plank below. They are both steam bent then carved to receive each other before being fastened together on the boat. They are fastened with rivets which, in the act of riveting, create further compression of the wood along the very accurate fit. A watertight seal. </p>
<p>Both kinds have a rabbet carved into the keel and stem and sternpost (whole spine of the boat) with a complex bevel to receive the garboard (first plank), and cotton caulking along the seam of that rabbet exposed to the world. </p>
<p>Pitch is often poured into the keel at the lowest point around the sternpost so that water which will inevitably get in, from seeping or over the gunwales, will find its way there by gravity but not rot the wood as is sits waiting to be bailed. Pitch can be applied many places and often is for degrees of repairs. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>Make it out of a naturally water-resistant wood, like pine or cedar. </li>
<li>Shove bits of old rope and other similar materials between the boards.</li>
<li>Cover whatever you can in pitch or resin.</li>
<li>Still expect it to leak, and to spend an annoying chunk of your time bailing water out/repairing leaks.</li>
