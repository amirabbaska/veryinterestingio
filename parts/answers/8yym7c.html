		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have already pointed out the cost and radiation exposure.  Another factor to consider is incidental findings.  If take 100 people and give them all a full body scan, you'll probably find some weird-looking thing in at least 20 of them.  This guy has a thing on his kidney which could be a benign cyst or it could be a cancer.  This lady has some stuff caked onto the ovaries, could be ectopic endometrial tissue but could be cancer.  This guy has a lump in his abdomen, could be a meckel's diverticulum but it could be a cancer.  Maybe two of the people with a weird finding actually have cancer, and one of them is probably too far along for it to be helpful to have found it now anyway.  Meanwhile, the other 18 people who turned out not to have cancer just ended up having unnecessary surgery.  With those 18 unnecessary surgeries, two had severe post-operative complications, one of whom died, two are now pooping into a colostomy bag, one is impotent, one is infertile, and two now have chronic pain.  So overall we've maybe saved one life, but also lost one life and substantially messed up several others.  Overall, it appears that this group of 100 people is worse off for all having gotten a scan. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>MRIs and CTs are hugely expensive even for part of the body. A full body scan would be outrageously expensive. CT scans, especially full body scans, also give a non-trivial dose of radiation. Finally, the likelihood of randomly stumbling across a cancer is exceedingly low.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They have reduced the frequency of prostrate exams in the US as they were finding too many non-fatal prostrate enlargement such that it was causing more harm than good by too much unnecessary cancer treatment. Prostrate cancer is usually very slow in its progression and you can have it for decades without it killing you. </p>
<p>[Source: Old Fart who now has much fewer of the “now bend over” at his annual physicals]</p>
<p>PS the same goes for annual full body scans. The body has a lot of strange growths as you get older and they are almost always benign and have no impact on your health. </p>
<p>That said, if you are having unusual symptoms, that could be one of those growths that does impact your health. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Those machines are very expensive.  Cost is a significant issue.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is non-trivial to find cancer even with such scans (unless it has progressed a long way).  Maybe soon we'll have AIs that can do it well. </p>
</li>
<li>Radiation exposure is best avoided unless there's a good reason. </li>
</ol>
<p>But with all that said, there <em>are</em> times when doctors do scans even when they don't really suspect cancer.  Such as when someone has a strong genetic predisposition for a certain type of cancer.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, MRI's are really expensive, and hospitals cannot just waste their money diagnosing something they have no reason to diagnose, and patients don't want to spend a couple thousand dollars on a diagnosis which will probably find nothing important.</p>
<p>Secondly, when you try looking for cancer, you will probably find something benign. There are so many things that may look like cancer, but are actually harmless, yet there is possibly no way to tell if something is cancerous or bening. Instead, you will be treated as if you had cancer, you will be put through chemotherapy, and a huge dosage of drugs which will probably not need. Benign tumors or other ailments which could just naturally go away are more probable. You only check for cancer after suspecting it because that is really the easiest way to tell if you actually have cancer. Also it is only worth intervening if you are having symptoms of cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
