		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>8k resolution has been a thing for a long time. Its just not very popular.... why, well frankly, we're really not even at 4k yet in the general market.  Very little video content is available in 4K.  There's a lot of screens that do 4K, but minimal content.</p>
<p>Instead of resolution, HDR is more likely to be the &quot;next big thing&quot; for video.  4K HDR is gonna be around a long time. Its really good and has a lot of benefits instead of bumping up to 8K.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First let's understand what 4k is.</p>
<p>720 is a resolution of 1280 x 720 for a total of 921,600 pixels.</p>
<p>1080 is a resolution of 1920 x 1080 for a total of 2,073,600 pixels.</p>
<p>4k is a resolution of 3840 x 2160 for a total of 8,294,400 pixels.</p>
<p>8k, the next step up, is 7680 x 4320 for a total of 33,177,600 pixels.</p>
<p>You'll notice that the naming scheme changed from 1080 to 4k because companies thought using the bigger number was more impressive. What we know today as 4k should really be called 2k or 2160.</p>
<p>As for quality, every time we double the horizontal number and go up a quality step we are actually quadrupling the number of pixels. If TV's don't get any larger more pixels will stop mattering as we already can't see individual pixels anymore at a normal viewing distance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the moment the acquisition and distribution of UHD Phase 1 and Phase 2 (4K and 8K for TV) is not widely developed for many reasons. The bandwidth requirements for an UHD are very large and the technology is not really there for the distribution to the home.</p>
<p>Whilst UHD Phase 2 (8K) will be the next resolution jump we are still a long way off from delisting it. Tests are being done at the up coming winter games and football World Cup.</p>
<p>The next development for home entertainment will be HDR. There are different types of HDR. HLG HDR is being developed by the BBC and is about to be tested very shortly in the UK. The is a type of HDR that’s is compatible with screens with a standard dynamic range.</p>
<p>TV’s will start being developed with different HDR standards. Not all standards are equal with some allowing content to be displayed at higher nit rates and dit depths which is what you want as a consumer for a better colour and brightness range. </p>
<p>The one standard being developed to look out for is ‘Dolby Vision’. This standard incorporates dynamic metadata. This allows the tv to set the dynamic range on a frame by frame basis rather than an overall range for the entire programme. Dolby Vision also allows a higher theoretical nit rate of 10,000, however only 4000 can be achieved at the moment. This higher nit rate will allows brights to be brighter and darks to be darker.</p>
<p>Look out for Dolby Vision in upcoming TV’s </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This depends on what you mean by &quot;when will we get there?&quot; for the common tech user, it may not advance quickly, as there isn't much demand for higher than 4k resolution. Panels with higher resolution are available if needed, although not in your average market. 4k is excellent, and impressive technology at that, but in many instances, even 1080p is adequate. But there are already 5k panels. It seems to me that resolution will keep getting better, as we demand larger displays with higher pixel density. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
