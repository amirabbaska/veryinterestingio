		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Reps and weight arent set numbers that work for everyone. </p>
<p>Per norm, Heavy loads with low reps are all about strength, moderate wright 6-12 reps is hypertrophy, and light loads with lots of reps are stamina/tone training.</p>
<p>So the way your muscles grow is Hypertrophy, when you work out, you get tiny tears in your muscle, and when its repaired, its repaired in a way that adaps to the stress put on it. </p>
<p>Now the key is understanding Muscle Strength, vs Muscle Size.</p>
<p>Strength comes from cell density, the more things you pack into your muscle cells, like glycogen, for example, helps you get more energy per cell, which increases the weight you can lift, this is achieved with low reps since it doesnt stimulate muscle growth in the same way as high reps but produces levels of chemicals that increase 'density'.</p>
<p>Hypertrophy depends on the amount of cells and some other stuff that doesnt directly translate to strength, like non contractile tissue that only increases volume. So increasing the tearing is the way to go, so moderate weight and 6-12 reps with lots of exercises to ensure muscle faliure</p>
<p>Everybody is different, and if youre skinny you should probably focus on building strength for a while so you can handle larger weights and then start training for hypertrophy, for example.</p>
<p>Fitness is all about trying new stuff out and figuring out what and how stuff works for you!</p>
<p>EDIT: Change tone to stamina, not sure why i wrote tone, assuming it was a translation brain error on my part</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm gonna give it to you straight - there'a a lot of science and study that people have put into lifting, and there are plenty of people who will try to tell you there is a definitive way to do it (especially if it's their way and they are selling a program to you).</p>
<p>But the reality is that there are so many factors that come into play and everyone is so different that there is a lot of trial and error to see what works best for everyone.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it basically comes down to:</p>
<p>1) pick up and put down heavy objects. Continue with increasingly heavier objects
2) consume food</p>
<p>And that's basically it. I think it was Greg nuckols who once said that in lifting, you very rarely get anywhere through application of analysis as a substitute for hard work. Which is not to say that analysis or study is worthless - nuckols himself writes a number of great articles on strengtheory.com - but more to emphasize that analysis paralysis is very real. I really hope /u/gnuckols doesn't kill me for putting words in his mouth (paraphrased words, at that). But I think the point still stands - get out there and lift. </p>
<p>For a beginner, I would highly recommend simply making sure your form is correct for not only safety reasons but so that you don't learn poor habits. Other than that, get out there and lift, man. Find what works for you and on your journey, start absorbing knowledge from others, but if you do, take it with a grain of salt and try to figure out if there is a reason what you are being told works actually works. There is a ton of anecdotal evidence in the industry that people preach as gospel. </p>
<p>Good luck and stay swole, my friend. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exercise physiologist here.</p>
<p>The exact mechanism for muscle growth (&quot;hypertrophy&quot;) is somewhat up for debate, but the general consensus is that when you lift high weight with low reps, this causes micro-tears in the muscular tissue that are repaired and adapted for the increased demand.</p>
<p>There are a few different types of muscle cells, and they each respond to exercise slightly differently. Some cells are better at strength and power, and others can exert force repeatedly over time. High weight and low reps works the first kind of cells harder, and medium-low weight with many reps works the latter harder.</p>
<p>I wrote a post in /r/science a few months back that goes into some detail you may like.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From multiple nutrition and fitness sources and books I have read. &quot;muscle toning&quot; is a myth.</p>
<p>To get &quot;toned&quot;you need to drop fat.</p>
<p>Muscles are pumped immediately following a workout due to inflammation and the things your body needs to repair muscle fiber flowing into your muscles. Basically working out injures your body and your muscles grow to adapt to this injury. That being said, to oversimplify the incredibly complex anatomy of your muscles. Again, oversimplification, you have 2 types of muscle fiber.</p>
<p>You have endurance muscle fiber. You build this muscle from high rep low weight exercise. The military loves this muscle. This muscle is great for marathons, ultramarathons, carrying 40 pounds of equipment for a 10 mile march. These guys are usually pretty small. They are not toned because of their muscles, they are toned because these endurance exercises use a lot of calories.</p>
<p>The other muscle fiber is your high strength, low endurance muscle. The IMPORTANT thing, is that THIS muscle fiber is the fiber that gets BIG. Body builders work these muscles much more because they get big. This muscle allows those weight lifters to bench 1000 lbs ONE TIME. It is what body builders show off.</p>
<p>Now a professional body builder will focus mostly on the 2nd type, but to get a more complete definition as well as keep from plateauing, will sometimes switch to working the 1st type.</p>
<p>So the question you need to ask yourself is why are you weight lifting? What are your goals? You wanting to run marathons? Yes marathon runners strength train. You wanting to bench 1000 lbs? You want to look like a body builder? Each goal has different methods to get their, but the important thing is if you are just starting out, you WILL be getting strength gains for a loooong time. So don't worry too much about the nitty gritty as long as you are continuously, if slowly, seeing muscle definition gains and increasing weight WHILE MAINTAINING FORM.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the more recent studies I have seen show that number or reps doesn't matter a huge amount for building muscle size.  The important thing is to reach high fatigue/failure for the muscle - not fatigue/failure of your cardiovascular system.  As others have said, this is normally in the 10ish reps range, but you could do more reps of a lighter weight if it was a highly isolated muscle movement, and less if it's a complex movement.  eg: doing sets of 20 curls is probably good, but doing sets of 20 squats or deadlifts will probably wear you out more than the specific muscles you're using.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
