		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>  <em>you're changing the primary direction of the cloth's major fibres in the same way vaccuuming a carpet changes its darkness in strips as you go back and forth.</em></p>
<p>The types of fabric like velour or velvet where this is the most apparent have small and short fibres that stand somewhat straight up. These act like millions of tiny springs so they feel soft when you touch them, and they create excellent insulation, so you often find them on baby blankets. </p>
<p>Now say the normal direction of those little fibres is straight &quot;up&quot; from the fabric base. When you run your hand along them in one direction, you're smoothing those fibres so they point flatter and along the direction of your vision. This flat surface &quot;bounces&quot; more of the light to your eye in the same way that looking at a lake's surface in the direction of a sunset bounces light toward you. But go the other direction and now the fibres are pointing in a way that you're looking sideways at them, or the light is hitting their tips rather than a flat part, so they absorb more of the light hitting them rather than reflecting it in your direction. And that makes them look darker.</p>
<p>This can be amplified if the natural fiber direction is normally bent a little downward in some direction rather than completely vertical. In that case, running your hand along that natural smooth direction makes it even smoother and more reflective, but going the other way REALLY roughens it up and allows for much less light to bounce away cleanly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>IIRC As the cloth are exposed to sunlight, the cloth fades. The fibers exposed to to sun more will be faded more. When you drag your finger along the cloth you are exposing fibers that were not as exposed to the sun, so their color is slightly different from the other parts.</p>
<p>Additionally, pushing the fibers also change the angle at which the cloth reflects light back, which can also influence the color we perceive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I have often observed that whet I sweep some pieces of cloth with my hand in a direction, it appears to be another color than if I sweep it in another direction. How does it do that ?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Vocabulary time: nap: The rough layer of projecting threads or fibres on the surface of a woollen or other textile fabric. Later also: a special pile given to cloth, esp. velvet, by artificially raising, cutting, and smoothing the short fibres.</p>
<p>Think about a short haired cat or dog. Their fur lies a certain way. Pet it that way, and they look smooth (and enjoy it). Pet them tail to head however, and their fur sticks up weird and they are mad. Their fur has a nap direction.</p>
<p>On a cloth, there is an underlying structure. For wovens (e.g. The pants in the video), the fibers are crossed over like a lattice fence. Now imagine if that fence were laying in the grass - the grass sticks up at a nearly perpendicular angle. Of course in a fabric, it's not grass but that actual woven fibers are either kinda hairy, or it's a special cloth with long parts. Other fabrics are knitted, like tshirts are knits. There are some velours that are knitted and have nap.</p>
<p>So with the cat analogy, we understand that the hairs sticking out can be brushed in different direction. With the fence analogy, we can see that the fence doesn't change regardless of which way we brush the grass. Now if the light source is really low, the grass will look bright on one side and dark if you're looking from the other side. That's pretty much why fibers look different depending on where the light is. The light bounces off the up fibers differently to the down fibers.</p>
<p>When velvet clothes are made, it is so the fibers stick out and trap more light (reflect less light). So a black velvet dress is as black as possible. Jewelry is displayed on black fabric for this reason - so the jewelry can scatter light and sparkle, and you don't get distracted by the background. In photography, black velvet is considered to be the hardest fabric of all to photograph. It's very hard to show the folds and details because the fibers trap all the light.</p>
<p>By the way the pants in the video are made of a &quot;brushed twill&quot;. Aside from velvet and velour, and fur, other things with brushsble nap include cut carpet (not the loopy kind), toweling, snake scales, feathers on a bird, and other fabrics like the new two toned sequinned fabric <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6UBjjZl6wY88GPJu/giphy.gif" target="_blank">see a gif</a>... <a href="https://youtu.be/mY9Ln8zHDBs" target="_blank">or a video</a>. In these sequinned fabrics, the sequin is made with one side that is one color, and the other side another color. Sequins are flat discs with a single hole like a record. The thread holding it down is loose enough that the sequin can be moved to show one side or the other. This is an extreme example - fibers in brushed fabric are all the same color, but behave differently en masse when brushed, because they were manufactured in a certain direction.</p>
