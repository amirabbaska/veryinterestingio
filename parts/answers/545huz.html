		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Batteries produce electricity through chemical reactions that are happening constantly, and produce a &quot;pressure&quot; called voltage. Once a battery reaches a specific voltage, the chemical reaction can't work against it as well and it just kind of hovers there (but it's still reacting, which is why new batteries can go bad).</p>
<p>When a battery is &quot;dead&quot;, the greater portion of the reacting chemicals have reacted and it can no longer produce the &quot;pressure&quot; at a rate that is usable, but it's still producing some. Since it's a weaker chemical reaction at this point, it can't push as hard, and the moment you try to use it, the voltage disappears; this is called a surface charge, because on the surface it has some charge, but it's not a real charge.</p>
<p>A good analogy is like when a can of hairspray is &quot;empty&quot;, but you can still get a few sprays out of it if you hold and shake it a little while longer.</p>
<p>EDIT: Or, a better analogy: If, as a kid, you ever mixed baking soda and vinegar in a soda bottle and put a balloon over it, how quickly it inflates the balloon is Current, and how big the balloon gets is Voltage. If you let some gas out, it can keep inflating as long as there are chemicals to react, but eventually most of it gets used up. If you leave it long enough when it's &quot;done&quot; you might still see the balloon inflate a bit, but not very much, and not very fast. This is your dead battery.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: Holy jeez, guys, thanks to the kind soul for the gold! I never expected that on my first real contribution!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two separate reactions that occur in the cell. One at each terminal. As you discharge the cell the reactants for each reaction get used up and the products are produced. Even though there may be enough reactants in the whole cell to continue the reaction, the concentration at the electrode might be too low to produce sufficient voltage to run your device. If you let the cell sit for a bit, the reactants can migrate through the electrolyte in the cell and the concentrations at the electrodes can be high enough for the reaction to start up again for a short time.</p>
<p>Edit: Apparently some folks are upset that this answer isn't the top comment as the one that is currently there is wrong. I guess I didn't use ELI5 language.  here is Bigbobby216's  analogy that should make any zombie loving five year old understand my answer.</p>
<p>OK, I'm posting this here in hopes that you will cut/paste it into your response: </p>
<p>So I guess I'll make an analogy too.  Comparing voltage to pressure is often done so I'll keep that.  Let's say that the pressure is created by a horde of zombies pushing against a fence though.  Now let's say we want to use up our zombies, so we electrify this fence which is (sort of) analogous to putting a load on your battery.  Now if you electrify it a little bit, the zombies directly against the fence will start to die slowly, but they'll still make some pressure and as they die one by one the zombies behind them can move them out of the way and continue making pressure.  Now if you electrify it a lot the zombies in the front die instantly so that they no longer make pressure.  They also make a limp squishy wall between the other zombies and the fence, through which the other zombies can't make their own pressure.  Now if you turn off the electricity the zombies up front will eventually get trampled down into mush and the zombies behind them will again be able to make pressure on the fence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For some types of battery chemistry if you discharge them at a high rate their available capacity drops.  As the battery chemistry tries to keep up with the required current the battery's internal resistance rises, which increases the voltage drop <em>inside</em> the battery until the output voltage is too low to usefully drive the load.  Stop drawing current,  let the internal chemistry recover to equilibrium through diffusion and then discharge at a lower current and you can extract more energy at a useful voltage.

<p>Proper eli5: if you make a lead acid battery sprint really hard it gets out of breath but not exhausted.  Give it a minute to rest and it can jog for a while more but not run as fast.  Eventually you get to walking pace before it can't continue any more and needs a recharge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The internal resistance of a battery goes up the closer that it gets to the end of its life, but only the voltage and the current of the battery can be measured by your device! The amount of energy that goes to your device is limited by the chemical resistance to the creation of the charge (electromotive force) required for that energy.</p>
<p>The &quot;Potential&quot; doesn't decrease, it is the <em>internal resistance</em> to the emf source that increases with battery usage.</p>
<pre><code>Imax = E/r</code></pre>
<p>Where Imax is the maximum possible current drawn from the battery, E is the emf or electromotive force of the battery and r is the internal resistance.</p>
<p>The only reason why the voltmeter works as a good measurement of voltage for a battery is because only a very small amount of current goes through the voltmeter due to the voltmeter's very high internal resistance. The battery's potential is only balanced by the force of static electric forces, NOT a something like the voltmeter in your device!</p>
<p>Analogy: If you owned a dam you could tell how much energy that could be produced by your dam by looking at the water level at the dam itself, but you wouldn't be able to predict the amount of snow that is going to melt to feed the reservoir in the coming season. Cold weather is the resistance to the force of the reservoir, but isn't measurable in the moment so the amount of available water is used instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
