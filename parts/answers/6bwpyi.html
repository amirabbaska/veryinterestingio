		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, the earth is still cooling from formation, specifically heat generated by accretion and differentiation. A lot of the heat is actually due to radioactive decay of things like thorium-232, uranium-238, and potassium-40. A good discussion of the topic can be read over at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_internal_heat_budget" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. </p>
<p>One thing to correct however: The earth's mantle is <strong>not</strong> liquid. The outer core is liquid, but that's it. The mantle is solid, but warm enough to undergo ductile flow at a very slow rate. Again, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_the_Earth" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> has a good discussion of the topic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This problem was famously studied by Lord Kelvin: he considered the Earth as formed as a molten ball of rock and then computed the time needed for it to cool down to present temperature, as an estimation for the age of the planet.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/roots-of-unity/lord-kelvin-age-of-the-eart/" target="_blank">He found that Earth was about 20–40 <strong>m</strong>illion years old</a>.</p>
<p>Of course we know (and actually had known before Kelvin's computations) that the actual age of the Earth is much, much larger than that (even though we did not know the 4.5 <strong>b</strong>illion figure, geologists and biologists had a correct rough idea of the order of magnitude).</p>
<p>What Kelvin missed, as /u/ouemt points out, is radioactivity — which was discovered only a few years <em>after</em> he made his computations (and which, interestingly enough, is also one of the bases for our current estimate of 4.5 billion years). This does not make his computations any less impressive, because they show exactly how large the part of radioactivity is in maintaining Earth's temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mantle isn't liquid. It has fluid behaviour over very long periods of time because of gaps at the atomic scale that are empty then get filled by the following atom or group of atoms. This causes a kind of convection flow that you might see in other systems that makes it seem like a liquid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some people have pointed out that the Sun will engulf the Earth before the core can cool down.  I'd like to know:</p>
<p>Assuming that we get on this problem fast enough and use whatever technology to start edging the Earth away from the Sun to keep it from being engulfed, how long would the core take to cool down to the point that it no longer supports geological activity?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The liquid mantle will never solidify because it is being pushed and pulled constantly by the gravitational forces. People don't realize how strong gravity is.</p>
<p>The tides are caused by gravity, the pull of the moon is moving gazillions of trillions of gallons of water. Just imagine how much force that takes to push that much water.</p>
<p>Those same forces that cause the tides are also pulling on those tectonic plates and on the Earth's core keeping it melted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
