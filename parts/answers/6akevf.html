		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tattoo artist here.  Tattoo ink isn't actually &quot;ink&quot;, it's pigment in a carrier (usually sterilized water and alcohol), which means that when it goes into the skin, it's staining the skin at a depth where the skin heals (anything above that dies and falls off during the scabbing process).  Have you ever stained white fabric black?  Now try staining that black with a lighter colour... doesn't really work.  Mostly because the darker colour will still show up through the lighter colour. </p>
<p><em>Edit</em>scabbing, not scanning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of a tattoo being similar to painting watercolors on paper.  Your skin absorbs the ink, like the paper absorbs the watercolors.  You may be able to put a darker color over a tattoo it to obscure what came before, but a lighter color would either do nothing or just deepen the dark color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tattoos aren't like paint where you can just put a coat of something new over the top. Instead you are injecting ink into a layer of skin which already contains ink; you can add more ink alongside the existing ink but if you put skin-colored ink there then it would just be beside the dark ink from before.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just to be pragmatic, even if this was possible, your skin doesn't stay one color all the time.  even if you color matched the skin tone perfectly at the time of the tattoo, even moderate sun exposure would likely result in changes to the overall skin color resulting in an area of discoloration.  That's not really considered an attractive trait in skin.  Basically you'd be giving yourself what would look like a big birth mark most of the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ooh, something I can contribute to as the recipient of a &quot;skin colored&quot; tattoo. I got one to cover up a deep red/purple birthmark on my face. The tattoo artist used a very light pigment to offset or lighten the birthmark to a less noticeable hue. While not as successful as I hoped, the result is better than it was. As I understand it, the other posters are correct in that the best you can hope for is a slightly less than perfect match when tattooing to match skin tone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
