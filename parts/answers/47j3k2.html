		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birds have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_vision#Anatomy_of_the_eye" target="_blank"><em>limited</em> eye movement</a>, primarily because their eyes are quite large relative to the size of their skulls. To compensate, birds have quite mobile head/neck regions (think of an owl's ability to turn its head upside down or swivel its head nearly 360 degrees). </p>
<p>The other extant group of animals related to dinosaurs are crocodilians (crocs + dinos[birds are a clade within dinos] = <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archosaur" target="_blank">archosauria</a>). Crocodilians like alligators <em>can</em> move their eyes around, so we can hypothesize that dinosaurs (at least non-therapod dinosaurs) were likely to have had eye movement as well.</p>
<p>But birds are not just flying therapods--they are really quite derived relative to their ancestors. Birds have much larger relative brain size than most therapods, something we can verify by checking out the fossil imprints of their brains in the form of <a href="http://www.livescience.com/41185-what-a-dinosaur-brain-looked-like.html" target="_blank">endocasts</a>. </p>
<p>So:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crocs are basal to dinosaurs-- CAN move eyes. We can reasonably hypothesize that the basal condition for dinosaurs was 'capable of eye movement.'</li>
<li>Birds are descendants of <em>therapod</em> dinosaurs--limited eye movement.</li>
<li>BUT Birds have larger brain size relative to body size, so a working hypothesis is that this increase in brain size reduced eye movement. </li>
<li>If the hypothesis is true, then therapod dinosaurs likely had similar eye movements as other dinos, which we hypothesized were at least as mobile as crocs.</li>
</ul>
<p>*should be  theropod, not therapod. My shame is great.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Raptors wouldn't have walked like chickens do now simply because the tail would give them a completely different center of balance.</p>
<p>An experiment was actually done where chickens were raised with artificial elongated tails. You can see that the stride is longer and the leg motion is different. </p>
