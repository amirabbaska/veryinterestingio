		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair does not know how long they have to grow. </p>
<p>But they have a finite lifetime. After that they stop growing and they fall out. Also new hair is allways growing. The equilibrium is the terminal length where you think hair is no longer growing.</p>
<p>Bodyhair has a much lower liftetime than head hair, thats why eyebrowns are shorter.</p>
<p>If you don't cut your hair it will also reach a terminal length and it will look like its not growing anymore.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hair length is predetermined and follows a schedule called active and regressive phases. Your body will continually grow hair during the active phase and when it turns regressive, it stops and falls out, not allowing the hair to grow any further. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, why do hairs in our eyebrows, specifically men, get waaaaaay long and gross and creepy, when they get old? They aren't that long as juveniles or adults? But as soon as you get pensionable.... boom scary eyebrows.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on the hair location (sort of what type of follicle it is). Hairs grow in three stages: anagen, catagen and telogen. First, hair cells grow and divide in the anagen phase, where the hair follicle itself begins to enlarge and grow deeper into the scalp or skin and comes in contact with nutrient supply. Head hair naturally remains in the anagen phase for an extended period of time, up to several years, and this is where it's location dependent. Hair on your arms, however, will move on to the catagen phase in a matter of weeks. This is when the hair stops growing and transitions to the dormant telogen phase. Telogen phase is where the hair stops lengthening, the bulb becomes more detached, and eventually falls out naturally through shedding or external trauma such as pulling. As hair follicles will have different lifespans in different areas of the body - dependent locally on certain hormone signaling and protein expression - and will grow at different rates/remain dormant for different amounts of time/fall out at different rates. Hope this is helpful.  :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body hair is subject to abrasions, especially your limbs, more so when compared to your eyebrows and the hair on your head. That is why the hair on your body is more thin at the ends compared to the root, contributing to its shorter length along with the different hair types(why people think shaving makes hair grow back thicker). To expand on what others are saying about the different types of hair, humans have three types of hair: languo, vellus, and terminal (which, after puberty,  can be subdivided into axillary hair). Languo is a little thicker than peach fuzz that all babies have, vellus is your normal peach fuzz, terminal hair is your thicker body hair (head, body, and pubes), and axillary(google will tell you it is body hair, sorta correct because it is a terminal hair, but it’s different) is your armpit and pubes. Axillary is different than normal terminal hair because all hair is very sensitive to testosterone, so it’s a bit different in the growth cycle.  Testosterone regulates hair growth by affecting the follicle and how it can produce the different types of hair. These follicle changes affect the growth phases of hair, producing different reactions. The result is changes in hair growth, or lack thereof, occurring over time, as the growth cycle of hair can take as long as 7 years to complete. What has baffled researchers for decades is how can a hormone like androgen cause some hair’s growth to be inhibited in one area of the body, while helping it in others? This paradox appears to be gene related. That is why men are more “hairy” than women, due to their much higher testosterone excretion. </p>
<p>Now that we have the hair types down, let’s expand on the growth cycle. 3 phases: anagen, catagen, and telogen. Anagen is the growth phase where 80-85 percent of hair spends during the growth cycle. Catagen is the transition phase, and telogen is when the hair is dead and called a “club hair” and can easily fall out. How long your hair is depends on how long is spends in the anagen phase. The hairs on your arms or legs differ in the anagen phase than the hairs on your head, which is why your arm hair doesn’t grow 10 inches long without trimming.  Everyone has differing lengths of the anagen period for a given body part compared to other people.  For the hair on your head, the average length of the anagen phase is about 2-7 years.  For your arms, legs, eyebrows, etc., this phase normally lasts just 30-45 days.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
