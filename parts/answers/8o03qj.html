		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Enough people have given the answer of 'we don't know really' which is mostly true. However, I'd also like to point out the time bias in the question; colder climate domination is only the case <em>now</em>.</p>
<p>A thousand years ago the centres of civilization were the Arabic, Mesoamerican and Chinese worlds. A thousand years before that the Roman Mediterranean (and probably the Chinese). A thousand years before that Egypt and India had the important civilizations etc etc.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's really no one answer here, and far from any consistently agreed upon &quot;main cause&quot;.</p>
<p>But I'll try to summarise/begin a few of the proposed ones I know so you can research them later and/or someone will comment with better explanations, probably reading way too deeply into whatever they think my opinion is and being angry about it (I'm going to try to keep my opinion out and list each proposition from its own viewpoint)</p>
<p>So one is that there's no real direct causality between Lattitude and economic development, but rather that colonialism forced those countries into an economic system and them kind of screwed them over in it, so when colonialism ended they started off poor. Examples commonly sighted are the European colonies in Africa where they taxed locals, but the locals didn't have money so they had to work in farms and mines the Europeans set up to make money to pay the taxes. Essentially forcing the locals to work for them.</p>
<p>Another is that the environment, particularly the weather, affects the culture and thus everything else. The northern countries have to deal with winter, which is a fairly regular issue. To the east China and Japan have monsoon season even in the more southern parts where winter isn't as big of an issue. This imposes a sense of regularity and a need for planning that a more temperate climate with year round hunting and plant harvesting doesn't. The theory goes on to state that this regularity and planning propogates into all areas of life, which ultimately causes a difference in cultural views about money. A common example here is Egypt, which has defined it's seasons by the Nile River, since the weather was relatively uniform year round. They had 3 seasons based on the flooding of the Nile which was very regular. This led to a very structured culture and a cyclical pattern in many of their myths as we know them.</p>
<p>Another which I don't know much about states that colder winters select for a different type of thinking, some say &quot;smarter&quot; but I see that as a subset of this larger theory. So this selection for a particular type of thinking would be better suited to economics and the like.</p>
<p>A fourth states that it's, again, a cultural difference, but with a different cause. The &quot;ancient world&quot; of Europe and China more or less founded the modern idea of money, or at least a precursor to it. Not just in &quot;I have 3 coins, I can buy this thing&quot;, because that has been shown to have developed all over the world, but many of the surrounding ideas. Lending someone money, enforcing the integrity of a currency, banks, etc. This way of thinking about money turns out to be rather good at long distance trade and long term investment. Who knew an economic system shaped by the need for those two things would be good at doing those? So as the 'world' expanded, particularly with colonialism setting up countries with that idea if money in their heads from the start, that style of money would become the world standard for trade. This meant that countries with other systems (like the Rai stones of Yap which depend on a shared oral history rather than physical possession) would have to adapt to this big, 'standard' system. Doing so for most countries would mean changing over their entire internal system as well, pushing everyone down to the bottom as they don't know the system as well as others and don't have the history and momentum that gives a starting value.</p>
<p>Yet another states that different climates support different sorts of technological advances. For example European metal working was far beyond any equivalent during the 'dark ages', while we're finding more and more evidence that people in the south if Africa had medical knowledge far beyond any contemporary cultures. These differences are the root of it. If I know something and I teach it to you, I still know it. Now we both know it. But if I make something and give it to you, I don't have it anymore. So I have a greater need for compensation in order to prosper. It also needs a more transferrable form of currency. This goes through some complicated explanations I don't fully understand and ends up with a difference in perception of value, which is then a claimed cause for why such nations aren't more economically developed right now.</p>
<p>There's a lot of others, but those are the ones I know enough to give an attempt at explaining. I personally think it's a combination of a lot of factors, but 2 large ones being the sudden shift to a new system and foreign exploitation.</p>
<p>We can see that countries that already had an economic system compatible with the one we now use near globally have a better starting place when this system is force upon them. Rather than starting with, say, a barter system and now needing to figure out currency (and starting with none) they have to figure out the exchange (already having currency the colonials will accept as a currency, even if their willingness to use it varied a lot), and then adapt to the new system and whatever the colonials are doing.</p>
<p>The second, colonial exploitation, refers to the locals inability to profit off its local resources. Europeans set up diamond and silver mines in Africa, but all the money from it got shipped back to Europe. The locals didn't profit from it, they just got forced into the bottom of a new heirachy and kept poor for a while. Only really being able to begin improving after the best resources were apparently depleted (some may know that some of the most valuable resources on the planet are currently being mined in Africa, although saying it's necessarily a better system today is debatable when you look at some examples), and the colonials leaving often made a mess of things too. Whether that was the colonials fault or not varies, but is still largely debatable.</p>
<p>Would it have been right for them to refuse to immediately pull out of some of the countries they did so too? Which they did because they were asked/told to, even though it almost invariably led to economic a structural collapse. What about when the native is Papua New Guinea destroyed what would have been the most profitable sugar cane industry in the world because the colonials had built it? I can't and won't say, but the effects these things have had are undeniable</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So first you need to understand that you’re asking a question about international macroeconomics and development. These are subjects that economists do not understand particularly well. Development economics is a field where a lot of smart people do a lot of good work, but it’s also a field where it’s basically impossible to prove anything. </p>
<p>One theory is the impact of climate on capital depreciation. If hurricanes or whatever are a regular problem, then buildings and roads are not going to last very long. The problem with this theory is that economists are not engineers or climate scientists, and it’s very difficult to measure levels of capital (which is a requirement for good studies). </p>
<p>Another theory is tropical diseases. If you take as a starting position that Europe is good and civilized and that Europeans make things develop, then you can compare countries where European colonists mostly died out, countries where European colonists took stuff but didn’t settle, and countries where Europeans successfully settled. There’s a not horrible correlation for this theory, but it’s basically impossible to prove. </p>
<p>A related theory is “institutions,” in that poor countries are poor because they don’t have good “institutions”. Basically impossible to prove, disprove, or even really measure. </p>
<p>Another theory is that the international trade and monetary systems are bad for development. There are economists who have strong views that this isn’t true; however this is a theoretical argument and not an empirical argument.</p>
<p>Basically, economists do not know.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are dozens of theories and none of them are definitive or well supported. The eli5 is that no one really knows for sure but im sure that isnt satisfactory. Underdevelopment was my area of focus for undergrad. One theory I subscribe to at least partially is the Dutch curse, or the paradox of plenty, essentially starting at colonialism (how colonialism was possible is so complex its an entirely different subject.) countries rich in resources, especially tropical places able to grow sugar, were colonized and enslaved. This process, prevented the accumulation of wealth and made those areas poor despite an abundance of resources. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
