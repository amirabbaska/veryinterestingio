		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Kids are wired to eat the stuff that used to be most important to surviving: high-calorie stuff, fatty stuff, etc. They're also more sensitive to bitterness than adults are (bitterness, evolutionary, tends to mean &quot;bad for you&quot;). So when you put a kid in front of a slice of pizza and a brussel sprout, the kid's naturally going to prefer the slice of pizza.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have some VERY strong opinions about this topic...</p>
<p>My kids have always eaten whatever we give them. It was never an option for them to be fussy or picky. We have never forced them to eat anything, ever, and if they didn't want to eat something we served, that was and is okay. However, they didn't get something else instead. </p>
<p>When parents give kids a new food and say 'Here, <em>try</em> this', the child gets the message that they might not like it or want to eat it. When parents say 'Just take a bite', the child gets the message that it is an option for them to reject the food. Even the expression on mom or dad's face, looking anxious or even hopeful, tells the kid that this food might be weird. </p>
<p>When our kids (now 12 and 13) were babies, we fed them a wide variety of foods and they only outright rejected a couple of things. We would not make any issue over it at all, but just put that food aside for a week or a month, and would then try again. Some things still got rejected, so we did the same thing - don't offer it again for a while, and try it again later, always trying to make mealtime as pleasant and calm as possible. When they were old enough to feed themselves, we filled their and our plates with the same food (in age-appropriate amounts), sat down, began eating, and they would as well. Eventually they ate whatever they were given, and still do for the most part. </p>
<p>Everyone has preferences and dislikes, and that's okay. But the thing I noticed is that there are cultures that eat things that other cultures might find weird or even gross. Chinese breakfasts often consist of a bit of fish, some vegetables, and other savory things which American kids would find unpalatable, in favor of sugary cereal or pancakes. Latin and Asian cuisines can be quite spicy and kids in those cultures seem to relish those flavors, where perhaps Scandinavian or British folks, for example, might be amazed at that level of heat. So it seemed to me like it's a matter of what is presented as 'normal' by the parents.</p>
<p>I also think the kind of snacks kids eat between meals will greatly affect what they are interested in eating at mealtime. Calorie dense, high fat or high sugar things, and mini-meals have not been available between meals for our kids. I love to cook and work hard on balanced, nutritious meals, so I want to make sure everyone is hungry when it's time to eat. So snacks at our house have always been things like fresh fruit, veggies, yogurt, a few whole-grain crackers, a handful of nuts, and stuff like that. My feeling is that a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is the main part of a meal, not a snack. They can have all they want of the snacky things, (because no kid should be made to go truly hungry), but they can't mindlessly eat chips at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, because then of course they aren't going to want much at dinner. </p>
<p>Of course this is all just my humble opinion. I don't judge the parents of the kids who bring a bag of Doritos and a Coke to school for breakfast because parenting is ridiculously hard. If your kid is fed and dressed and still alive every day, God bless you because you're doing alright in my book. But I've struggled with weight and eating all my life, and I <em>really</em> want to give my kids every chance to possibly not have that struggle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everybody else is pointing out the biological reasons, the reasons that keep kids from eating nasty alkaloid 'berries' or other things that might harm them. This is critical, without this behavior many - most? - kids would have poisoned themselves at some point. Avoiding bitter foods is a very good survival trait for young kids.</p>
<p>But there are additional reasons. After you give them something they <em>do</em> like, they are going to want that every time... if they want icecream but got peas, they won't eat the peas <em>even if they love eating peas</em>. Below a certain age they generally can't communicate that other than by refusing to eat or by pushing the food away from them, so the message parents take away is &quot;she is a fussy eater, she doesn't like peas&quot;. When it happens again with another food, they aren't surprised because they already know that the kid is a &quot;fussy&quot; eater.</p>
<p>Which means there are cultural facets, too. In many cultures you eat what you are given, even as a toddler. Different expectations, different behavior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People tend to like what is familiar. This is just as true for art as it is for food. The people who hated van Gogh's paintings in 1885 weren't uncultured, they just found his work unfamiliar. Children aren't fussy eaters, they are just drawn to familiar tastes. They start with milk and formula and work out from there. Commercial baby foods are also pretty bland and very soft. If children are going to eat a more varied diet, there are two keys to pulling it off: 1) start them young. As soon as they eat solid food have them try everything. 2) Don't force them. If they really hate asparagus, getting angry and forcing them to eat 7 stalks will reinforce it. Instead, have them eat 3 bites... enough so they remember the taste next time (remember, familiar is good), but not so much that the memory is a bad one. By the 3rd or 4th time they try it, they may find they like it. </p>
<p>This has worked amazingly well for our children. They'll eat everything except even mildly spicy foods and eggplant. Heavily garliced foods, brussels sprouts, broccoli, okra, lamb, etc... no problem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think it has to be that way.</p>
<p>1 Kids have very little power and will use  what power they are given in strange ways.  Often after a long day, parent(s) and kids are tired it was just easier to not fight and make a second dinner (do not do this it is a trap!).  They will notice this pattern and exploit it as it a small level of control.</p>
<p>2 If you kid(s) doesn't want to eat what I made the can sit quiet until we are done or if not quiet the in time out. When they tell me they are hungry just before bed I pull out the plate they turned down earlier for them to eat.</p>
<p>3 exposure give them lot of types of foods to eat when going out. But let them pick between two <strong>new</strong> items.  They get the power of choice and have to try new things.</p>
<p>4 let them help you cook, they will be more likely to eat if they helped make it.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
