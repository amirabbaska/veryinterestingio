		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably because you're english and American... I'm from Ontario and I speak both French and English. I went to Montreal once and decided to speak English and they were total assholes. Went back the next day speaking French and BAM I won their love. Also they hate Canadians... they don't sell Molson Canadian and everywhere in Canada they have a cigarette brand called &quot; Canadian classics&quot; but meanwhile in Quebec there called &quot; Quebec classic&quot;.... I tried getting the Canadians kind and she corrected me rudely.. never go to Quebec. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cultural variances. Being nice and being polite aren't the same thing. Some cultures value being polite (abiding by perceived social norms to avoid conflict), some value being honest even if it is abrasive and &quot;not nice&quot;. </p>
<p>A polite person won't tell you you're being an idiot to your face. A nice person will help you avoid looking like an idiot in future interactions with other people. Polite people may talk about you behind your back to their friends and the greater community saying you're an idiot even if they tolerate you on the surface. That's where the insidious aspect of being &quot;polite&quot; comes into play. Just because someone is polite doesn't mean they like you. People confuse being &quot;polite&quot; and being &quot;nice&quot;.</p>
<p>There are some cultures where if you do something that makes you stand out, people will tell you about it bluntly. That's considered &quot;not nice&quot; but in many ways people learn from the experience faster than cultures that promote social cohesion (nice) over corrective communication. To each his own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To be fair most of Canada thinks people from Montreal (and other parts of Quebec) are dicks.  </p>
<p>Now... the fact that the homeless guy was rude to you when he found out you were from the USA may have more to do with the fact that you are from the USA than the fact that he is in Canada.  Some people don't agree with American policy world wide.  Some people don't like American arrogance (my husband is American and he can be very arrogant at times).</p>
<p>Generally speaking though, Canadians are more chill than Americans, and tend to be more polite (which is akin to being nice).  Canadians tend to hold doors open for others (although to be fair this is not as common as it used to be) and to apologize to others even for the slightest of wrong doings.  </p>
<p>I am in my 50's and will say that over all Canadians now are less nice than they used to be but I attribute that to the general growing population, and more stress.</p>
<p>Small town Canadians are still super friendly and nice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Travel the world, then go to Canada.
You'll understand immediately.</p>
<p>People wait in line for the bus when it's freezing outside. The streets are clean. People are respectful and polite.</p>
<p>I suppose they have a culture of respect that permeates enough of society to become a stereotype.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's a stereotype from TV and movies. There's good and bad from any country. Most folks from rural or suburban areas of BC have been very friendly but the bulk of people from Vancouver city limits I've encountered over the years were vain and rude. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
