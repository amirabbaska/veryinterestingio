		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: US plugs were originally meant for the &quot;nose&quot; (ground) to face up to make it harder for things to short across the terminals of the neutral and hot.   We flipped them over because the &quot;face&quot; looked more pleasing but it also means they'll catch any thing on the terminals if the plug is even slightly out.</p>
<p>Tinsel, for example, still catches houses on fire at an alarming rate, and these days it's just metalized plastic.</p>
<p>The rest of the world wised up and not only codified their grounds high, but also insulate the back half of their live plug pins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know 1 function of the holes on the plug (male) is for lockout/tag-out. The idea being if a appliance is broken you can put a tag on the plug stating it is defective and not to use it until it is repaired. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>UK here... one thing I’ve wondered, what happens when/if you plug in the wrong way round? Doesn’t always seem to be any safety to stop destroying all your electrics constantly. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
