		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I realize people have already answered your question, but there is so much more to this that is fucking astounding.</p>
<p>The primary problem with terrestrial mollusks (snails, slugs, the people that work at the DMV, etc.) is water loss. Most of them get by through a mucus barrier on their skin and living in moist places. One thing many people don't recognize is the operculum. Your everyday garden variety snails don't have one since it has been lost, but most snails do have one. It's a tough protein flap attached to their back similar to a fingernail that they can use to close and seal their shell. When they do that, they can minimize the amount of water they lose. Snails without it generally make a mucus plug at the end of their shell during the day.</p>
<p>Another cool trick they use is aestivation (<del>aestus: summer or maybe fire...?</del> aestas I've been told is summer). Many snails have the ability to &quot;hibernate&quot;, but not in response to winter. In that state they can survive without food or water for very long periods of time. Many can go two or three months with nothing, some such as my <em>Pomacea</em> can go ten months with nothing, and then there is <em>Pila</em> in which you'll find one of my favorite anecdotal species.</p>
<p>A species of <em>Pila</em> was being studied for its aestivation time. After 563 days (1.5 years) the research was concluded, not because a time had been established, but because less than 20% of the sample size had terminated aestivation and the researchers lost patience. They gave up.</p>
<p>EDIT: Sorry I haven't been able to reply to you all. I've been at work all day and limited to mobile. Some of you have great questions that I want to be able to answer in detail (with video where I can) so I'll get back to you when I get back home.</p>
<p>EDIT 2: I'm back home and getting to as many of you as I can.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am currently breeding cornu aspersum/helix aspersa snails a.k.a. garden snails. They are very neat and interesting animals. When mating, one or both of them will sometimes attempt to impale its partner with what's known as a love dart. They have horrible eyesight though so often they end up missing. They only began forming a love dart <em>after</em> their first mating experience. Of course, being hermaphroditic, they don't require another snail to mate, but will rarely reproduce asexually. When the environment is not generally moist, snails will remain in dark places hanging upside down to retain the moisture they do have better. When it rains, they unlatch from their location and move around, forage, etc. They can also dig by eating the dirt or other material underneath them. This is how they lay their eggs as well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>depends on the snail species, the typical garden snail hides under leaf litter in the day time or summer. They come out when it's cool and moist because it's easier for them to move around, and the moisture ensures they won't dry out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>as long as we are in this frame of mind.</p>
<p>i stopped in Guadalajara for a connecting flight and the plane boards and deboards on the runway.  there was a cloud of mosquitos on the plane... it was so thick with mosquito bodies in the airplane.  was thinking it was gonna be a long 5 hour flight everyone swatting non stop.   but once the plane took off and reached altitude, they all disappeared.   where did they go?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
