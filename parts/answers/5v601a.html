		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To some extend a microwave can kill bacteria, but not all bacteria can be considered equal in terms of conditions required to inactivate or kill them. As you might understand there are many factors in play to consider such as the material, thickness of the material and the type of bacteria so it's not possible to give you a generalised answer that will apply to everything you stick in the microwave.</p>
<p>Perhaps you've heard of this tip before. Stick a sponge in a microwave to disinfect the sponge. Going by this example the following has been found. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/27/health/27real.html" target="_blank">NYTimes - The Claim: You Can Disinfect a Kitchen Sponge in the Microwave (2007)</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In recent years, at least two studies have put the claim to the test, and both have confirmed it. The most recent, published in the December 2006 issue of The Journal of Environmental Health, found that microwaving kitchen sponges and other scrubbing pads for one to two minutes at full power could reduce levels of bacteria, including E. coli and other common causes of food-borne illness, by more than 99 percent.</p>
<p>A previous study in 1999 found that many bacteria are eliminated within the first 15 seconds of being heated by microwave, and that only E. coli survive longer than 30 seconds.</p>
<p>To avoid fires or overheating, the authors of the 2006 study recommended that only damp sponges and those without metal be zapped. But some experts say the practice poses a safety hazard and should be discouraged. Some news accounts have described cases in which kitchen sponges caught fire while being cooked by microwave.</p>
<p>Other studies have found a safer alternative: soaking soiled sponges in diluted solutions of bleach, which is just as effective as heating. Then again, there is an even simpler option: tossing the sponge out and getting a new one.</p>

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Professor Gabriel Bitton, a expert in environmental engineering at the University of Florida, and colleagues contaminated kitchen sponges and plastic scrubbing pads in dirty water which contained faecal bacteria, viruses, protozoan parasites and bacterial spores.</p>
<p>After two minutes on full power, 99% of bacteria were inactivated. And E. coli bacteria were killed after just 30 seconds. Bacillus cereus spores - which are largely associated with vegetables or foods in contact with soil and are normally quite resistant to radiation, heat and toxic chemicals - were completely eradicated after four minutes in the microwave.</p>
<p>Professor Britton said it was likely to be heat, rather than radiation, that proved fatal <del>as microwaves worked by exciting water molecules.</del></p>
<p>The team also looked at whether the microwave oven could be used to sterilise contaminated syringes. It was found to be an effective method but took far longer - up to 12 minutes for the Bacillus cereus spores.</p>
<p>Professor Hugh Pennington, a food safety expert at the University of Aberdeen said heating was an effective way of sterilising kitchen equipment.</p>
<p>He said heat was an obvious method of sterilisation.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Useful Definitions</p>
<p>Disinfect: To kill all pathogens but not all microorganisms</p>
<p>Decontaminate: To make something safe for use by the general public</p>
<p>Sterilize: To kill all life, including viruses</p>
<p>Microwaves, do not kill cells by altering cellular structures, they just kill cells by heat. So it can kill cells to an extent, and can decontaminate if you let the microwave run long enough to get the food or whatever being heated to a high enough temperature. However, it does not necessarily disinfect. Food is always and only decontaminated. I've never heard of any industry or company disinfecting food, not sure it would be safe for consumption.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, even boiling cannot sterilize. You must use either incineration or a combination of pressure and heat, in order to increase the temperature of water past 100 degrees Celsius to kill all life. </p>
<p>Extra knowledge, endospores are an extremely heat resistant form bacteria can create, and they can outlive all other forms of vegetative bacteria. These are usually the hardest to get rid of when sterilizing something, unless there is extremely heat resistant Archae present in your food, highly unlikely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in a sterile compounding IV room, and I can't help but chuckle when people think they've &quot;sterilized&quot; or &quot;disinfected&quot; something. In order to enter an IV compounding room, you must cover hair, shoes, beards, and face up to your nose, wash up to your elbows for 30+ seconds, dry with a low-lint paper towel drying elbow to hand elbow to hand, elbow to hand, put on a low-linting garment, and then apply alcohol-based sanitizer to your hands for 30 seconds or until dry. Then you must put on sterile gloves. That means not the gloves in the boxes. These come like band-aids are packaged and you must put them on without ever touching the outside of the glove with your bare hand or the inside of one glove to the outside of the other. Then you must spray these gloves with 70% <em>sterile</em> alcohol. (Yes. 70% isopropyl alcohol is not sterile by default). You are now ready to begin compounding. Because you shed about 600K particles per hour of filthy skin cells, you're basically the highest risk item and must constantly redisinfect. You must work in a space that delivers HEPA filtered air in one direction so that no microbes land in the exposed sites like needles and vial membranes -- which must be wiped three times in one direction before you use them because those are not sterile either. </p>
<p>Bacteria can survive outer space. They can survive 70% alcohol. They can survive radiation. They can survive just about anything. Unless there was some type of harmful bacteria in the food that was pathological, you probably don't have to worry about it because unless you perform the procedure above at all times, your food and house and you are crawling with bacteria at all times, especially since you have more bacteria cells than human cells. So it's all kind of  irrelevant. Wash with hot water and soap or a high-temperature dishwasher and that should be adequate for a dish you're using to eat.</p>
<p>Microwaves work by heating water. They're not as good at heating other things. Furthermore, it needs to be pressurized to sterilize bacteria because the temperature to kill everything but prions is 250ºF or 121ºC for ≥15 minutes. Bleaching the sponge or immersing in rubbing alcohol would work better. (Particularly in sequence).</p>
<p>TL;DR, it's the heat and pressure, unfortunately, your microwave is unable to generate it such that anything can be even remotely called disinfected. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes and no.</p>
<p>Yes, microwave ovens are being used to sterilize baby bottles but inside a plastic steam sterilizer box.</p>
<p>Yes, you can heat foods above 100 degree C for 10 mins, the bacteria will die as much as traditional method.</p>
<p>But no, microwave oven won't disinfect by just turning it on. If the food is dry, it won't get heated up and bacteria won't die. If microwave when it's empty, you're not going to kill anything. You still have to clean your microwave oven.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oddly enough, I think it's a both yes and no answer. </p>
<p>Yes, the heat generated from microwaves DOES kill most bacteria. Provided that the heat is high enough and for long enough periods. </p>
<p>This includes the heat that is generated by the microwave bouncing off the moisture within the bacteria. </p>
<p>Now...the real question might be, if you kept the pathogen cool, or if the pathogen did not contain any moisture, would the microwave kill it? </p>
<p>I think the answer is no - it would not kill it. Hence the reason why bacteria still survives in a microwave oven even after prolonged exposure, simply because the bacteria is kept cool or kept from heating up to a degree that would kill it. </p>
<p>Therefore microwaves themselves most likely do not kill pathogens. </p>
<p>Anyone?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
