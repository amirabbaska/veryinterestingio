When you mix all primary pigments, you get black because they are filtering out all colors of light. When you mix light, you are adding lights to each other. When you mix all the primary light colors, you get white. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ELI5: Let's say you want to create a sculpture. Mixing paint is like starting out with a big chunk of rock, and having to remove some rock to reveal a figure inside of it. Mixing light is like starting out with an empty table, and having to add clay to get the figure you want. Paint is like removing chunks of rock, while colored light is like adding chunks of clay. To our eyes, both seem like just simple colors, but in reality the two work in opposite ways: one removes color, the other adds color.</p>
<hr />
<p>There are two mistakes in your assumption. In paint, you mix Cyan (not Blue) and Yellow to get Green. When mixing light, you combine Red (not Blue) and Green to get Yellow.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.infinity-printing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/AdditiveVSSubtractive.jpg" target="_blank">These are the rules</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>White = Red + Green + Blue  </li>
<li>Red + Green = Yellow  </li>
<li>Red + Blue = Magenta  </li>
<li>Blue + Green = Cyan  </li>
<li>opposite of Red = Cyan  </li>
<li>opposite of Green = Magenta  </li>
<li>opposite of Blue = Yellow  </li>
</ul>
<p>When we say we're &quot;mixing paints&quot;, we <em>start out</em> with white paper so we already have all the colors there before we even do anything. Therefore, you must <em>remove</em> colors to get other colors. Paints act like filters as they remove colors. When you mix Yellow and Cyan, you are not actually mixing two colors, but you're really <em>removing</em> two colors. Yellow paint removes Blue, Cyan paint removes Red, which leaves you with the only color left: Green. Remember, White = Red + Green + Blue, therefore White - Blue - Red = Green.</p>
<p>When we say we're &quot;mixing light&quot;, we <em>start out with darkness</em>. This means you have to <em>add colors together</em> to get anything. So you simply add whatever colors you want. You get Yellow when you mix Red and Green light, Magenta when you mix Red and Blue, and Cyan when you mix Blue and Green. And of course White when you mix Red, Green and Blue.</p>
<p>Computer screens mix light because when you turn them off, they're black. So they start out black and therefore can't remove color because there is nothing to remove. Printer ink and paint must remove color because they start out with white paper and already contain all colors, so they must remove some colors to &quot;gain&quot; other colors.</p>
<p>There aren't really two models for mixing colors. The confusion comes from the expression &quot;mixing colors&quot; that is equally used for both light and paint. When mixing paint, we're not mixing colors, we're actually subtracting colors, because paint acts like a filter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Okay so let's talk about paint and how it makes colors.</p>
<p>First of all, you've been taught colors wrong in art class. The primary colors for paint (aka the primary subtractive colors) are Cyan, Yellow, and Magenta. Not Blue, Yellow and Red. BYR is just a more normal and &quot;natural&quot; set of colors for artists to use.</p>
<p>(Fun fact, many printers use CMYK (the K is for black) because it can produce all the same colors as BYRK, and more)</p>
<p>Our eyes can only see Red, Green, and Blue light. (Sidenote: it can see yellow light, but that's because yellow light is interpreted as a bit of green and a bit of red)</p>
<p>White light is essentially all colors of light mixed together, although since our eyes can only see Red, Green, and Blue, white is <em>really</em> just a mix of those three colors. Why aren't those the primary colors for paint though?</p>
<p>Paint works by absorbing light, and then reflecting other light. Let's let CMY be the primary colors and then see what it's like if RGB were the primary colors.</p>
<p>Cyan light to our eyes is a mix of green and blue. So Cyan reflects green and blue, and absorbs red (as far as our eyes care. Magenta light is a mix of Blue and Red, and absorbs Green.</p>
<p>If we mix Cyan and Magenta, the cyan absorbs the red light, and the magenta absorbs the green light, leaving only Blue light for our eyes to see.</p>
<p>Now, let's try using RGB as primary colors... Red is red,  Green is Green. If you mix red and green, the red absorbs a lot of the green light, and the green absorbs a lot of the red light, leaving you with some gross colored paint (probably a dark brown, gray, or some other gross color)</p>
<p>Cyan, Magenta, and Yellow are known as the subtractive primary colors. this is because when you mix two of these colors, they absorb (subtract) different colors of light, and the ones that each of them don't absorb gets let through, making a new color. (What I was explaining earlier)</p>
<p>Red, Green, and Blue are known as the additive primary colors. This is because when you mix two of these colors together, they combine (add) to make more colors (ie Red plus Blue makes Magenta)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the difference between light absorbing pigments and frequencies of emitted light, there's the fact that your eyes have red, green and blue sensors in them that absorb those frequencies of light.  Yellow is figured out by your brain based on the amount of light being absorbed by those sensors.</p>
<p>So in the electronic world, light emitters attempt to fool the sensors in your eye, as opposed to pigments, which just absorb whatever frequencies they absorb and reflect the rest back to your eye.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
