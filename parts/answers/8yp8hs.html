		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Laughter is a release of nervous energy. I think when things go “wrong” in reality, it’ll create tension. When someone injures them self there is a possibility that they could die or that the situation is serious, and that creates tension. Once you realize that the situation is actually “safe” you’ll release the built up tension as laughter.
There are many factors as to what “wrong” is. It could be anything from a fart in high school classroom to a terrorist act on a global scale. Also there are many factors as to what “safe” is. Usually it is distance. An embarrassing situation could not be funny at all but once you look back a few years later it could be funny. Time could act as a “distance” so you could be safe. An 9/11 joke could be funny to a 13 year old in LA but not funny to a 50 year old fire fighter in NYC because of distance in a way. A viral video of someone injuring themselves is 10x more funny than if your mom or even yourself got injured in the same way because the situation is distant and therefore “safe”. </p>
<p>From an evolutionary and social viewpoint say you were hunting for lions or something and someone hears a sound. It would invoke a lot of tension. Now if the sound was revealed to be a small squirrel or something harmless it would release the tension with laughter, which also acts as a group communicator that everything is okay ( why laughter is contagious.) When things in reality go wrong, it creates tension for a split moment. Once you realize that the threat is actually safe than you release the tension.
I recommend reading about the science of laughter,dark humor, nervous energy, or anything close to those. If anyone has anything to add please do because I’m just going off memory </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not everyone does. There are some people who do not and cannot find humor in painful or embarrassing situations happening to others, even if they know they're fictional. </p>
<p>There was an interesting article that dealt with this topic, in relation to the TV show <em>The Office</em>, and how some people just cannot find it funny and in fact find watching the show to be painful. </p>

<p>It basically relates to empathy. If you have a high degree of empathy, you start to lose the ability to find bad things happening to other people, even fictional characters, funny. When you see someone getting hurt, or being embarrassed, or mocked by a group, instead of finding it humorous, you start to feel what they would feel in that situation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I mean, there <strong>is</strong> a difference.</p>
<p>Most people would laugh if I tripped and my face landed in pie. I'm clearly okay.</p>
<p>Only a select few would laugh if they saw me get run over and splattered to bloody pieces. Yeah, yeah, a 14 year old would laugh if they saw that in a cartoon. But if you actually saw that in the flesh, it'd fuck you up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
