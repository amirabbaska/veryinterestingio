		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Photosynthesis is a process where photon is captured and its energy transported across a chain of molecules for the purpose of storing the said energy. This process is well-controlled at various steps, and organisms have evolved over the years to use the best spectrum of light available.</p>
<p>In humans the majority of Vitamin D synthesis requires sunlight at one stage, but the UV light just provides the activation energy to convert one isomeric form of provitamin D to another (i.e. there is no active storage of energy). This is a spontaneous process not requiring cellular machinery, and the effect is limited to the substrate and product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In <em>any</em> way, then yes, energy from sunlight allows conformation changes in molecules. </p>
<p>But the mechanism of action is different. </p>
<p>With Vitamin D3 synthesis from vitamin D, the UV light turns the precursor molecule, 7-dehydrocholesterol, into another molecule which will turn into Vitamin D3 in a few hours. </p>

<p>Photosynthesis is a more complex reaction carried out in parts of the Chloroplast. It uses electron transfers to create 'sugar' to feed itself, different in many ways. </p>

<p>Other similarities might be that (of course) the molecules each have certain wavelengths of light that are most likely to cause this conformational change, &quot;-Dehydrocholesterol absorbs UV light most effectively at wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm &quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
