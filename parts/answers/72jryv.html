		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The water your dehumidifier produces is actually drawn from the air around it. The air contains water vapor that moves into the air from the earth around the walls and floor of your basement. Concrete absorbs water fairly easily. The water moves through it and eventually evaporates into the air on the other side.</p>
<p>Your dehumidifier uses a cold coil of metal that attracts the water vapor in the air to condense onto it (Similar to how a cold glass of water gets wet on the outside of the glass on a warm humid day). As the condensation builds up, it drips down into the catch basin.</p>
<p>If you did not have a humidifier, the water vapor would remain in the air (resulting in higher humidity), and would likely condense over time onto other items in your basement. The dampness would promote the growth of mildew and mold (both things which like to grow in damp areas) and over time become a health hazard, not to mention also possibly damaging anything stored in your basement.</p>
<p>As an aside... Most dehumidifiers have an outlet that you can attach a hose too. I have a hose attached to mine, which then run to the basement drain. Assuming you have a basement drain, this might be a good way to avoid having to empty your dehumidifier bucket every day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the air. The air is full of water vapour. Water vapour is transparent to the human eye, so we can't see it. And no, the steam from the kettle is not vapour, it's tiny droplets of liquid water, that's why you see it.  Same happens with the clouds, btw.</p>
<p>So, the vapour is in the air. If you didn't have a dehumidifier, it would be in the air. Have you ever heard of relative humidity? You could have a basement with a 90% relative humidity that is cold and stinks with mold, or you could have a basement with 20% relative humidity  with an air so dry that makes your nose bleed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just an FYI, you can buy a 'condensate pump' for short money. You attach a drain hose to your dehumidifier to the pump, then run vinyl tubing from the pump to the nearest drain. You can then forget about emptying the tank every day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earth around your basement.</p>
<p>It's rainwater from above and groundwater pushing up from below.</p>
<p>When you build a house (here in germany) you're encouraged to build a through, a sort of tub, an insulation protecting the walls like the black insulation of a man made pond.</p>
<p>A pond's insulation prevents stones from piercing the water holding film and water running off if it's damaged from the water side - the through works in reverse, preventing water from penetrating the walls of a house.</p>
<p>Moisture </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in walls promotes funghal growth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>partialy washes out mortar of brick walls (you'll eventualy note crystaline bloom in gaps and crumbling plaster) - this is usualy not dangerous, but <em>can</em> affect stability.</p>
</li>
<li>travels through portions of the house due to capilary effects (walls function like a sponge, sucking up and lifting the moisture like a tree's trunk).</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Retrofitting a through is expensive.</strong></li>
<li>You still may need to install a drain wall depending on the moisture present on your plot.</li>
</ul>
<p>I've seen botched constructions where water was actually <strong>running</strong> off the walls and pressing through the concrete floor in streams.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Concrete holds water like a sponge. One reason why warehouses always put things up on racks and pallets. A cardboard box sitting on a concrete floor would be ruined after a few days. The concrete walls of a basement in a damp area will weep water and be wet to the touch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
