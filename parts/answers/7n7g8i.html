		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rabies causes extremely painful muscle spasms in the neck and chest when swallowing. So every time they take a drink or even swallow their own saliva it is extremely painful. In later stages of the disease even the thought  or sight of water can cause the muscle spasms. So there is an aversion to the stimulus that causes the pain (water) and they become hydrophobic.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In rabies act of swallowing causes sudden and extremely painful spasms of diaphragm and other respiratory muscles. Pathological muscle spasms are corelated with damage to nucleus ambiguus (nuclei of nervus vagus) done by rabies virus.
View or sound of water cause fear of that pain. That fear can itself induce spasms or even epileptic attack.
Besides of hydrophobia pathognomonic (that is proper exclusively) to rabies is aerophobia- the same symptoms may be caused by flow of air on ill person's face.</p>
<p>It isn't caused by increased salivation. Both symptoms have the common cause- damage to nucleus ambiguus. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
