		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Permanently preventing a gas influx at a low depth is a challenging procedure. Conventional well control involves having a hydrostatic pressure greater than the pressure of the gas. This is typically done by controlling the liquid's weight, more weight = more pressure. Gas's hydrostatic pressure gradient is quite low; think of air pressure difference between Denver and Los Angeles (1 mile of vertical height) is the equivalent pressure of 5 feet of water.  </p>
<p>A typical gas well, are designed like telescope, larger shorter (in depth) outer pipes and smaller longer (in depth) inner pipes are cemented together. There is likely a leak between the deeper inner pipe to the more shallow outer pipe. So a high pressure is occurring at a low depth, which cannot be matched from a weighted hydrostatic fluid. </p>
<p>Drilling a &quot;relief well&quot; is no easy task. Drillers are attempting to drill a 8000 foot well and hit a 7 inch pipe. Imagine standing on the top of a 30 story building, while holding a 300 foot piece of spaghetti trying to hit a Cherri-O on the sidewalk. So drillers need to go slower than normal to be sure not to go off course. Determining where the drill bit is at needs to occur more often. Also I believe they are restricted to working only day light hours, normal drilling operations are around the clock. At 8000' the hydrostatic pressure will overcome the gas pressure, which would allow a better chance for the cement to 'set up' properly.  </p>
<p>Turning everything 'off' doesn't work like you'd want. With well integrity concerns, the gas might find a new way out, by means of breaking different parts of the well/ground, if it's constricted at the surface, which would only complicate the problem. Solving the problem properly at 8000' is more important than a temporary minor mitigation. </p>
<p>Luckily the gas well is isolated, about a mile from people. Even so, natural gas and the gas that gives natural gas it's unpleasant odor, are not harmful. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a petroleum engineer, I can comment. I can't find all of the details, but they need to drill a relief well to intercept the original well and plug it off with cement. </p>
<p>They can't flare I believe because the leak is uncontrolled and flaring could be dangerous. A fire would not travel down into the reservoir. </p>
<p>They likely can't rig up on the problem well itself to run cement because of the leak. Flammability around big machines. </p>
<p>They should be able to reach 8500 feet in ~10 days but intercepting a small diameter pipe could slow that down significantly. I don't have direct experience with that portion. Then there's the plugging operation  to pump cement down the relief well and into the problem well. At each step there's engineering and regulatory work needed that also can take time. In sure there's plenty of parties involved that can add a lot of red tape. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
