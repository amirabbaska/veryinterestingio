		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to Robert Sapolsky in <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Why-Zebras-Dont-Ulcers-Third/dp/0805073698" target="_blank">Why Zebras Don't Get Ulcers</a>, most animals have a quick stress response that is over quickly. For most, this does no long-lasting harm. This is not true for more social and hierarchically organized species.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4UMyTnlaMY&amp;t=1s" target="_blank">this video</a> where he describes the research on baboons that won him the MacArthur Genius Grant. </p>
<p>The tl;dw is that baboons are hierarchical and mean to one another. Lower-order baboons have rates of heart-disease comparable with modern humans, despite not eating like we do or watching Netflix all day. It's due to the constant stress of being on the low end of a social hierarchy. However, this is culturally learned and can be culturally unlearned. Serendipitously, he wound up studying a troop where all the aggressive males died at once. The only males left were social and nice, both to one another and to the troop's females. This changed the culture of troop. Not only that, but new males entering the troop were acculturated to the new norms of the troop. Their health improved once the culture of extreme hierarchy and cruelty stopped. It's a pretty life-affirming 10min lecture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question gets at one of the most challenging issues with studying psychiatric illness, which is that finding decently valid animal models for those diseases is somewhere between extremely difficult and impossible. I would be very hesitant to accept a claim that a wild animal is suffering from PTSD or generalized anxiety disorder just because of how difficult it is to demonstrate that those conditions exist even in a perfectly controlled laboratory animal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert- and this isnt answering the question directly but more adding onto better answers. In the book Sapiens, the author briefly mentions that humans were very much prey and the jump to predator was pretty quick by evolutionary standards. The theory is that we still have prey instincts that we havent fully dealt with. So its very possible that we share fear traits with most animals - but its possible that 'predators' like wolves, bears, lions dont feel that fear/anxiety. When these types of animals have never seen humans or only seen friendly humans they tend to not be very worried. The Selous safari park in Tanzania for example is split into two parts: a hunting section and no hunting section. The animals in the hunted section will all run away if they see a car/human - meanwhile the ones on the other side are used to seeing humans and are completely unfazed. I noticed the zebras/antelopes/grazers etc were way more skittish and suspicious of us- whilst the lions acted like we weren't there. I was 1 meter away from a lioness, my heat was beating fast and my adrenaline was going off even though I knew I was safe but that lion couldn't have been more chill. Makes me wonder if hierarchy plays a role in this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wildlife cut off from feeding/mating range because of natural range limited by development and transportation corridors suffer real and measurable physical effects, from malnutrition to inbreeding. The mountain lions of inland North San Diego County, for example, have been hedged in by 10 lanes of Interstate 15 dividing their mountain habitat. Wildlife cameras and biologists have witnessed lions coming to the side of the massive interstate highway, stressing out, and turning around. This isolated population is now showing genetic effects of inbreeding, including &quot;kinked tails.&quot; </p>
<p>Happily, land conservationists have just completed the purchase of a big wild parcel next to I-15 that will allow the construction of a wildlife bridge across the huge highway, as recommended by two science panels: <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sd-no-wildlife-crossing-20180413-story.html" target="_blank">http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/sd-no-wildlife-crossing-20180413-story.html</a></p>
<p>In a healthy ecosystem, human-style stress and emotional trauma aren't seen. Wild animals are content in their environments and able to deal with life and death events, even if the events affect them emotionally (see: elephant communities and grieving habits). </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple mechanisms that help mammals adapt to stress, I've focused on the endocannabinoid system and it's role in mediating stress so that mammals are able to think clearly and survive in stressful situations. One interesting element of PTSD in humans is that it seems that endocannabinoid levels (like anandamide) increase under stressful situations, causing upregulation of CB1 receptors. In the same way that alcoholics upregulate GABA receptors, mammals seem to upregulate CB1 receptors when their endocannabinoid levels remain high for prolonged periods of time. When they are removed from the stressful environment, endocannabinoid levels are reduced, however the increased amount of CB1 receptors are lacking in endogenous ligands to bind with them. That's where FAAH inhibition through exogenous cannabinoids like CBD has proven to be helpful in mediating the effects of PTSD, both in mice and humans. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4119220/" target="_blank"><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4119220/" target="_blank">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4119220/</a></a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
