		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Is there a more elegant way of finding the bedrock number that underlies a given exponent?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, for x^n the number you're looking for will be n!, which is shorthand for n * (n-1) * (n-2) *....*3*2*1.</p>
<p>For example, x^7 would end up with the number 7! = 7*6*5*4*3*2*1 = 5040</p>
<h2>To see why:</h2>
<p>Focus on x^2 to start. </p>
<p>To generalize the difference between consecutive items in the sequence, we have:</p>
<p>(x+1)^2 - x^2</p>
<p>Do some algebra and get:<br />
<strong>2</strong>x^<strong>1</strong> + 1</p>
<p>Repeat the process:</p>
<p>[2(x+1) + 1] - [2x+1]<br />
= 2</p>
<p>So there's your 2.</p>
<hr />
<p>Now we do this with x^3:</p>
<p>(x+1)^3 - x^3<br />
= <strong>3</strong>x^<strong>2</strong> + 3x + 1</p>
<p>Repeat the process:<br />
[3(x+1)^2 +3(x+1) + 1] - [3x^2 + 3x + 1]<br />
= <strong>6</strong>x^<strong>1</strong> + 6 </p>
<p>Repeat the process:<br />
6(x+1) + 6 - [6x+6]<br />
= 6 [aka <strong>6</strong>x^<strong>0</strong>]</p>
<h2>Making sense of it:</h2>
<p>Notice that I've bolded a few coefficients and exponents in the above section. As you go through the repetitive process, you see that your highest power term always gets canceled out in the algebra. In the x^3 example, you start with 1x^3 being your highest power term. Then you do the difference process and you end up with 3x^2 being your highest power. Then you do the difference process again and you end up with 6x^1 being your highest power. Then you do it once more and 6x^0 is your highest power. </p>
<p><strong>In the x^3 example, do you see how the highest power term goes like this as we go through all the steps:</strong></p>
<p>x^3<br />
3x^2<br />
6x^1<br />
6x^0</p>
<p><strong>So the general pattern is:</strong><br />
x^n<br />
nx^(n-1)<br />
n(n-1)x^(n-2)<br />
n(n-1)(n-2)x^(n-3)<br />
.<br />
.<br />
.<br />
n(n-1)(n-2)...3*2*1</p>
<p>which is the formula we talked about up top.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's just the result of taking the derivative repeatedly. Your final sequence (2, 6, etc.) will be x! (factorial of x) </p>
<p>Taking the derivative of a polynomial reduces the exponents by one, then multiplies the terms by the original exponent. </p>
<p>If f(x) = x^2<br />
f'(x) = 2 * x<br />
f''(x) = 2</p>
<p>If g(x) = x^3<br />
g'(x) = 3 <em> x^2<br />
g''(x) = 6 </em> x<br />
g'''(x) = 6</p>
<p>So each consecutive exponent would result in factorially increasing numbers. 1 <em> 2 = 2, 2 </em> 3 = 6, 6 <em> 4 = 24, 24 </em> 5 = 120, 120 * 6 = 720</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's called a second difference. For y=x, the first differences will be constant. For y=x^2 , second differences will be constant and so on. That's how you can tell from a table of value if a graph is linear, quadratic, cubic, quartic, quintic etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have already answered your question, but I thought I'd add that the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS, <a href="https://oeis.org/" target="_blank">link</a>) is a good place to learn more about things like this. You type in a part of the sequence you're interested in (in this case, &quot;2, 6, 24&quot;) and hit &quot;Search&quot;. It gives you a list of all the sequences that contain the subsequence you entered, including their name, a short description of what they may represent, and some mathematical references.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
