		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a whole team of people operating EVS machines (basically big hard drives that record all cameras at once, synced to the same timecode). They have controls which make it quick and easy to select multiple camera angles and adjust the playback speed, then put them together to make a clip. An assistant director (AD) oversees this team and relays to the main director which clip he should take to air. An experienced EVS op can put that together in a matter of seconds. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source: did this in college.</p>
<p>There’s the Director, he’s looking at screens of all the cameras. ‘Ready camera 3, go camera 3.’ The editor (me) hits the camera 3 btn, Jumbotron shows camera 3. Graphics etc all get loaded up on top as well in the same way. </p>
<p>Another editor, ‘replay editor’ or RP (also me or my coworker) is controlling replay. Replay is a deck that is constantly recording. RP hits a button to indicate ‘in’ point, like if a fast break happens RP hits the button, then if a turnover happens he hits again; Anytime there might be something cool coming up he hits it. </p>
<p>If Producer says “ready replay go replay” then RP is on… He has a scrubber knob that goes to the last in point and then he can turn the knob to control the replay speed… So a slamdunk can be Slowed down, paused, reversed… It’s basically RP’s time to shine.</p>
<p>My university I went to happened to be doing really well in sports when I was there so Coca-Cola gave a bunch of money for the Jumbotron and the replay truck, it was one of the most fun jobs I’ve ever had.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most broadcast companies have a source feed going to multiple work stations. One is for a direct live broadcast feed. It will usually be minimally touched by software and hardware so that it can be aired as quickly as possible. A second feed will go to a robust system intended to be able to quickly cut and edited (replay slow-mo) then fed back to the main unit switch for broadcast. </p>
<p>I will add that in some cases for major events they will actually time delay the whole event by upwards of a minute to give them time to make sure the best camera angle was chosen, and to hide anything that shouldn't be aired (looking at you Justin Timberlake and Janet.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not mainstream sports, but this gives a good idea of what a production team does on game day. A lot of teamwork goes into making the production.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
