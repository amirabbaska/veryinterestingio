		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah it contains one or more ingredients that absorb or reflect UV radiation very effectively. So while sunscreen usually doesn't change how you look in the visible spectrum, at least not much, if you had UV vision it would look like being smeared in paint.</p>
<p>The active ingredients can vary. Generally organic compounds tend to absorb the UV, while inorganic compounds like titanium dioxide tend to reflect and scatter it away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great question that has two answers, depending on the kind of sunscreen we're addressing. For starters, there are two types of sunscreens: physical sunscreens and chemical sunscreens.    </p>
<p>Physical sunscreens are chemically inert products that reflect or scatter radiation: therefore, they help stop burns by 'bouncing the rays' right off of your skin. These agents are typically more broad-spectrum that chemical sunscreens, meaning they simultaneously block UVA (which penetrates the skin deeper/is linked to wrinkling) and UVB (which burns the skin/causes DNA damage). The most common types of physical sunscreens are zinc oxide and titanium dioxide.    </p>
<p>Chemical sunscreens are aromatic (ring-shaped) compounds that absorb radiation and convert it into wavelengths that are longer and lower-energy. By doing so, you 'slow down' the wavelengths that typically cause skin to develop a burn. These chemicals are not typically broad-spectrum, meaning that some are better at blocking either UVA or UVB; therefore, combinations of different chemical sunscreens allow you to create a &quot;broad-spectrum sunscreen&quot;.    </p>
<p>Sunscreen is super important, and everyone should be wearing it! Protect your skin out there!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other correct responses, I want to explicitly point out that a sunburn is a radiation injury, not an injury due to thermal transfer. You are not cooking like food in a conventional oven or when you burn yourself with a flame.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sunburns differ significantly from thermal burns, which result from infrared radiation. Although infrared radiation gives sunlight its warmth, it is not the heat of the sun that burns skin.   </p>
<p>The energy from ultraviolet radiation can damage molecules in the skin, most importantly DNA. One consequence of this is the synthesis of different proteins and enzymes. The effects of these proteins, notably prostaglandins and cytokines, lead to dilation of the cutaneous blood vessels and recruitment of inflammatory cells. This, in turn, produces a sunburn's characteristic redness, swelling and pain.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two primary ingredients to sunscreen. Inorganic semiconductors particles and organic molecules.  Small particles of semiconductors with bandgaps of around 400nm such as TiO2 (381nm/413nm) and ZnO (376nm) either scatter or absorb incident UV radiation. Scattering means that the amount of UV radiation making it to your skin is reduced by scattering it away from you, small particles are very good at this. Basically it makes you a frosted UV mirror. Absorption pushes electrons into higher energy states, those electrons then thermally relax back to their ground state by releasing multiple low energy photons (heat). The analogy is taking an elevator to the top floor and then going down the stairs rather than jumping out the window (many small harmless steps rather than one big and harmful jump). Organic absorbers, such as  avobenzone or oxybenzone, work in the same way; by absorbing high energy UV radiation (nasty cancer causing stuff) and releasing it as relatively harmless heat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Titanium dioxide (white pigment) and benzephenone (A UV photo initiator). They absorb/reflect UV wavelengths of light and make the sunscreen layer on your skin mostly opaque to UV light, shielding your skin from the harmful wavelengths.</p>
<p>These are common raw materials used in both ink and sunscreen. Yes sunscreen contains the same materials as UV printing ink, have fun with that knowledge. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
