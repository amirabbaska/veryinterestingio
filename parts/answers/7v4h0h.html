		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey Hey! Certified Ophthalmic Assistant here!</p>
<p>Let's break it down,
Snellen eye chart: the test where you start with the big E and read down to the smallest line of letters you can. The smaller the line, the smaller the corresponding number. The big E is the 20/400 line and one of the smallest lines would be the famous 20/20 line (average good vision)</p>
<p>Visual field testing,
As the name suggests it tests your field of vision by blinking increasingly dim lights at you while you look at a fixed target and registers when you are no longer able to perceive the light. Helpful to see if there is any construction in a person's peripheral vision, or to check for blind spots (scotoma) </p>
<p>Ocular coherence tomography.
You look at a designated light in a machine and a it essentially does an ultrasound of the retina (the light sensitive wallpaper of the eye responsible for perceiving light and turning it into electrical signals for the brain to interpret) this can map the thickness of the nerve fiber layer and the macular (area of the eye responsible for perceiving fine details). </p>
<p>A phoropter is the &quot;better one or two&quot; machine. It helps determine your glasses prescription by giving you incremental lens choices by minute degrees in one direction or the other. Normal eyes not requiring lenses to focus images are called Plano, eyes too short for the lens system are called hypermetropic or &quot;farsighted&quot; eyes and a magnifying lens brings images into focus. Eyes too long for the lens system are called myopic or &quot;nearsighted&quot;, the lenses to bring images into focus in those eyes are concave and make images optically smaller.</p>
<p>The puff of air or blue light used to check pressures are called tonometers and measure the amount of fluid produced in the eye vs what is drained out. This is useful as steadily increasing pressures can indicate glaucoma. </p>
<p>The drops at the end of a complete eye exam dilate the pupils (make them bigger) dilation is essential for the doctor to observe the retina for any anomalies, and the pupil is actually a hole in the center of the eye.</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>alright so not an optometrist, but definitely someone who's spent a lot of time around them: By the dots I assume you mean the dot in the middle of the <a href="http://www.allaboutvision.com/conditions/amsler-grid.htm" target="_blank">grid</a>? That's the Amsler Grid, which tests for macular degeneration, a condition that often occurs with age and is the accumulation of fatty deposits under the retina, the layer at the back of your eye that does all of the most important parts of receiving light. </p>
<p>The machine with all of the different lenses is the fastest way for the doctor to determine your prescription, and how your visual acuity changes with different lenses. Each of the options you are given are curved ever so slightly differently to refract light into your eye in a slightly different way. You do each side separately and then together because the prescriptions in each of your eyes may be different and require slightly different lenses. </p>
<p>If you've ever had the numbing drops put in your eyes and then your lenses poked ever-so-gently with what looks like a straight-up pen, your doctor was checking for glaucoma or other eye-pressure related diseases that might damage the optic nerve. Glaucoma is the one that lots of people try medical marijuana for. </p>
<p>Idk what else... um, the dilating drops that they put in usually every other visit makes your pupils (the black part of your eye) open up wider (they're basically large holes that the light enters to the back of your eye through) so that the doctor can shine a light and see the backs of your eyes to look for any major problems like holes or those fatty deposits. </p>
<p>That's all I can think of--at least, all the things my doctor does! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My family optometrist does the visual field test every time we go, and my mom consistently would miss lights in one particular area. They checked a few times, and then recommended she get an MRI. Turns out she had a sizeable benign tumor pressing against her optic nerve. The visual field test is the only way they caught it, and she had the tumor safely removed shortly after. If she hadn't had glasses and regular optometrist visits we might not have found it in time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of the human eye as a camera system. So you've got the camera body itself, and more or less a lens in front. When you &quot;see&quot;, the &quot;lens&quot; (lens + cornea, tear film etc) at the front of the eye focuses light onto the &quot;camera body&quot; (retina), which transmits all that information to the brain.</p>
<p>So when you have a &quot;prescription&quot;, it kind of just means that the &quot;lens&quot; you have isn't compatible with the &quot;camera body&quot; that you have. This means the light isn't focused exactly on to the retina, and so things look blurry. We correct for this by giving you a prescription which makes the &quot;lens&quot; either stronger or weaker so that it's more compatible with your &quot;camera body&quot;. This is why simply giving you a &quot;stronger&quot; lens isn't going to make your eyesight better. All we're doing making your camera system work properly.</p>
<p>If we simplify it, being &quot;short sighted&quot; can mean your eye is a bit too long, and being &quot;long sighted&quot; can mean your eye is a bit too short.</p>
<p>An exam these days can typically start with an &quot;autorefractor&quot;, which is the machine you look into that may show something like a hot air balloon that may look blurry. This estimates the prescription you need. This used to be done manually by a techinique called Retinoscopy.</p>
<p>The machine that goes in front of your face with all the lenses is called the phoropter, which contains many different lens powers, we use this to help us refine your prescription based on what you see. This step might also involve making you looking at some dots (if that's what you're referring to), or perhaps circles. This is something that helps us refine for astigmatism.</p>
<p>After this we often then test the power out in in pair of trial frames where we what we think are the correct lenses in. This gives you a good idea of what your glasses will feel like in terms of the vision. </p>
<p>Depending on where you are, afterwards we can have a look at the health aspects of your eye. So because the eye itself is hollow, we can have a look inside the eye with something called the &quot;slit lamp&quot; which is basically a microscope</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What about the “which is sharper, the red or the green? test” These have a black dot on a red background next to a black dot on a green background.
And while I’m asking, they also use dye eye drops that makes my snot dayglo yellow. What’s that all about? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
