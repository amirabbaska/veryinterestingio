		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a lot involved here. There have actually been studies on it. Believe it or not though women tend to run warmer than men as far as core body temp goes, though their extremities (hands/feet) are significantly colder than those of a man.
It’s quite interesting to see how it’s broken down in <a href="https://io9.gizmodo.com/why-do-womens-bodies-run-colder-than-mens-836827770" target="_blank">this article</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since girls can make babies, the area around their tummies need to be warmer to keep the baby safe and comfortable. Heat is taken from girls arms and legs and given to the tummy area which makes girls feel a little colder on the outside than boys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Women have several things that make them feel colder, and they have to do with making them better able to carry a child. </p>
<p>Women tend to have slightly higher body temps than men on average, which means that what they sense as being cold will be slightly higher than what men do. </p>
<p>And they also tend to have poorer circulation in their extremities which will make their hands and feet more likely to be cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have a follow up question to this. Before getting pregnant,  my wife was always colder than most people (including other women). Starting around the end of the first trimester and continuing to today (kid is 6), she is always warmer than most people (including me and other men). Any ideas?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
