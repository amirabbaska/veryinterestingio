		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The best way to think about it is in terms of the impact on the vine.  </p>
<p>The climate/weather is an obvious one - other things equal, a warmer climate and/or growing season will lead to riper grapes with more sugar (most of which ferments into alcohol), riper (softer) tannins (in a red wine), and decreased acidity.  A cooler climate and/or growing season will result in less sugar (/alcohol), more acid, and firmer tannins in a red wine.  There are a number of other considerations to do with the particular situation of the vineyard, the length of the growing season, the particular variety being grown, etc., but this is enough to give you an idea of how you can taste the climate in the wine.  </p>
<p>How much and when rainfall occurs in a given growing season can also have a big impact on the wine.  If a vine gets too much water, particularly towards the end of ripening, the grapes swell and flavours get diluted.  For this reason, a lot of growers will harvest early if there is a lot of rain, even if the grapes aren't perfectly ripe.  While some winemakers will adjust their wine to compensate for either dilution or early harvest, the resulting wine will always be markedly different from one made from fully ripened or non-waterlogged grapes.  Again, the position of the vineyard has a major impact on how much rainfall will affect the grapes (i.e. if it is on a steep slope, things are better than if it is at the foot of a hill.)  </p>
<p>Now to the soil.  While there are many romantic notions that Mosel Rieslings taste of slate and Chablis tastes of chalk, there is so far little evidence to support that vine roots can actually take up minerals in the ways required to transfer flavours so directly.  Simply put, the mineral ions that a root can take up are very small, and essentially flavourless, so it's not like a straw just sucking up whatever is underneath it.  Of course, a different balance of minerals in the soil will nourish the vine differently, but that won't necessarily translate into that taste in the wine (e.g. a vine on an iron-rich soil is more vigorous, but doesn't make grapes that taste like iron).  What makes more difference to the vine is (a) drainage and (b) nutrient levels.  </p>
<p>Drainage relates back to rainfall.  What you want is a good synergy between grape variety (different varieties like different amounts of water), climate (i.e. average rainfall in the area of the vineyard), and soil drainage (the amount of water the soil retains).  So in a hot place with not much rainfall in the growing season, you want grapes that can tolerate heat without too much water, and soil that retains water well (like limestone or clay).  In a cooler area with a lot of rain, you want well-drained soil and grapes that don't need a lot of heat to ripen.  Again, this is oversimplified, but hopefully it's enough to see how aspects of the soil and location can play into the final taste of the wine.  </p>
<p>Somewhat counter-intuitively, you get the best wine grapes from <strong>poor</strong> soil.  Too many nutrients makes too many grapes, and this reduces the concentration of flavour in each grape.  What you actually want is for the vine to focus all its effort on a relatively small number of grapes (balanced against economic interests) to get the best quality wine.  Older vines on poorer soils develop deeper roots, and many growers, winemakers, and winelovers believe this extra work on the part of the vine means that it can better regulate its water intake (since shallower roots means that water access fluctuates more in relation to rainfall) and also exposes the vine to a different set of nutrients.  </p>
<p>Now to your question.  What impact do pesticides have on the vine?  There are many, pesticide types and amounts vary wildly between producers, and it's a pretty contentious issue as a result of the complex factors.  But lets start with the most obvious question: if there are pesticides <strong>on</strong> the grapes, don't they get into the wine?  Yes and no.  Most wine regions have laws regarding how long before harvest pesticides can be used, and the general feeling is that this window allows most of the pesticides to dissipate or wash off before winemaking begins.  But, there are still detectable pesticide residues in wines made from pesticide-using vineyards, so whether it's on the grapes or taken up by the plants, there is something in there.  But as I pointed out before, few of the things a vine root picks up actually introduce that much flavour.  </p>
<p>There are however, two levels at which I think pesticide use can markedly alter the taste of a wine.  </p>
<p>1) Heavy pesticide/herbicide use has a big impact on the life in the soil.  This causes big problems for biodiversity in the flora/fauna surrounding the vines, and ultimately strips the soil of its fertility.  Even though vines do well on poor soils, they do still need some essential nutrients, and those don't really get replaced when everything around the vine is dead.  So the heavy use of pesticides and herbicides generally leads to the use of fertilisers.  Over time, this leads to weak vines that rely on pesticides to protect them and fertilisers to feed them.  This kind of disconnects the vine from its growing environment since the nutrients are coming from the fertiliser rather than the soil.  A lot of people believe that this has a noticeable impact on the quality of the grapes and wine produced by these vines.  </p>
<p>2) Heavy use of fungicides kills many of the natural yeasts and bacteria on the grapes.  This means that getting a reliable fermentation going will require a packaged yeast.  A huge number of the flavours that come out of wine depend on the fermentation byproducts, many of which are particular to individual strains of yeast.  Compare the difference between wonderbread (made with commercial yeast) and sourdough bread (made with natural, local yeast).  Because natural fermentations start slower, you get a whole host of different yeasts and bacteria forming before <em>s. cerevisiae</em> takes over and finishes the job.  If you dose commercial yeast (always a strain of <em>s. cerevisiae</em>) right at the beginning, the flavour profile of the wine is noticeably different.  In general, commercial yeasts provide a more consistent result and reduce the chances of funny flavours, so pesticide use is not the only reason people would use commercial yeast, but it does make it more likely that you'd need to.     </p>
<h1>TL;DR - you don't actually taste the soil, the sun, or the rain, what you taste is the impact these things have on the vine.  The same is true for pesticides.</h1></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I make wine for a living. I could go on for hours about the bullshit propogated by sommeliers, but I will spare you the long read. There are really a very finite set of flavors you can taste in wine. Part of this is, of course trained expectation, but there is concrete scientific support for these flavors as well.
For example, when we make artificial vanilla extract, it more or less tastes like real vanilla. This is because they synthesize a compound called vanillin, which makes up the majority of the &quot;vanilla flavor&quot; you get if you eat an actual vanilla bean. In spite of this, there are over 300 flavor compounds identified that contribute to the flavor of natural vanilla. This same principle is true for most of the flavors you know.
In wine you have an enormously complex system of bacteria and yeast that manipulate the chemicals (think naturally occurring grape constituents) in grapes. During this process they will often produce compounds we are familiar with, such as key flavor compounds in fruits. Because of this, we can say we taste citrus, or tropical fruit (banana, pineapple, mango etc.). This is further substantiated by something called Mass Spectrometry. This is basically a fancy instrument that can tell us what chemical compounds are in a solution (in this case wine).
I encourage you to buy a Sauvignon Blanc at the grocery (it doesn't have to be anything fancy, but preferably something in a regular wine bottle) and sit down with a WINE glass. Concentrate, and see if you can identify citrus flavors. This is often the easiest place to start, and I can almost assure you, you will be successful!
I will not attempt to refute the claim that brand perception heavily influences the perception of wine quality, but one could make this claim for virtually every product in the marketplace today.
The studies that showed sommeliers were unable to identify red vs. white wine, were somewhat flawed. That being said, I think this underscores the human mind's susceptibility to suggestion. You can read quite a bit about the implications of these studies with a few Google searches if you are interested.
Finally, the notion that pesticides to not influence flavor is not true. I highly encourage you to find a so called &quot;natural wine.&quot; These have not been treated with sulfur, and as a result the natural bacteria (and to a much lesser extent, yeast) are allowed to ferment the grape juice unchecked. This often produces a very sour and unpleasant wine.
Conversely, if you were able to find a vineyard that was treated with sulfur right before harvest, you would find this impacted the flavor in a very very bad way. Oversulfured wine is hard to describe, but just try to imagine eating a rancid egg. You will never find this for sale, as we are required to report our sulfur levels, and wine with a high enough sulfur level to taste like this would never make it to market.
On a much less extreme note, there is a movement away from using moderate levels of sulfur, as we believe it may mute the delicate flavors of the wine, by killing the bacteria essential in producing the flavor compounds you recognize as citrus etc.
Feel free to PM me if you have any more questions, or want more clarification!
Hope I helped:)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The basic premise that &quot;everything can tasted in the wine&quot; is demonstrably false.</p>
<p>There are several famous expose about supposed &quot;wine connoisseur&quot; and professional <em>sommelier</em> that have been given blind taste test and not been able to distinguish between supposedly highly-regarded wines and inexpensive wines.</p>
<p>Generally, it is the perception that the wine is X, Y, and Z that makes you think it supposedly taste &quot;better&quot; and have &quot;notes&quot; of whatever.</p>
<p>As to pesticides, they are washed off before processing the grapes... so, not much.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was on a vacation in Mexico a few years back.   I made friends with the chef.   Was able to get into the a la carte restaurants in the resort all the time.    No reservations needed.    One of those times I was offered a Mexican wine.   I was like, Mexico makes wines?   So anyhow, the wife and I decided to try it.    One of the best ever.    I was explained that in the old days, Mexico started producing such amazing wines, the Spanish wine producers got worried of the competition.   They literally destroyed the Mexican wine industry.    Can anyone corroborate?   I would love to hear from anyone else who knows about this. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
