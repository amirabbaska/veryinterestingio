Being burned is a passive process, while becoming tan and producing color is an active process in the body due to melanocytes, you die?those die. The normal redness would also not be present since that is from extra blood in the skin from the uv burns, which is why you can press on sunburned skin and it turns white momentarily.
So, yes, your arm would still burn, but it would be a literal burn...but not a sunburn like we know. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and, no. </p>
<p>Let's first characterize sunburn: what we call sunburn is damage that is caused by UV rays cleaving DNA, thus messing up cell functions and generally killing, damaging or altering the cell. The redness, bubbles, shedding etc. following the actual burn are part of the immune reaction, where the boy deals with the damage that has been done.</p>
<p>For the yes: cells on a severed limb can survive for quite some time, yet how long this is depends on the type of cells. Skin cells can survive for quite a few hours and when exposed to UV radiation they would still receive the same damage. </p>
<p>For the no: Skin cells will survive longer than cells of the immune system (NK, T, Neutrophils etc.). This means that although the same UV &quot;burn&quot; has occurred you'd not have the same immune response and thus you'd not have the normal redness, tanning and skin shedding. Moreover in the absence of immune response other microorganism would take over fairly quickly.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I would say that a severed limb would likely start decaying, and based on the article could even mummify. I don't think it would sunburn in the traditional sense due to desiccation of the tissues</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First hand experience with this in a few ways. Had a run where the victim was cut in half by a train. His arms and chest was exposed and he did not burn as much as cook for lack of a better word. His skin was pale and hot with patches of dark spots almost black where the sun was hitting it the most. Second one was a heroin od that died in a car. She had been in the car for at least 24 hours.  Same basic response skin looked pale with very dark patches but her skin also fell off when you touched it.  Before anyone says it, it was not lividity been a medic for 12 years now I know what that looks like. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
