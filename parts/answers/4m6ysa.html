		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You absolutely can, it's called a secondary infection which is what causes pneumonia and also what gives AIDS its severity. You can actually see that in a lot of pet fish they will get a primary and they secondary infection whilst they recover and so you need to medicate twice (but I'm getting off topic so let's stop there).</p>
<p>The reason humans don't (well not every often) is that our immune system is rather most massive and incredibly strong at what it does. When we are ill our immune system behaves like a small child on red bull, absolutely alert out of its mind and destroys everything it doesn't like including other infections. Interestingly, if your body is losing a major infection it will swarm itself with killer cells which destroy massive amounts of biological material which also murders a lot of your own cells, though this is by no means a last ditch effort.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physician checking in: Your conclusion about illness (infection as I believe you are focusing more on) is more a matter of statistics than biology. Let me explain:</p>
<p>Firstly there is no rule that you can only have 1 illness at a time. Come to my hospital and I'd be glad to point out many people who have many illnesses all at once! In fact, many illnesses naturally compile and cause other ones,( AIDS, as I saw someone else already posted)</p>
<p>So... then why have you only had 1 illness at a time? Well I'm assuming you are an otherwise healthy person. And like most healthy people you probably only catch a cold or the like for 3 days once or twice a year. That leaves like 360 days of the year of being healthy. So just by statistics, illness in an otherwise healthy person being a relatively rare event, you probably (but you may!) aren't going to come down with several things at once. So in conclusion, your experience has been through the eyes of a healthy person but our health all eventually falters: cancer, heart disease, organ failure, and then things snowball real fast. Most people end up having many problems compiling at once towards the end, often dying of basic infections that don't really pose a threat in healthy people.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are correct that if your immune system is weakened you are more susceptible to disease. However when you are sick your immune system isn't nescessarily weakened.
Generally speaking, you get sick when a pathogen, i.e. a bacteria or virus, that you havent encountered before infects your body. Then your immune system gets to work fighting the disease. When the infection is fought off, your immune system calms down to the 'normal' state, but certain cells, the memory T-cells (and memory B-cells) are retained. When the same pathogen infects your body a second time, these memory T and B cells recognize the pathogen and expedite a faster immune response, and as a result you dont get sick, or at least less sick. Note that during this response the immune system doesnt weaken, but is actually in an overdrive of sorts.
That said, it is indeed possible that another pathogen comes along and infects you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's completely possible to have multiple illnesses at the same time.  AIDS, for example, is deadly precisely for that reason.</p>
<p>However, when you are sick with something like the cold, if my memory serves correctly your immune system is actually kicked into overdrive, which makes further infections less likely.  That and also different bacteria might actually start competing against each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good info in these comments but I would like to highlight that a lot of the symptoms we associate with illnesses like the cold and flu are actually your immune system trying to kill the pathogen. Increased nasal congestion, fever, cough are all attempts by your body to get rid of the pathogen. The pathogen itself isnt causing any of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
