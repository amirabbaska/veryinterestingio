		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As most people have said already, ramen is inexpensive and easy to store.</p>
<p>From my own college experience:</p>
<p>-There are multiple brands with a plethora of seasonings that you can try a different ramen every single day and still not get tired of it.</p>
<p>-You can practically cook it anywhere with little to no cooking experience. Only needs water and heat source.</p>
<p>-you can complement ramen with almost anything in the savory department or vegetables.</p>
<p>-some ramen can be eaten raw for a quick snack.</p>
<p>-takes about 3-5 minutes to cook.</p>
<p>-Doubles as soup</p>
<p>-Non perishable unless wet.</p>
<p>-are Independently packed so there is almost no waste.</p>
<p>-It fills you up</p>
<p>-Can be made into something fancy if you have proper equipment.</p>
<p>-If you buy the cup noodles you don't even need a bowl.</p>
<p>-Most cup noodles come with dehydrated veggies and meats.</p>
<p>-Tired of ramen, get the vermicelli noodles for a few cents more.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're cheap as <em>hell,</em> and even the least-capable chef with what barely counts as a kitchen can cook them. They also don't need to be kept cold.  An ideal fit for a dorm room lifestyle.</p>
<p>I can't come up with another food that's so insanely cheap (amazon will sell you a package of 36 for what's basically 50 cents each) and can be sucessfully prepared while blackout drunk.</p>
<p>edit: yes im aware there's much cheaper than on amazon, but that's kinda beside the point </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seriously? This is a real question?</p>
<p>Most college students are, at least occasionally, broke as fuuuck.</p>
<p>There's not many other meals you can make with thirty five cents and a microwave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
