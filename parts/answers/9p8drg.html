Are there any non-primate vertebrates that we know of that spent a majority of their time upright like humans? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Iâ€™ve heard about the Permian-Triassic extinction when we lost a lot of really weird vertebrate fish and of course a lot of strange Arthropoda, but have we ever had an extinction where we lost a whole lot of mammalian taxa?  I know most of the megafauna have gone, but has there ever been something similar to the really big extinctions?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This probably more for Dr Gold and Ashley Poust. Is there a lot of difference between how dinosaures got into flight and how pterosaurs did? I vaguely remember reading that pterodactyls are not dinosaurs and I find that fascinating that flight has evolved so many times. </p>
<p>Appart form relatively modern birds, was there ever massive flying dinosaurs like some of the pterosaurs?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
