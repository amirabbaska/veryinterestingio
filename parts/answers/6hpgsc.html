		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Back when I wore contacts, one of my eyes used a contact designed for astigmatism. Instead of weight, it relied on a small raised portion on the outside of the lens that aligned the lens each time I blinked. </p>
<p>It looks like they're still on the market- acuvue oasys 'blink stabilized' contacts are what you'd need in space. Alternatively, one could have vision corrected surgically, which I eventually opted to do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The blink aligning ones are what they would use but astronauts are highly trained aviators. These people have gone through years of flight school and you cant even be a US Air Force Pilot without almost perfect eyesight, so I dont really think one could be an astronaut with having the necessity of contacts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Further to the discussion so far about the lenses (gravity vs blink-corrected), there is another more vexing issue at work. The astronauts' eyeballs themselves are a different shape while in freefall. There is actually <a href="http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/03/04/518214299/doctor-launches-vision-quest-to-help-astronauts-eyeballs" target="_blank">some quite fascinating work ongoing into figuring out the mechanism behind this</a> (involving sticking instruments into former cancer patients' heads to measure pressure changes while they're strapped down in a &quot;vomit comet&quot; aircraft). </p>
<p>So the way contact lenses work may change in space, but the actual amount and type of correction that astronauts need can <em>also</em> be changing at the same time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Though this doesn't address the specific issue related to astigmatism, I thought this was useful supporting info about vision requirements to be an astronaut. </p>
<p>Astronauts can and do wear contacts in space. NASA requires pilots to have better than 20/70 correctable to 20/20 and to be a mission specialist you have to have better than 20/200 correctable to 20/20. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rigid gas permeable (RGP) lenses generally correct for astigmatism automatically because they hold their own shape rather than conforming to your eye. I expect these would work in space, but having never been there I can't speak from experience. They work great on Earth though!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
