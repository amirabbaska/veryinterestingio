		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radioactive decay is purely random. </p>
<p>That means it is not just random in the way a coin toss is random: If we would know exactly the velocity, angular momentum, mass and some other properties of the coin in the air we could predict the outcome but since we do not know these properties with enough precision we say the outcome is random. This is called chaotic randomness. </p>
<p>Quantum effects like nuclear decay are purely random. That means there are no hidden variables and it is not only technically but in principle impossible to know the outcome (the time of the decay). If you want to know more about this, you should read about Bells Theorem.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Random is perhaps the wrong word; it is stochastic. That is, while we cannot predict what a single atom will do, we can predict what a group of them will do. Hence the concept of &quot;half-life,&quot; the time it takes for half of the atoms to decay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>BONUS QUESTION?: Does environment affect half-life?</p>
<p>For instance do elements decay faster in a high gravity situation like in the middle of Jupiter?</p>
<p>All I can find so far is this poorly answered question from 3 yrs ago. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1mqa3d/elemental_half_life_is_always_quoted_as_a/" target="_blank">Link</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well it is pretty much as random as it gets and radioactive sources measurements have been used as random number generators.   </p>
<p>Each atom is constantly &quot;testing&quot; its barrier of potential to its decayed state, and a tiny fraction passes through the wall by quantum tunnel effect; the is no telling which are.<br />
Exactly like throwing a dice : no matter the previous results you can't tell if a dice will roll a six in the next throw or in a million year, only that it gets more likely with &quot;time&quot; (and that if you throw a large number of dices about 1/6 will be 6, but you can't tell in advance which will they be) </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
