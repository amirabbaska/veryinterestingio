		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short answer: Mormons.</p>
<p>Why? Members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints believe that they can be baptized on behalf of their deceased relatives. Part of that process involves meticulously documenting who has proxy baptisms done for them so that nobody gets doubled up on. Like most Christians, they believe that Jesus will be back soon and He's going to help them make sure they don't miss anybody.</p>
<p>How? As part of that ambitious effort to essentially map out the entire human family tree, resources like the above mentioned serve as searchable archives of public records such as birth, death and marriage certificates as well as census records. Many of these records exist in hand-written form only. To deal with this huge barrier, all of the documents are scanned into a database and volunteers from around the world (mostly Mormon) painstakingly type out the image text so it can be digitally searchable.</p>
<p>TLDR: Mostly Mormons do it, some are employed by those websites, many are just volunteer enthusiasts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The records was previusly in churches, hospital records and stuff.<br />
And a great deal of effort have been put into digitalizing it all. (University Genealogy studies mainly)<br />
Initiatives made by past relatives<br />
(such as mine - <a href="http://schroeder.dk/slaegt/pedigree.php?personID=I1410&amp;tree=schroeder" target="_blank">schroeder.dk</a>) that have been going since 1918 and uses tools by <a href="http://www.tngsitebuilding.com/" target="_blank">http://www.tngsitebuilding.com/</a><br />
TLDR: They make use of the public records made by the Genealogy societies and university studies</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My dad. He isn't mormon, but he is fascinated with where he comes from. His hobby has taken him all over the country. When he finds a lead he goes to the last known location of that possible ancestor, checks the cemeteries and libraries for documents. Once he is sure of the lineage he adds it to his tree. Some lines he has been able to take back a thousand years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I did! They have a volunteer base that reads documents and then keys in relevant information. I went through 50 or 100 WW2 era German documents from the Warsaw Ghetto I think it was. Sad, but I read German and I felt like I should help. I also did some union membership cards from Wisconsin.</p>
<p>They have a lot of files to download and work on!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I used to work at an archive in London that was digitising its collections of workhouse and asylum records. The job was both incredibly fascinating but also very repetitive as you turned page after page and took a high res photo of each. </p>
<p>Some of the books are in bad condition and couldn't be looked at by the public. It's fabulous that they are accessible now and to people all over the world.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
