		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're going to kill a virus, you have to have something to target. By inserting itself into the host genome, it becomes virtually invisible to the immune system. Viral RNA hanging out in the cytoplasm is easily recognizable. Viral dsDNA within the nucleus looks just like any other human dsDNA. At that point, the provirus can persist until environmental conditions within the host become more suitable (i.e. person becomes immunocompromised), at which point it will begin replication and packaging of viral RNA. </p>
<p>If you think retroviruses are inefficient, let me tell you about partial dsRNA viruses, such as Hepatitis B. In order for them to replicate, they must first enter the cell, and replicate the template strand in order to produce a fully circularized dsDNA. Then, they produce an RNA intermediate. The RNA intermediate is then transformed BACK to ssDNA via reverse transcriptase, which is then replicated to package the partially dsDNA genome into new viruses. </p>
<p>So you insert partially double-stranded DNA into a cell, make it fully double-stranded DNA, form an RNA intermediate, reverse transcribe it into ssDNA, then replicate it to produce the partially dsDNA genome to package. Why bother with the RNA intermediate? Virologists hypothesize that it allows for introduction of genetic variation, since the reverse trancriptase is relatively low fidelity (not very careful/accurate). EDIT: As /u/eng050599 pointed out, the HIV reverse transcriptase is also very low fidelity, and is believed to also act as a mechanism of introducing genetic variation. </p>
<p>The ability to evade the host immune system indefinitely offers a selective advantage over other viruses, therefore allowing them to persist despite their odd mechanism of replication. Either way, evolution doesn't <em>necessarily</em> select for efficiency, as long as it works well enough.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Biology graduation student here. Not an expert, but I'll give you my all.<br />
In Eukaryotes, DNA is almost always inside the nucleus. Because of this, defense mechanisms have been naturally selected for finding DNA outside of it and breaking it down. That way, you protect yourself against those nasty Adenoviruses.
However, it is believed that retroviruses have been selected exactly because of such defense mechanism: they're able to get around it, turning its RNA into DNA very close or inside the nucleus, &quot;dribbling&quot; the enzymes responsible for the defense process.<br />
Hope you understand it now!<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from dodging DNA-destroying mechanisms in the cytoplasm, from the perspective of the virus it's actually simpler to have just RNA than DNA. The virus has to develop a reverse transcriptase enzyme first, obviously, but once it has one then all it needs is RNA. DNA is really only good for storing genetic information to be transcribed and replicated later (whereas RNA has lots of interesting uses). The reverse transcriptase and integrase allow the virus to make the cell do literally all the work of replicating and transcribing its genetic info.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Virology graduate student here. I'll put in my opinion but it's more of the same info that's been said. As others have said, evolution doesn't decide what's &quot;best&quot;, it simply leads to a result that works. Obviously reverse transcription works; HIV emerged into humans not too long ago and there are tens of millions of people infected, and that's with excellent drug therapies. Imagine how efficient it would be without drugs. Again as others have mentioned, reverse transcriptase (enzyme that converts RNA to DNA) is very inefficient and makes lots of mutations. This occurs at about 1 mutation in 5000 nucleotides, so there are roughly 2 mutations made every time the genome is copied. This is unprecedented when compared to how DNA, or even RNA, polymerase functions. This gives the virus an advantage because it can evolve rapidly. This increase in the rate of evolution of the virus lets it mutate quickly to avoid drugs and the immune system. The virus doesn't care if it makes defective genomes and &quot;dead&quot; viruses by mutating a lot. As long as a lot of them are still infectious that's a win for the virus. Your question doesn't really have an answer. It's asking why evolution chose to do with it did, and the answer is always random chance. It happened to be that RT worked, and don't fix what's not broken. I'd love to answer any other questions you have though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm on my phone so will keep this response short, despite knowing there is a lot more that can be said to answer you more thoroughly. I think your question is a good one, but demonstrates a huge misunderstanding of evolution. There is no 'point' in evolution. There is no goal or intent and not everything that evolves is at all more efficient or better. Instead, evolution works on what's available. What characteristics (both genetic and phenotypic) exist and what mutations occur. Evolution doesn't start from scratch with every organism, it modifies what came before and that might not lead to the 'best' outcome, just one that allows an organism to reproduce and pass on its genes long enough to establish itself in the gene pool.</p>
<p>Edit: I know this didn't answer your question regarding retroviruses and the specific advantages they might have, but I really think all of biology makes more sense once the idea of 'direction' of evolution is dispelled with. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
