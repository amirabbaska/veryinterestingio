		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former flight medic here. There is lots of data on the &quot;stressors of flight&quot; (many of these stressors are also present in automobiles). As the vehicle moves, the sway and direction change cause you  to have to keep yourself upright. These micro movements cause your muscles to be continuously working (even if you don't realize it). The US Air Force has done studies report conistent exposure to aircraft vibrations can lead to fatuige and increased chance of health problems.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the vehicle accelerates or decelerates, the body needs to make a lot of small adjustments to maintain posture. You don't notice doing this as it's handled by your brain automatically. When this happens so many times, over a large period, you get tired.
This is also why you would feel more tired traveling the same distance in a car, than if you did by train. The would be slowing down and speeding up less often (no traffic etc) so the body doesn't have to work so much to maintain posture. </p>
<p>EDIT: This is obviously not the one and only factor at play here, but it is a major one.
The reason why I selected the example of car vs train is that a lot of other factors remain the same in these two. You can't really compare traveling by plane to traveling by train with just this in mind because now there are a lot of other things at play like cabin pressure, engine noise, altitude, air composition etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you're in a plane, there are a few things that wear you out:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Your body has to adjust to being higher up really quick. Your body feels like it's going from a normal altitude up to the top of a mountain, in a few minutes, even though cabin pressure eases the change a little bit. If you were a balloon, takeoff is where you get twisted into a balloon animal. When you land, someone sticks a pin in you and all that pressure deflates. Neither one is good for your body short term.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dry cabin air dehydrates you. Dehydration makes us sleepy.</p>
</li>
<li>The way the plane moves. Vibrations, juddering, turbulence and rolling are not natural movements for your body. It tries to stabilize itself, which uses energy that it's trying to use to cope with dehydration and swelling. That's tiring for it.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The amount of worry of getting to the right place seems to overshadow it.  You worry about getting up at the crack of dawn, getting to the airport early enough, getting through security early enough, taking off your coat and shoes and pushing your luggage through the x-ray thing, possibly embarrass yourself if they detect something in your bag and have to unpack everything from it to discover what it is, put your shoes back on and retrieve your items and try to get out of other people's way, find the right gate, find the right airline, did you remember your boarding pass, be sure not to lose your boarding pass, has the time changed for the flight, what if there's a delay, if there is a delay can you make your next flight, do you have time to go to the bathroom or get something to eat, what if you miss hearing the announcement for boarding, finding your seat, stowing your carry on, and then after flying you have to try to pry your carry on from the small space, get off the plane as fast as you can without holding up other passengers, walk through interminable mazes of hallways to find the exit or the terminal to your next leg of the journey, pick up luggage if you have it, call for a taxi or a ride, wait for a while while strenuously trying to spot your taxi or ride because you're afraid if you miss it, the taxi will pick up someone else and you'll be left there standing in the cold for hours.  </p>
<p>On each part of the trip, there's a possibility that something could go wrong if you aren't <em>completely vigilant</em>, and you're eagerly waiting for the time when you can stop anticipating what to do next and just relax, and you really can't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On planes, at least, you’re sat at 8000ft/2500m equivalent with something like 5% humidity in epically uncomfortable, hilariously cramped quarters.
