		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The catch is that white gaussian noise is a random process, not a deterministic signal like a delta function. Fourier transforms are defined differently for random processes. Strictly speaking, they do not exist. But we can still get information about the spectral content of a random process through defining it's power spectral density, which for white noise is flat. Think of this as a sort of average case fourier transform. Try generating noise and take it's FT. It will be far from flat. But generate a new noise sequence, and average the 2 FT's together. Keep repeating and you will see that this averaged spectrum approaches a flat line. </p>
<p>The connection to the delta function comes from its autocorrelation function. There's a whole field of study of this field called random processes if you're interested in learning more and the math rigor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>White noise has an autocorrelation which is a Dirac delta function. Since the autocorrelation and the PSD are the Fourier transform pair, there is no ambiguity.</p>
<p>You can think of it this way: white noise has a different phase response than a delta function, just like a shifted delta function. The unshifted delta function is thus minimum phase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Fourier transform of white noise is not constant. The magnitude spectrum is 1, but the phase spectrum is uniformly distributed over [0, 2Ï€). Remember the transform is done over the complex numbers.</p>
<p>Yes, the Fourier transform is bijective -- until you throw away the phase information. Then you lose bijectivity.</p>
<p>You'll find a proof of bijectivity at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_inversion_theorem" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_inversion_theorem</a></p>
<p>Another proof: The Fourier transform is an orthonormal linear operator. Why does that make it a bijection? I'll leave that to you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Fourier transform is a 1:1 transform. So the only function whose transform is a constant across the frequency spectrum is a Dirac delta function.  A white noise process is a process whose statistical maximum likelihood spectrum is flat but any actual sequence you create will never be completely flat.  But the longer sequence you make the flatter it should look.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
