		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oil is used to produce some 70,000 different chemicals and synthetic materials, so until we find a way to produce each of those things without oil, then it will never be obsolete. We're not talking about silly things either, oil is an essential material for making plastic, nylon, and a thousand other synthetic fibers.</p>
<p>Basically, if you wear any clothing not homemade, use a computer, drive a car, or use... anything these days, then you need oil. If it's not made out of metal, wood, or 100% cotton, it's got a little oil in it somewhere.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a fuel, yes.</p>
<p>We'd have to run out first or at least get to a point where the per-joule price point for oil is higher than something else. It's debatable how long that will take.</p>
<p>The green-minded people say it's already happened and the price is kept artificially low by countries (such as Saudi Arabia) selling below cost to undercut competitors to the point of bankruptcy, after which time they'll stop selling below cost.</p>
<p>Those in favor of oil (such as the oil industry spokespeople) say that, essentially, there's so much oil that we'll effectively never run out.</p>
<p>The reality is that there is a finite surplus on Earth and there is a finite production rate. If the human race is using oil faster than it is produced, the surplus will be exhausted.</p>
<p>As the surplus reaches exhaustion, supply does down bring the price up. This is when technologies such as wind, solar, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_depolymerization" target="_blank">thermal depolymerization</a> can become more feasible.</p>
<p>I've talked about thermal depolymerization before but there doesn't seem to be the level of interest in it that I thought there would be. To summarize, this process can convert just about anything with carbon and hydrogen into oil, natural gas, and &quot;carbon solids&quot; (probably elemental carbon or graphite, etc). Imagine a water treatment plant that converts raw sewage, garbage, used motor oil, and plastics into drinking water, natural gas, #2 light crude, and graphite.</p>
<p>Anyway, we'll never actually be away from oil completely. Oil is useful as a dielectric for large transformers, liquid cooling of computer equipment, wire EDM and EDM sinker machining processes, and all sorts of other things.</p>
<p>There's always going to be diesel and gas turbine backup generators, those are simply too reliable to decommission.</p>
<p>You're always going to need to lubricate something as well. Teflon is great, but sometimes you need the mechanical properties of metal on metal without the teflon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So when a company drills, they do not just get oil. They get a whole bunch of things. </p>
<p>Lets call these things HC's. When a well is drilled things then are taken from the earth. Things like Gas and Oil, but also things like Ethane and Propane. These are used for Transportation fuel, Plastics manufacturing, electricity generation (for things like heating and lights) as well as a plethora of other significant needs. </p>
<p>But the big concern in your question here is the Oil and Gas specifically. </p>
<p>In places like USA and Western Europe, you don't really think about it much (beyond that its the stuff you put in your car). </p>
<p>But in places like China and India, it is a huge concern! The 2 largest countries in the world STILL mostly use coal! <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/to-curb-climate-change-china-slows-coal-to-gas/" target="_blank">In fact, China is desperate to get away from coal and move to other energy sources.</a> Oil and Gas is one of those. </p>
<p>They want to get away from coal for a few reasons. </p>
<p>To the men in suits they will say it is more efficient and beneficial economically for the growth of not only the economy but the standard of living. This is very true. </p>
<p>To the concerned citizens and the world they will say it will be better for the environment and their quality of life. This is also true!</p>
<p>You are too young to remember but there was a time that Coal was King in many places in North America. Things like Acid Rain and heavy smog in smaller population centres was common. This is something China faces today!</p>
<p>So, in the near future, No!. Oils demand continues to grow! </p>
<p>In the very long run, who knows.  When your explaining to your great grandchildren when they are 5, you will have a better answer.</p>
<p>Remember, Oil has not began to be phased out. And Coal was being phased out a century ago and is still in use.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to be talking about petroleum oil from the ground. Until 1972 when whale hunting was banned sperm whale oil was used to lubricate automatic transmissions.  After the ban transmission failures increased dramatically. Now there is a substitute.</p>
<p>Nothing beats diesel fuel as a concentrated energy source for a mobile engine. The most important diesel engines in the world are in tractors. If you do not use tractors for farming you must use horses and mules. That would increase the need for hay and grain decreasing farm land available for human food.</p>
<p>I calculated enough corn oil and soybean oil is produced from farming to fuel the farm equipment. But it would have to be restricted to farm fuel. No extras to go around.</p>
<p>Organic chemists will tell you if they care that there are many many easily produced things which can be made from petroleum oil that it is a shame we burn it. Would you rather have warm coats or to drive?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
