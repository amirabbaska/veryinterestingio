<p>So for children too young to give us a reliable subjective &quot;1 or 2&quot;, we base the prescription on objective measurements. We can objectively measure their refractive error with retinoscopy (as mentioned above). That's when we shine a light in their eyes  and use lenses to determine the prescription. It's very versatile, and we don't need a machine so it's perfect for kids. They can do anything (eat, watch tv) as long as their eyes are open for us to get the measurement.</p>
<p>In kiddos, it's best to do this when they're dilated because the dilation drops force their eyes to relax their focusing/accommodation ability (which they have a lot of). Kids can accommodate through far sighted prescription/refractive error. Prescriptions for kids under 7 should almost always be determined with dilating drops. It's normal to be a little far sighted when you're young, and as you grow up you tend to become more near sighted. </p>
<p>As pediatric optometrists, one of our greatest worries is amblyopia or lazy eye. That's when a child either has an eye turn, or high prescription leading them to favor one eye over the other. The non-favored eye doesn't develop the proper connections in the brain to see 20/20 because the kid will always favor his &quot;good eye&quot;. That's why you'll see some kids wearing an eye patch. It's to force them to use their &quot;bad or lazy eye&quot; so the brain can recognize and developed clear vision through that eye. It's important to treat lazy eye when they're young while the visual system is still malleable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers so far are incorrect - try putting a baby in an autorefractor and let me know how that goes for you. ;)</p>
<p>For babies or nonverbal people, we can use something called a <strong>retinoscope</strong>. Basically we shine a light in the back of the eye and move it around, and based on how the reflection moves it tell us if you are far-sighted, near-sighted, or have good vision. If the reflection moves when we move the light, we know you have a refractive error and which one it is (far- or near-sighted). We then place different-powered lenses in front of the eye to &quot;neutralize&quot; or stop the movement. The lens that does that is your prescription.</p>
<p>We can also use the same technique to determine if you have an astigmatism.</p>
<p>Source: I am an optometry student. </p>
<p>Edit: Since a lot of people are asking why don't we just make this standard instead of the &quot;Which is better, 1 or 2?&quot; thing we do:</p>
<p>The answer is that retinoscopy is a <em>bit</em> less accurate than the regular &quot;1 or 2&quot; technique, but it can get us very close. The &quot;1 or 2&quot; is done to fine tune the prescription and make sure the patient is comfortable with the correction.</p>
<p>Edit 2: If the 2 options the doctor gives you look the same to you, it's perfectly acceptable to say so. &quot;They look the same&quot; is a valid response. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I took my son to All Children's in St Pete. They used a type of computer modeling to determine how to correct his vision problems after they completed the basic, physical eye exam. The tech measured different aspects of his eyes then the doctor was able to simulate his vision based on those measurements. </p>
<p>From there, the doctor was able to take out a set of sample glasses and set them to what would be his prescription. Then he'd put the glasses on his face and see how he'd react. He kept making minor changes until his eyes no longer crossed or turned in.</p>
<p>When the doctor finally got it right, he tried to take the glasses off my son and he grabbed at them. He threw a full fledged temper tantrum because he wanted the glasses back immediately. It made that much difference in what he could see.</p>
<p>The doctor said that children with severe vision problems almost always reacted that way when they got it right. That's one of the ways he could tell that the glasses would work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<li>
<p>Retinoscopy method described earlier is correct. With some skill, knowledge and experience you can be very accurate and certainly more accurate than asking a young child to refine his refraction with &quot;which is better&quot; type questions. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How do we know to check?  Every child that comes into my office for any reason gets a full, cycloplegic (dilated) eye exam with refraction, no matter the reason for being there. You would be shocked how many times I have to convince parents who brought their child in for pink eye or a stye to let me do the full exam with drops and I find something unknown and unexpected.  Also vision screening from outside sources (pediatricians or schools) has gotten quite sophisticated and picks up many things earlier than they used to. </p>
</li>
<li>Do young children need to correct their vision?  Sometimes. I will accept small amounts of myopia or astigmatism without correcting early while explaining to the parents that glasses are likely coming &quot;down the road&quot;. But larger amounts or particularly  significant asymmetry between the two eyes is something that if uncorrected can lead to amblyopia (the brain not developing normal vision from one or both eyes) and will usually be corrected as well as refractive problems in the setting of other eye problems like crossing of the eyes. </li>
