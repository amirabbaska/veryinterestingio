		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A natural flavor from for example a  plant is a combination of 100s of different chemicals. But it may be mainly just one of those  100s that give a distinct flavor. So you would analyze the plant, figure out the chemical structures of what make up that plant. This is done using different methods and is like solving a puzzle without a final picture. You have a bunch of pieces of Information and you try to see what they can make. Once you know what the structures that make up a taste are you can try to make a few. This is done using experience from the past on how to put chemicals together to get a certain result. For example we know if we have an alcohol, and we add oxygen, we often get an aldehyde or keytone, ( a double bonded oxygen instead of a single bonded oxygen). also alot of guess work. Maybe one of the structures you produce sort of tastes like what you want to flavour. Then you can produce that taste.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other answers, you have to realize that as far as the law is concerned, artificial just means created in a lab. Remember, everything is chemicals. You could for instance analyse all the compounds in bananas and find the one that causes its flavour and then replicate it in a lab. Even though it is 100% the same stuff, it'd still be classified as artificial.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>I can't explain it really but... it has something to do with known compounds that produce certain smells/tastes. Esters is what I was thinking of, but it looks like there are also Terpenes that do the same thing.</p>
<p>If you go to the Wiki page you can see which compounds produce which smell.. it says they're also used in food to produce taste. There's probably a separate page for tastes somewhere. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
