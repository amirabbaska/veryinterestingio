		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're already trying.</p>
<p>The UN has this thing called the <a href="http://www.plant-for-the-planet.org/en/treecounter/our-target" target="_blank">Billion Tree Campaign</a>. As you can see, they claim to have already planted 14.2 billion trees.</p>
<p>But it gets interesting. As you can also see from that site, they want to plant <em>One Trillion</em> trees. Why is the goal of the &quot;Billion Tree Campaign&quot; to plant a trillion trees, you ask? Because nine years after the campaign was started, scientists discovered <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/09/02/scientists-discover-that-the-world-contains-dramatically-more-trees-than-previously-thought/?utm_term=.289b44da5070" target="_blank">the planet is home to 3.04 trillion trees, blowing away the previous estimate of 400 billion.</a></p>
<p>That said, <a href="http://www.els.net/WileyCDA/ElsArticle/refId-a0000322.html" target="_blank">algae is our best source of photosynthesis</a>. So combined with the facts there are literally already trillions of trees and that trees take up a lot more space than algae, planting more trees is not the best approach to curb global warming.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a similar question posted earlier: One of the best carbon-capturing trees is the Silver Maple. It can scrub 25,000 pounds of carbon in a 55-year useful lifespan (454.55 pounds per year). Coal-fired power plants in Pennsylvania (a moderate producer of CO2 from coal) produce 136 million tons of CO2 annually. This equates to 37,057,220.7 tons of carbon. (Atomic weight of carbon=12, of CO2=44). Now do the math. 37,057,220.7 tons / 454.55 lbs = 163,050,141 silver maple trees. For reforestation purposes, it's recommended you plant between 726 and 435 trees per acre. Using the average spacing, that's about 680 trees per acre. So to cancel Pennsylvania's annual coal-fired carbon, you'd need 239,779.61 acres of silver maple trees. Which is about 374 square miles (.31 Rhode Islands).    </p>
<p>Oh, The National Arbor Day Foundation sells Silver Maples for $6.98 each. You'd need to budget $1,138,089,984.18 for the project, not counting the cost of the land.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of carbon being in three buckets on earth.</p>
<p>1 - the atmosphere</p>
<p>2 - the biosphere and </p>
<p>3 - sub surface</p>
<p>we are pulling the carbon out of the subsurface bucket and placing it in the other two buckets. Planting trees may help to remove carbon from the atmosphere but it only stores the carbon for a short period of time. trees die, burn, etc, and release that carbon back into the atmosphere.</p>
<p>the main way carbon is removed from the atmosphere is the oceans. phytoplankton removes the carbon and when it dies, it sinks to the bottom of the ocean, is compressed and due to plate tectonics is slowly submerged underground. this is obviously a very slow process. thus, the only real method to reduce carbon emission in the long term at our disposal is to either stop pulling it out of the ground or else find a reliable, long term method to get it back into the ground.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Forestry technician here. Planting trees as well regenerative farming practices for soil depletion as well as algae  are our answers to global warming. As far as just planting trees is concerned you don't just need to plant them you need to cut them down too this is sequestering carbon and storing it in items that we can use. Trees are the most green renewable energy. Some things being made/synthesized from wood (I went to a woodlot confrence the other day) : jet feul, fibreglass, biomass, feul wood. Wood is also the second most stable solution to heating your home. More wood we use the better. sustainable forestry has been around for hundreds of years we just don't practice it efficiently enough and cleary do not care about our planet.    </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
