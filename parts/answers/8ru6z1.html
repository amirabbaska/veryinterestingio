<p>I know that most scientific findings aren't generally useful until we stumble upon a use for seemingly esoteric information, but I'm sure there's current technology that wouldn't be possible without this vast array of experimental data, and I'm highly curious how these experiments have affected our lives, or could soon affect our lives. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One experiment yet to be conducted is the long term effects of low (not zero) gravity on people. Like lunar or Mars gravity. We have lots of data about how bad microgravity is, but in between that and 1g?  We know nothing.  We'd basically need a rotating hub module added to the ISS to find out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
