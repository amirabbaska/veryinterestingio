		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, realize that this only works for people who have vision problems due to incorrect focusing of the light. For our eyes to work properly, incoming light must be focused down to the retina. When this does not happen, either because light is focused in front of the retina (a condition called myopia or nearsightedness), or behind the retina (hyperopia or long-sightedness), objects are various distances will look blurry since the image will be defocused, as shown graphically <a href="http://products.pbhs.com/_procedural-ophthalmology/point-of-focus.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now squinting can remedy this situation in two ways. One possibility is that the deformation created by squinting can partially offset the natural imperfection in the eye, and can thus bring the focal plane of the eye closer to the retina. This will effectively offset the initial optical aberration and allow you to see an imagine which is better focused and thus sharper.</p>
<p>The second possibility is more general, and results from the increase in depth of field created that results from decreasing the aperture (opening) through which light enters your eye. Because of this even an image that is equally out of focus will appear sharper because the higher depth of field means that the sharpness of the image decreases more slowly as you move away from the correct focus. To better visualize this second effect, take a look at <a href="http://damienfournierdotco.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/dof_aperture_7guitars.jpg" target="_blank">this series of images</a>. Notice that as you decrease the opening of the lens, an increasingly large part of the field of view appears clear. This exact same effect is at play when you reduce the size of the opening into your eye (you can get a similar effect from looking at objects through an index card with only a small opening allowing light through).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I think this is something easier understood with a diagram, I took the liberty of making one, though it's extremely approximate and doesn't show things like the refraction of light through the cornea.</p>

<p>Top left you see an ideal eye. The lens focuses incoming light to a focal point on the retina (the red area), and that focal point is relatively small.</p>
<p>Top right you see a myopic (near-sighted) eye. The lens focuses light in the same way, but because the eye is elongated, the focal point is actually in front of the retina, and what hits the retina is a somewhat unfocused image (not to mention upside-down, but our brain adjusts for that).</p>
<p>Bottom center you see a myopic eye that's squinting (your eyelids visualized by the orange horizontal lines). Because the angles of the incoming light vectors are necessarily more shallow, there's less &quot;spread&quot; of the rays between the focal point at the retina, hence the perception of a clearer image.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In optometry its called the pinhole effect. By squinting we reduce the paraxial rays coming. Blur is a spread of a light and by creating a pinhole we reduce that spread thus making vision clearer.</p>
<p>but how does the spread make vision worse? well if there is a spread where in a field of adjacent points, the spread melts over the adjacent points losing detail.</p>
<p>that's my simplified/clinical take on it. im sure there a good explaination involving MTF and retinal sampling somewhere the fuel tank, but hopefully thats enough for you to understand!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
