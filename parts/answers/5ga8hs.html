		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of theories for this one. </p>
<p>One of my favorites is the display of physical fitness -- fitness being, higher in the order of natural selection, favored evolutionary adaptations, and/or a good gene pool.</p>
<p>Nice straight, white teeth? Still <em>have</em> all your teeth? We implicitly read that as &quot;Good genes&quot;! We like to show them! We like to show others that we are a fit member of society! We like to sometimes also show others that we are a <em>fitter</em> member than they are!</p>
<p>There are some tribes based in Africa who display this well. The males gather around and show off the whites of their eyes and the whiteness of their teeth, to show that they are the best selection for mating, for the local females. They have the best genes, they will be the best reproducers, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The big toothy grin is a variation on the more general play/happy expression you can also see in chimps</p>
<p><a href="http://www.chimpsanctuarynw.org/blog/2013/09/chimpanzee-smiles/" target="_blank">http://www.chimpsanctuarynw.org/blog/2013/09/chimpanzee-smiles/</a></p>
<p>Note that here, as with many human smiles, the upper teeth and canines are <em>not</em> bared.  That's a human things and is rarely meant playfully in any other mammal.</p>
<p>Why is this unique to humans?  My theory is this:  Nearly all primates, and quite a few mammals in general, use their teeth to fight.  Primates do a lot of biting, and males often have big canine teeth that they use for this purpose.  Baring your teeth means showing off the weapons.  But humans <em>don't</em> have big teeth and we <em>don't</em> usually fight with them.  We've got knives and spears and things for that, and have for a <em>very</em> long time.   </p>
<p>For humans, showing all the teeth doesn't mean showing off the weaponry, and that freed up the original smile to get exaggerated into a grin that wasn't considered threatening.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Smiles likely evolved from fang flashing. Fang flashing in higher order apes is not a sign of aggression. It's a sign of appeasement. It's says, &quot;here, take my spot, dominant male. I'm cool. No worries.&quot; And in Chimpanzees this expression happens among friends/equals, often. Even when they haven't seen each other for long periods of time. They may flash teeth, then hug.</p>
<p>Evolutionarily speaking... humans evolved from something that was ape-like or what apes were during the time of our ancestors. We have to make assumptions about behaviors set against our understanding of those apes today that our ancestors could have been most like. It could be that we never did any fang flashing. Could be that we did it all the time. It could be that we are another chimp species. But showing teeth seems in higher order apes to be an appeasement strategy. Kind of like making eye contact with a passing stranger and giving them the fake :-| smiley face. </p>
<p>Also, according to newer studies, basic facial expressions are innate, and babies in the womb will smile (as captured by hifi ultrasound). Comparing expressions of sighted people and blind people has also suggested this. They make the same basic faces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I had heard the smile is the primate fear face. Expressing fear is similar to expressing, &quot;I am not a danger to you.&quot; Which is very like &quot;I am accepting of you.&quot; If you see chimpanzees showing fear, it is not far from a human smile. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an anthropological question. Essentially it can be classified as an instinct. All humans have 5 basic facial emotions. I believe they are happy, sad, excited, angry, and pain. I could be wrong, there might be 6 now.... so if an anthropologist is reading this, please clarify, but I know these are one of the &quot;basic&quot; laws of anthropology. I'm a geologist myself so cut me some slack. So how do we know this... from isolated civilizations or tribes. When we've encountered Amazonian's or the &quot;Kung&quot; people of Africa. They exhibited these 5 basic emotions thru facial features even though we had no common language to share (Arrival!!!). These people had no outside contact, before we discovered them. So thus, why do they smile like we do? Why not frown when happy? Simple, because their muscular make-up of their skull is similar to our own. It's ingrained in our DNA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
