		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sensory information is represented in 'maps' in your brain. Meaning a certain small area in your brain (eg if you poke the back of your head, your primary visual cortex is around that area. If you poke the top of your head your primary somatosensory (skin sensations) is located around there. So zoom in to the top area on your brain, like really zoom in until you start to see cells. The cells are arranged in a sheet. If you move along a certain direction on the sheet of cells, the activity of those cells represents a continuous area of skin sensation on your body. These sensory cells then send signals to other areas of your brain (approx around top of forehead) which have 'goal related' brain cell activity. As in some cells are active and that represents the goal that you have, like 'i want this object'. </p>
<p>Now ultimately your behaviour (for example searching for an object) is just a sequence of muscle movements (for example to move your eyes, visual search. Or arm muscles to make reaching/grasping). &quot;Attention&quot; has to do with specifically what sense signals are used to program a movement. So maybe the object is in your hand. But the physical area of sensory cortex being investigated isn't the correct position of the object. So in this example. Maybe the cells in your frontal cortex (responsible for your goal of 'i want this object') is looking at the vis sensory cells in more detail than the sensory cells that represent skin sensation). So takes a bit longer to &quot;find&quot; the object in this particular event. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is too much information coming through our senses at any given time for our brains to process.What we refer to as 'attention' is our ability to focus on some aspects of sensory input at the expense of others.  When we miss something that might seem obvious because attention is elsewhere, we call it 'Inattentional blindness'.  There is a famous experiment where most people miss a Gorilla walking though a basketball game! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vJG698U2Mvo" target="_blank">ref</a>.  In the sace of your keys, your attention is focused on vision and not on on touch. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sensory Adaptation. For example, when you go looking for your sunglasses but they are already on your head. After the sunglasses have been sitting on your head for a while, you may not feel them because you adapt to the sensation of the sunglasses weight and pressure. My prof, said after a short period  of time the brain will adapt and then disregard the sensation as a way to save energy and focus for other things.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes this is related to habit &quot;subroutines&quot; we have created. For example, one of my habit routines is to grab my keys, wallet, phone when I walk out of the door. I do this without thinking about it, but if I'm on the phone when I go grab my wallet and my keys I might have a hard time finding my phone because my subroutine is used to it being there. Then my conscious brain has to take over and figure out that I'm an idiot and that the phone is already in my hand because I'm talking on it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can think about the brain working in 2 modes, one is the Subconscious mod (or auto-pilot) and the Conscious mod. Due to evolution the brain is mostly relying on the &quot;auto-pilot&quot; when we do simple tasks like walking or breathing.
When we do something like talking on the phone and looking for the phone to use the flashlight, the brain thinks about the phone and the flashlight as 2 separate objects.In that moment our brain being on auto-pilot doesn't realize that until we think about what we are doing, which consumes energy, that why sometimes the brain makes mistakes trying to conserve energy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
