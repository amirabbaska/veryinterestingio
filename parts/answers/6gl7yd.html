		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see many answers in this thread were some are blatantly trying to state only the negative side of one or the other. What it really boils down to is a matter of what the countries are striving for and how they hope to achieve that. </p>
<p>Europe in general, and very much as an example Sweden(where I live), stand by the belief that education should be available to all no matter where you were born or in what situation. This has it's obvious downsides and upsides. There are small fees in some schools but those are around the 800$ range for an entire 4 year program. For this to be possible, taxes are alot higher than in the U.S, especially income taxation. Schools are also completely without sports programs and a lot of other things because it's there to educate and nothing more.</p>
<p>As someone said, why most swedes are basically united on this political topic(it's rarely, or dare i say never brought up in parties campaigns). Is because this is how it's always been and most believe that the equal possibility for education will in turn make the countries economy stronger through an educated population. </p>
<p>(I also saw someone say that uni-professors are paid poorly in Europe. This could be compared to the U.S., ofcourse true, but the fact is that in Sweden it's one of the most well paid professions under the governments control. I know this because my girlfriends dad is a professor in engineering at a very large public school in Stockholm.)</p>
<p>I can't say I know a ton of how the loaning system works but from spending a fair amount of time in the U.S. I can tell you that it mostly boils down to that the capitalistic train of thought that is that if can't promise that you will, or have already, worked for it, you dont deserve it. Some believe that the perks heavily outweigh the consequences. For example the sports programs and the (debateably) higher quality of education. Some may instead argue that the capitalistic system along with higher level schooling splits society by wealth and lets school charge a lot more than many can afford because the demand of schooling is enormous in a world where a degree is almost required to land a job with deceny pay. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My accounting professor used to go on rants about various subjects and this happened to be one of them. His position was that Universities in the United States were so expensive due to the relatively easy access to various forms of student aid. His argument was that if the schools were confident that every incoming student could procure a certain amount of student loans and grants then they would simply adjust their tuition to match this amount in order to maximize revenue. As long as the government kept increasing financial aid limits the schools could raise tuition levels without worrying about students not being able to pay for it. I don't know how truthful this is for non profit Universities, but I have noticed that the &quot;for profit&quot; Colleges and technical schools set their tuition costs at exactly the dollar amount of government student aid a student can receive for the period of instruction, usually with nothing left over for living costs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As was said, it's because of taxpayer dollars that universities in Europe are cheaper.</p>
<p>I, personally, think it's the best system because of a few things.</p>
<ul>
<li>A) Having an educated populace is essential to the growth, economy and success of a country</li>
<li>B) It reduces debt, making it so people don't have to start in the red when they leave college, so that leads to having more disposable income, which can be used to stimulate the economy and/or pay tax dollars.</li>
<li>C) Combining both of those things, it leads to a stronger economy which would increase tax revenue.  Leads to better employment, which would reduce the strain on welfare and etc. etc.</li>

<p>We pay lots of tax.</p>

<li>
<p>Our tax gets used to make education free.</p>

<p>More of us become more educated. </p>

<li>More of us get quality jobs and pay lots of tax. </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>College education is a business in America. It has been increasing exponentially since the 1980s, far past the rate of inflation. Granted, American universities have added some more services in that time... but, taxpayer funding for public universities has been largely been reduced in those years as well. </p>
