		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There was a point about the American chestnut tree being great at carbon fixing, and how GMO trees could be used as a carbon dump. </p>
<p>What sort of genetic modifications need to happen here, and have there been studies on how this could be deployed? Would these trees have to be grown from terminator seeds in order to prevent the GMO chestnut from wreaking havoc? </p>
<p>And, as weird as this question may be, has the ecological impact of planting a fuckton of one tree been studied? Are there any field tests?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Unless I'm mistaken that would mean each human eats only 0.0015 lb of food to sustain themselves per day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the video it's mentioned that &quot;terminator seeds&quot; were never used because of the public outcry, wikipedia says the same. Yet I constantly see some form of the following argument: &quot;GMOs are bad because the seeds are sterile and so the farmers are forced to buy new seeds every year&quot;. Is this a misunderstanding on their part or is there something else to this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They missed (or didn't have time to fully explain) that herbicide tolerance isn't only a GMO issue.  There's plenty of examples like Liberty Link and Clearfield corn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetically_modified_maize#Marketed_products" target="_blank">(glufosinate and imidazoline herbicide tolerant)</a> or sunflowers (glyphosate tolerant through mutagensis) that got their herbicide tolerance through breeding techniques that aren't considered genetic engineering.  Of course there's also herbicide tolerant weeds  that aren't genetically engineered either.</p>
<p>Also GMO's can become the new organic seemed to be a weird comment as its really not the goal.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
