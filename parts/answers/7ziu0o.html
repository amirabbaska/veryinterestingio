		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The really simple answer is that humans run more efficiently because we let gravity do a lot more of the work; when we go forward we're basically putting one foot out and falling forward, then pulling ourselves forward and repeating the process with the other foot. When quadrapedal animals run, they need to propel themselves forward with their front and back legs; the advantages of this are that they can put more of their total muscle mass into running and you get more sources of speed, and run faster/quicker; pretty much any quadraped can out-sprint a human. But humans are the undisputed champions of distance-running on Earth, partly because their run is more energy efficient.</p>
<p>The other thing that helps us run, just as a sidenote, is the fact that our bodies are really good at not overheating. A cheetah for instance can only keep up their vaunted 60 mph run-speed for a very short distance without overheating and exhausting themselves. But our ability to have the airflow of our forward motion wick heat away by evaporating sweat off of us is one of nature's best heat regulation mechanisms, and allows for humans to run for hours on end without stopping, when properly trained.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes it takes more energy to run with 4 limbs vs 2. This is one reason that humans are such good endurance sprinters. Being able to run 15+ miles non stop is fairly uncommon in the animal kingdom, where as humans in good shape can do that fairly consistently. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Efficiency depends on the animal, actually.  Animals that run all the time, horses and deer for example, have tendons in their legs that act like bouncy springs, conserving quite a bit of energy.  On the other hand, bears for example, lots of muscles in their limbs, but more for killing prey and climbing trees, not as efficient at running as a horse.</p>
<p>To answer your own question, what takes more energy, running on 4 legs or 2, take an animal that can do both, bear or gorilla for example, and ask yourself do they prefer to run on 2 legs or 4?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Running on 4 legs is more efficient, and allows for different gaits at different speeds.</p>
<p>Humans exceed at running long distances because we excel at removing excess heat from our bodies via our superior ability to sweat.
Sweating is the only thing we are truely better at physically when compared to anything else in the animal kingdom. We can chase animals to death not because of good technique, but the ability to stave off exhaustion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
