		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both. There are hormones in your body that are triggered when you have enough or are in need of glucose. These are known as leptin and ghrelin. Your grehlin levels increase as your body uses up the glucose. When you are consuming it, your body will produce insulin to process it, and also leptin, which inhibits the receptors the ghrelin attaches to, so you will lose that urge. There's another chemical called galanin that has a similar function for fats.</p>
<p>On the other side, there is a chemical called cholecystokinin that is released when your stomach and intestines fill, making you feel full and turning off your appetite.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungry" target="_blank">wikipedia article</a> does a good job of explaining it in simple terms. I would say the answer is neither. Hunger is a result of the activity of a number of hormones. Your stomach never needs volume. The signal (hormones) that you are hungry could be a false positive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In your most likely case, it's neither. In the typical modern person, hunger is actual a signal that you feel like you should eat because your used to doing that at regular intervals</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I understand its neither.  Some peoples hunger signals can get completely messed up and get hungry a lot to permanently regardless of food intake.  Not sure exactly the mechanism but its something in the brain not related to your current nutrition or emptiness.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
