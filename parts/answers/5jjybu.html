		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been reported that the very act of paying for Prime makes a customer spend significantly more on Amazon.</p>
<p>&quot;Customers double the amount they spend on Amazon after becoming a member of Amazon's subscription service Amazon Prime, according to a new research note published by Deutsche Bank.&quot;

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The United States has 54 million Amazon Prime members, so you have to consider just how massive that scale is. HBO, by comparison gets about 45 million. They charge more though, around $180 a year, but at the same time HBO puts out a lot more original content than Amazon.</p>
<p>As for free shipping, it really depends. Some stuff is very cheap to ship, so what happens is it just eats into their profit margin a bit. If on a $40 item they'd usually get $20 markup (typical retail markup), and they spend $4 to ship, then they still get $16. For a brick and mortar retailer this could be disaster, but Amazon makes up for it, again, but having massive scale. They go for quantity sales rather than high markup on each unit.</p>
<p>Also, sometimes Amazon's prices are higher to make up for shipping costs. You might see something for $40 with free shipping on Prime, but a 3rd party seller has it for $36 +$4 shipping. In these instances, the shipping isn't free, it's build into the price.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is what is called a loss leader. Imagine if everyone sold cookies for $1 - $2 per cookie (in order to make a profit). You sell your cookies for $0.5. You build up brand loyalty and people will love the taste of your cookies. Imagine if you put your cookies in a store. Now people will simply drive to the store to go buy your cookies since they are so much cheaper than the other ones. </p>
<p>Let's say that you are not making a profit from selling those cookies. In fact, you are losing 10 cents for every cookie sold. However, when people come to buy your cookies, they aren't just buying your cookies and leaving. While buying your cookies, they may see brownies that are for sale, or sandwiches for $5, something like that. While your cookies don't make you money, the store, with its increased amount of customers, can make money from customers buying other products.</p>
<p>This is the same as Amazon. Their loss leader, instead of cookies, is Amazon Prime. For $99 you get free shipping and more incentives to visit their site. With their clever marketing (spying) tactics, they can find out what exactly you want, and make you more prone to buying it. For example, I don't go to the amazon website unless there's a sale happening or if I'm looking for something very specific. If you go to the amazon website every day for movies, then you might see &quot;$3 for 500 cookies! buy now!&quot; while opening the page. Then you might get interested in something you would've never seen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Amazon is a volume business. Its profit margin is roughly 1.5% which means it sees very little profit from each item or service that is sold.
By offering the prime membership people are more likely to purchase the item they need on Amazon which increases the volume. The higher volume makes it so most fixed costs, such as equipment, have their cost spread over many items.
We also live in a world of &quot;big data&quot;. Amazon uses all the information you give it about TV shows, music, items, and more to be able to guess what you will want to buy next. Even better they can use the data of others to help understand what your future interests will be, again this helps increase the volume.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers are a good try, but no one has actually offered the real reason. </p>
<p>Amazon operates on a deficit with most of their business units in the name of aggressive expansion. Many of these ventures are funded by their Amazon Web Service (AWS) revenue, which they make money hand over fist from. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
