		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I actually just wrote a research paper on this in my Federal Tax Research course:</p>
<p>An important thing to understand is that when you talk about the IRS filing your taxes for you, you're actually talking about free-filing. First of all, free-filing is already used, and has been used to the extent that you refer (the government gathers the data) in California with the ReadyReturn and Calfile programs. It is totally usable for income earners that do not file with itemized deductions, which is a majority of tax filers. On a national level, free-filing has been used by the IRS for quite a long time (since 2001), but not many people take advantage of it. This leads to my second point: tax return filing is a huge lobbying market for tax software providers like Intuit (TurboTax), and this keeps change from happening.</p>
<p>As mentioned in 2001, the &quot;Free File Alliance&quot; was formed with the hopes of making tax return preparation free for low income people, as well as making electronic filing the norm. The IRS formed the Free File Alliance with tax software companies, because they had the software, and made an agreement that those companies had to make a free filing software available on their sites and the IRS site. This software would have had to be usable by around 60% of income earners. The program has maxed at almost 3% of taxpayers actually taking advantage of it since its inception. After 2001, there was some growth in use, but since then pretty much none. Why is this? Because the free file alliance was formed by the IRS moreso to make electronic filing prevalent. This was achieved in 2011 when it reached it's goal of 80% electronic filing. Since then, the terms of the alliance have actually been amended in the favor of tax software companies, and further made binding until 2020. This means that hopes for free filing is in the hands of tax software companies, those who have a direct interest in making sure free filing does not become a thing, and any questions about free filing are answered with &quot;we have a Free File Alliance set up already.&quot; An important thing to note, and some will already know, is that Intuit DOES provide free filing. The catch? They make you pay to have that information prepared for your state returns, which isn't covered by the Free File Alliance. So, you're technically still paying to have your taxes done if you live in one of the majority of states that require state income tax.</p>
<p>There's some more history behind this as far as the efforts in California involving Intuit lobbying against politicians who were for free filing programs in the state. Calfile also provides free state returns, which gives reason to Intuit's concern. I also did the numbers in my report, and estimated that the Unites States could save somewhere around 16 billion dollars if everyone who could would take advantage of the tax-funded filing system in California right now. The thing is that free filing only affects tax software companies: accounting firms and even higher end tax prep providers would still have their higher income tax payers coming to them. I came to this conclusion by showing the increase in tax-service revenue from big four firms (mainly attributable to greater focus on tax consultation).</p>
<p>Other people will most likely argue that the accumulation of data and automated tax preparation is an invasion of privacy, which would obviously be prevented by notice that you want it done manually. Anyone with higher income, and thus an opportunity for itemized deduction would do the same. Free-filing is for the majority of people who have low income, for which software is already proven to be able to handle.  </p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong>
The ability to have data accumulated and prepared for taxes by the IRS/federal government/state governments is definitely viable. However, automated tax preparation also assumes free-filing. Tax software companies, like Intuit, have control over any efforts of the government handling preparation (and thus making it free) through the use of agreements and lobbying. </p>
<p>EDIT:
I was asked to share my research paper. I would love to do so, but I would probably regret it as I still question some of my estimates in hindsight. I do believe that there is definitely money to be saved nationally through free-filing. The Calfile program's highest operating budget was $125,000 and highest annual returns filed was 278,000. That's $0.45 per return, and could be much less on a larger, national scale. Here is a link to a very good NYTimes article I used as well as the official Free File Alliance agreements. I will not be able post links to data because it was scattered across maybe 30 or so sources. Feel free to do your own research:

<p>EDIT 2: I've seen a lot of people say that TurboTax is now allowing free state filing as well. I definitely respect Intuit for making this move, because I do think that is part of their corporate social responsibility. The main point is that they do have control of the future of tax preparation though. Whether that is right or wrong is up to you and your opinions on capitalism. What I am more concerned with is that Intuit is making ethical decisions and fulfilling its corporate social responsibility under the current circumstances, which it seems it may have started doing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This has nothing to do with data available today but more to do with a tax system that was developed in the 1913s, changed in 1985 and hasn't been updated since.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, back in the day, the IRS had no idea of your life situation and if you received money outside of your day job unless it was reported to them as a wage.  A lot of what was done was done over paper.</p>
<p>With today, where everything is reported to the IRS digitally and a few seconds on their part, they can find out anything about you, they could potentially do that.  But there are outside factors that can change your taxes from 1 year to the next.  Donations, getting married, getting divorced, kids, gains from a death in the family, etc, can all impact your taxes that can't otherwise be seen by the IRS unless reported to them.</p>
<p>Ideally, if your income, donations, family structure, etc. hasn't changed at all, then yes you could literally take the same tax return from the year before and re-report.</p>
<p>The other aspect is that the IRS still uses a lot of older systems similar to most other government agencies.  This can bog down their system and since there's only a handful of them and 100s of millions of U.S. adults who work, that's a lot to process.  It's just easier to get those 100s of millions to send in their taxes and check to see if everything is correct vs having to generate 100s of millions of reports to people, have them check it, then send back.  People are inherently lazy, so its easier to make people send in the information vs waiting to receive feedback.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Norway here. 25 years ago we did what you suggest, and started sending out prefilled tax returns with all the information the government already had. For everyone with uncomplicated taxes, that meant all you had to do was check that the numbers was accurate, sign the prefilled form and send it in.
About 10 years ago they ditched the signature as well. Now you just get a text message to check your numbers online, and change them if they are inaccurate. If everything is ok you don't have to do anything. If you have an uncomplicated economic life and you trust the system, you can just ignore the whole tax thing, everything is automatic.</p>
<p>They are constantly evolving the system, in order to expand what uncomplicated means. They do this both by automating information from ever more sources, as well as simplifying the tax laws.</p>
<p>The government apparently saved billions doing this, and society as a whole certainly benefited from it, since we no longer have to spend time doing unpaid work filling in unneccessary forms.</p>
<p>I can only speculate why the US doesn't do this. You seem to have an industry dedicated to figuring out people's taxes. That's totally unproductive, just simplify the tax laws and the need for this industry vanishes.
Complicated deductions might also be holding you back. Incentivizing certain behavior using the tax system can be great, but do it in a way that can be automated. Walking your old neighbors dog for free is nice, but shouldn't give you a tax deduction since no sane government could know that about you. Giving tax deductions for driving an electric car is fine though, as long as the IRS can access a registry over who owns what car and the registry shows which cars are electric. That way the deduction could be completely automated. Taxes do not need to be complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Look up &quot;real time tax.&quot; The IRS has actually looked into online systems that would make filing into a process where you log in, review the data the IRS has for you, and then either affirm or edit the information and submit.</p>
<p>It would result in massive savings for businesses and taxpayers through reduction of paperwork and time invested and increase tax compliance and revenue by reducing tax fraud, but the IRS budget is a political football and they can't even get the money they need to answer the phone (look up IRS courtesy disconnects) much less modernize the tax filing system. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you are describing can definitely be achieved using pre-filled forms. Ideally, the IRS would send you a tax return with all numbers available to the IRS filled in the correct spots. You would then review and make sure it is correct. You could even bring it to a tax professional to look it over for you. </p>
<p>What's stopping this from happening is the many parties that are interested in making sure your return remains complex. These parties include companies like Intuit (TurboTax) and H&amp;R Block. A lot of their business would disappear overnight, as they handle a lot of the more basic returns that only include income and the standard deduction. </p>
