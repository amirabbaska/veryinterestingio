		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1.) your mind doesn’t need to run through the scenario in real time. It can speed up each event so that you process more events in less time.</p>
<p>2.) your mind doesn’t generally process each scenario completely. For example, you can imagine yourself walking from your curb to your front door, but it’s unlikely that you know the exact number of steps between your curb and your front door. Your mind isn’t processing every single step you would take in the scenario, and therefore your mind doesn’t need the exact number of steps in order for you to imagine the scenario.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain stores all your life experiences in similar scenarios and goes through them.
It can do this because your brains computing power far exceeds any man made processor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about it this way. Your brain is a computer and every cell is a processor.</p>
<p>Distributed data processing is the technical term for what's going on. Whereas an actual computer must go through a long list of if/then type scripts and commands, it can technically only make one process decision at a time per processor.</p>
<p>Organic chemistry and neuroscience do not care about these limitations</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
