		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gameboy and calculator screens reflect light, just like how every other normal object works. Thus, just like any object, the more light you have shining on it, the better you can see it. Just like shining a light on a book makes it easier to read at night.</p>
<p>Phone screens, on the other hand, <em>generate</em> light. Having outside light shining onto the phone screen kinda overpowers the phone's lights a bit, making it harder to see. Just like how having a ton of lights in the city overpowers the incoming starlight, making city nighttimes look black and starless.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gameboy devices used transflective displays, so they reflect light as well as emit it.</p>
<p>The majority of phone screens are just transmissive (only generate light)</p>

<p>Phones don't use transflective displays because they're more expensive and produce lower quality colors</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The phone is designed so you can read the screen using the backlight, but in the presence of another light that's brighter than the phone (such as the Sun) the backlight can no longer do its job.</p>
<p>Calculators, watches and older gameboys were designed without a backlight, so they have a reflective layer that is designed to rely on light from an outside source. That's why attachments could be used that shine a light on the screen to help you see. The original version of the GBA SP also used the same type of screen and had an integrated &quot;front light&quot; to allow you to play in the dark.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gameboy and digital watches rely on light around you to see what's on the screen.  The black pixels are there to keep light from going past and bouncing off the grey background back to your eyes.</p>
<p>LCD phones rely on a lightbulb/tube/LED behind the screen glowing to show you what's on the screen.</p>
<p>The bright sun makes it great for Gameboy and the black on grey LCD watches but the sun is brighter than those light bulb/tubes behind the LCD screens on phones so it gets washed out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Game Boy screens were designed to reflect light. It's like how if you go into a dark room with a mirror, it will be hard to see. If you go into the sun, the mirror will reflect more light.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, backlit screens on phones emit light. It's like how if you go into a dark room, the light will be the brightest thing, but if you go into the sun, it will appear washed out.</p>
<p>The reason why this happens is because when it's dark, your pupils (eyes) open up to allow more light to enter. It matches the brightness of the brightest object, which is the screen you are looking at. When it's bright due to the sun, your pupils close up and allow less light to enter. This means very little light from the screen can get in and it seems dark by comparison.</p>
<p>I think the Game Boy Advance SP (or one of them) used to allow users to toggle the backlight for this reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
