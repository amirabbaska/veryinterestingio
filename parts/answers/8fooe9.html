<p>You couldn't possibly to expect the person who calls 911 to pay. If that was the case I would watch you die right in front of me before I would call for help. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think I need to step in and clarify a few things here.</p>
<p>First, as others have mentioned, if you're in a state of mind to refuse an ambulance, you can go ahead and do that. </p>
<p>Now, I don't care what country you live in, if you get taken somewhere by ambulance, <em>someone</em> is paying for it. If you're in a country with socialised healthcare, it's the government. </p>
<p>The US is thought by most people (including Americans) not to have socialised healthcare, but this is only partially true. There are many government programs that pay for healthcare. More now than a decade ago, imperfect as the new ones are and hobbled as they re becoming. So there's a decent chance that if you are an American and someone called you an ambulance, the government (federal or local) is paying for it.</p>
<p>Barring that, you probably have private insurance, and <em>they</em> are the ones who will pay for it. Now, many private insurance programs will have various fees and copays for services, including ambulance service, <strong>but this is not uncommon in countries with socialised medicine</strong>, either. Your insurance might be charged a few thousand dollars, and you'll have to pay $100 out of that (or more, or less -- depending on the program you chose). </p>
<p>Only if you have <em>no</em> insurance will you be billed directly yourself. </p>
<p>And when that happens, that's when it makes a huge noise and people outside the US hear about how someone in the US is now $100,000 in debt because of medical costs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
