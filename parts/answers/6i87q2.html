		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The hydrostatic pressure depends only on the depth. So the pressure is the same in all of your scenarios. This is not in contradiction to the description of hydrostatic pressure arising from the weight of water above you.</p>
<p>Quick and dirty calculation: pressure <em>p</em> is force per unit area, hence it is the weight of a given column of water above some fixed area divided by that fixed area. Hence <em>p</em> = mg/A = ϱgV/A = ϱgAh/A = ϱgh. (Here ϱ = density of water, g = acceleration due to gravity.) So we see that the pressure at depth <em>h</em> is <em>p</em> = ϱgh, and this depends only on <em>h</em>, not on the total mass or total volume.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>edit:</strong> <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SZpcw8S.gif" target="_blank">Here is a picture</a>. Yes, only the depth matters. All of the questions of the ilk &quot;what if I made a container in this shape or that shape, or what about this?&quot; can all be answered by &quot;only the depth matters&quot;. It may seem non-intuitive, but that's the answer.</p>
<p>So what <em>is</em> the difference between the containers? Does it affect <em>anything</em>? Yes, of course. The <em>total force</em> on the walls of the container will depend on the cross-sectional area.</p>
<p>For example, consider two identical right circular cones (base radius <em>R</em> and total height <em>H</em>), which are each filled with water. One cone is inverted (so the tip is on the bottom) and the the other cone is upright (so the tip is on top). To lighten up notation later, note that the total mass of water in each cone is the same and given by <em>M</em> = πϱR^(2)H/3.</p>
<p>(I should also mention that since force is a vector, the calculation below is not really the net force. In fact, the net force on both cones is <strong>0</strong>. What I am really calculating is the total hoop stress on the cones. What's important is not really the net force vector, but how these force vectors give rise to different strains.)</p>
<p>The (gauge) pressure at the bottom of each cone is the same; it's just *p*<em><em>bottom</em></em> = ϱg<em>H</em>. The total stress on the walls of each cone, however, are not the same. They are, respectively for the upright and inverted cone,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>*F*<em><em>upright</em></em> = 2Mg*(H/R)</p>
<p>*F*<em><em>inverted</em></em> = Mg*(H/R)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, the total stress on the walls of the upright cone is <em>twice</em> the total stress on the walls of the inverted cone. Why? More of the upright cone lies at a larger depth. This is why dams are thicker at the bottom. Since the pressure increases with depth, the lower part of the dam feels more force than the upper part of the dam. So the lower part of the dam has to be stronger to compensate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.</p>
<p>Your depth gauge or div computer that you'll be using will show the depth you're at (add 1Bar for every 10m down) will show the same reading whether you dive a tiny pool, a water pit, an olympic pool or the ocean. </p>
<p>The fun science'y part is that as long as you equilize your ears, you don't feel a change in pressure even at 40m down. </p>
<p>Good luck with the course and come tell us about it over at /r/scuba </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>imagine a 1 cm wide 10 meter column of water standing on your head – the weight of the water on that 1 cm point on your head is essentially the pressure on that 1 cm. Now if you're in a pool 10 meters down the weight of the water on top of you is the pressure your body is experiencing. It doesn't matter whether you are 10 meters down in an ocean or in a 1 meter column pool</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose I have a slab of steel that it four feet by four feet by <del>sixty</del> one hundred feet. Through the magic of precision craftsmanship a cavity is made on the bottom that is me shaped plus .25 inches all around. Additionally a .25 inch hole is drilled from the top to the cavity. Now I get into this space and it's filled with water to the level of my nose. This takes a modest amount of water, perhaps ten gallons. I'm totally fine standing in this water. Now Moriarty takes a three gallon bucket of water and goes to the top and fills the tube. It takes less than a gallon to fill the rest of the cavity from my nose to the top of my head and then a quarter gallon to fill the one hundred foot tall, .25 inch diameter column. Does this two pounds of water instantly crush me to death? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As other people mentioned, pressure is constant at a given depth. The reason this question is confusing though, is because it is possible to apply a different amount of force by changing the area of the surface that the pressure is acting on. This is how a hydraulic press works <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_press</a>. But this only works because pressure stays basically constant inside the fluid.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
