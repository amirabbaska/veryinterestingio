		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=2&amp;v=sPScqP3mFKQ" target="_blank">Rapid temperature change, which also leads to a change in density.</a>  The density change pushes and pulls the molecules around it, applying mechanical force within and around the ice cube that breaks its crystal structure.  Water is actually most dense at 4 deg C.  It's very similar to you snapping a pretzel.</p>
<p>LTP: Glass refrigerator shelves can do the same, and produce a lot of glass pebbles as a result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun tidbit, the forces at play can, on rare occasion, cause the ice to crack with enough force to make a piece jump out of your drink.  I’ve witnessed a grand total of one time in my life.  It was spectacular.</p>
<p>The forces at play are similar in some ways to the “prince rupert’s Drop”.  Variable stress within the ice (or glass, in he case of the drop) pulling in multiple directions can sometimes cause explosive results.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes.  Rapid temperature change.  When I used to do HVAC work I once had a customer who ran his heat pump with a bad defrost timer for days.  He had a block of ice so thick it had protruded out of the outer covering of the unit, he had a giant block of ice in his backyard.    I tripped it into manual defrost mode and immediately heard a series of loud deep pitched knocking cracks in the sheet of ice because the source of the ice (the tubes that normally take the heat from outside to heat the home) was suddenly flooded with hot gas instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about the process of how water freezes. </p>
<p>1) We know water expands when it freezes
2) We know water freezes from the outside-in.</p>
<p>When you pour water into an ice cube tray, its liquid. The first thing that freezes is a very thin outer most layer. The water on the inside expands and pushes against that first solid layer but not so much that it breaks that layer. </p>
<p>This increased inside pressure is in equilibrium with the strength of the outside solid layer.</p>
<p>Again, freezing from the outside-in, a second layer is formed (inside the first), strengthening the combination of the outside layers. At the same time the liquid pressure inside increasingly pushes against the combination of outside layers because water is still expanding. </p>
<p>Freezing continues with the outside solid water becoming thicker &amp; thicker, while liquid inside pressure is increasing more, in equilibrium. Enormous potential energy is created.</p>
<p>-- So, when you drop the ice cube in water, the outer-most layer is melted immediately which breaks the equilibrium. The build up of pressure can not be contained anymore and the potential energy is  released immediately resulting in fracture.</p>
<p>Its not so much a rapid temperature change to the whole cube. What happens rapidly is the outer most layer melts. </p>
<p>This is a very generalized explanation, and I like it. Its not like we can actually witness layers being formed when water freezes. At a molecular scale, generally, the freezing from the outside-in does occur but it could be irregular around the the body of water that is freezing. </p>
<p>Regardless, it is this equilibrium that is maintained during freezing. And the crack is much like swiftly kicking a leg from under an elephant who has climbed to the top of a mountain.</p>
<p>TL;DR;
Water melts the outside of the ice which breaks the equilibrium of the pressure created during the freezing process, the pressure is released via fracture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Keep in mind this happens in larger scales too.  It always freaked me out when ice fishing as a kid when you'd hear a loud boom echo across the lake as a long crack went shooting between your legs.  It's a neat sound, but it's a bit unnerving if you aren't used to being on a frozen body of water. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
