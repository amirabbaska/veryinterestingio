		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Use a refrigeration cycle. Compress it and raise it's pressure (and thus temperature), cool it (reject heat) while at a relatively constant pressure, then expand the gas back to ambient pressure, thereby cooling it further.</p>
<p>Repeat this process using different coolants. Eventually: compress it a lot, cool with liquid nitrogen, expand it back out to some ambient pressure and it will condense into liquid helium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The current way labs experimenting with ultra-cold materials do it is to magnetically contain an amount of super-cooled (let's say helium) in a way that the magnetic containment looks like a cup with sloped sides. The most energetic atoms (highest temp) will eventually fall out of the &quot;cup&quot; leaving only the coldest behind. </p>
<p>In this way you can isolate only the coolest members of a material resulting in a lower temperature than the bulk material.</p>
<p>There is a really good Nova 2 parter about this called The Conquest of Cold. <a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/conquest-of-cold.html" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/tech/conquest-of-cold.html</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cold is the absence of heat. One way to cool something down is the passive way of equilibrium, put something cold near the object you're trying to cool down, and equilibrium will have heat travel from the warmer object to the colder one, cooling one and warming another. Another way would be to modify the properties within the PV=nRT gas laws. If you change one side, the other side will change as well to maintain equilibrium. To get the extreme cold temperatures, you'd heavily compress the gas, which will increase the temperature, then cool it down to a reasonable temperature like room temp, and once you expand it out, it will heavily cool down. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The normal way we make liquid gasses is to compress them, which makes them heat up, then cool them back down. Then you release the cold, high-pressure gas through a nozzle. When you drop the pressure of something, it becomes colder. The temperature drops to the condensation point, so some of the gas becomes liquid, which you collect. The remaining very cold gas is used to cool off the compressed gas in step 2, before being cycled back through the compressor.</p>
<p>Now helium is seriously weird in many ways, so you have to be careful in what pressures and temperatures you try to liquefy it at, but the basic idea is the same. Pressurise it, release the pressure, collect the liquid that is created and recycle the remaining gas.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally, we don't need anything cooler, just like your fridge doesn't need a constant supply of let's say ice cubes to keep your milk cool. And even if it would, you would need a way to freeze water to get these ice cubes. Simply speaking, cooling means nothing but reducing the average kinetic energy of the system, so you need a machine that does exactly this for you. Generally this is how it works:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampson%E2%80%93Linde_cycle" target="_blank">Hampson-Linde cycle</a> </p>
<p>The first step is to compress the gas, but by doing so you will actually heat it up above room temperature. You can now cool the gas by letting it equilibrate with a cooler environment. Now you can exploit the Joule-Thomson effect*, that states, that an expanding gas will cool down. So by expanding the gas into a bigger Volume, you will further reduce its temperature. You have to repeat this over and over again, but eventually you will end up with liquid helium.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>*Helium is actually a special case here as it will not reduce its temperature on expansion if its temperature is above a certain value. To actually exploit the Joule-Thomson effect in Helium for cooling you have to pre-cool it. For this you could use regular air that has been cooled below the critical value by using the same technique. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
