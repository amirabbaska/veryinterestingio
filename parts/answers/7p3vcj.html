		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we dream, we enter a period of sleep called REM (Rapid Eye Movement). We knows that this phase of sleep is strongly associated with sympathetic nervous system activity -- that's the part of the nervous system that is used for the &quot;fight or flight&quot; response. The chemicals that this activity releases (called catecholamines) make us feel anxious, and that is what you are feeling when you get up right after a nightmare. It's the same way you feel when you take a big test or, yes, are running from a tiger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One of the main theories about dreams is that they come from random neural activity, however you are semi-conscious. Essentially you are thinking (in a low state) however your thoughts are rather random, and they aren't well recorded so you don't remember them very well. When you feel emotions in your dream, you are actually feeling these emotions, so if you wake up, you may still be feeling the same emotions.</p>
<p><em>tl;dr</em>: When you're dreaming you're thinking, the emotions you feel in the dream are real, sometimes when you wake up you can still feel the emotions - other times you just don't remember the emotions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check out the book, &quot;The 24-Hour Mind&quot; by Dr. Rosalind Cartwright to learn more about the function of dreaming.  Dr. Cartwright suggests dreams are a function of the brain that exist to help bring a sense of internal congruence and reconciliation--a form of problem-solving. Our frontal lobe (which controls rational thought) reduces in function, while our lymbic and paralymbic areas (which deal with emotions) increase in function when we dream. Hence, dreams can have a highly emotional, albeit at times irrational, effect on us. </p>
<p>Nightmares are, more or less, problems we are struggling to solve. Combined with an overly-active emotional response, nightmares can easily evoke a sense of panic, which cause us to wake and possibly even remain panicked for a short time thereafter. This panic reduces as our front lobe becomes more engaged once we wake, but it may take a little time to &quot;kick in&quot;, so to speak. </p>
<p>TL;DR--The nightmare causes you to panic because your brain (which is to say, you) were struggling to solve some sort of internal dilemma and your brain released signals that illicit a fear response. The part of your brain that would tell you not to be afraid takes a little time fully activate and calm you back down. This is all perfectly normal. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
