		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you multiply two numbers together with the same base, you add their exponents to find the answer. </p>
<p>2^3 times 2^2 equals 2^5 </p>
<p>or 8 times 4 equals 32</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>x^0 * x^2</p>
<p>= x^(0+2) </p>
<p>= x^2 </p>
<p>= 1*x^2</p>
<p>so in the way that this was constructed, choosing x^0 = 1 makes the rule consistent when dealing with x^0</p>
<p>There is similar reasoning for the subtracting powers rule when dividing.</p>
<p>n! can be used to compute how many permutations of n items there are. that is, how many lists of n items where order matters.</p>
<p>e.g. you have an orange and an apple. You can arrange it to be {orange, apple} or {apple, orange}</p>
<p>2! = 2*1 = 2</p>
<p>If you only no items, there's only one way to order it. </p>
<p>The empty set { } </p>
<p>so from the viewpoint of using factorial to compute permutations</p>
<p>0! = 1 </p>
<p>is a good choice. There's probably other uses of factorial that I'm not aware of where 0! might be chosen to be something else so that it is consistent with that usage                 </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The same reasoning holds for both of these, and it's the same sort of reasoning that leads to x*0 = 0.</p>
<p>One of the nice properties about addition (and multiplication) is that the order you add things up in doesn't matter. If you want to find the sum of the list [1, 5, 3, 2, 7], you could add up the first three elements (1+5+3=9) and then add the last two (2+7 = 9) and then add those results together (9+9=18), or you could add up the first two elements (1+5=6) and the last three elements (3+2+7=12) before adding <em>those</em> together (6+12=18) and you'll get the same result.</p>
<p>We'd like this property to hold for <em>any</em> way of splitting [1, 5, 3, 2, 7] into smaller lists. For example, we'd like to be able to say that the sum over [1] plus the sum over [5, 3, 2, 7] is also 18, and since we know the sum over [5, 3, 2, 7] is 5+3+2+7 = 17, it must be the case that the sum over the single element [1] is just 1, as we might expect. But what if we split it up in an even more extreme way? What if we put <em>zero</em> elements in the first part of the sum and all five in the second? Then we'd have &quot;the sum over [] plus the sum over [1, 5, 3, 2, 7] is 18&quot;. But we already know the sum over [1, 5, 3, 2, 7] is 18, so the &quot;empty sum&quot; of zero objects must be 0. And it doesn't matter what the other elements in the list are - the empty sum will always end up being 0 through the same logic.</p>
<p>If we define multiplication as repeated addition, we have x*2 representing the sum over [x, x], x*3 representing the sum over [x, x, x], and so on. In particular, x*0 is the sum over [] and is therefore 0. So x*0 &quot;should be&quot; zero, if we want our definition of multiplication to be natural.</p>
<p>The exact same reasoning works with products, but with 1 as the value of the empty product. If the product over [2, 4, 3, 2] is 2*4*3*2 = 48, then we not only want the product over [2,4] times the product over [3,2] to equal 48 (which it does, since 8*6 = 48), but also the product over [] times the product over [2, 4, 3, 2] to equal 48, which implies the product over [] is 1. Then x^n is the product over [x, x, ..., x] with n copies of x, so that x^0 is the &quot;empty product&quot; and therefore 1. Similarly, n! is equal to the product over [n, n-1, ..., 2, 1], which is the empty product when n is 0.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In regards to your second question, it's mainly for the sake of continuing the sequence. </p>
<p>4! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 = 24 </p>
<p>We can then divide that by the greatest number to get 3!, And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>4!/4 = 3!, 3!/3 = 2!, 2!/2 = 1!</p>
<p>Since 1! is just 1, dividing it by the greatest/only number still leaves you with 1</p>
<p>Does that make sense?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
