		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Chinese Exclusion Act in the 1800s banned Chinese immigrants from doing pretty much any good jobs which drove Chinese Americans to slums.  Chinese food was considered dirty and for poor people as a result.  The act was repealed during WWII because China was considered an ally.  As a result Chinese food didn't really catch on in the US until fairly recently.  During this time, the majority of Chinese immigrants to America came from a handful of places in China, most of them ended up in New York, and most of them were illegal immigrants who found work in restaurant kitchens.  They adopted their cooking styles to what was locally available, i.e. General Tso's Chicken is just chicken nuggets smothered in sauce.  There's a very good documentary on Netflix called <del>General Tso's Chicken</del> The Search for General Tso which better answers your question.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Training. Newly arrived Chinese immigrants in America typically find that fast food Chinese restaurants are one of the few sources of employment opportunities due to their lack of English language skills and often times, lack of formal education. </p>
<p>So they start out by working and learning under an established Chinese restaurant. Then they save up some money and move further in-land to start their own Chinese restaurant. In time they will hire other Chinese immigrants who are either their relatives, or perhaps friends of their relatives, and before you know it you got Chinese restaurants in say, South Dakota, serving up the same food as one in NYC. </p>
<p>They cook the same dishes that the original restaurant in which they worked at cook, because they understand that's what Americans like to eat e.g. General Tso's, Sesame Chicken, Fried Chicken Wings, Crab Rangoon, etc. The menu is basically off a template and again there's a &quot;standard&quot; because many of the restaurants use the same printing company. </p>
<p>There are no &quot;pre-made&quot; versions of most of the main dishes: they are simple enough to make from scratch i.e. General Tso's is breaded chicken, stir fried with a simple sauce. However many of the appetizer items are indeed pre-made i.e. crab rangoon, dumplings, spring rolls etc. because they are rather labor intensive. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
