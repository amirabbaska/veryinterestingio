		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Anything that goes from being viscous to being rigid will act like glue, because it'll first conform to whatever surface it's touching, getting into all the nooks and crannies. Once it hardens, it'll grab on to said nooks and crannies, and be more or less difficult to remove.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To us metal pans look and feel smooth, but take a look with a microscope and it's a mountain range unlike any other. </p>
<p>The food and the material of the pan form chemical bonds, especially with protein rich food because they form more complex bonds. </p>
<p>Oil fills these mountain ranges and reacts with the heat causing a coating called patina. To prevent sticking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The interactions of proteins and heat can introduce the Maillard reaction which denatures the proteins into basic sugars that caramelize. If your pan is hot enough to cause the meat to stuck, turn the heat down and wait a couple minutes. Alternatively, you can add a couple tablespoons of water to create the steam separation between the pan and the protein. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simple answer? Proteins are sticky. They get stickier when they're denatured with heat. That's why you dab a little egg wash on the edges of pastry to seal them; the proteins in the egg are sticky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
