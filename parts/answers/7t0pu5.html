		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In 1848, Michael Faraday literally explained the science of candles to five-year-olds in a series of lectures. In his own words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is another condition which you must learn as regards the candle, without which you would not be able fully to understand the science of it, and that is the vaporous condition of the fuel. In order that you may understand that, let me show you a very pretty experiment. If you blow a candle out carefully, you will see the vapor rise from it. You have, I know, often smelled the vapor of a blown-out candle—and a very bad smell it is; but if you blow it out lightly, you will be able to see pretty well the vapor into which this solid matter is transformed. When I hold a lighted match two or three inches from the wick, you can observe a train of fire going through the air till
it reaches the candle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>engineerguy recorded himself giving the lectures with all of the practical demonstrations, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0INsTTU1k2UCpOfRuMDR-wlvWkLan1_r" target="_blank">put them on YouTube</a>. Here's the part where <a href="https://youtu.be/6W0MHZ4jb4A?list=PL0INsTTU1k2UCpOfRuMDR-wlvWkLan1_r&amp;t=364" target="_blank">he reads the paragraph above and does the experiment</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its kind of been answered, but I'll add my .02 if I may.</p>
<p>In theory, a perfectly efficient flame will have no smoke, because the fuel combusts with the surrounding oxygen, and in a perfect world, you will have C02 and H20 byproducts, both of which are a gas and invisible. But in the real world, it is difficult to get a perfect rate of combustion. Instead, we often get incomplete combustion, when there is too much fuel for the air to mix with. </p>
<p>In the case of a candle, while it's burning, you will often see a little wiff of smoke every now and then, since we cannot control the rate of which the wax burns (the wick and candle design can get it close, but not perfect). When you put out the flame, the fuel continues to vaporise, but is unable to burn and thus you have smoke. </p>
<p>This is the same for all sources of combustion. If your campfire is really smokey, stir up the wood and get some air flowing through it, bringing more flame and less smoke.</p>
<p>Old cars usually smoke more than newer more efficient cars, and in winter, a cold start generally has a lot of smoke because the engine is fed more fuel to help it run until it's at operating temperature. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact, this is more or less why backdrafts exist. Technically only gases burn - solids like wood or a candle wick, when exposed to sufficient heat, undergo a chemical reaction called pyrolisis, which basically just converts the solid compounds into flammable gases... which then burn. In order for fire to exist, you need the four elements of the fire tetrahedron: fuel, heat, oxygen, and a chemical reaction. When you blow out a candle, you temporarily separate the fire from its source of fuel and cool it off, extinguishing the flame. The candle is still off-gassing combustible fuel (smoke), but it is now too cool to combust.</p>
<p>Now take modern homes. They are insulated extremely well, to the point of being virtually airtight boxes, and they are stuffed full of petroleum-based synthetic materials (mattresses, couches, curtains, carpet, etc.), which burn like straight up gasoline. What happens is a fire starts, gets ridiculously hot, and generates an insane amount of fuel/smoke. It's a hungry, greedy bastard though, so it eats up all the oxygen in the house. Because there are no gaps in the windows and doors, there is no way for fresh air to come in and continue to feed the fire... so it goes out.</p>
<p>The problem is that the house is still very very hot, and it is absolutely stuffed full of unconsumed fuel that's ready to go. If you break a window or open a door, you might end up accidentally introducing oxygen back into the mix and causing a catastrophic reignition that looks something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnUA04wyHg4" target="_blank">this.</a></p>
