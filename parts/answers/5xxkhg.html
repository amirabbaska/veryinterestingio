		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a convention but you could consider it to have deeper significance. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoperation" target="_blank">Addition,  multiplying and exponents are all repeated applications of the former operation</a>.  Multiplication is repeated addition (4×3= 4+4+4) and exponentials are repeated multiplication (4^3 =4×4×4).  </p>
<p>You preform exponents before multiplication and multiplication before addition, essentially doing the highest order operation first as it consists of doing the lower order operations multiple times. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have said it is a convention, albeit a very useful convention that eliminates the possibility of incorrect interpretation by the reader while still being concise in its representation.</p>
<p>An alternative, perhaps even more concise and leaving less room for incorrect interpretation is reverse polish notation: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was probably for convenience sake that we calculate multiplications and divisions first over additions and subtractions because the latter are a more common operation, so we could cut down the amount of parenthesis we used. So it was likely agreed upon based on practicality. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
