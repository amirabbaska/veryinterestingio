<blockquote>
<p>Listing yourself leaves people no way to confirm anything that was mentioned in the comment. A source allows people refer to find more information or to verify what is being said. From a philosophical standpoint, stating that you are a source is counter to everything that science is about. It's telling people to take your word for it, and it reinforces the idea that people can claim to have expertise without backing up their assertions.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/pGLLx" target="_blank">Here is one from NASA,</a> <a href="http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=78592" target="_blank">with a description</a></p>
<p>The satellites used to take images of the Earth are usually in polar orbits so that they may cover more terrain.  There is no technological reason they cannot photograph the poles.  This lack of imagery is more likely caused by a lack of interest and money.</p>

<p>Google Maps doesn't display them because having high-res imagery of places where nobody lives isn't useful for Maps, it would just make the app slower. So they use low-res images.</p>
<p>Source: I work at the <a href="http://nsidc.org" target="_blank">National Snow and Ice Data Center</a>. We have lots of pictures of the poles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason they look funny on maps isn't because of lack of resolution per se, but rather because a round image projected onto a square map will always have distortion, and most map projections have extreme distortion near the poles. <a href="https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a000000/a003400/a003403/englehardt_still.0000.jpg" target="_blank">There are quality satellite images of the poles</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
