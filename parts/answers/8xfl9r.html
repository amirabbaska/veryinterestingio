		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey, I used to be abused. Not to a huge degree, but enough this it scarred me. So, the reason why is because they don't know anything else, and they think that the abuse is normal. It's what they grew up with, and what they were raised on. It's familiar to them. They are skeptical of those who are nice to them, because to them it's not natural.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They fear the unknown. They fear being alone. They fear that the next person they trust will be worse.  The human mind tends to displace trauma as a defense mechanism, so only the positive memories are easily accessible, leading them to look at the good times and not necessarily always reflect on the bad. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its called a “cycle of abuse” for a reason. Abusers don’t just continuously beat and/or abuse their partners. Usually there is a period of time right after the abuse where the abuser apologizes, tries to make things better with promises that things will get better. The partner caught in this cycle clings to those crumbs of love each time even through the inevitable anger/abuse that will eventually ensue once again because they know that there are good times mixed with the bad. If it were always a painful experience then leaving would make sense but unfortunately these relationships are a rollercoaster ride which always leads the victim to believe the abuser will eventually change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Studies have demonstrated that humans will prefer a situation that is uncomfortable and even unsafe to one that is unknown. Also, in many cases the abuser has conditioned the abused to believe that the abuser is a powerful, strong individual, and the victim is weak, undeserving of love, and in need of support.  But of course every situation is unique and saturated with its own context, history, etc, which makes a simplified answer really tough.
Good luck with whatever you or someone you care for is going through. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One explanation I saw recently is this:</p>
<p>Abusers have convinced their victims that there is a map through the minefield which is the relationship, and if the victim would <em>just try harder</em>, they'd figure out how to keep the abuser happy. You can't just run out of the minefield because you'd need a map not to die. So you NEED that map. Plus, the definition of a 'cycle' of abuse is that there's a blissful period where everything is great for the victim, and the abuser is incredibly accomodating. This provides fuel for the desire to return to the relationship.</p>
<p>Abuse, in a romantic, platonic, or family relationship, is illogical. It 'feels' wrong because it doesn't make sense to the victim - I've stepped here before and there was no landmine, why is there one here now? Maybe I'm stepping on it differently... Wanting answers, and wanting the honeymoon period back seems to come after escaping the cycle.</p>
<p>When I was dating a manipulative, arguably-abusive guy, I didn't feel that he was being unfair - I felt like I was too stupid to keep track of all of his preferences and I kept stepping on mines. It was a joke between us that I was forgetful, but somewhere along the line I started to try and keep track of every little thing so that I wouldn't somehow cross a line. When I finally broke up with him, I felt like there was so much unfinished stuff - I was so used to basing my thoughts around him that being disconnected was terribly painful at first. I wanted to go back to him to tell him what he had been doing wrong (I'd been crying too hard to talk when we broke up), but I also desperately wanted to know if he would ever adjust to me the way I adjusted for him. I will always remember how incredibly kind he was to me at the start, and the way he changed kind of haunts me - I swear it all changed in a month.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
