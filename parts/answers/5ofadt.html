		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Import tax be passed on to consumers by raising the price of imported goods?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For any goods that are imported, yes (which is a lot of them, at least in part). The idea is this incentivizes people to buy domestic goods, which will create more jobs domestically.</p>
<p>It also tends to hurt exporting businesses, because other countries will retaliate with their own tariffs. In addition, depending on what trade agreements are in effect, we can be fined.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How are American citizens being helped by paying more for the same products?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is that making jobs at home is worth the higher prices. It's generally accepted that isn't worth it (at least nationally. on a smaller, industry specific area it can help).</p>
<p>Part of the problem with globalization is that certain areas tend to get hit extremely hard. In the U.S.'s case, one big example is manufacturing (because it's cheaper labor). In theory, the decrease in price makes us more than rich enough to help those people who lost their jobs out, and still be richer. In practice, we haven't done a particularly good job of having those people switch to a different job, relying on the market to sort it out (which can often be a long and painful process).</p>
<p>tldr:
Yes, it will basically just hurt us. But people are extremely upset with the status quo, and it's not obvious to the average person that it won't work. It sounds very compelling.</p>
<p>edit:
As a couple people have mentioned, i did leave out the impact of automation (for simplicity. Although, it's larger than globalization). While the above explanation still holds, technology just makes things even worse, since tariffs clearly aren't going to put the technology genie back in the bottle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>It might not work that way in practice but that's the thought behind it. The fact that many &quot;foreign&quot; cars are actually produced domestically makes it all more complicated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, and yes. No, American citizens are not helped by paying more for products.</p>
<p>His import tax has nothing to do with economics and everything to do with politics.</p>
<p>Economics generally agree that free trade and globalization is good on average. Keyword here: <strong>average</strong>. Free trade and globalization is the reason that your iphone, which has parts and rare earth minerals from all over the world, doesn't cost $1500.  When the entire world assigns different people to make different products in the most efficient way, and then sell to each other, instead of having one country struggle to make everything by itself, everybody wins. That's the upside of globalization.</p>
<p>However, the downside of free trade and globalization is lower skilled people in developed countries lose their jobs en masse to poorer countries with lower cost. </p>
<p><strong>On average</strong>, free trade is good for the US. However, the benefits and downsides are not symmetrical. The upside of free trade is that everybody gets cheaper Iphones, cheaper fruits, cheaper T-shirts, cheaper TV shows, cheaper everything, improving the standard of living. However, these are subtle changes that affect everyone, and people generally just take it for granted, and rarely base their political decisions on it.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the downside of free trade is much more visible, much more striking, and affects a smaller number of people, but in much deeper ways. When a factory or a plant is shut down, the entire town might lose its job, and spiral into disrepair, drugs, and population loss. And the people who lost jobs definitely think about it as they enter the voting booth. That's why it's much easier politically to be against free trade than for it.</p>
<p><strong>By placing his chips against free trade, Donald Trump is betting that the people he is trying to court (disaffected Rust Belt working class voters) will notice and credit him as they vote, while the people that he will hurt (everyone else) either won't notice or will forget the rising prices in storefronts by election day.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer is yes. Tariffs are passed on to the consumer at the shelf. Its essentially a penalty against your own citizens for buying foreign product. It says, if you buy foreign, im going to add a tax so it costs as much as buying American.  </p>
<p>He thinks it will &quot;create jobs&quot; but it will likely just starve low income walmart shoppers in the rust belt even more. </p>
<p>It might spur some American industry but far from enough to create the change and jobs that he is falsely promising.  If we all only bought American and kept all the money in our own businesses in theory companies would be able to pay more Americans, but reality is that we cant become self sufficient or reach autarky. </p>
<p>His tactics are also bully tactics and PR stunts that do not help Americans. The &quot;Carrier Deal&quot; is a total sham and crony capitalism.  The attacks on individuals and individual companies are just PR tools to support the narrative for his voters that he is making &quot;deals&quot; and &quot;negotiating&quot; and fighting the &quot;establishment&quot;. In reality he and his nepotistic enterprise are probably just shorting stocks right before he bashes a company on Twitter. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure if it's been mentioned that we already know what will happen, because we tried it in the 1980s with Japanese auto imports. Domestic car makers raised prices an average of $1,000. Turns out that there's not much price elasticity in highly segmented markets like the auto industry. </p>
<p>I do believe, however (somebody will correct me) that the Japanese import tariffs are what spurred the Japanese automakers to build factories in the US.  </p>
<p>Either way, Trump is playing chicken with the auto makers. He hopes that the threats will stop auto makers from building or expanding plants in Mexico. If they ignore him (as it appears BMW will), it's bad news for consumers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
