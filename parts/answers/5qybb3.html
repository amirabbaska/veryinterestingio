If you went from off to low power, the motor might not get enough power to actually move the fan.  If it can't actually turn over, then instead of turning electricity into motion, the motor will turn electricity into heat and can burn out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humidifiers and the like do it because they contain a fan.  In all of these cases, it's a safety feature.  </p>
<p>Fans run at different speeds by using different sets of windings in the motor.  These are literally wires that are wound to form a coil, which is part of how an electric motor works.  Using more or fewer windings in a coil changes the speed and torque of the motor/fan.    </p>
<p>If you suddenly apply a voltage to the low speed winding (1), a very large surge of current will flow through it.  If you suddenly apply a voltage to the high speed winding, the surge current will be much lower. </p>
<p>So electric motors almost always are wired so that you go from Off to the high speed winding to reduce the surge current.  This minimizes the chances of the surge current causing a problem (like a fire); it also makes the motor have a longer lifespan. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
