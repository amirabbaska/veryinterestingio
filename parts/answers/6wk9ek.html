		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It ran into a high pressure system to the west that prevented it from moving more inland, and to an extent, is sandwiched between another high pressure system to its southeast, just kind of holding it in position.  It is eventually going to slowly move to the east/northeast as it dissipates, but will dump tons more rain on the Houston/south Texas area before doing so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was wedged between two high pressure systems that were holding it in place. They've since pushed it back out in to the gulf. This morning the projected it coming back inland and run over us again but it looks like it'll head northeast from where it is now and hit Lake Charles as a much more tame storm than what landed a couple days ago. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't verify the claims but just sharing a post from r/weather that points to a &quot;broken up&quot; jet stream. Usually the whole collection of high and low pressure systems drifts eastward due to the jet stream.  When the jet stream is disrupted or &quot;broken&quot; you can lose the eastward drift and all types of weather good and bad tend to stay in place for longer periods of time... </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Quick answer is it ran into a low pressure system to its west, and the shear force between the different directions of rotation has stalled it's movement. It's track is looking to start going northeast later this week though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
