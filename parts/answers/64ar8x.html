		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not botanist but I do like me my citrus fruit so I will take a stab at this. Basically mandarins are naturally occurring citrus fruits, along with the pomelo, citron and Papeda. Tangerines are a descendant of mandarins or closely related to mandarins from Morocco. Clementines are a human made hybrid of oranges and mandarins. Now that we are to oranges, they are a hybrid of pomelo and mandarins. Most citrus fruit you eat and can find are generally hybrids of the first four there.</p>

<p>It shows how many seemingly nonrelated citrus fruits in a nice Venn-diagram-style.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since a lot of people is talking about the families and botanic procedure I'm gonna try to give you some insight about what's more practical:</p>
<p>Mandarins are the &quot;smallest&quot; of the family and also the most sweet. Their skin can be peeled easily and they are quite sweet and tasty. Clementines are the closest to mandarins. They are not that tasty and their skin is thicker. However they're cheaper to produce and can also be peeled by hand.</p>
<p>Tangerines are a hybrid between mandarins and oranges. Their inner structure is very similar to mandarins (you can separate them by hand) but are bigger as an orange and their skin varies its thickness. They are usually good to eat. Oranges are, well, oranges. They have the thickest skin and must be peeled with a knife or similar. They're ones that are better for juice than others but can't be separated as the other three and also depending on the sub species are sweeter or mor acid</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm going to give a different, musical, perspective on this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Clementine is from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arL3QzNBc6A" target="_blank">folk song</a>:</p>
<p>Near a cavern, across from a canyon,<br />
Excavating for a mine,<br />
Lived a miner, forty-niner<br />
And his daughter Clementine  </p>
<p>Oh my Darling, Oh my Darling,<br />
Oh my Darling Clementine.<br />
You are lost and gone forever,<br />
Dreadful sorry, Clementine.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;2.  Tangerine is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxaOItEmu3U" target="_blank">this song</a>:</p>
<pre><code>Picture yourself in a boat on a river  
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies  
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly  
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes  </code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;3.  The odd one out is the mandarin, which is from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdTTPOEvZiY" target="_blank">the miraculous mandarin</a></p>
<p>Basically it's classical music for old people.  According to Wikipedia &quot;it caused a scandal and was subsequently banned on moral grounds.&quot;  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Miraculous_Mandarin" target="_blank">From Wikipedia</a>.  Basically, it was like ballet-porn.</p>
<p>So I hope this clears up at least the musical history.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tangerine is a generic name for mandarins used interchangeable with mandarin in the US.  However in grocery stores it is often indicates seedy types versus the ones sold as clementines.</p>
<p>Clementines are originally a specific cultivar of mandarin, the Algerian Clementine, but since it became popular it has become a generic name for seedless easily peeled mandarins.  When you buy clementines/cuties/halos they are one of about four specific types depending on the season.  </p>
<p>Mandarins are a general term for the parent citrus the bred oranges, grapefruits, etc and there are many many varieties.  Oranges are 75% mandarin 25% pummelo.  Grapefruits are 50% mandarin 50% pummelo.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
