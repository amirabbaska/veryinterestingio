		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>It is to supply full pressure to the outer pane.</strong>
Foremost.  </p>
<p>It has the function of demisting the outer window as well.</p>
<p>The structure is as follows. Outer pane and middle pane form a unit. Middle pane has a small breathing hole. On the inside of this unit is a quite large air gap and then the inner pane.</p>
<p>The outer and middle panes are load bearing. Where the outer is meant to be the primary and middle is a spare. Inner pane takes daily wear and tear like brushing, scratches and such away from the load bearing unit.</p>
<p>So if the outer pane fails the middle pane keeps the pressure? But what about that hole?
Correct, the ecs (air compressor) is vastly overpowering the loss of air through that hole thus keeping cabin pressurized. </p>
<p>Why is it important?
If the outer pane fails, it is important that it looks like it fails. The pressure supplied by the small hole makes sure of that, since it pressure equalizes and transfers the load from the middle pane to the outer.
Without it, the middle pane would be taking all of the pressure. </p>

Because there are 2 windows, we have a space between them which should be at the same pressure as the inside of the plane (otherwise, there would be an undesired effort on the inner window), hence the hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The interior of the plane is pressurized, but at the normal cruise altitude of 35,000 feet, the interior pressure is less than atmospheric pressure at ground level. The aircraft interior window doesn't hold pressure, it just helps insulate the plane (like a double pane house window). So the hole allows the air pressure between the two panes equalize to the changes in cabin air pressure as the plane rises and descends. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
