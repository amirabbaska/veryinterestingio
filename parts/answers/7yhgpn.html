		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Possibly involves direct stimulation of hair follicle growth; may increase local blood flow; and stimulate dormant/resting hair follicles</p>
<p>What's interesting is that once you start it you can't stop. If you start bucking the system it hurts hair growth. Much like acne medication or OTC creams you need to use it EVERYDAY for it to work effectively. </p>
<p>Even I have a tough time keeping a good skin care regiment. Either
1) people see good results and quit (Me: My skin looks good now It won't matter if I skip today)
2) Don't see results soon enough so they quit </p>
<p>With good use hair growth should be apparent in 4 months. So that means in order to notice ANY new hair growth it takes 4 MONTHS of continues everyday use.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>minoxidil, the active ingredient in Rogaine, is a treatment for a type of balding called androgenetic alopecia.</p>
<p>A basic summary of how hair follicles work:
Hair follicles have three phases, growth phase (anagen), involutional phase (catagen), and resting phase (telogen).
Normally, a hair follicle will grow for 2-6 years. Then it will start shutting down, and finally stop growing. It stays in the scalp without growing for 2-3 months, then sheds the hair at the end and starts growing a new hair. The ratio of hairs in growth phase versus rest phase determines how thick the hair is.</p>
<p>With age-related balding, the hair follicles spend less time in growth phase and more time in rest phase until there's no visible hair at all. Minoxidil stimulates the hair follicles to spend more time in growth phase to restore the hair. The exact mechanism for how it does this is still unclear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mechanism isn't fully understood, but it's thought to be related to the ability of Rogaine to dilate blood vessels near the hair follicle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As I understand, the chemical was originally tested as a vasodilator for the purpose of blood pressure control. During the study they observed increased hair growth in many subjects. </p>
<p>As a result, it is thought that when absorbed via the skin it dilates the vessels near the hair follicle, spurring hair growth by allowing blood and nutrients to the follicle. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is a fibronectin promoter, which means it triggers cells to produce and excrete fibronectin. Fibronectin is a protein that deals with connective tissue, and serves many different purposes depending on where on the body Rogaine (monoxadil) is used. </p>
<p>When used on the top of the head, it increases blood flow to hair follicles. When applied to a cut or laceration, it reduces healing time by 66%. When applied to &quot;external organs&quot;, it can enlarge them (disclaimer: can cause inflammation,  and the user to walk funny) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
