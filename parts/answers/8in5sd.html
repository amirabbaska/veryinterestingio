		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Water is a very good heat conductor when compared to air. Not only is its thermal conductivity higher, but its heat capacity is as well (heat capacity is a measure of the amount of energy required to increase the temperature by a 1 degree). So if there's a difference in temperature between the water and an object that it is in contact with, then the water will be able to exchange a large amount of heat with that object at a relatively high rate.</p>
<p>The rate of heat exchange is further improved with running water. Since the rate of heat exchange is proportional to the temperature difference, you'll see that the rate goes down with time when using stationary water, since the temperature of the water approaches the temperature of the object. By keeping the water moving, this doesn't happen and the rate of heat exchange remains high.</p>
<p>Note that in the above text I never made the distinction between water cooling something down or heating it up (defrosting). That's because the aspects that make water effective at heat exchange apply to both. If the object is hot and needs cooling down, the colder water will absorb the heat. If the object is frozen, then the warmer water will provide the heat needed to defrost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Moving water is really good at making thing &quot;closer in temperature to the moving water.&quot; </p>
<p>In hot climates, running water is usually colder than the air (it might come from snow melt, or from high-altitude lakes, or from clouds that are up where it is cold). So it will be good refrigeration. </p>
<p>But, by definition, running water is not frozen. So it is warmer than anything that it frozen, and will quickly defrost it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The ELI 5 way of looking at it is: don't think of water as being cold, think of water as being neutral, only cold or hot in <strong>relative</strong> to what it is in contact with.<br />
In food preservation, water is cooler than the food, therefore running water carry the heat away, making it colder.<br />
In melting ice, water is warmer than the ice, therefore running water deliver heats to the ice, melting it.<br />
Why is the 'running' part important? Well, giving or taking heat is actually more of &quot;trying to equalize&quot; the heat difference. Similar to how things fall from high elevation to lower, heat, or more specifically kinetic energy, also spreads (conduct) from hot (high energy) to cold (low energy). Once thw water absorbed the heat from the food, it is now the same temperature as the food, therefore heat transfer no longer occurs. Similarly, once the water has melted the ice, its tempersture is now the same as the melted ice water, so no more transfer occurs. Running water moves the equilibrium away from the contact area, and keep the temperature different, so that the heat transfer can continue.<br />
Same with people blowing air into hot food to cool it down, or blowing air into ice cream to makes it less cold. Once you start thinking about everything in term of relativity and equilibrium, things makes much more sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;I understand that water is a great insulator and heat conductor&quot; - it can't be both, these are opposite statements.</p>
<p>Water isn't a great insulator, it conducts heat relatively well.  It also has a very high heat capacity - it takes a lot of heat to change the temperature of a small amount of water.  This means running water over something hotter than the water will cool the object as the water absorbs its heat, and running water over something colder than the water will heat the object as the water gives up its heat.</p>
<p>In both cases the object is getting closer to the temperature of the water, both processes are just using water to move lots of heat energy and change the temperature of an object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no 'counter-intuity.'</p>
<p>The issue seems to be your understanding of temperature. Cold is just the absence of thermal energy, otherwise known as heat. It's not a state in and of itself. </p>
<p>When something gets warmed up it absorbs thermal energy. When something cools down it loses thermal energy. But you don't ever say that something heating up is 'losing its cold' because cold doesn't mean anything there. Cold is just a word that means lacking thermal energy. </p>
<p>So heating and cooling are essentially the same. They both involve a heat transfer. When keeping something cool, the water absorbs heat. When defrosting something, the water is warmer and the object absorbs heat. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
