<p>While there are larger <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allotropes_of_oxygen" target="_blank">allotropes of oxygen</a>, they mostly exist in pretty specific situations, and they aren't polymers in sense you're talking about.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, the oxygen-oxygen bond is to fragile to exist as a repeat unit in a polymer structure.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_peroxide" target="_blank">Organic peroxides</a> are generally not very stable.  In fact <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzoyl_peroxide" target="_blank">benzoyl peroxide</a> is many times used as an initiator in polymerizations due the fact the O-O bond easily forms radicals.    </p>
<p>One theorized polymer but never truly produced in practice you may be interested in is [linear acetylenic carbon]( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_acetylenic_carbon" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_acetylenic_carbon</a>). It consists of alternating single and triple carbon bonds.  The difficulty of making this polymer in real life highlights how difficult making a polymer with -(O-O)- bonds would be.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can make <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_oxygen" target="_blank">oxygen crystals</a> at low temperature. That is &quot;sort of like&quot; a polymer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As the pressure of oxygen at room temperature is increased through 10 GPa (1,450,377 psi), it undergoes a dramatic phase transition to a different allotrope. Its volume decreases significantly,[6] and it changes color from blue to deep red.[7] This ε-phase was discovered in 1979, but the structure has been unclear. Based on its infrared absorption spectrum, researchers assumed in 1999 that this phase consists of O
4 molecules in a crystal lattice.[8] However, in 2006, it was shown by X-ray crystallography that this stable phase known as ε oxygen or <strong>red oxygen is in fact O8.</strong>[9][10] No one predicted the structure theoretically:[5] a rhomboid O8 cluster[11] consisting of four O2 molecules.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, the reaction from single bonded O polymers to O2 would be both favorable in terms of enthalpy(two single bonds are weaker than a double bond in O) and in terms of entropy (a polymer that breaks apart into a more disorganized gas). The oxygen polymer is unstable to the O2 gas.  </p>
<p>Also the bond is weak enough that the kinetics are fast. You couldn't really form it and hope for kinetic stability while thermodynamically unstable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
