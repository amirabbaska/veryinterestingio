<p>According to <a href="http://forensicoutreach.com/library/the-falling-bullet-myths-legends-and-terminal-velocity/" target="_blank">Major General Julian Hatch</a> bullets returning to the ground will have a terminal velocity between 200 &amp; 330 feet per second (60-100 m/s).</p>
<p>This is enough to penetrate unprotected tissue &amp; the skull.</p>
<p>While the ballistics of each bullet will be different, don't do it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll do the math the other guy failed at doing.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5.56%C3%9745mm_NATO" target="_blank">An M16 fires a 5.7 mm diameter bullet.  The weight of the round is about 4 g.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_coefficient" target="_blank">The drag coefficient for a bullet is approximately 0.295.</a></p>
<p>The equation for terminal velocity is</p>
<p><a href="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee680de6632767977a602cfbed943853e3854cdc" target="_blank">https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/ee680de6632767977a602cfbed943853e3854cdc</a></p>
<p>where</p>
<p>Vt is the terminal velocity</p>
<p>m is the mass of the bullet, 0.004 kg</p>
<p>g is the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^(2))</p>
<p>rho is the density of air (1 kg/m^(3))</p>
<p>A is the area of the bullet (pi/4*(5.7 mm)^2 = 25.5 mm^2)</p>
<p>Cd is the drag coefficient (0.295)</p>
<p>So the terminal velocity of a bullet fired straight up from an M16 is 102 m/s.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7175470" target="_blank">here</a>, the minimum velocity of a bullet to penetrate skin is 58 m/s.  This bullet well exceeds that.</p>
<p>Don't shoot guns in the air.</p>
<p>Edit: it's been suggested that I point out that the muzzle velocity is 960 m/s, so the bullet is far, far slower on the way down than if it were pointed at you.  Also, a gun shooting at 102 m/s wouldn't count as a firearm under Canadian law.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the bullet. It will be coming down significantly slower than it goes up, especially if it is shot straight up, because if it is shot straight up, it is much more likely to tumble on its way down, drastically increasing drag. If it is shot at an angle, it is much more likely to maintain its spin and stability, so it will have a much faster terminal velocity, and therefore be much more dangerous.</p>
<p>With big bullets, even tumbling it can be lethal, but small bullets will likely be survivable if shot straight up.</p>
<p>Regardless, getting hit by a bullet that was shot straight up is never going to be better than not getting hit by a bullet it all, so don't be firing guns into the air. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big determining factor is the angle the bullet is shot into the air.  If it is shot straight up then it will tumble on the way back down which will cause it to slow significantly.  If it is shot at an angle it will maintain its trajectory and come back down with a much higher velocity.</p>
