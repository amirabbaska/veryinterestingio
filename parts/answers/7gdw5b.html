		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How does one initiate a desire or decision to do something? For instance, I can decide to raise my arm and then, based on that decision, I simply voluntarily raise it, but what is the underlying biochemical cause for that decision?</p>
<p>In my neuroscience class my professor said that the planning of movements stems from the ideomotor cortex, but I'm interested in how specifically the ideomotor cortex 'initiates' the desire to do something. I guess I find it difficult to reconcile the voluntary-seeming nature of decisions with the involuntary-seeming nature of the biochemical pathways/reactions that give rise to those decisions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
