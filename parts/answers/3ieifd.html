		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All right, let's say you have a friend named Simon, who's a normal weight and loves junk food, and a friend named Albert, who's extremely fat and also loves junk food. Since you're buddies with Simon, you'd be able to guess what junk food they're gonna eat next based on what they ate before and you'd also be able to guess what they had eaten based on the wrappers and boxes left over. However, even though you're buddies with Fat Albert, he's just so huge that when he gets near enough something to eat, he swallows it wrapper and all. You have no idea what he'd eat next or what he ate before because he swallowed anything and everything near him. BUT NOW, all of a sudden, you realize that Albert is not only fat, but he's a messy eater. Because of this, you realize that there are crumbs, smudges, and pieces of the food left around his mouth. So you're like, OH! Now I know what you ate. Maybe in time you could use that to learn his eating habits just like you know your buddy Simon's!</p>
<p>So in this case, you're Mr Hawking, and you realized that the black hole, Albert, although he seemed not to leave evidence of food (information), actually might leave that evidence at the edge of his mouth (the event horizon = the edge of the black hole). You can use that to figure out all sorts of things!</p>
<p>(Hopefully this helps people, this is my first post here!)</p>
<p>Edit: Wow, I was just writing this as a joke, I didn't expect so many people to like it! Thanks so much for the gold and for everyone who enjoyed it! For the people who are asking if I'm a teacher, I'm not, I'm just a young adult applying to med school haha. Thanks again! </p>
<p>For people who are still a little confused by what the theory is, and why I talked about Simon:
The original thing that we thought was what I described at the beginning, that for any normal scenario (a Simon) we would be able to get information, but in the case of a black hole (Albert), we can't. But Hawking's theory is your theory that if you look at the edge of his mouth, you can see the crumbs and figure out a pattern to how he's eating just like you did with a normal case like Simon. In the same way, looking at the event horizon (the &quot;edge&quot; of a black hole) might let you get the information that we before thought was destroyed. Hope that makes sense!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey everybody -- I'm in Sweden right now with the guy, and was in the room yesterday when he gave his technical lecture to us.</p>
<p>There are many things still to work out, so we really call this an &quot;idea&quot; rather than a theory, but that being said, we're busy debating about it!</p>
<p>Hawking's idea is a proposal to solve a major crises in black hole physics -- what's been called the &quot;firewall / information paradox.&quot; It's been know for a while now that black holes conserve information of in falling matter. (See previous example of Albert and Simon eating junk food) -- anything that goes into a black hole is gone forever.... Kind of. The metaphor I like best is to think of an encyclopedia and all the knowledge it contains. Throwing it into a black hole is like throwing it into a furnace... Out of the furnace comes a big pile of ashes from the encyclopedia that, in theory, could be reconstructed atom by atom to be an encyclopedia again. In practice however, this is beyond difficult. </p>
<p>This argument (called &quot;holography&quot;h has held up really well! But... it was found to violate one of three unbreakable laws of quantum physics! A well known proposed solution to this conflict is the hypothetical &quot;black hole firewall&quot; that argues the encyclopedia never makes it into the center of the furnace, it just &quot;incinerates&quot; at the furnaces entrance (the &quot;event horizon&quot;). </p>
<p>Yesterday, Hawking proposed his own solution that he's been working on with Andy Strominger. He argues that the information from the encyclopedia is conserved because the ashes are a &quot;super translation&quot; of the original encyclopedia.  So, what the hell is a super translation? In &quot;group algebra&quot; translations are simply how one group &quot;moves&quot; along some defined dimension -- stand 3 meters from the wall. Now walk to the wall. Congratulations! You have just &quot;translated&quot; along a single dimension of space. </p>
<p>A super translation is much more technically sophisticated than that, but it's the same basic principle. It has symmetry -- and that's very important. Symmetry means you can walk towards the wall, or the wall can move to you. Makes no diff.) Hawking argues that the &quot;ashes&quot; are super translations of the information content of the in falling encyclopedia. Because of symmetries inherent to that mathematical object, using a super translation approach may resolve the nasty paradoxes. </p>
<p>Tl;dr (read in Hawking's voice) &quot;our calculations about black holes suck. Let's try using 'super translation' mathematics instead.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While I can't speak to the specifics, as a layman who has followed this since reading &quot;a brief history of time&quot; I can say that it's a pretty big deal if he's right.</p>
<p>Basically, black holes have been considered to &quot;destroy information&quot; which basically means you can't see what's inside a black hole. This is a big problem in physics because energy/matter/information can't be &quot;destroyed.&quot;</p>
<p>What Hawking is saying now is that the information isn't destroyed, but instead sort of &quot;imprinted&quot; on the event horizon of a black hole.</p>
<p>An event horizon is what we might consider the border of inside vs outside the black hole. Everything past that line is &quot;inside&quot; the black hole and can't be seen because even light gets trapped in it. But if an object or particle enters <del>a stable</del> orbit on that boundary, special things happen that I don't understand and can't really describe.</p>
<p>However, I can say that what Hawking is saying is that if something crosses this barrier, it effects how the event horizon looks, and therefore in a way, we can retrieve that information, kind of like looking at footprints in the snow leading up to the edge of a cliff.</p>
<p>I may be way off base here, but that's my understanding and I invite anyone with a better understanding to ELI5 to me.</p>
<p>Edit: there is no stable orbit on the event horizon.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hawking's new claim is that you can, in fact, escape a black hole, and that information isn't destroyed as a result of entering a black hole's event horizon. Here's the ELI5 version:</p>
<p>What was previously thought is that information was lost in a black hole, and that it was permanently gone after the black hole had fully radiated away, the information was lost. What hawking says is that the information isn't lost, but it's now in a disorganized, useless form, solving the information paradox. </p>
<p>Edit: <del>information meaning physical information, so it's like saying all physical matter becomes the same once entering a black hole. Physical information is the ability to tell what a physical system is and used to be based on the state it's in, but the paradox comes about when a black hole is brought up because all of a sudden the physical systems are all the same in a black hole, with no way to tell what the system used to be when the black hole radiates. Hawking is saying the information isn't destroyed, but it's just in a useless form to us.</del> For a better explanation of information, see /u/Snuggly_Person 's explanation</p>
<p>Hawking has also stated that physical matter that falls into a black hole stays on the event horizon and doesn't &quot;fall&quot; further into the black hole. </p>
<p>Edit 2: sorry guys, this is harder to ELI5 than I thought it'd be</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its all about information. Information can be seen as lego instructions only that they contain all the possibilities how the lego block could be utilised. Current laws say that these instructions cant be lost. The block vould be destroyed but instructions for   it cant. The instructions can get scrambled but not in a way you couldn't unscramble them.</p>
<p>Classical eternal all devouring black hole broke this rule by gettting a hold of the instructions and never ever letting go. </p>
<p>Hawking theorised that black holes aren't eternal but slowly  decay emiting hawking radiation. This can be seen as the instructions are being shredded to aa point  they cant be glued back together. </p>
<p>Now the theory says that the information never actually goes to the shredder but linger to be shredded pile. There they can get &quot;stolen&quot; by dishonest employee taking the instructions to his home. Now the instructions are gone from  our house but not actually destroyed</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
