		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Judaism is what's called an &quot;ethno-religious group&quot;. Thousands of years ago, that was pretty common. If you were Egyptian, you almost certainly also followed the Ancient Egyptian religion. If you were Jewish, you almost certainly also followed the Jewish religion.</p>
<p>This was to the point that it was almost &quot;by definition&quot;. The Egyptians didn't expect non-Egyptians to follow the Egyptian religion, and the Jews didn't expect the non-Jews to follow the Jewish religion. There are writings from antiquity talking about how whenever someone traveled to a different place or married into a different tribe/nation, they'd sacrifice to the local gods of the area, not worrying about the ones back home until they got home. During times of war, there would be attempts to lure the other side's god(s) to your side with offers of better sacrifices or whatever.</p>
<p>Again, this was the common state of humanity and its various groups for thousands of years. It was generally assumed that there were many gods of many nations, each set of god(s) looking out for their respective nations. Pantheons were fluid, with gods in different pantheons being identified with each other (oh, you have a thunder god too? It's probably the same guy, you just call him Bob instead of Spencer, next time I sacrifice I'll call out to Bob too...).</p>
<p>Where the Jews and Judaism differed from most others is that they became strict monotheists (there's evidence that at the beginning of the Jewish religion they were more accurately &quot;henotheists&quot;, meaning they recognized that other gods existed, but only theirs was the best/most powerful/chief).</p>
<p>(EDIT: Above I originally said that henotheism meant that they felt it was only right to worship one, not that one was the most powerful/chief/best. The correct term for thinking it's right to worship only one is &quot;monolatry&quot;, which is a difference that I swear I knew before. Props to u/Zorro_Darksauce for the correction.)</p>
<p>This monotheism gave rise to the idea that non-Jewish gods didn't exist. While they shed polytheism, they didn't shed the nation-god association, meaning that God was <em>their</em> God and while He was also everyone else's God, everyone else had a lesser role in His plan and weren't required to do as much and/or were denied His special favor.</p>
<p>The other way in which Judaism differed from many others is that this dynamic continued until today. The other major examples that I can think of would be Shinto and Hinduism, but there are countless religions of equal pedigree and age around the world that are often lump under the generic &quot;folk religion&quot; tag.</p>
<p>This is contrasted with religions like Christianity and Islam, which were founded as religions not for a particular people, but for <em>all</em> people. As a result, they had an imperative to go out and convert others to their religion that was lacking in the earlier dynamic (and would even have been viewed as kind of silly...&quot;they're not Japanese, why would they practice Shinto?&quot;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before I answer your question, I have to note that most of the answers here, even those with hundreds of upvotes, are in part or even wholly wrong. I don't know why there is so much ignorance about Judaism - it is not exactly a secret religion and there is plenty of fairly authoritative information about who we are and what we believe on the Internet (well, I guess a lot of BS written by non-Jews and even anti-Semites, too, so maybe it is difficult separating truth from reality here).</p>
<p>To dispel some of the myths I've read so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Judaism does accept converts and has so since ancient times. It is only frowned upon because Jews see the obligations incumbent on Jewish people alone (613 commandments) is an unnecessary burden for Gentiles to take on (who are obligated to follow 7 commandments). Jews believe that Gentiles who follow that tiny subset of obligations to be just as righteous as Jews who follow the full set.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While Judaism doesn't stress the afterlife like Christianity and Islam do, what's clear from our tradition is that it is not reserved for Jews. Everyone (everyone) ends up in the same place: &quot;the world to come&quot; (which is ambiguously defined since, well, no one has ever come back to tell us about it...).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sincerity is important for conversion, so the idea that converts are only allowed to take in spouses is diametrically wrong. Prospective converts are routinely denied if they are found to be doing so just to appease future in-laws.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not only are converts considered as Jewish as someone born Jewish, there is actually a commandment that Jews can not treat converts differently, and can not even draw attention to the fact that a convert wasn't born Jewish. A convert is as Jewish as Moses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &quot;God's chosen people&quot; is completely misinterpreted. Among Jews familiar with our religious tradition, it has always meant the obligations of Torah and the fact that the Jewish nation chose to accept them. It has never meant we believe God loves us more than Gentiles; this is a strawman invented by Catholic authorities ages ago in order to demonize us.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Judaism, there is no concept of race. It is meaningless. There are and have been Jews of all sorts of national origin since ancient times, not least due to the fact that conversion has always existed (the book of Ruth is literally about Judaism's first convert). As for how we feel about treating people who are different based on their looks/national origin: in the Bible, Moses's sister Miriam is struck with a sort of disease when she makes fun of Moses's (African) wife, and God doesn't release her from the disease until she repents for days.</p>
</li>
<li>There is no concept of a &quot;racial Jew&quot; or &quot;partial Jew.&quot; You're either Jewish or you're not; you were either born to a Jewish mother or a convert, or you're not Jewish. Period. Someone with a Jewish father but a Gentile mother is not Jewish (unless s/he converts). And since both mother &amp; father contribute the same amount of DNA to a child, the idea that Judaism cares about how much &quot;Jewish DNA&quot; you have is simply not true.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, to answer your question: </p>
<p>Judaism is only a religion. The reason that, in certain locations in the world, Jews look broadly similar to one another is that those groups historically didn't intermarry (they followed the religious commandment to marry another Jew) and conversion was either frowned upon or outright forbidden (sometimes under penalty of death or punishment of the Jewish community) by the surrounding population, or there was so little contact between Jews and their Gentile neighbors that each population evolved separately.</p>
<p>It might be helpful, though, to think of the Jewish people as a nation. You can either be born to a nation automatically and have all the obligations incumbent on you automatically by virtue of your birth, or you can join the nation (&quot;naturalize&quot;) by agreeing to follow rules and being accepted by a designated authority.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also, there are several different ethnic groups of Jewish people that wouldn't have similar features. Your average Ashkenazi Jewish person isn't going to look exactly like your average Sephardic Jewish person isn't going to look your average Bukharan Jewish person isn't going to look like your average Cochin Jewish person, because during the several Jewish diaspora, the Jewish peoples moved into other nations, fell in love with and had children with local ethnic groups, but also had a significant degree of intermarriage and unique customs that each of these groups became distinct ethnically.</p>
<p>With regard to Catholicism/early Christianity/orthodox faiths, remember that during its spread, the Roman Empire, Byzantine Empire, etc., spread them by force and conquest, and sent missionaries out to every land under the sun. &quot;Catholic,&quot; as an adjective, literally means &quot;universal.&quot; The idea was that everyone was obligated to convert to Christianity. Some iterations of the faith took this to mean &quot;... or die!&quot; while others did not. So the reason why there is no strong ethnic association with Catholicism (there are weak associations; the Irish, Italians, Latin Americans, etc.) is because Catholicism never envisioned itself as the faith of any particular ethnic group. It was always practiced by multi-ethnic groups of early Christians. </p>
<p>Judaism, on the other hand, was the ethnic religion of the Hebrews, much like all of the Indo-European groups had some version of the PIE religion. Catholicism, for the most part, wiped out folk religions of Indo-Europeans, to the point today where all attempts at reconstructing those folk religions for worship are at best copies of copies of what we think someone eight hundred years dead thought about those religions. But there are always movements within ethnic groups to practice that group's traditional religion. It's just that the Jewish peoples, like a few others (Zoroastrians, for example), have managed to maintain and preserve their ethnic folk religion in a way few others have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's an increasing trend (especially in Reform Judaism) to accept patrilineal Jews as part of the fold, and Kaifeng Jews are different in that, like most Chinese people, inheritance comes through the father. And there are plenty of people whose fathers were the Jewish ones but they were still raised (or at least partially) Jewish, like Carrie Fisher. Thing is, it's basically in the realm of ethnicity and community. And converts ARE accepted, there's just a prohibition on proselytism and a conversion process is long to make sure that people really want to go through it. There are also many types of Jews (Kaifeng, Ashkenazi, Mountain, Beta, Mizrahim, etc) but we're united by the faith (even if many aren't religious), common family ties and the fact that we're around 1% of the world's population.</p>

<p>PS it's so typical to see the racists and antisemities crawl out of the woodwork to scream about Israel and Pharisees and whatever nonsense they like to think Jews cause even though this thread only asked about ethnoreligion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I really want to challenge the proposition that Jewish people have distinguishable physical features. There is sufficient genetic diversity within the Jewish population, if nothing else, across the Ashkenazi/Sephardi divide. There's a Jewish diaspora all over the world. Eastern European Jews have had a long time to have different genetics than Iberian Jews. I grew up next to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judaism_in_Mexico" target="_blank">Mexican Jews</a> such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Rivera" target="_blank">Diego Rivera</a>. There are also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Israel" target="_blank">black Ethiopian Jews</a>. Natalie Portman looks nothing like Sammy Davids Junior who looks nothing like Mila Kunis or Daniel Radcliffe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, be very wary of the concept of &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_categorization%29" target="_blank">race</a>&quot; itself, as there is a widespread suspicion amongst modern scientists that the idea that people can be classified into races is untenable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
