		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My bet would be that they are mostly intact, though with some surface corrosion, and they might be there for quite a long time. The atmosphere is mostly inert CO2 and N2 with some trace amounts of sulfuric acid. The temperatures and pressures might accelerate acid degradation somewhat, but the acid concentration is very small. The acid might actually form a protective salt layer on the metal surfaces, inhibiting further corrosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was part of an ESA sponsored workshop for postgraduate level researchers. Over the course of 2 weeks we designed a mission that would send an orbiter to Venus to investigate some gaps in our knowledge of the planet. One of the goals was to measure the rate at which the rotation of Venus changes. We came up with an idea to use the remnants of the landers as targets for our radar. Their locations are known well enough and 1/2 a ton of corroded metal makes a nice bright unmistakable marker in a radar image.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without wanting to stray too far from the topic at hand, this seems to be the best place to ask: if we were to build a new Venus lander in 2017, could we make one that was more capable of surviving the Venusian environment? It's been many decades now since the Venera landings, and while those were heroic efforts at survivability in an unfathomably hostile environment, could we do better with what we know now, and access to potentially better materials and design tools? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Space historian here. I’ve worked with some of the people behind the Veneras and asked them this exact question. I’ve got a few responses below, and, while they don’t provide a complete answer, do shed some light on what the Venera Creators were thinking.</p>
<p>At the time of the Venera landers, physicist Roald Sagdeev was serving as director of the Space Research Institute at the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Essentially, he was THE man in charge of all lunar and planetary programs for the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Here’s a snippet of my interview with him in 2010:</p>
<p><strong>3:56 What happened to the [Venera] ships after they stopped working? If we went there today, what would we find?</strong>
I think you will find that whatever is made of the metals, stayed there, and all the other things like plastic, everything else, melted since long ago because of the temperature.</p>
<p><strong>4:24 So you think the structure of the spacecraft would still be there.</strong>
Yeah I think structural will still be there.</p>
<p><strong>It just seems like over time the titanium hull would have slowly softened...</strong>
Probably you know, maybe somehow deformed, but I think it’s still it’s probably there.</p>
<p>And then Viktor Kerzhanovich was one of the people with a scientific experiment aboard the Venera landers. He had this to say in 2012:</p>
<p><strong>46:26 If we could go there to see what the landers were like, what would you expect?</strong>
Ah, I would say the same. If you open them up, of course melted, that’s all the welded connections… transistors will be burned, okay this is the thing that cannot tolerate four hundred sixty [Celsius] mechanically, but for rest? Too much hypothesis. But essentially... I don’t think that much will happen.</p>
<p><strong>47:32 Okay, so it’s not like it will have melted down into a puddle.</strong>
No no no, it will melt inside, of course some circuits will be melted inside.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A little off topic, but this might help with some of your understanding. You seem to have a slightly more hostile perspective of Venus than I think it is in reality. </p>

<p>Also the lander crafts are almost certainly mostly intact, they will look ugly and corroded to heck, and the computers are long gone, but the overall structure should still be there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
