		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Freemasonry is the largest and oldest fraternal organization in history. It dates back to the 1500's (lots of records have been destroyed however, so we don't have exact dates.)  The stories and rituals reflect those of the Stone Masons of that time who would build the cathedrals and castles.  Through out time the organization went from having only operative Masons, to including speculative Masons.  This changed as kings wanted to become members with out knowing the actual craft.  The craft was valuable knowledge, as knowing this type of stone work allowed you to work in different countries and earn wages... so you an imagine keeping this type of skill low key was essential.  All the things that happen in the temple, ritual and stories are based on the building of King Solomon's Temple.  That is the basis of all of this.</p>
<p>Freemasonry is not a &quot;social club&quot;, it goes beyond that.  It's a group of men who are like minded and seek to better them selves as men, fathers, brother's, son's and husbands.  Through use of allegoric symbols, moral and ethical character is taught through out a brother's life.  Freemason's meet and work according to their charter and bylaws.  Each state in the US is governed on its own and by its judicial laws.  So in the US there is no over powering masonic ownership, each state has its own Most Worshipful Grand Lodge that oversees is local lodges of its areas.  There is no copyright on any Masonic symbolism either.</p>
<p>Freemasonry is worldwide!  Although some ritual and some bylaws are different from country to country and even state to state in the US.</p>
<p>Freemasonry is involved in some charity, but its not a charity. Let's not confuse the two.  It's main purpose is not charity.  In Illinois at least we have two Masonic Children's Home sponsored solely by the Illinois lodges and its respective Grand Lodge.  We have a shriner's hospital where children are treated free of charge, also solely funded by the Mason's of Illinois.  Each lodge has its own charities and they do as they please with their funds.  </p>
<p>To become a Freemason you must a man, freeborn (not uncommon nowadays lol), be 18 years of age(in Illinois at least), have a belief in a supreme being(whatever you call it), no atheist can become a Freemason, it is not religion specific, have resided in the state for more than 6 months and come of your own free will and accord.</p>
<p>Once he procedures to petition and join are started and completed, you receive your 3 degrees of membership.  Enterered Apprentice, Fellowcraft and finally Master Mason.  Once you receive your third degree of Master Mason, you are a full member can vote and hold office.  There is no degree higher than that of a Master Mason, that is the &quot;highest&quot; you can go.  There are other appendent bodies of the Masonry that work on their own systems... The Shriners, Scottish Rite, York Rite, Grotto, etc. etc.. </p>
<p>Freemason's meet at designated Masonic temples.  We meet twice a month, typically.  At those meetings we conduct business like any other organization.  We have officers that are responsible for their duties.  We have a worshipful master(WM) who sets the craft to work and oversees the lodge.  Every state has their own set of officers, different names, duties etc.  It always differs.  It Illinois we have a WM, Senior and Junior Wardens (SW, JW). They are the right hand men for the WM.  The SW is like a Vice Pres.  He is in charge when the WM is not present and is getting ready to be next in charge.  The JW is in charge symbolically of the workmen of the temple at the time of refreshment (symbolically)  They are usually in charge of food and dinners :D  You also have The Senior and Junior Deacons (SD JD) who deliver messages symbolically, to the wardens and are also in charge of certain things for incoming members during ritual.  You have a Treasure and a Secretary like any other organization to keep track of monies and historical items such as minutes and newsletters.  There are the Senior and Junior stewards(SS JS) who assist the JW in their refreshment duties. Then you have a Marshal who directs members to respective places during several functions such as masonic funerals.  A chaplain who says our prayers and finally a Tiler who gaurds the outer door of the meeting room so no one enters or leaves with our permission and properly identified as a member. Symbolically he typically sits outside the meeting with a sword in his hand.  A lot of times he actually does have a sword in his hand.</p>
<p>There is a lot lot more to this...  The internet is full of garbage conspiracy .. you can't stop men from being bad and abusing certain things.   This organization is something I'm very proud of being a part of because it really has helped me learn a lot about my self.  There is no secret treasure that is revealed at the end of it all.. you kind of have to find all that out for yourself.  Freemasonry gives you the tools to do all of this on your own.  It's truly a fascinating concept and everything about it is beautiful.  You must really go through it to appreciate it.  It's definitely not for everyone, not everyone can or knows how to accept the light you receive.</p>
<p>I'm always happy to answer any other questions, I don't feel I need to defend Masonry.  Masonry defends its self.  Also, if you are interested in good reading on this.. pick up  &quot;Freemasonry For Dummies&quot;  as funny as it may sound, but it is a great book for the uninitiated and its factual, has great information and also written by Brother Christopher Hodapp who is a great author of many other books.  I hope this helps!  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Freemason here... It's primarily a social club. There is a ton of charity work and fund raising.  A lot of people seem to think our lodge meetings consist of how we're going to take over the world, bit it's really just us voting to pay the bills, with some history lessons thrown in.  The pride comes from doing something to benefit your community without expecting anything in return. </p>
<p>A few answers to common questions:  </p>
<p>• There is a secret handshake </p>
<p>• We do not wear robes, but we do have white aprons we wear during lodge</p>
<p>• There are annual dues just like any other club</p>
<p>• There are only 3 degrees in Masonry.  When you hear people talk about 33° Freemasons, they are referring to the Scottish Rite, which is a subset. </p>
<p>Edit:  Tons of questions about how to join. Look up your local lodge online. The secretary should be listed with contact info.  Give him a call/email and ask to meet some of the brothers and if you can check out the lodge.  Most have a monthly dinner that you can attend to meet people. Just won't be able to actually attend lodge until you're a member. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For those that are interested, here is a short summary of my journey into Freemasonry:</p>
<p>My father passed when I was 15. He and my mother had been separated almost my entire life and I only got to know him the last two years before his passing. After the funeral, his current wife handed me a cardboard box and told me that she believed that he would want me to have it.  It contained all of his masonic items. After pouring through the box I decided to learn more. I visited his lodge and spoke with his friends, learned more of the craft and eventually joined my local chapter. </p>
<p>The night I was raised to the 3rd, almost the entire chapter from my fathers lodge attended. I have since moved on into the York Rites. Masonry for me has been a long journey of bettering myself. Many of the lessons and ceremonies challenge you to look into your own morality, and to truly examine yourself. We have a few people who joined because their beer-buddies did, and yes we have a couple local businessmen who joined to try and drive up their businesses, but overall it's been a fantastic group of men that I am proud to be associated with.</p>
<p>Our chapter does wonderful things for local charities and high schools, we keep up with each other families. The majority of my lodge feels like an extension of my family.</p>
<p>It is a family tradition to me, initially started just to have a link to my past, but it has blossomed into so much more.</p>
<p>One day my five year old came from my room with my regalia sword and asked my why I had a sword in  my closet. I smiled and looked at him and said, &quot;Because I am a Masonic knight, like my father before me, and maybe one day you will be as well.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm currently Worshipful Master of my lodge.  Like everyone else on here has already pointed out, most of our meetings consist of planning our charitable work and general business (paying bills, building maintenance and other routine stuff).  However, we also do a lot of other awesome stuff.  We report every meeting on sick or financially troubled brothers and have a fund set up to assist when we can.  We check in on our deceased brothers widows to see if we can assist in any way or simply talk to them.  We provide scholarships to local high school kids.  We're the largest volunteers of both money and time to the Special Olympics (at least in Ohio).  We tend to have this reputation of this highly secret society that runs the world thanks to Hollywood and Nicolas Cage, but truth be told we're mostly a bunch of old dudes who are simply looking to get out of the house a couple nights a month. We just happen to do some good while at it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My Dad and Brother are both Freemasons. From what I've been able to get out of them, they do a lot of charity work and it's basically a men's club with some ceremonial stuff thrown in. They also hold fundraisers for local and UK charities. </p>
<p>They really do look after their members as well. </p>
<p>Back in 2013, my dad was diagnosed with cancer. At the time he was the 'Grand Master Apprentice' (or something like that) He spent 9 months in hospital and fell behind on mortgage payments, car payments, and his wife was struggling with hospital parking fees and petrol. </p>
<p>The whole lodge banded together and paid his outstanding mortgage payments and 3 months in advance, debts he fell behind on, paid for petrol and his wife's parking fees and held a fundraiser for Cancer Research UK. </p>
<p>Although I have no interest in Freemasonry, I can't thank them and his lodge enough.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
