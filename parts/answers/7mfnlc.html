		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All objects emit black-body radiation. This comes in the form of electro-magnetic radiation. The intensity and spectrum (color) of this radiation depends on the temperature of the object.</p>
<p>At room temperature and below, the radiation is too low frequency to be able to seen by human eye, but objects do glow at infrared, and that is why heat vision cameras work. At about 500 degrees celsius, you can start noticing objects to glow at red. Increasing the temperature further makes them brigther, and whiter. And if you continued to heat the object beyond about 6000 celcius, then the glow would transition from white to blue.</p>
<p>The reason why you wont find green hot objects, is because when the objects spectrum peaks at green, it will also emit a lot of red and blue, and this mixture gives the overall white look.</p>
<p>The reason you wont easily find blue hot metals, is because everything evaporates before that. How ever, some stars are hot enough to glow blue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been said, objects emitting light due to their temperature is blackbody radiation. Everything is a blackbody, even you. Thermal goggles can see you in the dark, because they detect the infrared radiation that humans so strongly emit. </p>
<p>One would expect that, the hotter an object gets (and thus more thermal energy it has), the more energetic the light it emits will be. That is, the light will be farther towards the high-frequency violet, UV, etc. side of the spectrum. This is exactly what happens. </p>
<p>If we heated you enough (say to 3500K), you would eventually turn red hot. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wien%27s_displacement_law#/media/File:Wiens_law.svg" target="_blank">Check out these blackbody radiation curves</a>, keeping in mind that the cutoff for visible light is in the 390nm-700nm range. The peak starts off far to the right, in the invisible range, and then creeps into the reds as it heats up. Since most of the other visible light is negligibly emitted at this stage, 3500K you appears red. Heating = shifting that peak over to the left.</p>
<p>Now, what happens if we heated you even more? Well, the peak must shift over towards higher frequency light, to account for the energy, but the entire peak rises as well. Take the 5500K curve for instance. It does indeed peak in the green spectrum, but there is a large amount of red light, yellow light, blue light, etc. as well. This means that the green gets washed out and everything appears white. It's hard for your eyes to tell when there's just slightly more of one color when they're all there and at high intensities (or even low intensities, if you've ever picked out paint).</p>
<p>It turns out though that, if you heat up something enough, blue-hot is possible though! For a fun example, look at stars. Stars emit most of their light through blackbody radiation; you can look at the color of a star and determine how hot it is, and from there determine many things about its age and mass. The important thing to note is that more store mass means increased nuclear fusion, increasing the temperature as well. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/O-type_star" target="_blank">The O-type star classification</a> are extremely massive and hot. This results in a nice blue-hot color, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnitak" target="_blank">as you can see in pictures</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually does. It goes from the lowest frequency (red) to the highest (frequency).</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>At first, it is just glowing infrared, thus, not glowing in the visible spectrum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, as it gets hotter, it glows red. If you look at the infrared spectrum, it is still glowing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then as it gets hotter, it also glows green. But it doesn't look green because it is glowing red AND green. And when you mix red and green, you get yellow, that's why it looks as if it is glowing yellow, because is glowing red AND green.</p>
</li>
<li>Finally, it glows blue. But remember, it is still glowing infrared, and red, and green, and now, blue as well. And when red and green and blue is mixed, it glows white.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blue hot does exist. Red hot and white hot exist on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_temperature" target="_blank">color temperature</a> scale, measured in Kelvin. If you heat a black body emitter, like iron or the sun, to a certain temperature, it radiates off light at a specific color. That color is identified by the temperature of the emitter. This is one tool we use to predict the temperature, and therefore the contents of stars, by their color. You've never seen metal heated to blue hot because it begins to vaporize before getting that hot. Iron, for example, vaporizes at less than 5000K, which is still very white. Blue hot is around 8000K or 10000K.</p>
<p>This is also why you see light bulbs rated in Kelvin. An incandescent bulb is about 2000K. Midday sunlight is about 3500K. My favorite color that I've ever seen is <a href="http://www.mercedesforum.nl/forum/download/file.php?id=109843" target="_blank">13000K</a>. Your display cannot accurately represent how brilliant of a color it is.</p>
<p>You'll also hear the acronym CRI in reference to artificial lights creating Kelvin colors, like LEDs. CRI is the Color Rendering Index and is a mathematical comparison (up to 100) of how similar the spectrum of light is to an ideal black body emitter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun is actually green hot, however red is below and blue is above green and the mix all together to look mostly white to us. Plants are green because sunlight is strongest in the green and it would burn them if they absorbed it; instead they reflect green and absorb red and blue. When the peak of the intensity of blackbody is on green, it is also going to be emitting red and blue which to us just appears white. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
