		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a state when you are given a goal to achieve (e.g. get cake) but no guidance as to how to achieve it. Moreover everything you try turns out to be somewhat &quot;wrong&quot; and not accepted by other people but noone can tell you how to do it right. </p>
<p>Anomie makes people upset and they need to figure out &quot;a way&quot; to achieve goals. For example people may withdraw themselves from life (<em>cake is bad</em>), choose to achieve set goals in a way disapproved by the society (get cake in any way possible whether others like it or not) or rebel (<em>I don't need cake</em>).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In sociology, anomie is defined as a social dysfunction, an illness if you will, that occurs when socially defined goals are hard or impossible to attain via socially accepted means. For example, when you can't achieve financial &quot;success&quot; by working hard. I imagine it's a similar concept in philosophy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
