		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first arriving units will most often be at the fire before it gets large, so they can relay to the investigators where the fire was and how big it was when they arrived on scene.
Fires will also leave lots of clues as to how fast and hot it burned but also the direction that it came from. There are origin indicators like needle freeze (pine needles that freeze and point in the opposite direction of where the fire came from), charring on trees can tell you a lot depending on how intense the fire was when it burned the tree. Grass can fall back towards the origin in a low intensity fire. There could be no soot on a large rock on the opposite side of where the fire came from. Those are just a few examples.
As to finding how the fire started they have to look at the origin of the fire which is why you look for that before you start looking for how. Once at the origin,  depending on how the fire was started it could be hard easy or impossible to determine. A hot start, where someone just holds a lighter or similar flaming material to the fuel and then takes the lighter and flees is hard to prove. But often times fires don't durn so hot when they first start, depending on many factors, and there could be evidence left behind as to an ignition source. Most accidental fires you can find out who did it either because they confessed or they weren't trying to get away with it so there are witnesses and more evidence. Also most arsonists don't just start ONE fire, they start many. And once there is a known arsonist working an area reports become more general so you can charge him with more fires knowing that you have some that are definitely him and some probably aren't but can't rule him out for it.
And for big, expensive, deadly or suspected arsonist fires there will be multiple expert investigators. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My father is actually a detective who specializes in Fire Investigation. We actually live close to Gatlinburg(within an hour). He helped investigate another fire relativity close(time wise) to the Gat. Fire.</p>
<p>They solve these cases using a forensics analysis and training acquired through Arson schools. They look for burn spots and patterns that match certain accelerants, path of a fire, and so on. </p>
<p>Witnesses are incredibly helpful as well. For instance there were many hikers up on the mountain that day(chimney tops) and many of them were eager to prove their innocence. They can identify others they passed and verify what they were doing during their hike. A polygraph can be used as well. </p>
<p>These particular teens played with matches apparently, and as some are citing above got caught in a picture unknowingly. They also apparently posted a Facebook video with a song about &quot;a mountain on fire&quot;. which was suspicious and got deleted quickly. They also confessed to it as well. </p>
<p>Edit: Apparently the Facebook video is not related and just occurred coincidentally at the same time as the fire. See below.</p>
<p>Edit 2: Thanks guys for all the &quot;Arson Investigation Failures&quot; links referencing the 80's and before. Very relevant /s. It's not like all that new science just got thrown out the window. That said, nothing  in this world is exact so get used to it.</p>
<p>Edit 3(last): You guys are really focusing on the polygraph..... ok here we go. Like a a hammer doesn't build an entire house by itself, so does a polygraph test not build a full case. It's just a side technique at least around here. That said your random &quot;hundred&quot; comments on &quot;pseudo-science&quot;( must have looked that up on the Internet) won't change anything on reddit. Go to your local PD and ask about it's use. Go to town meetings. CHANGE IT if you don't like it!! Quit whining on Reddit and the internet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people have touched on witnesses and cell data but fire investigation is a common practice at all forest fires.</p>
<p>As a Firefighter Crew Leader my crew will often fight the fire without me because I'm off investigating. Signs such as the burn and smoke pattern on trees and stumps will direct you to the origin location, which can be very precise down to a 1 foot square area. Once at the origin location we are trained to look for sources of ignition, matchbooks, debris from flares, tracks from ATVs, etc. then you can determine the exact time the fire started by using a fire behaviour prediction book and you have a time and place. To find a person responsible after that is often luck but if we do find you, you are responsible for the cost of the fire and we are not cheap.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a random side point I lit fire to my bathroom on accident with a candle. The glass holder got hot and broke, the countertop started burning, and a towel had gotten caught before I realized it. It happened super fast and I panicked while throwing water and wet towels on things.  My dad, who is a fire investigator, came home the next morning and 5 seconds in the door asked me what burned (he hadn't seen it just smelled). I tried to tell him but obviously my story didn't match up to the burnt remains.  I wasn't lying, I just genuinely couldn't remember cause I was so panicked. Anyway, he was able to give an exact play by play of how it started, what it caught next, etc.
Tl:dr; fire investigators know their crap.

<p>This article states that another hiker unwittingly got a picture that led to the identification of the two teens. What I'd heard (but don't really have the motivation to go find the specific source of), it that the hiker saw the teens tossing matches, and took the picture of them. Either way, a picture led them to identifying the accused.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
