Earth's orbital speed varies through the year, and that makes the length of a solar day vary slightly through the year. When the solar day is less than 24 hours, noon gets a bit earlier each day. When it's longer than 24 hours, noon gets a bit later each day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The earth orbits the sun in an ellipse - it's farthest from the sun in July and closest in January. Thanks to some complicated math worked out by Johannes Kepler, we know that orbits follow the &quot;law of areas&quot; - basically, the wedge that an orbiting body sweeps out will have the same area for equal amounts of time (if you draw the earth's orbit and tick off each day along it, then connect each tick mark to the sun, the wedges will all have the same area).</p>
<p>With the law of areas in mind, we know that a body (earth) orbiting its host star (the sun) will move faster when it's close and slower when it's farther away. Otherwise the areas wouldn't be equal, and the law wouldn't be valid. Thus, the change in times of sunrises and sunsets are farther apart in January simply because the earth is moving fastest in its orbit.</p>
<p>Kepler figured this out in part with Tycho Brahe by observing the orbit of Mars, which is more elliptical than earth's and so easier to note the effect and not attribute it to data noise.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the earth travels roughly an additional 500,000 km on its elliptical orbit between sunrise and sunset so it's not an equal distribution of distances between the two times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_of_time" target="_blank">equation of time</a> explains this. Spoiler alert: it sounds way cooler than it is.</p>
<p>The major factor is the eccentricity of Earth’s orbit. It’s not quite a circle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
