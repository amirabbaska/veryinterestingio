		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It actually depends on a few factors. What you are cutting, the type of knife or blade you are using, and other things like temperature of the knife and the object you are cutting.</p>
<p>The biggest determiner, is the thing you are cutting. Soft, malleable things like loaves of bread, or very loose meat, don't cut well with a sharp edge because you don't have enough tension in the material you are cutting to press against the blade and create an even cutting surface. Tomatoes and Bread are excellent examples of this. Only the sharpest of sharp knives can even hope to cut cleanly and evenly through some breads and most tomatoes without issue or mushing.</p>
<p>Serated blades, seek to change this by adding in the serrations, tips and points that act to tear and have sharp points that press into what you are cutting and pull small sections, like a saw blade and tear bits and pieces instead of cutting cleanly and straight through.</p>
<p>Very, Very hard things also have the same problem, like bone or frozen foods. The ice makes the object to cut so hard and dense, that a sharp knife is almost useless. A serrated knife on the other hand, can cut by ripping and tearing its way through the object where a standard blade could never perform.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since pressure is measured as a force divided by area ( P = F/A), having serated teeth means the pressure that used to be divided by the whole length of the blade in contact of the material being cut, the pressure gets quite a bit higher, and so more likely to cut through.</p>
<p>There is also the case of cutting thin but strong materials (like leather), then serated teeth do a slightly different thing. The tooth now snags on the material, and instead of only cutting with the downwards force of the blade, you now add the force coming from your hands back and forth action.</p>
<p>Most cases have the the effects added together to some degree, but those are the basic principles of serated teeth. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
