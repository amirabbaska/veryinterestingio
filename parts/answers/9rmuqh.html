		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They do. From the perspective of the pilot, the propeller is spinning clockwise, which makes the plane want to roll to the left.</p>
<p>There is also the fact that because of the relative motion of the plane and prop in the air, the downward part of the propeller's cycle (i.e., the right side) moves more air than the upward (left) part. This makes the plane want to yaw left. </p>
<p>Additionally, the turbulent air flow off the prop affects the tail more strongly on the left than the right, also making the plane want to yaw left. </p>
<p>All of these are corrected with a bit of right trim in the ailerons and rudder, or compensated for manually.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Typical aircraft are designed with some passive aerodynamic stability, so the roll force from the propeller tends to ultimately result in a tendency to yaw left or right. (<a href="http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/webproj/211_fall_2016/Collin_Lasley/collin_lasley/torque.html" target="_blank">http://ffden-2.phys.uaf.edu/webproj/211_fall_2016/Collin_Lasley/collin_lasley/torque.html</a>) If the aircraft is equipped with a trim tab on the rudder, you can get it trimmed out to fly mostly straight without having to maintain constant pressure on the controls.</p>
<p>Some high-performance aircraft have taken more substantial design steps to balance well at the most commonly-used speeds and power settings. For instance, the Macchi C.200 family of fighter aircraft had the left wing about eight inches longer than the right.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others have addressed the mechanisms to compensate for it, but it's worth addressing that the torque is far lower as well. Propellers are smaller and spin faster, so they generate less torque. All actions having an equal and opposite reaction, the resultant torque on the aircraft is much lower. It's torque, not power, that creates that moment around the fuselage, so fundamentally a propeller plane requires less compensation than a helicopter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This was actually a known issue with the high powered piston fighters of the second world war. Spitfires, Hawker hurricanes and so forth all had a tenancy to roll in the direction of their props, especially on takeoff when their control surfaces weren't all that effective yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
