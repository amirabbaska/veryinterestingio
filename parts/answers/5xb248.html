		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>New Zealand and Australia used their own independent pounds, shillings and pence for some time after they had independence. When they decimalised, they found people worked in shillings. So they came up with a system where the cent was similar in value to the old penny, and 10 cents was a worth one old shilling. To keep it decimal, they needed a new currency worth 100 cents, and so they picked the name &quot;dollar&quot; because it's understood as a currency name, and other proposals were unpopular.</p>
<p>Other countries weren't straight for their own currency, and adopted a decimal currency with a similar value to their neighbours. Dollars were recognizably different from pounds, so made sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Spanish Dollar (aka &quot;pieces of eight&quot;) weighed about the same as a Crown coin.  A crown was worth 5 shillings or 100 pence, so it was the natural unit to convert to when you're trying to decimalize with existing coins.  Also, during the 19th century the Japanese, French,  Americans, and British minted &quot;trade dollars&quot; of equal weight to the Spanish dollar as it had become the de facto currency of trade in Asia.  So to many the Trade Dollar appeared to be on its way to being a global currency.  This notion fell apart in the early 20th century.</p>
<p>The UK did not do this because they decimalized very late and was less interested in fixing value to the pence or the crown but in retaining the &quot;very British&quot; pound.  So they kept the unit and reminted all the coins (which is more expensive, but not as challenging in the modern age).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>German: Thaler</p>
<p>Dutch: Daalder</p>
<p>In English, these became dollar. The dollar was a silver coin minted by a variety of Dutch &amp; German countries. And Bohemia. Yes, the Netherlands used the guilder as their currency before the Euro - that was their name for their gold coin. We're talking about silver here, which is far more widespread &amp; important.</p>
<p>The Dutch were heavily involved in international trade, including the fur trade in North America. So the word stuck. More importantly, the Spanish were minting galleon-loads of silver pesos like you wouldn't believe. From Mexico, and especially from Potosi. Potosi was a mountain made of so much silver it basically destabilized both Europe and China because it caused so much inflation. Pesos, pesos everywhere! In fact, our dollar sign probably comes from the mint-mark for Potosi coins.</p>
<p>English-language countries continued to use the word dollar for pesos because both coins contained the same amount of silver. In contrast, British pounds were heavier, containing more silver than a dollar/peso. With the wide-spread Spanish minting, the Spanish weight (also the dollar weight) became the international standard. And as other posters mentioned, Britain kept most of its gold &amp; silver in the domestic market.</p>
<p>So all around the world in British colonies people were using daadlers-called-dollars and pesos-called-dollars. But they couldn't call them the pound - because pounds are a different weight.</p>
<p>Paper currency without inherent value doesn't become common until after all these countries gained independence. If it had, those former colonies probably would be using something called the pound.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Australia: When we swapped to decimal currency we swapped from dollars to pounds. The name change was to distinguish between the two, especially as there was a period during the transition where both could be used at once. Note that the change was NOT made at federation (independence) in 1901, it was made when the currency was decimalised in the 1960s.</p>
<p>A lot of names were thrown around for the new currency, opinion polls and all that, in the end the Federal Cabinet just went with dollars and cents. <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/money-exchange-when-australian-swapped-pounds-for-dollars-20160211-gmrm3a.html" target="_blank">Article on it</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
