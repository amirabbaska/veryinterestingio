		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that nobody knows for sure. It might have been an asteroid hitting in just the right direction, slowing it down and reversing it. It might have been the atmosphere dragging it backwards. There are some <a href="https://youtu.be/vEiSZaRnfIg" target="_blank">videos on the subject</a> that you can check out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One common theory is that asteroids hit it to the point where it completely reversed the direction it turned. All planets have a slight tilt, most likely from asteroids. </p>
<p>Edit: The theory states that a bunch of asteroids most likely hit the planet, not just one. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My question would be &quot;at what point does an object start spinning once in space?&quot;.  I mean is it possible that during its formation that all the impacts during its coalescence basically had it spinning in an opposite way; perhaps with the help of a now ejected planetary body?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know but it could be any number of random reasons. The direction most of the planets spin is not a hard rule but just the most likely way for them to spin given how our star system formed.</p>
<p>Imagine having like 5 similar skipping stones in your hand and trying to toss them all at once across the lake. 3 skip along nicely, 1 skips once, shoots off to the side and sinks, and the last flops out of your hand and hits the ground. Basically, shit happens.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
