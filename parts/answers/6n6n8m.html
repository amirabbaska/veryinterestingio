		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The common definition of berry certainly preceded the scientific one and the usage developed separately with little or no influence from the scientific terminology. Berry is present in Old English &quot;berye&quot; and has cognates in old German and Norse including &quot;beri&quot; and &quot;ber,&quot; all with essentially the same meaning that's very similar to the modern usage for a small colorful fruit, often collected in the wild.</p>
<p>In the 1700s, Linnaeus introduced usage of the Latin word &quot;baca&quot; for fruits that are the fleshy pericarp of a single ovary and with soft seeds or pips. This was an existing Latin word that also referred to several types of small colorful fruits often collected in the wild, but also with a special connection specifically to grapes, which are indeed a berry in Linnaeus's botanical sense. Even during Linnaeus's lifetime, this usage was translated into English and Germanic languages using &quot;berry&quot; and its cognates, probably because the meanings were so similar (they may be related in proto-Indo-European).</p>
<p>So, I think Linnaeus and later taxonomists were just taking these existing words that were close enough rather than creating a whole new word out of thin air, which is really hardly ever done. Many other fruits that were (and are) commonly called berries were also berries in this new scientific usage, including currants and gooseberries, cranberries and blueberries, elderberries, etc. I think also that many of the fruits which are technically berries, but not commonly thought of as berries were not yet familiar to Europeans, like avocados, bananas, pumpkins, etc., so at the time it probably didn't seem as odd as it does today.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Looking at this from the other side. Scientific (biology) terms frequently group things together by their taxonomic or morphological function. Culinary terms largely group items by flavour profile or the role they play in a dish because it is more useful in the kitchen to know what items are say soft and sweet than it is to know their evolutionary heritage.</p>
<p>This allows you to know that all culinary berries are somewhat interchangeable in recipes. So if you know you can make gooseberry and raspberry fools this immediately suggests you can probably also make strawberry or blackcurrant fools. Or that you can likely make fries from stratchy root vegetables other than potato.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
