When you close a door, the sound has to make this ' medium shift ' twice: from the air to the door (solid), and from the door to the air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds travels best in solids <em>once it is already there</em>.</p>
<p>Energy is lost when sound traverses a medium, as much of it reflected back.  It is the same reason sounds <em>in</em> the room become louder when a door is closed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I believe this is because energy is lost when traversing between different mediums.  So when sound waves are passed from air to a solid (door), a measure of energy is lost.  Then when the sound waves must pass again from the solid into the air on the other side of the door, more sound energy is lost.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Essentially at any interface where the speed of sound changes, some of the sound energy gets reflected back into the originating area. </p>
<p>That's true of waves in general whether light or water or electronics, or anything else, if they go into medium where the speed of the wave changes, some energy bounces back.  It's why you see light reflecting off water, and why soundwaves don't propagate well from the air to the water.  Trying to get energy from one media to another is a process known as &quot;impedance matching&quot; if you want to investigate it further and see it at a &quot;Non-5&quot; level.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what /u/jesusfreek  and /u/the_bookworm wrote, most doors and walls are not solid all the way through. Walls, for example, are often filled with insulation which contains many air pockets. And many doors these days are hollow core doors, so there would be more than 1 each of air-to-solid and solid-to-air transitions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
