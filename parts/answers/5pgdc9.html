		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On mobile a a coffee shop, so forgive any formatting issues. I studied sports and recreational management at school and had a few courses specifically on playground development and history. </p>
<p>In short, playgrounds are all developed for specific ages and the equipment is designed to help develop physical and social attributes. I'll need to go back to my old notes for the exact age breakdowns but basically: very young ages to help build balance and coordination and motor skills, toddler-child age the equipment focuses on building strength in children (monkey bars, see-saws) and social skills (fake climbing walls, swings, etc.). And parks for adults focus on a mix of physical and social (basketball courts, tennis, disc golf, etc).</p>
<p>Slides, see saws and other playground equipment don't have stringent standards besides safety standards (although this is changing more and more as research on safety and play habits increases) but standard playground equipment all have a specific purpose depending on the age, skills, and intent of use for the target demographic. (classic park for children vs basketball &amp;  tennis courts for adults vs walking, scenic or gardens for seniors). </p>
<p>More diverse playground equipment is being made to include multiple ages and developmental goals but it's also why in certain areas you can find out dated equipment that appears sketchy or downright dangerous but is always more fun than hyper safe new equipment. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cool question, thanks for asking. I looked it up, and found <a href="http://www.aaastateofplay.com/history-of-playgrounds/" target="_blank">this</a> website that seems pretty good.</p>
<p>&quot;The first playground was built in Manchester, England, but the idea of playgrounds was first developed in Germany. Playgrounds were presented as a way to teach children how to play safely and fairly with one another. The first sketched concept of a playground was produced in 1848 by Henry Barnard and featured a large, shaded area with teachers looking on as children played with wooden blocks, toy carts, and two rotary swings. However, it would be another 39 years before the first playground was built in America, and in the meantime, children needed a safe, designated place to play games. Many children, especially in urban areas, played in the streets or on curbs, and there was constant danger from being hit by passing cars. &quot;Play streets,&quot; or streets largely ignored by road traffic, were a popular option for children to seek out.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a decent scholarpedia article on the matter: <a href="http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Evolution_of_American_Playgrounds#Model_Playgrounds" target="_blank">Evolution of American Playgrounds</a></p>
<p>It appears that the earliest &quot;modern&quot; playground came about in the late 19th century at Hull House in Chicago, followed closely by ones in Philadelphia, Minneapolis, Pittsburg, and Denver. The playground at Hull House had swings, sand piles, hammocks, and a maypole, and the motivation for creating these spaces was to promote socialization and to keep children safe and out of the streets.</p>
<p>As to why we see certain standardized pieces in playgrounds, it appears to have evolved into its current form with ever-growing safety concerns:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “standardized playground” era... reflected the design and redesign of manufactured playground equipment, primarily the four S’s -swings, slides, see-saws, superstructures, and the prevalence of surrounding hard surfaces typically seen on American playgrounds throughout much of the 20th century. During the 1970’s and 1980’s standardizing playground equipment developed simultaneously with concerns about playground injuries, increasing lawsuits, and formation of task forces to prepare national standards for playground equipment safety (Kutska, 2011). Executive Director of the International Playground Safety Institute, authored the most comprehensive reference addressing current playground safety data.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would also imagine those &quot;Four S's&quot; are fairly cheap to manufacture on a large scale.</p>
<p>TL;DR: They're relatively &quot;safe&quot; and easy to manufacture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wow - Something I can actually answer.  I'm a designer at a custom playground design build firm. </p>
<p>The typical modern playground - often called post and deck has been around for about 30 years.  It was developed by a guy named Jay Beckwith in collaboration with a large European playground company.  The idea was that it could be modular and include lots of different elements that could be be attached - Slide, climbing bars,  sliding pole... Etc.  It's only in the last year or two that post and deck has been getting subbed out for other systems. </p>
<p>Truthfully, I'm not as sure about swings - they have been around quite a while. Generally I think they are standard in a playground because the goal of any playground design is to have a diversity of experiences - movement based play (swings,  see saws, slides etc) - climbing/balancing - passive (hiding) - the list goes on. Swings are a cost efficient and relatively safe way to provide some movement based play. </p>
<p>I don't see loads of see saws anymore. Risk of injury on them tends to be higher so the demand for them tanked. </p>
<p>Over time trends in playground equipment are typically set by our tolerance for risk. More and more the tolerance has been on the decline - which in my perspective is a detriment to the development of kids. In such a litigious environment cities and communities don't want anything that might increase their chance of getting sued. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey sweet, I wrote a thesis paper relating to this question! </p>
<p>The domain of play has seriously shrunk since the early 1900s. Kids used to have to create their own fun by playing in the streets, forests, empty lots, whatever they could find. When cars became a more popular, affordable form of transportation, play started to diminish because it was more dangerous for kids to be running around on the streets. Some early forms of playgrounds, which are still used in Europe but never gained popularity like adventure/&quot;junk&quot; playgrounds basically put a bunch of building supplies in front of kids and from there on children built their own play equipment. </p>
<p>In North America, mass production and a growing trend in parenting styles where child safety became a top priority ensured the streamlining of equipment basically up to what you'd find in most playgrounds across America. Different organizations release reports on injuries every year, and different equipment is dropped when it's considered &quot;too dangerous&quot; for kids. </p>
<p>What most parents aren't really aware of is the fact that playgrounds are meant to be a little bit dangerous, because they are designed for the development of skills like risk assessment and team building. If there are any parents reading this now-- let your kids on the playground as long as the surfacing (what's under the play equipment) isn't hard like concrete or a thin layer of sand. That's what really causes the injuries!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
