		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because a factorial is how many ways you can arrange a bunch of items in a set. You can arrange 1 item in one way {1}, 2 items in 2 ways {1,2} and {2.1}, 3 items in 6 ways etc. You can arrange 0 items in one way, it is an empty set. You can make one combination with it {} so 0! is equal to 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>1! = 1 = 1 * 0! = 0!</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is that when you multiply no numbers, you get 1, not 0. This is because one is the multiplicitave identity; it's the value that has no effect, when used for multiplication. Zero, meanwhile, has quite an extreme effect. Zero is the addative identity, so adding no numbers together gives you zero.</p>
<p>Consider it this way: Multiplying a number by no other numbers should not change it, right? But if the value of &quot;No numbers multiplied together&quot; were zero, then multiplying a number by no other numbers would change it to zero.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1 <em>is</em> what you get when you have no numbers to multiply. 0 is what you get when you have no numbers to <em>add</em>. </p>
<p>The reason for this is relatively simple. If the number you got by multiplying no numbers was 0, then, because everything multiplied by 0 is 0, multiplication of any two numbers would be 0. So, in order for math to no break down like that, it must be the case that 1 is the number that you get when you have no numbers to multiply together.</p>
<p>Another way to look at it is: what number multiplied by any other number is the same thing as doing nothing? That number is 1. You can multiply any number you want by 1 any number of times, and you'll get the exact same thing. So, multiplying by 1 is the same thing as doing nothing, and so, 1 is what you get before you've done anything at all.</p>
<p>In any case, the key here is that addition and multiplication are different, and things don't necessarily transfer over in the ways you might think. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>n! follows a pattern:</p>
<p>5! = 120 | ÷5</p>
<p>4! = 24 | ÷4</p>
<p>3! = 6 | ÷3</p>
<p>2! = 2 | ÷2</p>
<p>1! = 1 | ÷1</p>
<p>0! = 1</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we have n!, to get from there to (n-1)!, we simply divide n! by n. If n=1, we have 1! = 1. To get to 0!, we calculate:</p>
<p><em>1!/1 ---&gt; 1/1 ---&gt; 1</em>.</p>
<p>Therefore, 0! equals 1.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
