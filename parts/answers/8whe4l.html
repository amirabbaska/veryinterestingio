		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>X rated movies (outside of the US, short for explicit) are supposed to be viewed by mature audiences only, due to extreme violence, language, or sexual content. This is equivalent to NC-17 rating in the US (no children below 17 admitted), which is a step above R rating (which children can get into if they have a parent/guardian with them).</p>
<p>For a while, film makers were content with X. Then they wanted to get the point across that some films were raunchier than others, so they used XX. Now we're at a point where everything is XXX, which is three-explicit levels. </p>
<p>Basically, it was a required denotation that eventually became marketing gimmick that caught on and is now a cultural icon. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the modern film ratings system was created in 1968, the “X” rating was intended to denote films only suitable for adult audiences. However, since the “X” rating was not copyrighted by the MPAA, it was often self-applied by porn producers who wanted to market their films to adults only. One “X” became two “X”s and then three “X”s. One can only assume that the additional X’s were added to draw the attention of men walking past porno theaters back in the 1970s and 80s, the decades during which “X” and “XXX” became pervasive and synonymous with pornography. Finally, in 1990 the MPAA decided to replace the “X” rating with NC-17, because the “X” rating had become so linked to porn that legitimate theaters wouldn’t show “X” rated films, and newspapers wouldn’t allow advertisements for them, thereby dooming any “X” rated film to commercial failure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
