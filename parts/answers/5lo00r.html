		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on the 'poison' you're talking about. A lot of toxicity in humans is caused not by the chemical itself, but by what the liver breaks it down into. For example, ethanol(drinking alcohol) is converted to acetaldehyde in the liver while isopropanol(rubbing alcohol) is converted to acetone. One of these(ethanol) is 'relatively' safe for us to consume. The other is fatal in pretty small doses</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sorry what? A gall bladder has nothing to do with it. The reason why certain animals don't have gall bladders is generally their dietary habits - hind gut fermenting animals that are grazers don't all have a gall bladder (horses for example). </p>
<p>The gall bladder stores bile created by the liver and discharges into the small intestine. Animals without a gall bladder (and I assume people too) still create bile it just doesn't get stored - it trickles into the small intestine at a more constant rate. </p>
<p>I'm a vet so not 100% on the human aspects. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't seem to find a source for deer being able to consume rodotoxin because they don't have a gall bladder or anything relating toxicity to the gall bladder... But the toxicity is due to &quot; an inability to inactivate neural sodium ion channels resulting in continuous increased vagal tone&quot;. This mechanism is the same in humans and animals, and since I don't see a relation to the gall bladder I'm going to say yes it would still be toxic. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Due to us being omnivores, we have a gallbladder to store bile.  Bile helps to break down fat when we eat meat and other fatty foods.  That is its one and only purpose.  It doesn't have any relation to poisons or the ability or inability to process chemicals in the body.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gallbladder has nothing to do with breaking down toxins, it's sole purpose is to store and concentrate bile that was made in the liver (though some waste products are excreted in bile). Toxin management is the liver's job (and to some degree the kidneys). If it's true that deer can eat poisonous plants it's because they have a specific enzyme that is able to break the toxins down. Different animals have adapted to eat different things, e.g. termites can digest cellulose because their gut has cellulase which breaks it into more simple sugars, humans cannot (we just poop it out - which is why fiber is good for constipation - it stays in your gut and pulls water in to keep your stool hydrated/flowing).
If you had you're gallbladder out, don't try eating poison...you're gonna have a bad time.</p>
