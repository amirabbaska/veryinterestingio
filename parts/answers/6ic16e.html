		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ingrown hairs have already been explained, but do you mean those white, fast-growing, brittle hairs?</p>
<p>From what I've found from googling a while ago, it's just a mutated hair follicle that, because of the mutation, ends up producing the hair much faster than it should. As a result it's unpigmented and not very strong. It also grows much longer than the hairs on that part of the body usually do, like 2-3 cm long hairs in places you'd normally only get peach fuzz.</p>
<p>I get them occasionally myself, my girlfriend had one that grew back in the same place several times. After plucking my girlfriend's &quot;whisker&quot; the last time, the root of the hair came out with it, and it hasn't been back since. All the previous times, the hair just broke off at the base because it's so brittle.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've actually observed this with a couple hairs that I know grow (back) in certain places including in my ear, waist-band, and upper chest/lower neck.  At least in my case, I can see them growing under the skin as a dark line (tends to break out cleanly by ~¼-½&quot;) or spot (a curled-up hair; tends to be more painful and come out springy-looking).</p>
<p>At some point, enough dead skin ablates off and a portion of the hair is exposed.  With this, any rubbing tends to agitate the hair out the rest of the way, breaking any dead skin along the way back toward the root area. And presto, you've welcomed a new friend into the world.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These are overgrowths of vellus hairs (peach fuzz) often caused by either a hormone imbalance, a change in diet, stress, or fine scar tissue.  People get them at any point in their life and because their cause can be so varied, they are not reliable indicators of any condition. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
