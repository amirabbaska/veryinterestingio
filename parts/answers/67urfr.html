		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a lifetime poor sleeper I wanted to chime in with something that has been such a big help for me.  When you are laying down head on the pillow, don't think about life.  This has messed up things for me for years, I never tried to control my thought patterns.  Today I will not let my mind wander and I do this by using a trick.  Think back to a time you took a hike, walked a route to school, were driving a familiar route etc.   Then force your mind to &quot;revisualize&quot; that walk.  For instance, I remember my old bus route when I was a kid. I picture myself lying there, listening to the Diesel engine, looking out the window at the trees etc.  It's made a world of difference for me but takes some getting used to- if you find yourself reverting to life thoughts again, stop and start over.  I'm sure this will get buried, but I just wanted to throw it out there for anyone like me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is very much an individual thing. A great many people have serious issues having a nap in the middle of the day but go to bed at night and instant snore time it is.</p>
<p>There's a lot of things that can influence this beyond whatever your genetics say about you. </p>
<p>On-the-job conditions in a lot of fields such as in armed forces or emergency room workers can teach you to sleep wherever you can whenever you can.</p>
<p>Your nighttime habits are a big factor - you're gonna be tired for sure if you frequently Reddit until 3AM. </p>
<p>And there's your body's physical stuff like your level of exercise and fitness, and your eating habits and blood sugar levels, that can influence things. A couple quarter-pounders for lunch and by 3PM you can barely keep your eyes open.</p>
<p>So, lots of factors, different for every person.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey! I made a quick <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6FPtBKYpto&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">video to answer your question.</a> If you don't want to watch the video I'll sum up why I think it's easier to nap than sleep. Or why you have problems sleeping:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Naps can be great, but they can also be the cause of the problem. See if you can cut the naps out, and if you find it easier to fall asleep then that's great!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome (DSPS) may also be the problem. This is a problem with some teens and young adults, but it can persist in later life. This makes it harder to fall asleep, and acutally pushes the time it takes to fall asleep back by 2 hours. This can be problematic as your brain can start to wander.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most peoples day structures around working/studying in the day and then getting home. You are then exhausted from this and fancy taking a nap. However, you spend the rest of the evening relaxing so you're not exactly tired at night! Technically not tired anyway, a good way to combat this is to not have a nap so you're still exhausted or do some excercise!</p>
</li>
<li>It could be diet, if you are eating/drinking sugary items a few hours before bed this could have a negative impact on your ability to fall asleep. This goes with caffeine too, it can impact on your sleep even 6 hours after consuming!</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helped, I also hope you enjoyed the <strong>joke</strong> at the end of the video.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Greetings,</p>
<p>I work a 6 AM shift and I have never been a morning person. It seems you're either a morning person or a night owl by genetics. Fellow groggy co-workers agree that after 15+ years they are still not 'morning people'. </p>
<p>Companies like 23andMe.com ['found 15 genes that are associated with being a morning person'] (<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/do-you-have-the-genetic-profile-of-a-morning-person/" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/do-you-have-the-genetic-profile-of-a-morning-person/</a>) after conducting a survey of nearly 90,000 people. There is even a cool map of <a href="http://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/newshour/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Morningness-Map-23andMe-1024x532.png" target="_blank">Proportion of Morning People by State</a>.</p>
<p>I agree with most replies below: It's <strong>also</strong> about sleep hygiene, diet, fitness, etc. One cannot ignore the science as well, especially when as a kid I used to sleep until 1PM on summer break and I felt great!!! Guess I am a night owl.</p>
<p><strong>TIPS on getting more sleep</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get the software (Win/Android) <a href="https://justgetflux.com/" target="_blank">f.lux</a> which manipulates your monitors color temperature to match the sunrise/set.</li>
<li>Enable <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2016/03/23/how-to-set-up-use-night-shift-mode-iphone-ipad-video/" target="_blank">Night Shift</a> on iOS.</li>
<li>Stretch in the morning</li>
<li>If sleeping for less than or equal to 5 hours, eat a big breakfast as soon as you wake up.</li>
<li>Start a sleep prep routine such as: turn off all lights, put phone to charge and leave it there, prep for the morning, brush teeth, floss (underrated skill), sleep (without picking up your phone)</li>
<li>Find a bulb that also shines at a warmer color temperature, I have a <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PLR3M0M/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank">GE Align PM bulb</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>None of the tips will work if you do not make a conscience choice to prepare yourself mentally and physically for a good nights rest. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's a couple of things I have noticed about myself:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the afternoon, you have things to do that you possibly don't want to do. It's easier to want to procrastinate this way, including procrastinating by falling asleep. For the longest time, it was hard for me to relax unless I was ignoring my work. When I had no work, I could hardly relax. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may have gotten a not-so-good sleep the previous night, so you are tired during the afternoon. By evening, you've eaten and been moving around so you're energized and feel more awake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Light concentration. Daylight seems &quot;duller&quot; to me than having the bright laptop in an otherwise dark room. This concentrated light seems to be more intense and make me want to keep my eyes open longer. I also read something about the blue light from screens messing with your internal sleeping machinery, so that's possible.</p>
</li>
<li>It's cooler at night, which makes me less relaxed than during the day. The warm air and heat makes me sleepy.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any or none of these could apply to you, OP.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
