		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Please correct me if I'm wrong. But isn't the important distinction here between &quot;decompose&quot; and &quot;bio-degrade&quot;? My understanding is that plastics decompose, but never bio-degrade. Plastic never stops being plastic. It merely becomes smaller and smaller units of plastic until microscopic. And microscopic plastic eventually infects water supply.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without repeating the bit about plastic bonds breaking down;
Back in the day when you had a boat and wanted to know how much weight you could put in it before it sank, you just added stones until the water was close to the rim.
Then... One day you didn't have to put stone in, you could find someone who had done this for a lot of boats. They could give you an educated guess.
Then... One day you could find a smart person with a pencil and paper. They could calculate the mass of the water displaced by the boat and tell you the weight it could hold.</p>
<p>That's where we are with calculating how long plastics last. Leaving a sample out over years is the equivalent of going back to stones in boats again. You can still do it, but it's more for checking if your number crunching is correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
