		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sound barrier is how fast sound moves in air. But sound is just waves moving in the air, so really it's how fast the air &quot;likes&quot; to move. Which also means it's how fast the air &quot;likes&quot; to move out of the way if you're moving through it (just like moving in water, you have to push the air out of the way). If the speed of sound is how fast the air &quot;likes&quot; to move but you're moving faster than that, you have to forcibly &quot;push&quot; the air out of the way faster than it naturally wants to move. This &quot;push&quot; requires extra energy, and pushes some of the air together (kind of like an air compressor pushing air into a tire, but instead of rubber surrounding the air it's just surrounded by other air that doesn't &quot;want&quot; to move as fast as you're pushing it). </p>
<p>Once you've moved past, the air wants to find a way to decompress, and now that nothing around it is moving faster than the speed of sound it decompresses by pushing the surrounding air out of the way. Much like you'd pop a balloon (or a bicycle tire filled with compressed air) and the balloon makes a &quot;pop&quot; as it releases air; the air that was &quot;compressed&quot; by something moving through it faster than the speed of sound makes a &quot;pop&quot; as it decompresses behind the object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a tiny, bouncing ball on the surface of a pond, with ripples spreading outwards from it.  The ripples always travel at the same speed, regardless of what the ball is doing. When it's still, the ripples spread out evenly in every direction. But if the ball starts moving slowly across the pond, the <a href="https://62e528761d0685343e1c-f3d1b99a743ffa4142d9d7f1978d9686.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/files/12550/area14mp/hbsmgt9g-1341284530.jpg" target="_blank">ripples in front of it will be closer together than the ones behind it</a>.</p>
<p>Now, if the ball moves exactly at the speed of the ripples, then the ripples at the leading edge can't get away from the ball and dissipate - they just accumulate, so all that energy is concentrated along a single, massive leading ripple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose you're travelling at the speed of sound, a bit faster though, in any direction you want, in air. </p>
<p>Sound waves you're generating will sound normal in all directions, except the one you're heading to, because what happens is that yourself can arrive there before your own sound waves do it, and all along the way you start carrying that wave in front of you, basically distorting it and amplifying it. Like there are hundreds of copies of that same noise packed together in a single instant.</p>
<p>If someone else is standing still and you pass above them, you'll bring a loud BOOM with you right after your passage, and then they'll hear the noise that's actually coming from around you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer is that molecules can't get out of the way of others creating a shock wave. A shock wave is NOT a single occurrence, but instead a surface at which the state of the air changes dramatically across a very tiny gap. Temperature and Pressure changes are nearly instantaneous. This causes a &quot;lot&quot; of energy to be released in the form of sound. (a lot for sound anyway) Shock waves are very fascinating. They are in no way &quot;pulling through&quot; or &quot;bunching up&quot; as shown in some graphics. Bunching up of molecules imply they are communicating with each other and creating a high pressure. The fundamental quality of a shock wave is that air/fluid molecules don't have time to communicate with each other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
