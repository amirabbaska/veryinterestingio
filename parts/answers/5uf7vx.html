		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't quote me on this but from my personal research and studies on cognition, emotion, memory, and the ego. I believe that tasks that we don't feel like doing, which doesn't have high priority is quickly replaced by other tasks or thoughts of higher priority. Some of which maybe for entertainment and others for urgency. Such as tending to a child.</p>
<p>The pizza in the oven is not of immediate urgency but will become. So we get this feeling in the back of our minds. That there is something of importance but not urgent enough to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Off topic but on topic</p>
<p>I have found that many aspects of our lives work in the same manner. Sometimes there are even subjects in which we don't want to remember. So the subconscious mind which I believe is controlled by emotions. Has a funny ways of tricking our conscious minds into forgeting or remembering things according to particular feelings.</p>
<p>Hope my experiences help</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You remember things, by remembering the last time you remembered that. It's a kind of chain, and often retrieved information after some time gets its own set of neuron paths and stays there. Minute things in short-term memory may just float away, if that remembering chain is broken.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a sensoric (ultra-short), a short-term and a long term memory. The problem with the pizza within the oven is a problem of the short term memory. A &quot;chunk&quot; is lost, your pizza burns within the oven. Your brain thought, the information wasn't important enough to &quot;store&quot; it within long term memory.</p>
<p>Explaination</p>
<p>1st you have the sensoric memory - it is ultra fast and ultra short (e. g. image recognition in apperception, etc.)
2nd there is the short term memory that is limited to &quot;chunks&quot; - limited logical chains and - if it is really important (according to your brain) it's
3rd stored within the long term memory by creating new neuronal (dendritical) connections within your brain.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short-term/working memory has limited capacity, and not everything in short-term memory is 'transferred' into longer-term storage. It's entirely possible to remember that you need to attend to something at Time X without recalling the details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
