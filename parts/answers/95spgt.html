		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I set these down myself for my city! </p>
<p>They are hollow tubes that allow air to be pushed down to a box at the end of the tube when cars drive over them! The tubes can be used simply to count cars or as mentioned by others, to calculate speed at which cars travel over them (when using 2 tubes at a specific distance apart). </p>
<p>A traffic engineer would use these data points to run a simulation to see if the road needs widening, a turn lane added, or many other possibilities. It also helps correcting estimations for traffic flows as cities grow.</p>
<p>Edit: The tubes are simply screwed into the concrete or asphalt using wire fasteners and a pilot hole. Sometimes they get ripped out/apart D:</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>That knowledge is useful to show when rush hours start/end and what signal timing plan to use throughout the day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You assumed correctly. Those strips are just traffic counters. They count how many times something big smushes them. If you have two of them, you can also measure speed by comparing the time between similarly timed smushes. </p>
<p>You can use the information generated for anything that the information might be useful for. It could be upcoming construction, or zoning, or funding, or whatever.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They count how much traffic is on a given road. Each time you drive over it, that's recorded. </p>
<p>A scientist for the city/county then takes this data and determines where the road budget will ha e the greatest effect. Typically this means comparing the worst road conditions to amount of traffic. But for like, all roads in the area.</p>
<p>Fun fact, I grew up in a really out of the way place, there were only two roads that got you to my neighborhood. So whenever one of those roads had one of those sensors the neighbors made a big deal about it and everyone would go do a few laps to artificially pump up our &quot;traffic&quot; and therefore make it more likely that our roads would be improved. I think this is a somewhat common practice. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
