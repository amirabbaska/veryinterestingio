		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yeah, all food is microwaveable (well, unless it has gold or silver leaf in it as some pastries may).</p>
<p>Non-microwaveable cookware absorbs microwave radiation and so it'll get hot, and also prevent the food from getting hot.  That's all.</p>
<p>Microwaveable cookware generally does not absorb much microwave radiation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's usually the container that is or is not microwaveable, not the food itself.  But some foods don't come out well.  For example, if you have a day-old dinner roll and want to soften it to make it seem fresher, you can nuke it for just a few seconds, and that works, but any longer, and it will just turn to mush.  Same with pizza, because of the dough.  So the best method is to nuke your leftover slice for 30-45  seconds to soften it, then pop it into a toaster oven for a few minutes to firm up the crust again. </p>
<p>So for what ever reason, bread does not microwave well.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All food is microwavable and safe to eat if you cook it long enough. The only time it's unsafe to microwave foods is when they are packaged or held in something containing metal. </p>
<p>Cooking instructions will sometimes tell you not to microwave foods just because they might not taste good as compare to other cooking methods. Foods like pizza and fries won't crisp in the microwave, meats won't brown like they do on a pan or grill, and vegetables get mushy as compared to when they're steamed. It's usually more about flavor than anything else.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
