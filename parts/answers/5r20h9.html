		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three characteristics that psychology hypothesizes (and the evidence supports) are so integral to human societies that we have a biological predisposition to processing. They are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Gender</li>
<li>Age</li>
<li>Group Membership</li>
</ol>
<p>They are distinguished from other characteristics in that they are processed and encoded a) very quickly b) involuntarily c) culturally universally and d) with very accurate recall.</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, the work of Leda Cosmides is relevant; you might google her for more info.</p>
<p>So while our perceptions and behaviour will certainly add a layer of complexity to identifying gender; it is very likely we have some innate neural circuitry devoted to it.</p>
<p>Edit: Group Membership</p>
<p>Originally, the list was gender, age, and <em>race</em>. However, from an evolutionary perspective --- necessary if we're supposing that there is any innate biological predisposition going on --- it makes no sense for race to be in this group. Humans have not been exposed to substantially different groups of other humans on an evolutionary time scale. Some very clever experimentation (see source below) established that it was instead &quot;group membership&quot; that was the important factor. That is, we do have a vested interest in establishing who belongs to our tribe and who does not belong to our tribe such that it could potentially be an evolutionary pressure.</p>
<p>&quot;Group Membership&quot; really is as general and vague as it sounds --- it's about who belongs to the same &quot;group&quot; as us and who does not and that will vary depending on context. In any given context, we belong to multiple overlapping, hierarchical and competing groups and changing context changes the relative importance of those groups.  We will attend to indicators of group membership <em>to the degree that they are relevant</em> in a specific context. To the degree that race is an indicator of group membership within a community, it will be perceived and encoded in the same fast, automatic, rigorous manner than gender and age are.</p>
<p>The experiment in the source below shifted the social context to team sports and showed that they could override the race effect and replace it with team membership.</p>
<p>This seems to explain a lot of sensitivities that subcultures evolve that outsiders are largely oblivious to. For instance, everyone has an idea of what a &quot;valley girl&quot; sounds like when she's talking, but few realize that there was variation between groups of &quot;valley girls&quot;, particularly in their grammatical use of 'like', that was a clear indication to each other which group they belonged to, even though it was not necessarily a conscious behaviour on their part. Spend enough time with them, and you'd cue to those differences as well.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, I felt this perceptual shift myself... I'm Canadian but went to grad school in the US. While it would be ridiculous to suggest that growing up I didn't <em>perceive</em> racial differences---I obviously did---I witnessed a subtle (and extremely uncomfortable) shift in my perceptions in the US. Race just had an <em>impact</em> that it didn't before and I found that I was more sensitive to it. It didn't really change my behaviour, but in my environment (a small college town in a red state) there was very little racial mixing. This was a couple of years before I encountered studies below that helped me explain that experience.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just want to make a related point here which might help you interpret other answers.  </p>
<p>There's often not a clear distinction between &quot;hardwired&quot; and &quot;learned&quot; in human (or animal) behavior.  Some things are fully hardwired (for example, you don't have to learn how to beat your heart) and some are entirely learned (like the Konami code).  But in many cases we are hardwired to learn.  For example, rats (and humans) aren't hardwired to know that certain foods (like rotting foods) can make you sick.  But they <em>are</em> hardwired to rapidly associate nausea with flavors eaten beforehand, even if there's a significant time gap.  If you give a rat a flavor, then make it feel nausea through some other means afterwords (radiation was originally used), the rat will avoid that flavor in the future.  If you try the same thing with a light or a noise instead of a flavor, the rat won't learn nearly as quickly or easily.  That's because rats are hardwired to link taste and nausea. (here's the <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/122/3160/157" target="_blank">original paper</a>, though IIRC the first one doesn't test other senses.  Also it's paywalled)</p>
<p>Likewise, humans are not hardwired to walk, but they are hardwired to learn to walk.  Human infants tend to do certain activities (like move the legs alternatively, sit up, and observe and mimic those around them) that lead them to learn to walk.  But the actual walking motion and the precursors that lead up to it have to be learned and practiced.  And toddlers have to learn about what sort of ground they can walk over without falling (eg, gaps and edges).  They have to practice motor control to improve it.  So walking is instinctively learned.  Here's a <a href="http://www.psych.nyu.edu/adolph/publications/AdolphRobinson-inpress-LearningToWalkPreprint.pdf" target="_blank">paper</a> you can read if you'd like to learn more.</p>
<p>There are plenty more examples out there...language being a big one.  So when you read about &quot;hardwired&quot; or &quot;learned&quot; behaviors, ask yourself if those definitions are capturing the entirety of what's occurring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alright I'll take a stab at this one!</p>
<p>Short answer yes, but the longer answer is yes but it doesn't really mean anything.</p>
<p>I found <a href="https://psychcentral.com/news/2013/10/12/your-brain-first-notices-race-gender-before-all-else/60650.html" target="_blank">this article</a>
and this harvard study says </p>
<blockquote>
<p>When you meet someone new, the first thing your brain does is take note of two characteristics: race and gender.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but it goes on to say</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s important to note that previous research suggests the FFA does not endow visual stimuli with meaning, so it probably does not know anything about sex and race. It’s simply a brain region in the visual system that sees faces as belonging to two different sets</p>
</blockquote>
<p>so it seems as though it is one of the very first things that our brains pick up on, but it doesn't really have any meaning other than differentiating between them. Other parts of the brain would then assign meaning to what you perceive as male/female.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are animals that recognize genders. They have specific warning calls for each gender that are meant to warn their group about the dangers human males can cause. If that hardwired into them? At least if primitive species can easily differentiate between human genders it probably means that they have some brain mechanisms to easily understand human genders. That brain mechanism is then very primitive. So we probably don't need a high IQ to differentiate between genders. If it's not automatic from birth it is automated to become a reflex. But I would assume that some things like gender specific clothes are somewhat softwired but things such as breasts and high vs. deep voices are in a higher degree hardwired. But it's probably brain modules evolved to recognize genders but also evolved to adapt to their environment.</p>
<p>Here is one example of monkeys differentiating between genders:

<p>Elephants are just one of many species that recognize human genders:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't have the answer directly for you, and I'm sure someone else could do a better job of answering this, but I have something that points us in the right direction.  Per a study published in 2004, by Cellerino, Borghetti and Sartucci it was determined using various resolutions of pictures that facial recognition methods held by people to resolve gender use different cognitive processes.  </p>
<p>The study broke pictures down with reduced resolution and had test subjects select male or female.  It was determined at a level of certainty above pure chance, that a male face can be identified at a level of resolution that is far less detailed than a female face.  This is possible because the process involved in determining male faces with certainty at above chance is done differently than resolving if a face is female with certainty.  Additionally, the study found that generally females perform better at facial recognition than males.</p>
<p>Does this mean the human brain has &quot;areas&quot; dedicated to recognizing gender? I don't know if you can draw that conclusion specifically, but it does assert that the process to determine a male face versus determination of a female face is handled differently in the brain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
