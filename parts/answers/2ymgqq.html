		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With the Yakuza it's multiple factors.</p>
<p>1) There are no direct evidence against the higher up bosses with hard crimes they're suspected of. Even if they find some, usually the underlings will proudly and gladly take the fall for the higher ups (especially since if they do they and their family are taken care of generously).</p>
<p>2) Yakuzas make enough money and networking through legitimate and illegitimate businesses that it's harder for the law enforcement to track them and to sort through the corruptions. I say this over and over that it makes a statement when a Yakuza boss dies and you see more than a handful of celebrities, business moguls, and politicians coming to pay their respects.</p>
<p>3) Police have been cracking down hard on the Yakuza which have pushed them further into the shadows. But Yakuza in general (outside of Kitakyushu) have become &quot;docile&quot; in the sense that they'll not do illegal acts publicly and they'll not commit violent crimes. Most of their known crimes these days are gambling, sex trade (EDIT: &amp; SEX INDUSTRY sorry for the confusion folks), and drugs. Police can't afford to care too much about the gambling and the sex trade (&amp; sex industry) as long as Yakuzas are respectfully quiet about it (human trafficking is a great concern but dealing with that is a whole another level of difficulty for law enforcement). </p>
<p>(To go on further about this as it's causing a very well deserved confusion due to my lack of better wording and such. Gambling and Sex Industry and even Drugs can be done extremely discreetly. Gambling is usually done in hidden casinos and sex industry thrives behind &quot;legal&quot; fronts. Gambling and sexy industry are also regarded more or less as a lesser sin than drugs which carries on a much bigger taboo. Drugs can also get in the wrong hands and not too difficult to find peddled in the streets, clubs, and etc which is easier for the law enforcement to follow. <strong>Human trafficking and child prostitution is another level of the sex industry that is of great concern and also much harder task for the law enforcement to deal with but they do deal with them severely and to the best of their abilities</strong> but on the same token the Yakuza also do their best to keep these hidden and their to make their hands seem clean as they carry grave punishment)</p>
<p>4) That last part leads to the uneasy truce we see with so many organized crime families and law enforcement around the world. Long as one side don't cause too much of a fuss, neither will the other side. It's non-beneficial for anyone for the two to go to war. It's costly economically on both sides. </p>
<p>5) With all that said, I'm going to say it again: <strong>this does NOT apply to the Yakuza at Kitakyushu</strong>. They are looked down upon these days by many of the other families for being blatantly violent and aggressive. These guys will stab you for speaking poorly about the Yakuza. Hell, these guys might stab you just for looking at them wrong down the streets in Kokura. Stay the fuck away from the Yakuza at Kitakyushu. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The difference from knowledge and legally actionable knowledge. One you know they are a gangster, the other is can you prove it in court. He wears the tattoos and hangs with &quot;known&quot; gangsters - this indicates he is a gangster. The other is can you gather unintimidated witnesses to criminal activity,can you prove place who, what, where, and why, and finally is your police force non-corrupt.      <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=japanese+police+corrupt&qs=n&form=QBLH&pq=japanese+police+corrupt&sc=1-19&sp=-1&sk" target="_blank">http://www.bing.com/search?q=japanese+police+corrupt&qs=n&form=QBLH&pq=japanese+police+corrupt&sc=1-19&sp=-1&sk</a>=</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Japan specifically, there's kind of an informal arrangement between the government and the Yakuza. As long as they restrict themselves to certain areas, and don't cause <em>too</em> much trouble, the police turn a blind eye to some of their dealings. I think the reasoning goes that crime is inevitable, so it might as well be organized so that it doesn't get out of hand. To their credit it seems to work for them.</p>
<p>EDIT: Discworld, I get it. It's a cute coincidence.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Part of it is that some of the major gangs maintain good public images, so the pressure to prosecute is fairly low. Like, the Yakuza actually did a good deal of work with the Tsunami that hit a few years ago, and the nuclear plant cleanup.</p>
<p>Also, there's the issue of actually pinning anything on any specific person, building a solid case against them, and being able to convict. This is hard with how tight-lipped people in the organizations are. Like, you know, how they couldn't find enough evidence of Al Capone's mob activity, so they had to jail him for tax evasion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>simple. </p>
<p>The yakuza arer not a crime syndicate, they are a part of japanese tradition. </p>
<p>Let me explain that. </p>
<p>When you hear, crime syndicate, you automatically think, los zetas. People getting hands cut off, fighting gladiatorial style to the death, massive drugs gangs, and such. </p>
<p>Because the Yakuza have existed for so long, it's kind of an informal agreement. If you want the protection money, you do not fleece the locals too much. If you want the protection money to grow, you ask the locals, where does the shoe hurt? What is bothering you? and you help out. </p>
<p>Something as simple as a rape by a soldier of the yakuza can be answered by him loosing a hand. NOT because law demands it, but because he has dishonored the yakuza. If he wants to remain a yakuza, he has to give,m first fingers,m then the hand, to </p>
<p>The rules for the rank and file are pretty much the same, all centered around, don't embarass, untill you are in the respective areas for this. </p>
<p>Don't embarass the police, untill they give you a reason to embarass them. </p>
<p>Don't embarass the local politiians, untill you want them to move against you. </p>
<p>And most importantly of all, don't embarass the yakuza. Never ever. </p>
<p>In the purest sense of the word, the yakuza, for example, have a better way with peiople. They fill the house MD role: a third party everybody loves to hate, but you call when shit needs getting done. They can cut through all of the red tape, because this is what they do. </p>
<p>There are , depending on the region, certain gumi that have differing opinions. One does not allow his members to sell drugs, because they feel it violates the buddist commandments, one does not deal in women, but has nothing against prostitution, and so on. </p>
<p>There is a secondary theory as to why crime syndicates are allowed to exist, and surprise, it has to do with the police. </p>
<p>There is an estimate that 50 % of the worst excesses of the cartells, mafia, triads and so on are comitted by embedded informants. People that the government has sponsored with substantial siums to provide them insight into the criminal empire of X, but who turned around and said, boys, supersize your meals, we are now getting government paychecks. </p>
<p>Because the standartised deals is freedom from punishment, and prosecution, or aything like that, so the criminals usually use this as a way to comitt murder, extortion, and so forthj, as much as possible, for them, because they know the government can't charge them with shit. </p>
<p>In my honest opinion, it's a little bit from column a, an a little bit from column B. because, honestly, at least the yakuza punish their own when they fuck up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
