		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short term memories are formed by transient synaptic plasticities and Long term memories are formed from these short term ones by Long Term Potentiation (its the most well accepted neural correlate for memory formation as of now). The short term memories are formed in the hippocampus which is very robust starting early age but the frontal cortex (also called as the neocortex where most of the long term memories are thought to be stored) develops even until the mid-20s in humans. From this perspective, infants may not consciously remember anything as the short term memories cannot easily get translated to the long term memories and get stored in the brain (we donâ€™t truly know the chemical/physical nature of memory yet).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Beyond the biochemical aspects, <em>what</em> exactly would you remember?  When you think about a memory, you mostly just describe it in terms of other, firmer concepts.  Car, ground, tree, red, friend, cold, etc.  A picture's comprised of a thousand words.  But as a baby, you don't have any of that.  The world is an incoherent jumble of sensation that takes <em>years</em> to learn to make any sense of.  Consider blind people who gain sight for the first time as adults; they have the damnedest time learning to comprehend what they are looking at.  To turn the photons hitting their retinas into &quot;Oh, that's my friend Bob, about 15 feet away, looking directly at me, wearing a white shirt and jeans&quot;.</p>
<p>To remember your infancy would be like trying to remember a conversation other people are having in a language that is totally alien to anything you know.  It's just a string of random noises to you, a solid wall of incomprehensibility with no chinks there for your mind to get a firm grip on.  It's not until you can map sounds to concepts you already know that you start to actually remember them in earnest.</p>
<p>Honestly, I've always been <em>amazed</em> at just how much infants have to learn, and how quickly they do it.  Not just learning a language or two from scratch and the aforementioned sensory processing, but also motor control, distinguishing between living and nonliving things (&quot;the quick and the dead&quot;), socialization, you name it.  That's an <em>awful</em> lot to have to pick up, and they get a huge chunk of it by age 3 or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I like the proximate explanation given by /u/vingeran.</p>
<p>I'm also fond of ultimate explanations so I offer: the infant brain is terrible at making sense of its inputs because all of it is a confusing, uncorrelated mess. They are learning how to interpret the grand sensorium provided to them. Every input is novel and bears little relation to others.</p>
<p>Remembering a sensorial, interpretive mess provides no utility. A melange of un-compartmentalized sense inputs will do you no good in the future, so there is no mechanism to remember them by.</p>
<p>This is not to say that infants don't lay down diffuse, affective memories (this is good, this hurt) because I think they do, but they appear to be light on specifics because they have a hard time distinguishing specifics so early.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maybe the most intuitive explanation for infantile amnesia is that memories are physically stored in neurons and synapses, and those structures change during postnatal development. Specifically, it has been hypothesized that neurogenesis (the creation of new neurons) in the hippocampus causes cells to reorganize and thus break and replace synapses (the connections between neurons). (<a href="http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/19/9/423.short" target="_blank">http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/19/9/423.short</a>)</p>
<p>This hypothesis explains why infantile amnesia seems to happen in animals and why young children appear to form long-term memories, even though they can't recall them later. (<a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096585710235" target="_blank">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096585710235</a>) However, it does not explain how we can be influenced by events that take place during the time of infantile amnesia. For example, we begin learning to walk and talk during this time and we don't lose these abilities at the same time that we forget episodic memories. </p>
<p>Another hypothesis, supported by data from cognitive and neurological studies, proposes that the memories usually remain in storage in the brain, but cannot be accessed in the same way as later memories. (<a href="http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/21/3/135.short" target="_blank">http://learnmem.cshlp.org/content/21/3/135.short</a>) The common analogy for this is that children first store memories on VHS, but then switch to DVD around 3 years. The VHS's are still there, but they no longer have the VCR to play them. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, that still doesn't really explain why this happens. The truth is that we still have more questions than answers when it comes to memory, and infantile amnesia remains an area of active research. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
