		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a much-debated question in physics, and unlike what people here are saying, it's not due to pressure or friction melting the ice. The pressure of a human being is not enough to meaningfully alter the melting point of the ice below.</p>
<p>Instead, I believe that the current mainstream theory is that the ice molecules in the topmost layer of the crystal lattice act like liquids. They are not locked in place from all sides, so they have some freedom of movement which gives ice its slippery characteristics.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not a physicist but i don't think ice is slippery, when it's frozen on a very low temperature and you touch it your hand will get stuck not slip. The reason it slips when not on a very low temperature is that because the surface turns to water which makes the contact between the ice and other objects slippery.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
