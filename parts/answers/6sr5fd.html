It's the same with driving, your sight is over stimulated so you want music and snacks as you drive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think it's kind of simple. While eating, you can't use your hands or mouth. Can't think of any activity you can do without at least one of those, other than sitting there watching something.</p>
<p>Inversely, when watching a show, you can't really use your eyes or ears for something else, but you can use your mouth and hands. So you could either suck a dick or eat some food and I know which one I would choose every time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well eating without doing anything else can be quite boring (perhaps because we have developed a need for constant entertainment) so it is more satisfying to be watching TV/movies while eating.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
