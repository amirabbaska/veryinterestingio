		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At the time of the Eighteenth Amendment, Congress understood that the Interstate Commerce clause did not permit Congress to regulate commerce occuring within a single state. Hence, an amendment to the Constitution was required to abolish it.</p>
<p>Later, with Wickard v. Filburn along with other cases, the Supreme Court effectively wrote the &quot;interstate&quot; part of the clause out, arguing instead that Congress could regulate activity which merely <em>affected</em> interstate commerce.</p>
<p>As a result, marijuana regulation and other regulations are now allowed by courts, even if they only impact activity within a single state.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh boy! I just took a 4 hour final on this exact question. Most comments at the top do a pretty good job explaining the modern approach to Commerce Clause regulation. But if you want to know why alcohol required an amendment then but not now you have to look at the evolution of CC regulation:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>In the beginning there was Gibbons v. Ogden in which SCOTUS held that the commerce clause granted broad authority to Congress to regulate commercial activities beyond just traffic between the states. And the doors were opened...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then came what  a lot of people call &quot;the bad old days&quot; or the Lochner era. From about 1890-1937, SCOTUS was very hesitant to let Congress regulate anything. They created all these wacky standards that really had nothing to do with the Commerce Clause or the Constitution. One example is the EC Knight case, where Congress tried to prevent the Sugar industry from monopolizing/consolidating. SCOTUS said that the manufacture of sugar was only &quot;indirectly&quot; related to interstate commerce. Thus was born the &quot;direct/indirect&quot; test which the court relied on in one form or another until the New Deal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then came NLRB v. Jones. Congress was trying to regulate labor management disputes and stop discrimination against unionized workers as part of New Deal regulation. Congress argued that labor disputes had a &quot;substantial effect&quot; on interstate commerce and therefore could be regulated. In light of the modernizing economy and public support for the New Deal, SCOTUS agreed and ushered in a new era of commerce regulation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then came Wickard v. Filburn, the case everyone here is talking about which established the &quot;aggregation principle&quot;. As others have noted, this principle basically states that an individual's personal consumption when added to many others doing the same thing, had a substantial impact on ISC, and could be regulated. The Raich case later clarified that only &quot;economic activities&quot; could be aggregated this way, and the regulation in question therefore had to have something to do with consumption, production, or distribution of some commodity. </p>
</li>
<li>The modern approach comes from US v. Lopez. In that case, SCOTUS defined 3 distinct categories under which Congress can regulate ISC. The first are the &quot;channels&quot; of ISC, or things that involve highways, waterways, etc. The second are the &quot;instrumentalities&quot; of ISC, or the individual items/commodities being transported across state lines. The third and final category involves &quot;economic activities substantially related&quot; to ISC. And this is where Weed comes in...</li>
</ol>
<p>If we apply the aforementioned principles we come up with this rule that Congress can regulate something if it's an &quot;economic activity, substantially related to interstate commerce.&quot; Applying Wickard we can further say that individual economic activities can be aggregated in order to argue that they have a substantial effect. In Raich, the court used these concepts to hold that an individual's home consumption of weed, even if used privately for medical purposes, in aggregate would have a substantial effect on weed distribution among all the states - therefore Congress was able to regulate such consumption under the Controlled Substances Act. </p>
<p>As an example of something that would not be allowed- In the Morrison case the Constitutionality of one provision of the Violence Against Women Act was challenged. The Court held that domestic violence had nothing to do with &quot;economic activity&quot; or any of the 3 categories listed above.</p>
<p>This &quot;modern approach&quot; was also used in the Obamacare cases - but ultimately SCOTUS found that Congress did not have the power to regulate healthcare under the Commerce Clause (they could under the Tax and Spend clause). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They made an end run around the law.  Instead of prohibiting marijuana outright (because no one was sure that would be legal) they simply imposed a tax that required a permit which, in turn, was unavailable.   The American people made no fuss about that so... stricter and stricter laws were imposed without worrying that anyone would challenge the original basis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
