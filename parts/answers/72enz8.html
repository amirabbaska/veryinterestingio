		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>its two-fold. you have the boxer do some sort of exercise that heavily targets the abdominals such as squats or hanging leg raises, then you hit them in the abs by either punching them or throwing a medicine ball at them while they are resting. this gets the person used to being hit in the stomach, and it forces them to keep their abs tight during these exercises so that they get more out of it. for instance you can squat without a braced core and your abdominal's don't get worked very much, but throw a twenty pound medicine ball at them and your core suddenly becomes very very braced (;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not a physical trainer or anything but I used to box. The ball hits you usually right below the sternum where it's easiest to knock the wind out of you. The training did several things for me...it helped my brain know when I needed to flex to not have the wind knocked out of me. You can't just sit there with your abs flexed that hard the whole time so you develop almost like a sneeze reflex where your muscles intensely tighten for one instant and you need to get the timing right for it to be effective. That intense flexing will also build muscle. And your body learns exactly which muscles to flex and how to coordinate that with your breathing (i find i also stop breathing and put pressure in my lungs a bit when it hits me). You also just get used to the very unpleasant sensation of getting rocked in the abdomen over and over..which is good at lowering your overall level of bitchiness. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You do similar stuff in the military, for combatives, body hardening they call it, and there are certain moves you just perform back and forth, over sensitive area or nerves to get used to being struck.  </p>
<p>Dunno if army does it, doubt the airforce or navy does, the Corps does this tho.  </p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, most MCMAP is crap, and it's junk before like green belt, but the body hardening aspect was kind of cool, and it certainly works.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
