		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just doing an order of magnitude calculation here: if a neutron star 1.4 times the mass of the sun is 10 km in radius and spinning 716 times per second, the gravitational field is 1.8 trillion m/s/s whereas the centrifugal force is about 10% that, at 200 billion m/s/s. This is an approximation of course.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would like to trail off of this question with another; me and my boss had a disagreement when I told him about pulsars.</p>
<p>He was saying he doesn't believe that the entire star is rotating around an axis. He told me that the definition of 'spinning/rotating' should be defined better after I told him about the extreme circumstances of its gravity and its density. He believes to be more of an energy wave traversing around the star, like a wave on the surface of water, that is emitting radio pulses, meaning the entity isn't rotating around itself but gives the appearance of such.</p>
<p>Can anybody help me with this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This breaks the rule for normal-size, normal-density spinning disks given in XKCD no-rules NASCAR for the maximum speed of a spinning disk  to hold together:</p>
<p><a href="https://what-if.xkcd.com/116/" target="_blank">https://what-if.xkcd.com/116/</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This lets us apply one of my favorite weird equations,[4] which says that the edge of a spinning disc can't go faster than the square root of the specific strength[5] of the material it's made of. For strong materials like Kevlar, this speed is 1-2 km/s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This means that if your neutron star was made of solid Kevlar, it would fling itself apart. It's just density and gravity that holds it together!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: Disclaimer: The following comment applies to a stationary inertial frame of reference, not a rotating inertial  frame of reference, as people with a better understanding of the matter have kindly explained below.</p>
<p>I just have to point out here that there really is no such thing as &quot;centrifugal force&quot;, that is &quot;created by spinning&quot;. Here's some basics of circular motion. Imagine a satellite orbiting the neutron star on a circular orbit. The satellite is moving at a constant speed at a constant distance from the star, so each orbit takes the same amount of time.</p>
<p>As Newton's laws tell us, if the sum of the forces affecting the satellite is zero, the satellite will keep on moving in a straight line (or stay still if it wasn't moving in the first place). However, since we know that the satellite is not moving in a straight line, but orbiting a star on a circular orbit, we know that the sum of the forces on the satellite is not zero.</p>
<p>In order to stay in circular motion, the satellite needs to have a constant centripetal force (towards the center of the orbit, perpendicular to the direction of travel on the orbit) to keep the satellite in orbit. A centrifugal force would be pushing the satellite away from the star (and does not exist), whereas a centripetal force is pulling the satellite in and keeping it in orbit. The so called centrifugal force is an illusion caused by Newton's first law (Roughly &quot;A body in motion wants to stay in motion&quot;), and does not actually exist, but people still talk about it from time to time.</p>
<p>In the case of a satellite orbiting a star, we can pretty safely say that the only significant force on the satellite is the star's gravity. In this case, it is the star's gravity that keeps the satellite in orbit, and thus we say that the gravitational force is the centripetal force of the circular motion.</p>
<p>The centripetal force for a constant circular motion is F=(mv^2)/r, where m is the mass of the orbiter, v is the velocity at which the orbiter is travelling along the orbit and r is the radius of the orbit. Here we see, that if you want to orbit faster, either the centripetal force or the radius of the orbit has to grow. This can also be applied to driving a car around a bend, if the bend is turning with a somewhat constant radius from a point (meaning the turn looks like a part of a circle). If you want to drive faster through the bend, then the frictional force on your tires has to grow in order to keep you on the circular track through the bend. If the friction of your tires is not enough, then the radius grows, meaning you won't be able to turn sharp enough and you will slide out of the bend.</p>
<p>With all this in mind, your question would probably be better asked along the lines of &quot;Since the neutron star is spinning so rapidly, is the gravitation force on the surface of the star enough to keep an object on the surface, or will the object be flung into space instead?&quot;</p>
<p>TL;DR: &quot;Centrifugal force&quot; is just an illusion caused by Newton's first law. The star's gravity works as a centripetal force to keep an object on the surface of the star or orbiting it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Does...oh man. This seems like a silly question all of a sudden. Does the Sun spin?   I guess I have been under the impression that the stars remain motionless, and now I realize how impossible that is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
