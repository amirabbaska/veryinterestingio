		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>Disclaimer:</em> I'm far from an expert on complexity theory, but I can give you some idea of the magnitude of the effects we're talking about.</p>
<hr />
<p>Let's ignore recent developments for a bit, and discuss the hypothetical question.</p>
<p>Knowing BB(10000) means you are in possession of an algorithm which gives you, simultaneously,</p>
<ul>
<li>the computable enumeration of the halting Turing Machines with (less than) 10.000 states,</li>
<li>the computable enumeration of the <em>provably</em> non-halting Turing Machines with (less than) 10.000 states,</li>
</ul>
<p>on a blank tape.</p>
<p>The trivial corollary is that if you have an arbitrary TM that describes a certain system and has less than 10.000 states, you can look it up in this enumeration and proclaim (as loudly as you want) whether it halts or not. Since we can restate many problems in CS in terms of the question whether a TM halts or not, this is a very useful result. You could use it to trivially verify many a piece of software, by looking them up in that enumeration.</p>
<p>While this can certainly have value, it doesn't seem as useful as Eliezer claims. It's certainly painstakingly difficult to construct TMs for simple problems spanning more than a couple tens of states. Is it hyperbole?</p>
<hr />
<p>Not so fast (no pun intended). Let's take into account actual historical developments again.</p>
<p>The Busy Beaver functions result in some absurdly Big numbers. We know exactly only up to BB(4)=107 (Brady 1975), and we have some <em>lower</em> bounds on BB(5) ≥ 47.176.870 (Marxen and Buntrock 1990), BB(6) ≥ 7,4 × 10^(36.534) (Kropitz 2010), BB(23) &gt; Graham’s number (“Deedlit” and “Wythagoras” 2013).</p>
<p>In April 2016, Adam Yedidia and Scott Aaronson described a TM with N = 7918. They noted that enumerating the theorems of ZFC would need a big number of states. They used a graph theoretic statement proved by Harvey Friedman to be equivalent to the consistency of a theory that implies the consistency of ZFC. By defining a new high-level language that is easily compiled down to Turing machine description, they built a machine that would halt, <em>if it found a counterexample to Friedman’s statement</em>. Therefore this TM's behaviour (when run on a blank tape) can never be proven from the usual axioms of set theory, under reasonable consistency hypotheses. See <a href="https://www.scottaaronson.com/busybeaver.pdf" target="_blank">Yedidia and Aaronson (2016)</a>.</p>
<p>So <em>if</em> you had a memory card with a number for BB(10000) in it, you could waltz into the offices of the IMU, declare set theory (and Mathematics) as we know it null and void, and request a Fields Medal and whatever monetary award you saw fit. Possibly all other sorts of ridiculous things. Fortunately, nobody'll ever have it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
