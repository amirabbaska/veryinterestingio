		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Wages have been stagnant and even dropping relative to inflation for quite a long time now, and the requirements to get said jobs have generally gone up. At the same time, the cost of education has skyrocketed something like 1000% relative to inflation. So where a bachelor's degree might have costed you a few thousand in today's dollars back in the 60s and nearly guaranteed you a decent job, today it costs $50-60k and doesn't at all guarantee work.</p>
<p>EDIT: Dear everyone replying with 100% confidence that their particular economic beliefs are correct: it's a controversial issue and I very consciously left it at that. I am not an economist and neither are any of you.</p>
<p>EDIT2: Oh god what have i done</p>

<p>EDIT4: Prior to this comment, I had averaged 121.52 karma per day. This comment has accrued 2706 in five and a half hours. That's an acceleration of 94.3 times my normal rate of karma generation. To achieve a subjective rate of karma generation that accelerated due to relativistic effects, I'd have to travel at .999943c.</p>
<p>EDIT5: My top-rated comment ever! I'd like to thank <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_Academy" target="_blank">the Academy</a> and all the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Charlie_and_the_Chocolate_Factory_characters#Oompa-Loompas" target="_blank">little people</a> who made this possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you look at <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-503-x/2010001/article/11388/tbl/tbl002-eng.htm" target="_blank">income by age</a> there isn't too big of a difference in what Millennials are earning in regards to other cohorts.  At 25-34 all people are expected to double their yearly income (that's the millennials) and then the next generation after (Generation-X) has $20k for the next age group with the Baby Boomers on average making $10k less than Gen-X but $10k more Millenials.</p>
<p>So why is home ownership and car ownership so out of the question?</p>
<p>The problem isn't the ability, the problem is the way.  In 1950 there was no such thing as the Internet, there was no such thing as a cell phone.  My cell phone and Internet bill amount to roughly $2000 a year.  After 10 years that's $20,000.... or you know... a car.</p>
<p>For previous generations owning a house and a car were huge priorities.  They were willing to go without in order to have those things.  Everyone hears stories about their parents having to can, and jar, and nickle and dime.  And then when said parents had a car and a house they began to furnish it, improve it, and collect things.</p>
<p>And that's the story of the successful baby boomers.  Your unsuccessful baby boomers, which represented about 30% of the population rented all of their lives, bought cars second and third hand, and having nothing set aside for retirement, so they can't retire.  Instead baby boomers are taking pay cuts so that their employers don't get rid of them.  Baby boomers are willing to work for as much as a Millennial now because they need money to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>Among the boomers 30% would owner a car before age 30.  Among the millenials 20% would own a car before age 30.  That isn't as dramatic as people make it seem.</p>
<p>Housing is a problem of perception.  When you look at the Boomers in regards to other generations they're certainly distinct.  <a href="http://www.doctorhousingbubble.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Homeownership-Rate-Age2012-11.jpg" target="_blank">Statistically</a> no one is like them.  Roughly 70% of baby boomers are home owners by the end of <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0019m/2010325/ct002-eng.htm" target="_blank">their life</a>.  However they mostly bought their homes when they were in their 40s.</p>
<p>However notice <a href="http://www.doctorhousingbubble.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Homeownership-Rate-Age2012-11.jpg" target="_blank">this chart</a>.  Millenial home ownership DOUBLES every five years of the generation.  At the high end of the generation (35) you have 50% of the population being home owners.</p>
<p>Home ownership is related largely to cost.  Buying a new home is more expensive now than before because what needs to go into it is more expensive.  In the baby boomer age you could buy a run down house and call it home for pretty cheap.  Today it wouldn't pass city inspections and would be destroyed.</p>
<p>A perfect example is Detroit.  The city shrank by 80% shutting down services to 80% of the building's in the city.  A crafty go getter could just buy one of these and call it their home, maybe build their own well or get water some other way (like a water tank).  But, the sale of these homes is illegal because they are in bad repair and have no service access.</p>
<p>If home ownership wasn't down across all generational lines you'd say there was a problem with the generation, but it's a problem with the housing market itself.</p>
<p>Millennials are on average wealthier than their parents were when they started (adjusted for inflation) but on average have more debt.  The appearance of being poorer is related to the rampant consumerism.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not just millennium kids,  but all of us since GenX. The post war baby boomers benefited from the war dividend and the growth of the US.  Of course,  the US made much from &quot;robbing&quot; from the old world,  especially the UK.  Anyway, now the baby boomers are at the end of their lives and they are investing their wealth into to medical,  etc.  This will continue to impoverish the rest of us.  </p>
<p>Of course,  at some point the wealth of the baby boomers will get back,  but not to my generation.  I think you millennium kids stand a good chance of getting wealthy when you are in your 40s from inheritances.  </p>
<p>Also, globalisation (the spread of money from the few to the many) increased tax and increase profits of the 0.01% take their toll.  If you take the generation stuff out (which is just speculation by me) then globalisation is a big driver to reduced cash in the developed world.  </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The question is whether the millennials are poorer or whether they are just living within their means moreso than previous generations. </p>
<p>In the constantly evolving story of the sharing economy, you really have to sit down and question the benefits of owning a house or car. My mindset when it comes to riding transportation or renting an apartment is different than people viewed it 20 years ago. I wouldn't structure it 100% as a 'poorer' generation, but more like a generation that has reprioritized where it spends its money/goes into debt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
