		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Wages have been stagnant and even dropping relative to inflation for quite a long time now, and the requirements to get said jobs have generally gone up. At the same time, the cost of education has skyrocketed something like 1000% relative to inflation. So where a bachelor's degree might have costed you a few thousand in today's dollars back in the 60s and nearly guaranteed you a decent job, today it costs $50-60k and doesn't at all guarantee work.<br><br>EDIT: Dear everyone replying with 100% confidence that their particular economic beliefs are correct: it's a controversial issue and I very consciously left it at that.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>If you look at <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-503-x/2010001/article/11388/tbl/tbl002-eng.htm" target="_blank">income by age</a> there isn't too big of a difference in what Millennials are earning in regards to other cohorts.  At 25-34 all people are expected to double their yearly income (that's the millennials) and then the next generation after (Generation-X) has $20k for the next age group with the Baby Boomers on average making $10k less than Gen-X but $10k more Millenials.<br><br>So why is home ownership and car ownership so out of the question?<br><br>The problem isn't the ability, the problem is the way.  In 1950 there was no such thing as the Internet, there was no such thing as a cell phone.  My cell phone and Internet bill amount to roughly $2000 a year.  After 10 years that's $20,000.... or you know... a car.<br><br>For previous generations owning a house and a car were huge priorities.  They were willing to go without in order to have those things.  Everyone hears stories about their parents having to can, and jar, and nickle and dime.  And then when said parents had a car and a house they began to furnish it, improve it, and collect things.<br><br>And that's the story of the successful baby boomers.  Your unsuccessful baby boomers, which represented about 30% of the population rented all of their lives, bought cars second and third hand, and having nothing set aside for retirement, so they can't retire.  Instead baby boomers are taking pay cuts so that their employers don't get rid of them.  Baby boomers are willing to work for as much as a Millennial now because they need money to survive and thrive.<br><br>Among the boomers 30% would owner a car before age 30.  Among the millenials 20% would own a car before age 30.  That isn't as dramatic as people make it seem.<br><br>Housing is a problem of perception.  When you look at the Boomers in regards to other generations they're certainly distinct.  <a href="http://www.doctorhousingbubble.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Homeownership-Rate-Age2012-11.jpg" target="_blank">Statistically</a> no one is like them.  Roughly 70% of baby boomers are home owners by the end of <a href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11f0019m/2010325/ct002-eng.htm" target="_blank">their life</a>.  However they mostly bought their homes when they were in their 40s.<br><br>However notice <a href="http://www.doctorhousingbubble.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Homeownership-Rate-Age2012-11.jpg" target="_blank">this chart</a>.  Millenial home ownership DOUBLES every five years of the generation.  At the high end of the generation (35) you have 50% of the population being home owners.<br><br>Home ownership is related largely to cost.  Buying a new home is more expensive now than before because what needs to go into it is more expensive.  In the baby boomer age you could buy a run down house and call it home for pretty cheap.  Today it wouldn't pass city inspections and would be destroyed.<br><br>A perfect example is Detroit.  The city shrank by 80% shutting down services to 80% of the building's in the city.  A crafty go getter could just buy one of these and call it their home, maybe build their own well or get water some other way (like a water tank).  But, the sale of these homes is illegal because they are in bad repair and have no service access.<br><br>If home ownership wasn't down across all generational lines you'd say there was a problem with the generation, but it's a problem with the housing market itself.<br><br>Millennials are on average wealthier than their parents were when they started (adjusted for inflation) but on average have more debt.  The appearance of being poorer is related to the rampant consumerism.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Not just millennium kids,  but all of us since GenX. The post war baby boomers benefited from the war dividend and the growth of the US.  Of course,  the US made much from &quot;robbing&quot; from the old world,  especially the UK.  Anyway, now the baby boomers are at the end of their lives and they are investing their wealth into to medical,  etc.  This will continue to impoverish the rest of us.  <br><br>Of course,  at some point the wealth of the baby boomers will get back,  but not to my generation.  I think you millennium kids stand a good chance of getting wealthy when you are in your 40s from inheritances.  <br><br>Also, globalisation (the spread of money from the few to the many) increased tax and increase profits of the 0.01% take their toll.  If you take the generation stuff out (which is just speculation by me) then globalisation is a big driver to reduced cash in the developed world.  <br><br>Rambling enough? </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>This seems to happen in power distribution economics. I'm way too late to this, but I've spent a lot of time on this one - not to say I have the answers. There are a lot of things that contribute to our generation being worse off than our parents'. <br><br>First - let me take back what I just said for a moment - this is a very Euro and American centric question to be asking. During our grandparent's generation, Europe and America were the leaders by leaps and bounds. Even though Russia was given to be a leader, it wasn't even close. Over the last few decades (and couple of decades in particular), for various reasons, our &quot;world economy&quot; has become much more of a global economy than it ever was. Without attempting to view a scenario that is strictly zero-sum, but somewhat limited in total gains, we send jobs over seas, we send productivity overseas etc. because it's cheaper. So &quot;new wealth&quot; is somewhat more rare than it was for our parents, the children of our grandparents. <br><br>Another reason is the odd maneuvering of corporate leadership. Believe me I am 100% on board with capitalism, maybe in a different sense than we have it today, but it's hard for anybody to say that it doesn't have some very weird consequences. In our grandparents' and parent's generations, CEO to low worker pay ratio was in the 3-10 times range. Now you would be surprised to see anything remotely like that. Profits seem to be the goal now, and the mainstream belief is that this can be had by increasing technological efficiency, cutting staff and staff pay when possible, and hiring the best possible leaders. The &quot;oddness&quot; I mentioned comes in when you start thinking about hiring the best possible leaders. Today's CEOs, at least in the US and Europe are more like rock stars or pro athletes than leaders of business. CEO, and other top executive pay has absolutely skyrocketed over inflation in the past, as competing companies strive to beat out competition in pay for leadership. The new leadership then comes in and cuts pay and benefits for the workers - who actually do all the work to begin with. It's a totally fascinating paradigm.<br><br>Then you have the school thing - which nearly everyone in our generation is bitter about. I have mixed feelings on the subject and have nothing empirical or fact-based to say, but because I'm just now entering the convo and nobody is likely to read this I'll say it anyway. Our generation was flat-out lied to. Education, for the sake of education, seems a dumber choice now than lack of education. I remember hearing my parents and many other kid's parents say the exact phrase, &quot;It doesn't matter what you get a degree in, as long as you get a degree.&quot; Bull shit. I did Math and Econ, worked fewer hours in college than my ex at the time who did Art and English. Guess who's making 300K a year? Not her. Guess who got a better GPA and spent far more time on credit and in the library? Not me. I can't tell you how many Humanities-types from my year were baristas for multiple years before finally finding a steady job. It's a racket. And I hope this MOOC thing or some kind of online thing completely blows the whole thing up. Not to mention many professions don't need the education we force on them to begin with. But that is a really really big conversation that I won't jump in to. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>In the UK, it didn't help when the Conservative government sold off all of the Council owned properties, in the early 90's, to residents as a way of appeasing lower classes prior to the election. This was all done upon the promise that the money would be re-invested in more social housing, which never happened. It allowed even those with nominal incomes (from that generation) to buy houses, sell them on 5 years later at ridiculously inflated prices, which all added to the housing price boom.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Let me preface this by saying I am not some kind of pinko, left-wing, flag-burning hippy. I am a free-trade, open-borders,  let's-create-a-powerhouse-economy type of guy who's actually still registered as a Republican. <br><br>Globalization has caused a huge drain of manufacturing and what I will call &quot;easily accessible&quot; middle-class jobs. My wife's dad, who's only 20-ish years older than I am, has been working at a paper mill for 25 years and probably makes about 70k after all of his overtime and whatnot. It's just because he's been in a union manufacturing job a long time.<br><br>Those jobs aren't available for our generation. Getting a job like that at a factory 20, 30, and 40 years ago - one that pays a solid middle-class wage was akin to getting a retail job today. You have a pulse? Can you do this repetitive activity with minimal complaints? Great, welcome aboard. Jobs that have such small barriers to entry <em>and also</em> pay that highly sought-after &quot;living wage&quot; that you kids keep going on about are pretty much non-existent these days. A huge driver of that has been globalization, where large US companies have figurd out that for manufacturing jobs that paid an inflation-adjusted 70k 20-40 years ago, can be moved overseas and someone in Thialand can do the work for on the cheap.<br><br>This taken alone would not be a disaster. Cheaper labor ultimately drives prices down and makes the costs of things in the stores cheaper. But while all this has been happening, we have not stayed as competitive in the areas of technology, engineering, finance, etc., all those really competitive high-GDP sectors of the world today, as we once were. Other first-world nations are stepping up. Look at the auto industry. The US auto industry was once a world-leader, now FORD stands for &quot;fix or repair daily&quot;. Rich people would rather drive something European than something American any day. While we're still the world leader in the high-GDP sectors mentioned previously, we're as dominant of a world leader.<br><br>The result of all of the middle-class jobs going away is that everyone who used to be showing up at factories 20-40 years ago straight out of high school, who maybe was not all that academically inclined, is now showing up at a college campus because &quot;that's the only way to get a good job.&quot; And it's mostly true. Due to the vast majority of easily accessible middle-class jobs going away, you pretty much have to go to college to have a chance at being middle class.<br><br>The rest of the story is pretty much found throughout the rest of this thread. Demand for higher ed soared, education costs soared, people who did make it to middle class jobs after getting their degree were crippled by student loans, some people became crippled with them without landing a middle class job, etc. I'm actually one of those &quot;middle class millennials,&quot; I'm 27 with an MBA (from an unranked school, so don't be impressed) and I make ~80k per year. Right now I'm going through the process of increasing the balance on my mortgage by $35,000 to pay off my fuckin' student loans, something that would be completely unheard of 20-40 years ago. That's more or less the &quot;handicap&quot; to being middle class today that didn't exist 30 years go. In my case it's, another 35k on my mortgage and 6 years off of the beginning of my career spent in school. When 30 years ago, I could have just walked down to the factory and made a similar paycheck to what I'm making today.<br><br>Things used to be &quot;Show up, be consistent, make mostly responsible choices, and you will do well in America.&quot; (You've probably heard something like this from your boomer parents). Now it's &quot;Bust your ass for four years in college, make <em>only</em> responsible choices (When you're young, and doing so is most difficult), and you might do well in America.&quot;<br><br>Hope that helps. <br><br>tl;dr: Globalization has taken away easily accessible middle-class jobs and we have not kept up with the rest of the world on the high end of things. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wolverinesfire" target="_blank">wolverinesfire</a>
		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There are many trends at play. <br><br>1) Globalization - Jobs moved to cheaper locations. This is occurring in many industries. If an american is paid 30 dollars an hour for a job, and someone in Asia can do it for 5 dollars a day, or even 5 dollars an hour, that and shipping will usually be cheaper. This includes telemarketers and industrial/factory jobs. <br><br>2) The internet allows for knowledge exchange and telecommunication improvements allow job offshoring. A computer programmer in India can do the same or similar job an american could for $15,000 vs $100,000. <br><br>3) Automation - more jobs have been replaced by equipment that is just faster and more efficient than people. Its a trend that will increase over time. This again hits factory jobs. There was a story online that talked about a company wanting to replace 'chinese/asian' labour with automation because its even cheaper than them. <br><br>Even higher skill level jobs previously safe are being affected. They have machines now that can scan thousands of documents and then a lawyer can search through key words to sort through those documents for trial cases. This eliminates the need for trained lawyers looking through thousands of boxes eliminating more jobs. <br><br>4) Shipping is relatively cheap. Even with oil prices that have been higher until recently, container shipping across the ocean is not that expensive, so if the price is lower including wages to ship it then that product can be built somewhere else.<br><br>5) Wages have been stagnating. In 2008 the financial crisis wiped out a lot of people's savings because the stock market crashed and people in panic pulled their money out. When people do that they lock in their losses, and do not receive the stock market increase when the market comes back. Having a lot of their savings damaged, people who were expecting to retire decided to stay in the job market. This increases the pressure from those top jobs and puts pressure on all the other levels of employments below them. Middle managers stay put, junior associates stay put, and new people have a much harder chance from moving up or even getting a chance to start. <br><br>Companies also downsized. By eliminating jobs, combing jobs, having splitting full time jobs into part time ones, or contract work. By reducing pension benefits or changing the formula's so people now get much less. <br><br>6) A lot of these factors are the reasons why companies have been earning record breaking incomes. This income has not trickled down or benefited their workers much. Less workers means more efficiency, but not necessarily better income for all. <br><br>Part of that is because so many people are out of work it depresses wages. If there are 2 applicants for jobs that a company needs done, then they will increase wages to attract that applicant or to draw more people to that industry to fill that job need. That's the reason why income for people working in the oilfield industry is so high. <br><br>7) When you have 100-1000 applicants for one job, it depresses wages. Wages may fall, wages may stay the same, but otherwise the credentials people need for that job may rise. <br>A job that previously needed highschool may need a college diploma. A job with a college diploma may now need a university degree and so on. <br>People with no experience now need to show experience to make it in. <br><br>Structurally there have been other changes. <br><br>1) Housing - Housing used to account for a lot of growth in the economy. The sub-prime mortgage melt down occurred because a lot of people who could not qualify for a mortgage were given mortgages without assets, or income that would qualify them for a traditional mortgage. Mortgages that were given were set at a given interest rate and with future increases in that rate built in. So, when you might pay $1000 for a mortgage per month, and 4 years later you pay $1500 or $2000 instead, you default. This occurred over and over again and destroyed the faith in the housing market. With so many houses empty or for sale, the prices crashed. This was another source of money for previous home owners that affected retirement savings.  <br><br>2) Student loans. Student loans have become excessive. The interest rates and sheer amount of student loans have increased with for profit colleges. People have been taught that a college degree equals a better job. But with a job markets that isn't doing well, and rates that can be excessive, its another incredible burden on young people. Many of these loans can not be discharged through bankruptcy. <br><br>3) So, because of a depressed job market for various reasons, and increased burdens on both younger and older generations, you have more people than ever who cannot afford to move out, buy a car, or own a home. Its also led to an increased amount of kids staying home longer, or being supported by their parents. <br><br>4) By the way, companies have been making record breaking profits for the past few years. Worker pay has not increased as much as wealth for these people and share holders. Some of this money is kept offshore to avoid U.S. taxes. Trillions of dollars offshore that just grow, but don't benefit the government, or normal people. <br><br>5) Many banks that would've lost everything in the financial crisis were saved by the government pumping lots of money into them to try to ease money flowing through the financial system. These were given for extremely low interest rates. The system was saved but lending didn't increase as much so banks seem to have used this benefit from the government to benefit themselves most. <br><br>All of these factors affect every level of society. Rich people who have kept their money in the stock market have gotten wealthier. The middle class has stagnated and shrunk. The lower class grew and is still struggling. <br><br>What caused this? Part global trends, part political trends. <br>The financial crisis - There were rules in place that would prevent reckless actions by the banks, on derivative trading and so on. These were repealed through lobbying. <br><br>Same with many other issues. <br>Elections are won and lost by much smaller margins than people think. Young people generally don't vote. Older people do. <br><br>So Millenials and younger people from previous generations have to get out and vote. To pay attention to the issues. And to attack politicians who ignore them, and vote for those who don't. Forget tackling every issue. Pick the top 3. Vote! Otherwise why the hell should politicians pay attention to you! <br><br>These problems aren't accidents, they are systemic. <br>In the american constitution it says, 'We the people'!, not we the corporations. Demand what kind of world you want. Get motivated. Or else let those who are more motivated take the world and do with it what they will. <br><br><br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

Why? Because supply and demand affect money the same way as other goods. If you can create new money faster than build new houses then the price of houses will go up because the value - purchasing power - of money goes down. Whatever is scarce  and in demand is valuable. Same is true for new cars - if there's too many consumer loans the dealers will jack the prices up and the manufacturers will be happy and won't make more cars to drop the price. No sir!<br><br>And so for every new purchase which grew to be a staple of the &quot;American Way of life&quot; you have to pay more and more and more. Get more and more and more in debt. Pay more and more and more interest.<br><br>The prices would normally fall - just like it happened after the 2008 crash - but that would mean too much money would evaporate from the banks (also known as deflation) and that just couldn't stand. GDP would contract, a crisis would strike and that might cost the politicians an election! Screw dropping standard of living! We might lose the next election!!!! So the government and the fed kept propping the credit bubble up and even increasing it.For years and years and years.   And the prices kept rising and rising.. long enough for the <strong>cantillon effect</strong> to occur. This is the key and an important term to remember - because it is soooo obscure and pundits and politicians like to talk about getting new taxes, dropping interest rates more, introducing new laws... And never address the real issue! Besides who'd care about some Cantillon? <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Cantillon" target="_blank">Who was he?</a> A Frenchman? An Irishman! Get out!<br><br>-----<br><br><strong>Cantillon effect</strong> occurs when a lot of new money is introduced into the economy through very few channels. Meaning when not everyone suddenly gets a 100$ bill stuck into a wallet but when the banks can borrow money from the FED at a much lower rate. Then the banks get it first, play a bit on the financial markets, then perhaps invest in some stocks and that money slowly, slowly, very slowly trickles down to you. There's just one 'but'. Whoever gets it first can use its full purchasing power. As it filters down through the economy people realize that there's more money and the value of it (the purchasing power) falls down. So whoever gets the money last gets the least of purchasing power. Whoever gets the money first spends it on a market that is <em>not yet aware of this new money</em>.<br><br>The problem? There's no difference between &quot;new&quot; and &quot;old&quot; money. So if a bank creates one billion new dollars it will affect the value of the new dollars just as much as the value of the old dollars in your wallet.  And if the credit expansion was happening continuously since the 1987 crisis and the post Gulf-war recession (which cost George Bush Sr the election)... That's almost 25 years of printing money to suck out all the life from your wallet. <br><br>Only the bank and the government can keep printing, and printing, and printing.... And they get bailouts, TARPS, quantitative easings... And you have to keep <em>working</em> for your wages.  You have only two hands and there's only 24 hours and 52 weeks.<br><br>----<br><br>This is really what causes the &quot;drop in real wages&quot;. The wages don't decrease. You don't get wage cuts but the money you are earning isn't worth as much as it used to be before. And while people keep telling you that &quot;inflation is consistently low&quot;...  remember that inflation is measured to avoid &quot;systemic shocks&quot; such as rapid growth in oil price, housing bubbles, higher ed bubbles...<br><br>Pretty much everywhere where the inflation really hurts.  If you want to know how badly put a baloon in your butt and blow it up with a compressor. That's how much it hurts. Damn inflation.<br><br>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>There are obviously other causes too. Jobs are getting scarce because the market is volatile. Companies can't get credit or capital for investment and can't expand and employ people - especially when Li and Wong work for a bowl of rice. Banks have too much troubled assets and can give loans for free like 10 years ago. Unless you are an old white guy - but even then it's not guaranteed. But the reason why this here - <strong>above</strong> - is <em>the</em> explanation is that in times like this prices should <strong>fall</strong>.  Just like the prices in 2008 did. Just like the housing bubble in Nevada brought new homes in Las Vegas from hot properties for 150k  to vacant lots at 25k. Just like the property bubble in Britain in the late 80s drove the price for a broom closet in the City of London to 25000 pounds and then brought it back to a pack of peanuts in 1991.<br><br>Shit doesn't sell anymore! People are out of work! So why <em>some</em> prices are still so high? <a href="http://www.quickmeme.com/img/57/574aa510639422f9e66a9832de8c6bfcad2b57a23afa95c8488baa81ee6ed301.jpg" target="_blank">Why is it so too damn high I am asking you!!!</a><br><br>You need to get the money <em>out of the economy</em>. And that means &quot;deflation&quot;. And the banks and the politicians poop in their pants when they hear this. Because election!<br><br>-------<br><br>EDIT: Because my lifelong ambition is becoming an editor.  I dreamed about it as a kid. And now? Sigh... I only edit posts on reddit.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>tl;dr:<br><br>The housing/student loan bubble pushed prices up high while wages stagnated. The bubble popped, crashing the market and depressing wages and hiring for several years, but home prices and tuition are &quot;sticky&quot; and so they haven't come down much.<br><br>I'll try to ELY5 (or maybe 15):<br><br>From around 2002-2008 or so, federal regulations on home and student loan were &quot;relaxed&quot; along with the regulations on how banks were allowed to package and re-sell them. At the same time, government assistance programs for homes and college tuition were cut way back. At the same-same time, almost every market sector (except energy and high-tech) was experiencing a decline in growth, partly as fallout from the dot-com bust of the late 90's, and partly as a result of free-trade agreements encouraging the shift of skilled labor (manufacturing labor) into overseas markets. The healthcare &quot;boom&quot; hadn't started yet because the baby boomers weren't old enough yet to cause the spike in health services needs. To try to &quot;fix&quot; this problem, the federal reserve bank started steadily lowering the prime interest rate, which has the effect of increasing the money supply, which also has the effects of:<br><br>1. causing higher-than normal inflation<br>2. weakening the dollar<br>3. encouraging spending (and thereby propping up GDP growth)<br><br>Since federal aid for homes and tuition was down, but it was easier than ever to get loans, regular folks started taking on debt to buy houses and go to school. Credit card debt went way up as well for less responsible people, but even responsible people need a place to live and want an education, so no one was really immune. Since interest rates were down and people really only care about their monthly payments and not so much about the total price, this resulted in housing and tuition prices climbing pretty rapidly - the market sets the price, and when people are willing to pay more in total because their monthly payments are lower, then the total goes up. In the housing market, this created a feedback loop, because all of a sudden the housing market was the new place to invest. Everyone was buying, and prices just kept going up and up! You couldn't lose. Now taking on even <em>more</em> debt to buy a house made sense, because in year or two your home would be worth way more than you paid. This created the &quot;bubble&quot; which you have I'm sure heard about. <br><br>A similar thing was happening with college tuition. Since federal aid was cut back, colleges needed to make money somehow, and since loans were cheap and easier than ever to get, they could increase tuition without seeing a decrease in enrollment. So they did.  People still went to school, because they could defer the payments until after they graduated and got that high-paying job they were dreaming of.<br><br>All of this on its own wouldn't be too bad, but there was one other factor at play. Due to the &quot;relaxed&quot; financial market regulations, and the stagnating rest-of-the-economy, financial investment folks figured out a way to take advantage of these bubbles caused by easy consumer credit. They started buying up home loans (backed by the property itself) and student loans (backed by the fact that you can never discharge student loan debt) and repackaged them. Only, they did it in a way that wasn't entirely honest (whether on purpose or not we don't know). What they did was set things up so that the apparent risk in the loan package was lower than the real risk, as people normally understood it. In other words, they would buy up a bunch of loans given to people who probably maybe should not have been given a loan in the first place, but then do some funky math and claim the risk was actually lower than it was. They got away with it because the regulations governing that sort of thing were not as strong as they used to be.<br><br>Ok - so to recap - there were several things happening simultaneously:<br><br>1. Loans were cheap, everyone was getting them<br>2. Housing and college prices were going up<br>3. Financial groups were cashing in by packaging up bad loans and reselling them as good<br>4. Most of the rest of the economy was stagnating<br><br>The net result of all of this was that housing and tuition prices were being driven up quickly, and there was nothing to keep them in check. As long as housing prices kept going up, people would keep getting loans. As long as people were still in school and hopeful for the future, they would keep getting loans. The problems started when interest rates couldn't go down any more (the federal reserve had lowered the prime rate as much as it could). Once monthly payment amounts were more than people could afford on their wages (which had been increasing much more slowly than housing prices, and were also affected by higher-than-normal inflation) housing and tuition prices couldn't keep increasing. This made all of those home loans that only made sense if prices kept climbing suddenly worthless. In turn, this made all of the derivatives (the packaged loans) worthless, and because of a pretty complicated relationship between those and a bunch of other financial markets, there was a huge crash.<br><br>This all happened in 2008 and was the start of the &quot;Great Recession.&quot; Once the free-money party that was enabled by constantly decreasing interest rates was over, there were no more bubbles that could be used to prop things up. Investments declined, people stopped taking out so many loans, and a lot of people who had &quot;invested&quot; in homes were suddenly making payments on houses that were worth less than what they paid for them. Since the education and housing bubbles were propping up the rest of the economy, things got bad everywhere. Lots of people lost their jobs, wages were depressed further because unemployment was way up, the close association of healthcare to employment meant people who would like to retire or switch jobs didn't so that they didn't lose their health insurance, and since pensions and other retirement benefits were cut, people who could otherwise afford to retire didn't.<br><br>Now normally, when a market crashes, prices decline as part of the adjustment. This is what happens in an idealized capitalist economy. For our economy, some prices are &quot;sticky&quot; - basically anything that people &quot;need&quot; is going to move slowly in the absence of a large driving force. The large driving force to push home and tuition prices up was the availability of very cheap credit. There is no corresponding force to push them down. They did decline a little (in some places where the bubble was ridiculous they came down a lot), but they are probably not coming down much further any time soon. Unfortunately, wages and food are sticky too - it takes a lot for wages to start going up, and when unemployment is high, wages tend to stay put or even decrease. And if food prices are high (this is also partly due to energy prices being high), they don't have money to spend on other stuff, and so the economic stagnation continues.<br><br>The combination of all of these factors has led to our current situation - wages are still low, tuition and housing prices are still high, and most people spend all their money on the essentials. Fortunately, consumer electronics are cheap enough to keep us entertained!<br><br>Once the health care reform package went into effect at the beginning of 2014, there was an increase in hiring since people could switch jobs and retire a little more easily. Housing prices and tuition will start to decrease when people stop buying as many houses and less people go to school - that is what you are seeing now - it has gotten too expensive for a lot of people, so they aren't doing it.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Look no further than the culture of constant growth. Economies breathe, they expand and contract. It seems like somewhere in the 80's the concept of the expansion became the only palatable portion of economic breathing. As a result, the US population looked more and more to policy makers to achieve constant growth, with no downside. The overwhelming majority of policy makers obliged, since they have a very narrow view of the world limited to the time between now and the next election cycle. As a result we get a group of central planners who implement policies to direct economic outcomes. These policies create imbalances. What we are living through now is an imbalance fueled by the &quot;debt is good&quot; mindset that has risen as the Great Depression generation has slowly passed. Keep in mind debt represents future consumption. For example, if you spend $1000 today on your credit card, then you forgo $1000 of future consumption, as you have to pay back the $1000 you spent today. Debt in terms of mortgages, corporate bonds, consumer credit, and the like worked to pull decades of demand forward, creating massive growth. The problem is we are running out of time on the debt cycle. 2008 was clearly a fracture in that cycle, which policy makers solved by... you guess it, more debt. To combat the exponential rise in debt, central planners inflate the currency. Inflation allows the pulled forward consumption to be paid back with less real wealth in the future, further encouraging the debt cycle. The more consumption that is pulled forward, the cheaper debt needs to become to encourage more future consumption to be pulled forward. This is how we get into negative interest rates and all the mania we are facing today. The Millennial Generation happens to be on the tail end of the debt cycle. While policy makers work frantically to keep the cycle going, it is unsustainable. <br><br>Millennials should be really pissed with the actions coming out of 2008. 2008 represented a massive fracture of the debt cycle primarily enjoyed by the Baby Boomers. Yes, the result of the fracture would have been painful (would it have been more painful than it is now?), but we would have also enjoyed a deflationary period, which would have benefitted... you guessed it, those without debt; i.e. the Millennials and prudent Generation X and Baby Boomers. Instead the majority of political power is still derived and influenced by the Baby Boomers and massive debt, so kicking the can and maintaining the debt cycle for as long as possible became the policy of choice. Imagine an economy where housing, groceries, cars, education were 25%, 50% or more less expensive. Yes it would destabilize the old guard, but it would be a boon for the next booming generation, the Millennials.  <br><br>Disclaimer: <br>There are millions of other factors at play, as economics is a social science, but simplifying the equation to debt really highlights a major factor in the Millennials plight. <br><br>Edit: Accidental double posted, then realized I could delete the first post. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LW__eE7-BA" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LW__eE7-BA</a></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I am a millennial. You have a few options 1) don't go to college, probably get a cheap shitty job, hard to live off of 2) go to a less known but cheap college, get an okay paying job, maybe a little debt 3) go to a good college but be in a shit ton of debt, but get a decent job hopefully. All of these barely provide enough income for living, and even those that do go to college have no guarantee of getting a good job. We are just trying to make ends meet, trying to live and pay off debt. Also the mentality that I have observed it that experiences are more important than objects. A lot of my friends would prefer to go on a nice cool trip to Europe than own a car. I also think the stigma of second hand purchases has gone away. Kids these days love shopping at salvation army, or buying cars second hand. Public transportation/ biking has become more common. Everything still works and does its job, it doesnt have to be brand spanking new. When people look at numbers of cars they often only look at new car rates but the truth is there are so may cars already made just waiting to be sold second hand. I also think people are waitin to purchase homes until they are married, which is when they get older most of the time because it really is truly difficult for someone with college debt to pay for a house as well. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There are many different factors that have led to this trend. One is the lack of higher paying jobs available. As a millennial I can tell you the incredible promises made to us by college recruiters that we'll make $60k or more per year if we get that bachelor's degree. And how important it is. Fact is, a lot of the fields that require a bachelor's degree only pay about $28 - $30k coming out of college with no experience. This of course after paying $50k + for your degree. College tuition has increased by about 600% since the 70's, and as a previous comment or noted, about 1000% per inflation. This is repulsive consider the education is relatively the same, and the administrative expense on average for a college or university is 60% or more of its total annual expense. This does include secretary staff and things, but why is there so much outrage over CEOs of big corporations making millions per year when a dean or president or coach of a school makes much the same per year and there is no outrage over that? Is not education funding far more important? PROPER education funding? Also is the lack of skill set and experience many millenials bring to the table. Many, not all, but many have never held a.prior job. Makes it difficult for an employer to hire some one at a reasonable wage. Then there is the LIE. As I mentioned before, we were told up and down by our parents, college recruiters and school counselors that a 4 year bachelor's degree will make us $60k and more per year coming straight out of college. This is simply not true. Fact is, that even of pay takes 5 or more years at a company with a bachelor's degree. What they didn't tell us is that many of the trade jobs (welding, telecommunications, HVAC, electrician, etc.) Will actually make you more right out of school with paying less for your education. And, these jobs are going to be in high demand being most of the workforce is near retirement age now. Then there is simply laziness. Why should I have to work 60 hours per week to make $100,000 per year? Right??? We were told we could make that kind of money without that kind of effort. Again, we were lied to. Even the big CEOs of major companies work more than that. Yes, they get long wonderful vacations. But the $1500 meal at the amazing new restaurant down the street was likely a business meeting, not simply entertainment. And many of us millenials were given everything. I grew up in a low middle class household. But my mother's rule was, &quot;if you do sports you don't need to get a job. If you don't do sports, you need a job.&quot; I had a job over the summer every year. A VERY physical one. But guess what I did during the school year? I played sports. Yes, I thoroughly enjoyed participating in the sports I did. But from August to the end of May, I didn't pay for a damn thing. Some of you may read this and think I was one of the lucky ones. Yes I was. But I also know a staggering amount of people who never had to work during highschool or college because their parents paid for everything. THEN there is inflation. Staggering, nauseating, mind-boggling inflation. In the 1960s my grandparents were able to buy an 1800 sqft ruler with 5 bedrooms, including a finished basement, two vehicles, and raise 4 kids on a total household income of $40,000 per year. Their house, in its time, was beyond high end. My wife and I now have two vehicles (a 2009 truck and 2011 SUV, a small 3 bedroom town home we can't even park our vehicles inside, with 2 kids. We make a combined average of $65,000 per year (the median national household income). And we struggle dearly to make ends meet. Things are too expensive, we've become too lazy, we've become way to dependent, and our government has stopped caring about our well-being and success, and has begun caring too much about its own expansion of power, money and control. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Here's the deal: Back when the parents of millennials were just starting to enter the workforce in any meaningful number (this would be the late seventies to the mid eighties), there was a MUCH smaller gap between the minimum wage and a LIVING wage. What this means is, back then, two people could feasibly get married, buy a house, buy a car, and have a child - all on minimum wage - with no or absolute minimum help from the government.<br><br>As time went on, inflation went up, but the minimum wage didn't keep the same pace. In addition, college tuition has almost tripled, but the only thing to offset the additional costs have come in the form of government loans and other agencies that offer assistance - of which some are borderline predatory. So, today, we have people graduating college with a veritable mountain of debt. So, millennials have an uphill battle. No problem, they can bounce back from a bit of inflated debt.<br><br>Enter the economic collapse of 2006. The majority of the workforce is either JUST graduating or are about half way through their degree. Unemployment is in the 20-30% range, and <em>will be</em> for the next few years. Those that have just graduated, incurred a disproportionate amount of debt that's equivalent to a house payment now have almost zero jobs available. It's the goddamned Thunderdome of employment - you better be DAMNED good at what you do, be willing to take almost NO money, and be willing to drink the blood of your competitors. <br><br>So, no one's finding jobs. Everyone's moving back home, and a quarter to a third of our population has to get on unemployment. Meanwhile, people that are still only half way through their degrees are seeing this and going, &quot;Holy <em>fuck</em>.&quot; Effectively, what's happened is that the backbone of what is supposed to carry our economy (young, college-educated, middle-class workers) has been trained to stab any motherfucker that comes close to their money, because the only &quot;real-world&quot; they've known is now run by Tina Turner and Master-Blaster holding a briefcase.<br><br>On top of that, wages <em>still</em> aren't where they should be to match the inflation-income levels that existed when millennials' parents were entering the workforce. In essence, millennials are trying (and <em>expected</em>) to do the same thing their parents did, but they're trying to do it on hard-mode, with <em>more</em> debt and <em>less</em> effective pay.<br><br><strong>tl;dr; Watch &quot;Road Warrior&quot;, but instead of gas, it's jobs. Also, Millennials start the movie being shot in the leg.</strong></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I am from a developing country, where the current generation is slightly richer than the previous generation. I will try to answer the question based on whatever I had read, heard and came to know but pls take them with a grain (or a bowl) of salt!<br><br>First of all, I would like to point out that a middle class/upper middle class person in a developing country might have nowhere near as many material possessions that a middle class/upper middle class family in a western country (especially US) has. Families have sufficient things but they pale in comparison with the no. of things that a western family has (had!?). Beware though, I say this mostly out of anecdotal experience. Having a suburban house with a landscaping, garage and a decent-sized backyard is pretty much exclusive for RICH people in this country (or rural/remote parts of the country).<br><br>Second, the life style choices in developing countries such as food, vacations etc. are still a fraction of what is available in developed countries. Remember though that this will go up once many people join this social strata in the developing countries.<br><br>So basically what I mean here is that even the emerging affluent class in developing countries might not have as much material possessions or lifestyle choices (only in terms of food or vacations) that middle class in developing countries once had in its heydays. <br><br>So why is that? My understanding is that both of the above mentioned points consume finite resources from earth in order to sustain itself. (Material possessions: limited by earth's resources; Choice of Homes: limited by land, energy etc; Food: limited by arable land and plateauing agricultural productivity). However, as more and more people enter into this category of people, the pie is going to get smaller. <br><br>So, the current generation of people in the developed world had to share the finite resources of earth with more people, than the previous generation who had less people to share with. This might give the appearance of them being poorer than the parents.<br><br>Remember, that the above mentioned conclusions might be wrong under two circumstances. 1) The number of people to share the resources with becomes a constant (population stabilizes) 2) Bottlenecks on  many (or all) of some of above the mentioned factors (energy, water, land, agricultural productivity etc) are removed. Possible scenarios include mastery of renewable energy, efficient desalination of sea water, space colonization (removes the land bottleneck). Unless any of these stuff happens, the resources that the current generation has to share, will ensure that they will have a lifestyle not as good as their parents'. (especially in case of US)<br><br>Now, as to why the previous generation had less people to share resources with, it's a by-product of long history where the Western world basically sparked a scientific and industrial revolution which enabled it to run away with a huge lead in terms of economy and military compared to other regions of the world (especially the previous heavy weights China and India). The snowballing of this, however was a pretty lucky one, IMHO as other regions and civilizations had those leads in the past and squandered them away. This snowballing or positive feedback loop however, was halted for the Europe during the world wars I and II. However, the US emerged from those wars with a pretty huge lead which probably enabled the generation previous to the millennials, a life style no where matched in other parts of the world or in the past history. US had at one time, I believe 40% of world GDP. This amount of wealth concentration on a Nation state is pretty unheard of (matched probably only few times in Human history). <br><br>So, its probably better to realize that unless breakthroughs of the scale of industrial revolution occur in present or near future times, the millenials would never match the wealth of their previous generation.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I believe that not everyone should go to higher education. The risk is not worth the reward. I am a high school dropout. Now hear me out... I changed schools a couple times going into a private christian school and back to public. The state didn't want to credit me for some of the class hours I had earned at private school due to religious subject. Although I'm a dropout doesn't mean I'm not bright, I was mainly bored. I passed what classes I was interested in, the others I left to die. I have a mechanical mind. I understand how things work and how to fix them. I built a network running off a Windows NT server 4.0 machine I had built at age 11. I built a forged and stroked race engine at 18. <br><br>I started working on my 18th birthday on a large printing press at R.R. Donnelley, worked 14 hours that day. That year, 2007 (age18-19) I brought home $25,000. I stayed there for 4.5 years running printing presses and doing manual labor associated. I worked my way up to $35,000 by the end of my stint there. I had learned robot programming, automation, PLC communications,  and how to print on just about any web press, Goss, Hitachi, Timson, Mitsubishi, and more. I left to join the automotive industry, being a car guru I wanted a job I loved. I went to building engines for Subaru. I build a several tens of thousands 2.5l boxer engines for Legacy, and Outback. While there I put in for a skilled trade job at ThysseKrupp AG as Tool &amp; Die making Ford 5.0L and Ford Ecoboost 3.5l crankshafts. I do CNC machining, manual milling, die repair, blade repair, general tooling repair, CNC programming, welding of all kinds, and trouble shooting the forging process (7,000metric ton press). I took this job as a start into a skilled trade that in 5 years will lead me to higher paying jobs in other tool &amp; die positions, as this job is below the national average for tool and die wages, but they were willing to teach me the trade.<br><br>With nothing more than a GED I earned while working night shift at 18. I'm currently earning $44,000 bring home pay at 25 years old. I own an Audi A4 and a GMC Acadia,  I am also a homeowner of a 1600sq ft 4 bedroom home for my family (wife, 2 sons). With no student debt. I'm not rich, but in rural Indiana, with low cost of living, I'm not doing too bad. If I did it all again, I still wouldn't go to higher education. I don't mind working hard to earn that promotion or getting dirty. That is the issue with the newer generations. School teaches them as young as the 6th grade; Go out and get a degree, so you won't have to work hard and you can own a house, car, and a boat! Well there has to be workers that are willing to make the shit happen under all that management. The people who hold the degrees and debt are dead set that they earned the right to not have to work on the floor or do the labor. I'd rather earn it than buy it. <br><br>That being said I do believe we need to people to get the bigger education and be those CEO, CFO, engineers, aerospace, and all those other high end jobs that make this world what it is today. I just believe we have an influx of kids throwing themselves into debt with no idea why, just that everyone teaches them its 'best'.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Everyone between the ages of 16 and 35 listen up. If you want to go to college for free then I recommend going into the military, serving 4 years and then getting the fuck out. Do this and you will have the &quot;GI Bill&quot; which will give you thousands of dollars to live off of while you are in school, will pay your full tuition, and even cover the cost of your books. <br><br>You don't have to join as a lowly private either. You can join a ROTC unit <em>while</em> you are in college, sign a contract saying you will serve in the military when you graduate, and then the military will pay for your schooling <em>and</em> you will be a commissioned officer in the military when you graduate. This is by far the better option, although it does take a bit more discipline, and there may be age restrictions, but if you are between the ages of 17 and 26 or so then you should be fine to start ROTC in college. <br><br>Also, if you were injured in the military and can show evidence of this then you can go to college using something called &quot;vocational rehabilitation&quot; which is the GI Bill on steroids. This program is more complicated, but essentially it works like this: If the military fucks you up and you can no longer do the civilian equivalent job of what you did in the military when you leave the military as a result of your injuries (mental or physical), then the military will pay to retrain you to do whatever you are smart enough to do. For example: If you are a military police officer, go to Iraq, come back with PTSD and a fucked up back then you can no longer serve as a civilian police officer when you leave the military. You file a claim with the VA (uncle sam) they have the docs check you out and if they say &quot;yes, the Army/Air Force etc. fucked you up&quot; then you will be eligible for this program, and you can be retrained as a doctor, lawyer, electrician or whatever floats your goat.  <br><br>I'm getting my bachelor and masters degree paid for by this program and its amazing. <br><br>PM me for the deets, or just reply and I'll help anyone out who has more questions. It really is a no brainer. Serve, and the country will serve you....just don't get so fucked up that you become a vegetable...or die...so like join as intelligence, aircrew, maintenance, linguist or some other non-combat job. Do not join the infantry,military police or any other combat job!!! <br><br>EDIT: If you are a ninja and or triathlete and <em>really</em> just want to kill people and blow shit up then join Special Forces/Special Operations-75th Rangers, don't go regular infantry and stay there....you'll be bored and miserable. <br><br><br>EDIT 2: TLDR Get a free bachelors, masters and or PhD by enlisting and serving 4 years in the military. Join the military while you are in college and become an officer, then get out 4 years later with money for a masters or PhD. Don't join the infantry! Go intel, linguist, aircrew etc. </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>This is my first post, but this issue is near and dear to me and I thought that I might have something interesting to contribute. Some people on this thread might be economists (I happen to be one). <br><br> This is a highly contentious inter-generational issue, as older generations seem to think that the time period that millennials (my generation) are growing up in is the same they grew up in. It is not, as evidenced by almost any economic indicator that you look at. Below are some economic indicators that I review periodically to gain my bearings on where we are in this story. Despite the information put out by most mainstream outlets, the economic situation is rather dire for the average person in the United States:   <br><br><em> Real Median Household Income. Has Risen 5.5% since 1979 (annual rate of .01%): <br><br><a href="http://stateofworkingamerica.org/charts/real-median-household-income/" target="_blank">http://stateofworkingamerica.org/charts/real-median-household-income/</a><br><br></em> Housing prices have risen 180% since the early 80's (annual rate of roughly 4%):<br><br><a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/02/us-house-prices" target="_blank">http://www.economist.com/blogs/graphicdetail/2014/02/us-house-prices</a><br><br><em> US higher education costs have risen roughly 130% since the early 80's (annual rate of roughly 2.8%):<br><br><a href="http://nces.ed.gov/FastFacts/display.asp?id=76" target="_blank">http://nces.ed.gov/FastFacts/display.asp?id=76</a><br><br></em> US Healthcare Costs have risen substantially, relative to the rest of the economy:<br><br><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/03/health-care-costs-_n_3998425.html" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/03/health-care-costs-_n_3998425.html</a><br><br><em> People on Food Stamps in the US rose from about 2.9 million in 1969 to over 46.5 million in 2014 (a 1600% increase in that time period). Normalizing for population growth, participation in food stamp programs rose from about 9% in 1980 to roughly 15% today:<br><br><a href="http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/pd/SNAPsummary.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/pd/SNAPsummary.pdf</a><br><br><a href="http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/govt-report-food-stamps-participation-historic-high-even-unemployment-rate-falls_782712.html" target="_blank">http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/govt-report-food-stamps-participation-historic-high-even-unemployment-rate-falls_782712.html</a><br><br></em> Consumer Credit in the US rose to $3.2 Trillion at the end of 2014 from a mere $133 Billion in 1970 (9.8% annual rate):<br><br><a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/HIST/cc_hist_mh_levels.html" target="_blank">http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/g19/HIST/cc_hist_mh_levels.html</a> <br><br><br> Anyway, I could provide more evidence of the difficulty that the millennials are facing economically, but I think you get the point. To answer your question simply: Real wages remained stagnant in recent decades, relative to the cost of pretty everything else that people care about (food, education, healthcare, and housing). This coupled with overall higher debt levels, has made it difficult for the average American (younger Americans in particular) to live with the same comforts formerly enjoyed in previous time periods. Things are difficult for the millennials (and everyone else for that matter) for these reasons.<br><br> This being said, I am hopeful that my generation is paying attention and will see fit to educate themselves on what brought us to this dire state. From what I've gathered, the millennials are doing just this, by questioning more deeply the system(s) and arrangements they were born into (economic, monetary, political, etc...) and these questions, along with their awakened action might actually change the world around them (hopefully for the better). Great question and I hope I've answered it adequately. <strong>I'll end my post with another question: What are we going to do about it?</strong> <br><br><br> P.S. If there are any other economists on this thread, please forgive my citations of economic data. I wanted to provide graphs, where possible, as I think graphical data representations are easier to digest for most people. <br><br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>We have something called a federal reserve banking system where there are different banking collaborations creating money out of thin air when giving out loans, taking it's value from the rest of the fiat-money in the market. <br><br>This creation of money as debt is why we in this day only have so-called &quot;debt-based money&quot; where banks use your birthcertificate to borrow you money in your name to lend it back to you with interests (the perfect crime?).<br><br>When a lot of people borrow money like this as they have been doing for decades now, the value/purchasing power of the money will fall, thereby wiping out the middle class and and feeding of the poor. Since a lower purchasing power of money leads to higher prices over time, this also discourages savings as the money will be able to buy less goods in the future compared to present day. <br><br>In math, this equation would look something like this: (Money)Inflation = Total amount of money %(divided by) Total amount of goods. Using this calculation we can quickly realize that money is close to endless or basically based on the lenders/creators of money's gut feeling for the time being. With the endless backing from governments through mandated government insurance, this guy feeling has been really good for a long long time now.<br><br>The distortion of money creation where the price of money (the interest rate, determined by how much money people have been saving) is artificially low (because there is no actual savings to borrow money from, as it is created on the spot), leading to an accumilation of money near the organizations who get the &quot;new&quot; money first (normally banks/governments) causes investment distortions because people this they are living above their means on borrowed money. <br><br>The current and next generations is the ones that will be ending up paying for all of this because of previous democratic acceptance of this type of distortion in the money supply.<br><br>The human world has had one hell of a spending party since the creation of the Federal Reserve Act in 1914, and the current generation has just arrived way to late to the party.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I have a very simple theory to this.  College today holds the stature that High School did in yesterdays world.  You &quot;Had&quot; to go to get a job.  The problem with that in my opinion is that High School is relatively cheap while college is full of debt, but the job market isn't very much different.  So say 50% of high school graduates got a GOOD job in the 50s or 60's but today its only 50% of COLLEGE graduates that get a good job. The difference is though, nowadays the OTHER 50% without good jobs, still hold the DEBT from college.  vs. High School has virtually no debt to speak of.  So in my opinion in the shrinking market, with everyone HAVING to go to college to get a good job, we've really just increased that nations debt and maintained the same amount of jobs over all. Which is why todays generation is poorer overall.  I haven't gone to college yet and I don't really plan to soon, because I don't want to go until i KNOW what I want to do, if it even involves college.  But instead of wasting money not knowing what I want to do, I have a job that makes decent money and Im saving.  A lot of kids end up in college cause its what you &quot;Have&quot; to do as you've been told all through high school, but all it does is beat the next and next generations into debt.  <br><br>TLDR: College is last years high school, Main difference is DEBT, teenagers are fucked</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

Homes and cars have become more expensive, even  after adjusting for inflation. But believe me, your parents arent much better off. Many of them dont own their homes or cars. Often, the marriage is the only reason a home becomes affordable. Meanwhile, after car payments and mortgages, the average retiree will have saved less than 100k for retirement, less than half the cost of medical expense over 20 years. This leaves many relying soley on social security just a few short years later. Believe me, at this rate, our parents will be living in our basements.

And god forbid - GASP- they go to trade school and make a lucrative living as a top notch plumber or electrician.  Enjoy that educational debt burden.<br><br>2) Blurring Needs/Wants/Instant Gratification:  Millennials were raised by the &quot;Helicopter&quot; crowd, thus they expect to have everything they want when they want it.  They also are clueless as to what a &quot;need&quot; is versus a &quot;want&quot;, so they do idiotic crap like finance iPads, phones clothes, insane weddings and elaborate tattoos because they &quot;need&quot; it.  Hello?<br><br>3) Not willing to start at the bottom and work their way up:  Hey Millennials guess what?  Us Gen-Xers are fighting and clawing and scraping out our livings and we have been doing it since you were shitting your diapers.  We are exhausted, stressed out, overworked and not giving up our paychecks without a bloody fight.  So fuck you - start in the mail rooms and call centers like we did and eat the same shit for low pay like we did and deal with it... you are not special.   No one gives a shit about your Masters degree in theoretical physics here in the trenches. <br><br>4) &quot;Anything I can dream I can be&quot;  Nope, no ya can't.  It costs money, lots of it.  I can't tell you on my way to work how many Millenial art school douche bags I hear on the train talking about the &quot;epic film we are shooting&quot; or the &quot;record we are producing&quot; or the &quot;game we are designing&quot;.  Awesome!  Too bad like 90% of them won't get past your bedroom doors.  Not everyone can be a rap star or a movie producer - there are only a few of these jobs and the people getting them are the ones who are most closely connected to them - thousands of talented people fade into obscurity every day.   Should you give up on your passions and your creative endeavors?  Absolutely not - but stop kidding yourself about getting rich from them - the statistical probability is that you won't.  Learn science and applied engineering, better yet learn a construction trade.  Our bridges and roads are crumbling, our environment is deteriorating, our natural resources are vanishing and transportation is stuck in the stone age.  The future needs smart, creative people to fix this shit, not produce rap albums and time wasting web sites.  Learn this stuff, master it and then earn a good living fixing it and actually changing the world in a real way.<br><br>Flame away</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

That’s what mainstream media seems to think in regards to millennials. A study found that over 50s actively absorb the attitude that millennials are lazy and entitled. Older participants in the study were more likely to read articles that portrayed millennials in a poor light because it gave them a self-esteem boost.&quot;</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Quick and simple answers: technical progress is to blame and monopolization of the markets (to some degree, resulting from technical progress).<br><br>Elaboration: the commonly thrown around phrase that the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer is actually true. Maybe not in the absolute sense of those words (the poor of today have access to various technologies and facilities which were not available to the poor of the past), but in relative terms - yes. This is commonly measured using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient" target="_blank">Gini coefficient</a> and Gini is growing in pretty much the entire world. <br><br>The reason for this is that we are today able to produce the same amount of goods and services using less people than before thanks to using machines and software. Company owners are gradually replacing people with machines to earn more or sell their products at a lower price. Even those who do not wish to fire people are forced to do so as their cost base is higher and so are their prices (so they can not compete). This means that company owners either do not lose money or earn even more than in the past. Employees who get redundant either stay unemployed or find worse paid jobs and can no longer afford a house or a car.<br><br>Monopolization is also a result of technological progress, especially progress in communication and transport. In the past there used to be soda factories close to each major city to supply them. Once TV became popular people were exposed to advertising. Development of transport system allowed the goods to be transported over long distances and people started drinking Coca-Cola or Pepsi almost exclusively. Local soda factories went out of business. In the past there used to be theatres in many cities and many people worked as actors, these days we have TV and cinemas and people around the world watch the same movies. There is a group of perhaps 100-200 actors who earn millions of dollars - the money that regional actors could theoretically make. Modern internet companies are able to dominate the entire market almost immediately (think Google, Facebook, Twitter). Internet is currently replacing traditional retail chains.<br><br>Add to this the fact that science is so well developed these days that it requires a lot of resources to be able to develop a breakthrough technology. It is rarely possible for small companies to accomplish this. Large ones can afford it and it improves their competitive position thus contributing to the monopolization of the market. Single company, even if it is huge, will use less people than 10 smaller ones serving the same market, obviously. <br><br>Rich person of course spends more than a poor one, but only in absolute terms. If you make 20-30 k per year, you will end up spending just about everything (and struggle). If you make 20-30 m per year, chances are you will end up spending no more than 1-2 m even if you spend lavishly. The remainder will be invested and will not directly contribute to creating demand on the market. Rich businessman will not eat as much as the one hundred employees he made redundant, will not buy as many cars or clothes, etc. This means that car manufacturers do not need as many employees and make them redundant, etc. This is where often the governments step in and provide additional demand by issuing debt instruments. So the public debts have been growing for the last (companies and rich individuals cut down on investment until prospects are better, but this further reduces economic growth, so the government starts building more highways or sth to give people jobs and money). Because of all of this there is a growing concern that large income inequalities are slowing down the economic growth. Here is an IMF paper supporting that thesis: <a href="http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1402.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/sdn/2014/sdn1402.pdf</a><br><br>TL; DR The rich have too much money and wealth which they accumulate by monopolizing the markets using the achievements of technical progress and making people redundant (or work for less).<br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Let's consider a (potentially) positive reason why this is the case.  Millennials are far more likely to have an 'experience' vs 'ownership' mentality. They have grown up with something no generation before them has: social media. Social media has provided a platform for millennials to show the world all the cool things they are doing. While before the only way for the average person to display their wealth/success/culture was to amass 'things', now one can collect experiences and keep them neatly catalogued on Facebook/Twitter/Instagram. This has created a culture that is more interested in using things rather than owning them. Services like uber or bikesharing or airB&amp;B all cater to a new wave of people who don't want stuff weighing them down as they consume experiences. Now, there is a question of cause-and-effect here: did lack of jobs/income/savings create a culture of underachievement in which the only solace is jumping from experience to experience and figuring out your finances later, or is the consumption of experience the ulterior motive and the bare minimum of employment and possession are achieved to allow it? </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>If you want it short and sweet, here it is: Ronald Reagan happened, that's why.  Since the election of Reagan, the conservative efforts to shift wealth away from the middle class have taken innumerable forms, but what they all add up to is what you are asking about.  The middle class used to live well, and yes college tuition costs were very reasonable until the 1980s, but so was just about everything else.  And more importantly, it was possible to buy a home, a car, and live comfortably on a middle class income.  Corporations today hire &quot;part time&quot; employees so they don't have to provide medical or dental plans and can pay only close to the minimum wage.  Corporations run the country, and you can thank the Reaganites for that.  Even Democrats like Bill Clinton could see the writing on the wall and adopted similar policies which deregulating the banking industry and so forth.  Essentially, the people to blame are the voters.  <br><br>That's right, the American people in their ignorance voted for flag-waving patriotic nonsense sold to them as &quot;fairness&quot; and &quot;deregulation&quot; for all without realizing what they were doing.  That Reagan and that crowd are still idolized by so many people today is hard to even believe.  He and his crew cut taxes on the rich, raised taxes on the middle class, and almost single-handedly destroyed the middle class dream in America.  <br><br>That Americans are not more outraged that we have such low tax rates on the wealthiest Americans is mind-boggling.  That they aren't outraged that we still don't have a single-payer medical care system for all Americans (like Medicare) is also hard to make sense of.  The basic problem is that Americans are not politically or economically very bright and they believe in a collection of nonsensical ideas about the &quot;free market&quot; whatever the hell that means and &quot;freedom&quot; and other childish homilies without ever bothering to find out what they mean to the politicians spouting this nonsense.  <br><br>The American political system is utterly broken, the two major parties hardly differ in most significant ways, and the old American concern for the poor and willingness to pass around the prosperity to all or most Americans is dead, dead, dead.  It's every man for himself!  Have a nice &quot;millenial&quot; life, kids!  </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>While this is a fantastic question, it isn't one with a simple answer. <br><br>First, you have to decide which side of the house you are on. Is this generation really better off, or worse off? I can find fifty statistics that go both ways on that question alone. <br><br>Second, this has so many variables in it that it is insane. There is no simple answer because there are so many economic factors. (Which also could be endlessly argued based on which numbers and models you prefer to follow)<br><br>The simplest answer I can think of for this is that the baby boomer generation was not a generation of savers, but rather ridiculous spenders for the most part. It allowed the free market to raise prices at a fairly constant rate that outpaced income. With the consumption level as high from the last generation, it creates an interesting problem. The supply for work is miles higher than the demand, so incomes are reducing or stagnating in many fields. Hence, the push for higher education on the current generation. This isn't including changes in companies shifting from guaranteed retirement to provide for yourself and the many other things they are doing to cut current and future costs. <br><br>With that push of higher education, it created an increased demand on colleges. This allows for higher tuition rates. As colleges churn out more and more graduates, the job market continues to stagnate and grow slowly compared to the influx of qualified labor. The students then want to go back to college for more education to pull them out of the labor problem and become more valuable. It's a huge circle, and it really doesn't have a stopping point yet. <br><br>This isn't including the shift in our economy from manufacturing to other goods/services or the second industrial revolution around the corner (Robots). While this isn't exactly the answer you were probably looking for, this is the simplest a person can possibly make it before having to get extremely technical and arguing large amounts of economic theories and data concerning hundreds of aspects of past and present generations. <br><br>There is no way I could cover everything about this so feel free to add more.<br><br>Edit: mixed my supply and demand up when I was talking about employment.

<li>Fiat money, money printing, QE, practically 0% interest rates instead of a sound money policy. The goverment wants inflation to finance their deficit spending. This directly lowers the purchasing power and with that the wealth of people (especially the poor).<br><br>2. Catering to special interest groups. Laws get made that are written by lobby groups for lobby groups. They already operate according to the new regulation.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9Whccunka4" target="_blank">Here is the story by economy Professor Richard D. Wolff</a><br><br>Long story short: Until the 70s, the United States had a constant shortage of labour. They practically eliminated the natives and had vast lands and vast ressources to exploit, so everything grew and grew but there were never enough workers to really make use of <em>all</em> of it.<br><br>This is what forced employers to give the workers a good share of the profits, i.e. the workers received good and ever-growing wages. Because if an employer would not do that, the worker would simply move on and become a farmer or go to one of the booming mining towns.<br><br>This situation is what ended in the 70s. The labour shortage turned into a labour surplus. A labour surplus means that there is systemic unemployment and that not the employers have to compete for the employees anymore, but rather the employees for an employment. This allows employers to pay lower and lower wages. There is a variety of reasons for this:<br><br>1. After WW2 all the other major industrial powers were devastated by the war, so the USA had very little competition.<br><br>2. Women rights movements - they wanted to find real jobs, too.<br><br>3. The owners of businesses (the capitalists) became fed up with having to pay high wages, so they pushed offshoring legislation and &quot;free trade agreements&quot; that allow them to outsource the production to places where the wages are lower.<br><br><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/US_productivity_and_real_wages.jpg" target="_blank">The result: While productivity keeps rising, wages are stagnating</a>. At the same time the inequality of wages is ever-rising, which means that most people actually have <em>less</em> than in the 70s.<br><br>It's really just the normalisation of capitalism. What most people believed to be the intrinsic good of capitalism turned out to be just circumstantial.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

Taxes, utilities, groceries, housing costs, transportation costs, medical costs, education costs. All these companies just keep raising their prices, taking a larger and larger slice of everyone's pie. But few people are raising their employee's pay.<br><br>The net result is everybody borrowing from Peter to pay Paul, getting deeper and deeper in debt. Companies fight like savage dogs with each other over those slices of the pie, but none of them are giving that money back to their employees to prop up the economy at large.<br><br>Cash hoarding is the problem, is what I'm saying. During times of recession and depression, the money doesn't just vanish into thin air. It's being hoarded by a few rich bastards who refuse to give back. And now with controls and regulations slowly being gutted, hoarding is a bigger problem than ever.<br><br>But if these rich bastards let go a little bit, and upped their employee's pay, everybody wins.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Our economy has been based on constantly increasing production of materials and manufactured products. Centralized ownership and the mechanization of agriculture, resource extraction, production and delivery of products has emphasized the reduction of the need for workers. This is especially pronounced in times of war, where men are needed as soldiers and production must be at a maximum and centralized under the control of a few large concerns to streamline delivery to the military. The Roman Empire did this by having mega farms to produce food for its legions with slave labor and the cities were packed with impoverished people willing to join the military. England was only able to build its industrial and military empire when the serfs were forced off the land so that sheep could be raised for wool and the displaced people would become cheap labor for the mills, mines and military.<br>The present crisis of crowded citied, deserted rural regions, and lack of gainful employment in old industries might be an opportunity to return to more human skills to improve the quality and efficiency of our communities like carpentry painting, masonary, plumbing and craftsmanship  and  moving back to traditional smaller towns and simpler ways based on safer, healthier, sustainable agriculture and forestry. We need people to rebuild our cities, towns, villages, farms and restore our natural landscape and wildlands.  This new generation and many of the older would appreciate and probably thrive in creative action rather than be employed in just the gain of more and more wealth, the frustration of a meaningless job or the struggle to survive with any work.  Modern communication and transportation reduce the need to live in a crowded city to gain education, entertainment, interacts with others. And the demand for locally produced food, products, necessities and crafts could provide jobs for many. Many rural towns have homes and farms that could easily be purchased at a fraction of the cost of rent for a small city apartment. I know several people who have left high paying  tech jobs to get some land in the country and become organic farmers, or artisans. A better future is actually possible we must change our perspectives, attitude and goals, and get organized to work for that better world.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Even though I am deeply grateful I don't want to live the same way. My priorities are different, I want to actually enjoy my life. I am an entrepreneur, I am not rich and I am not planning to be one. I just want to have enough money to make a living and to enjoy my life doing the things that I actually like. I enjoy traveling (on budget), I like painting, photography, yoga, running, growing my own food (at least part of it) meeting and listening strangers, discovering places and having worth living experiences. To some people this may sound immature, but it is just a different meaning of life. Life is meant to live it and enjoy it. We should measure it by experiences, knowledge, sensations, not by the amount of things one can own...  </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>1) The baby boomers had the GI Bill which really gave them an upper hand in obtaining a degree, owning a home, etc. (if they were white, anyway). They still have some programs but it is not as good as it was back then and less of the generation is going to turn to the military (Marine buddy of mine). Veterans used to be taken care of and truly honored and respected until about Korea/Vietnam era. Nixon's Watergate, Gulf of Tonkin lie, etc. kind of disillusioned or jaded everyone against being as patriotic.<br>2) The government supported a strong middle class and consumerism as a way to stimulate the economy. They wanted people to buy and spend and sort of ushered in credit. This also meant that they were supportive of good paying jobs for adults with a minimum of a high school education (manufacturing). Businesses have no moved off shore and try to reduce benefits. It's a trend that will continue until places such as Mexico, China, Indonesia, and Cambodia catch up with labor/human rights and make it more expensive for businesses to remain offshore.<br>3) We have messed up our priorities. There was a war on poverty instead of a war on the poor as we have now. To me it means that we are less willing to support people, even if they are deserving of the help.<br>4) With the recession we saw many people lose their jobs. Now as the current generation is coming out of college, people who have been working in x field are now taking those entry level jobs as last resorts as they are more qualified and more desirable candidates. Sort of facing that myself actually, just got my Master's in Public Policy and while I am qualified for many of the positions, there are just older people with more experience applying as well.<br>5) Rising cost of living and inflation have affected the value of the dollar without wages going up in kind. Certain states like NJ have raised their minimum wage and indexed it for inflation, but it is still below what it should be.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There is more than one credible explanation for this phenomenon.<br><br>Liberals will tell you that it is because we do not provide enough support the poor through government services, the minimum wage is too low and has not kept up with inflation, and that we do not provide students with enough support for tuition (with college now essential to compete in the workplace) - often calling for debt forgiveness.<br><br>Conservatives (traditional) will point out that we provide more government services and help than in the past and the lack of support from the government cannot explain the reduced purchasing power of the new generation. Some also blame public education for not preparing new generations with skills appropriate to working in the modern world and the cultural degrading the value of &quot;hard work&quot; and blue collar jobs.<br><br>Libertarian (and Libertarian Conservatives) will tell you that the availability of easy money has created this problem through moral hazard. That is - it is the inflationary practices of the Federal Reserve Bank fueled the housing crisis, the subsequent bailout, and the public programs propping up demand for college education. All of this comes from the creation of new money and the creation of this money degrades the purchase power of the money currently in circulation. Thus, this (at a structural level) discourages savings and encourages unsustainable borrowing and spending. Among other consequences, this means the current generation's ability to purchase homes and cars is greatly diminished.<br><br>Personally, I agree most with the libertarian view, but you will find people who believe all of these basic viewpoints/explanations.

This caused home owners to realize they could charge much more for their houses because it was easier to get a larger loan. This led to a market bubble. This bubble burst in 2008. The media has been lying about a phony recovery ever since. The cost of living is MUCH higher than it used to be. The raise in minimum wage hasnt kept up with the cost of living increases we have experienced in recent times... I think the banks set this whole thing up because they knew people would take advantage of this...

Obamacare is another example - requiring small businesses to provide insurance to employees slows down the growth of the company and job creation.  Another example, Underfunded pensions at the local, state and federal level of government.  Baby boomers are starting to retire and there is not enough money to pay their pension.  That debt will become the responsibility of millennial's.  They are going to see their taxes increase drastically at the local, state, and federal level in the very near future to cover this liability, add in the underfunding of Social Security and Medicare and the mess gets even bigger.  We are going to see a massive transfer of wealth from the generation with the least amount of wealth (millennial's) to the generation with the most wealth (baby boomers).  This is going to have the biggest impact (along with student loan debt) on the decreased lifestyle of millennial's vs boomers.  This is going to make it more difficult for them to own a home, car, etc.  The money they make will be taken and given to their parents generation.<br><br>6) College/education - as others have said, the dramatic increase in the cost of education and the cost of student loans are having a major impact on millennial's.  But the other thing I haven't seen mentioned here is the number of people getting degree's vs the number of jobs requiring degrees.  &quot;Everybody needs to go to college&quot; is not going to work out for the majority of college degreed people.  The number of professional jobs that require college degrees has stayed steady over the last 30 years at ~33-35%.  However, about 65-70% of millennials have at least some college (along with debt).  Having more people with degree's does not increase the number of professional (higher paying) jobs.  That number will stay about the same.  So about 1/3 of millennial's will not be getting that higher paying job they were told their whole life would be waiting for them.<br><br>The other thing is the millennial generation is undereducated compared to previous generations.  The academic standards have been lower and less has been expected of them regarding skills and knowledge (this is K-college).  For example, I have seen several polls/articles discussing how only ~ 1/3 of millenial's can name the 3 branches of the government and far too many of them have to use the calculator on their phone to muliply 12 times 6.  Another example in the lowering of standards is how college students today write 'group papers&quot; and take multiple choice test.  Previous generations were required to write their own papers and took test using blue books instead of scantrons.  More was expected of my generation than today.  I don't blame millennial's for this - they don't know what they don't know.  I blame their parents generation - who did and do know.  <br><br>7) corporate cronyism.  I know this has become a cliche thing to say but it is true and both parties in the US are guilty of it.  corporations buy favor with politicians to create legislation that protect their turf and eliminate and/or minimize competition.  This is usually done in the form of government regulations, but also done through 'earmarking&quot;.  Earmarking is a procedure congressmen and senators use to &quot;earmark' funds for a particular company or industry.  funneling taxpayer money and passing protectionist laws makes it more difficult/too expensive for small businesses to compete.  And as I stated above, about 70% of new jobs are created by small business. Fewer small businesses being created = fewer jobs being created = fewer good paying jobs for millennials.<br><br>There are many variables playing a part in why millennials will be poorer than their parents and I feel bad for them.  They have been told their whole life - &quot;jump through all these hoops and you will have the winning ticket at the end&quot; and it just isn't going to work out that way for many them.  You are also going to start seeing the biggest divide in wealth among upper and lower middle class.  Most millennials are upset/disappointed 20-somethings....wait until they get into their 30's are start realizing the shitty deal they have been handed.  I suspect it is going to get ugly real fast.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Back then there wore 3 major things that you needed to spend money on: car, house, food. Now there are a lot more: Internet (for some the internet is a 100 $ bill or more): mobile devices, laptops, pc's, digital cameras - most of you if you look around you will have about 4000 $ worth of devices, that most will be replaced within a year or 2. <br><br>Back then people did not have Internet and didn't see what they wore missing so they would feel a lot less social competition.

<li>We live in a dual-income generation.  In order to have a middle class life, most families require two incomes.  This is new to the last 20 years.<br><br>2. Education costs have skyrocketted. Most people are saddled by debt for the first years of their life.  More people are going to university too, to get this debt. <br><br>3. Early marriage rates have plummetted - few get married in their early 20s anymore.  Weddings used to be a source of early income to get you on your feet.  Not a winfall, but enough to get you that first downpayment.<br><br>4. Well educated jobs don't pay enough to make the education investment worth it.  When graduates were scarce, the investment on a university education made sense - invest 20K (at the time) on a degree, get a job that pays double what a non-degree earner makes.  Now, since everybody has a degree, there's virtually no advantage to having one.  You only get it to not &quot;not have one&quot;.  <br><br>5. People spend way more today on useless shit.<br><br>6. Basic expenses have gone way the fuck up (gas used to be how much???).<br><br>7. People have no discipline.  They'd rather spend it than save it.<br></li>

Being able to afford college on a normal minimum wage job is no longer applicable. <br><br>Members of Congress refuse to see any kind of minimum wage increase because of reasons. Now add to the fact that a lot of colleges have higher and higher tuition costs every year, to say nothing of the costs of other things like books, transportation, housing, etc. <br><br>So, college prices are up, wages are down or stagnate. This means you either go to college and get saddled with a shit ton of debt that makes purchasing other expensive items difficult to do, ooooor you don't go to college and make a very low wage and still won't be able to purchase expensive items (car, house, etc). <br><br>Essentially this all boils down to the fact that the rich want to stay rich, and the rest of us can just go fuck ourselves. Businesses want to make the most money they can, so CEO wages continue to outpace normal wages by something like 500 to 1. <br><br>This kind of inequality cannot last, and I'd love for someone to show an example of a society where it did. <br><br>Watch this video:<br><br><a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_hanauer_beware_fellow_plutocrats_the_pitchforks_are_coming?language=en" target="_blank">https://www.ted.com/talks/nick_hanauer_beware_fellow_plutocrats_the_pitchforks_are_coming?language=en</a></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I believe that millenials (I am included in this) don't value ownership of property as much as those that came before us. Because the infrastructure and living standard of Americans has risen so much the past 20-30 years, we don't need to value them as much. <br><br>If you live in one of the countries major metropolitan areas, chances are you don't need a car. You can take public transit and ride sharing and short term car rentals have become a huge deal. <br><br>So far as housing, I believe that young Americans value mobility over ownership, and we value proximity to our obligations as well. Again, if you live in a major metro, you're not actually owning property in the city unless you're filthy rich (this goes for everyone). So your options are rent in the city, which although expensive gives you a diversity of options, or you own property outside the city. It is much more difficult to sell a home than to cut and run from a lease, and as more people are moving based on work opportunities alone, the ability to move freely is absolutely critical and reassuring to a lot of people.<br><br>That's my non-professional, non-cited take on it anyway.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>On the owning a house bit I got it explained to me this way; ages ago, people were fewer and it wasn't uncommon for a single person to own large acres of land. As this first family patriach died he subdivided the land among his children (used to be sons only back in the day) and they in turn passed down their inherited piece among their children and so on and so forth until, finally, the land was so subdivided and cut that it became too small to be put to logical use. So lets say this land size-threshold was met when your father inherited the land from your Grand-dad. Your dad sees that he'd be much better off selling that small piece of land and moving into a rental house/apartment or mortaging a house (sometimes the land isn't even that small but greed for money effectively blinds one). So puff in a jiffy years of historical ancestral land goes down the drain and is converted into a mall or something until by and by your entire extended family now has no land to lay claim to. Only apartments and individual houses. You caught on the unfortunate end of it all have nothing to inherit in terms of land- Your family already lives in an apartment/rental/mortaged hse. So when you move out you have no choice but to start looking for a rental or crash at a friends house or something whereas back in the day your dad would just section off a tract of land from his large farm and point you in the general direction. Lack of this effectively creates this relative 'poverty' that you talk about facing todays youth.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>cost of education massively increased, everyone needs an education to even work a shitty job these days, wages have stagnated as inflation brings the value of our money down.  from a big picture perspective, wars and investment in mililtary, political wasting of money on so much shit has basically destroyed our chance of recovering our economy.  mostly its the student loan debt, which totals more than credit card debt in our country.  our parents basically went to college for free with very little competition, came out making money and were able to get huge loans to buy houses and cars.  our generation had to do as much schooling as many of our parents by the time we hit senior year of high school, then had to compete to get into college to get massive student loans that totaled more per year than our parents had to pay for their entire education and housing.  maybe that is why?</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Despite making several times the median income where I live, I bought the smallest cheapest house I could find for cash, because debt is toxic to life.<br><br>I have no idea what millennials in your area are doing, I can only speak for the tiny group I know, but they don't want the things people think people are supposed to want.

You are in fact the one that signed the loan papers. Yes , you could have went to a two year college then transferred to a good 4 year university for substantially less. Instead, you opted for 4 years , out of state and wonder why you are in so much debt. Secondly, you chose your degree. If an BA in basket weaving isn't netting you the 6 figures you wanted, then there is an issue. <br><br>Alternatively, having worked in the office environment for 10 years, I can tell you from  interviewing them, they are LAZY and unmotivated. They grew up being coddled and cannot fend for themselves. To top it off , they want more and more for doing less. A recent experiment was let go at our office for asking , &quot;when do I get do to something cool? &quot; That was on his first day. Anyone in the office environment will agree.<br><br>Lastly, stop being brainwashed that college is necessary. I don't have a degree and neither do most of my peers. One guy didn't graduate highschool. We all make 6 figures +. Get your foot in the door and BUST YOUr ASS. You will start out doing a BS job, but rock it out and you will be promoted. <br><br>It's about initiative. Go out and get what you want. Shit will not be handed to you on a plate.

And frankly I'm scared for my future, because with high school graduation coming up, I'll have choices to make. At this point in the US, you either don't go to college and don't make enough to survive well, or you go to college and then use all of your money you make at a high-end job to pay off the debt of getting the education required to obtain that job.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I havent seen anyone mention this yet. Healthcare costs, so think of this, for the last 20 years the cost of healthcare has been rising around 8% or something, much faster than the rate of inflation. For most people their employers pays around 3/4 of the healthcare costs, which means that every single year the cost of keeping that one employee continues to rise while that employee doesn't actually any more money. In my reasoning a big part of why wages have been stagnant is because that extra money, amounting to thousands of dollars a year for an average employee is instead being spend on healthcare. <br><br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I believe that the millennial generation's parents were probably just as poor. The 1980s saw a boon in consumer credit even in the wake of a recession. The credit card created a shopping culture which allowed families to excessively spend on consumer goods. <br><br>Then families mortgaged homes, made minimum monthly payments and continued to quench their thirst for consumer goods until their credit debt crept in on the remainder of their disposable income. They took out second mortgages or sold their homes to address their blistering credit. Then they'd simply repeat the process while passing the debt to their children upon death.<br><br>The idea of passing property to the next generation is no longer a priority in American society. Each generation starts off fresh with no direction. They're going to rent an apartment for the rest of their lives and inherit the debts of their fathers. They will continue to be absolutely terrible with their money and even more horrible when it comes to credit. They'll have children who will do the same.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Those very same parents and older people saying that &quot;In my generation...&quot; usually followed up with some great qualities about work ethic and jobs about their generation. Like &quot;in my generation we got a job after school and moved out of our parents house.&quot; Except they forget that their generation shipped jobs overseas. They held the positions at colleges and banks allowing the cost of college and loans to soar. They were the politicians who allowed companies to create loopholes to avoid taxes and ship jobs overseas. They sent jobs overseas. They created the housing bubble and it's ensuing economic recession from bursting. They are the generation who hold banking jobs that are under regulated. <br><br>Whenever I hear someone say something about people my age and how &quot;in their generation...&quot; I just want to strangle them. There is a reason that the prospects for owning a home seem unlikely for millenials, it's because a lot of us graduate college with a mortgage thanks to our soaring costs to go to college. Yet to get any decent job in many industries these days a college degree is required. Then they have the nerve to say that you should go to college for something worthwhile. Yea, but even those worthwhile degrees don't guarantee you the ability to start paying your student loans back when you graduate. Then buying a home/car is difficult because even if you had a credit card in college and were responsible with it, you have a lot of student loan debt which doesn't help your credit.<br><br>The problem is we were told our whole lives to study hard, go to school, and get a good job. Yet each step of the way the older generation has done everything they can to make it increasingly difficult to do so. We have done what you taught us. Yet now we graduate college with few job prospects, a lifetime of debt, and criticism from the older generation because some how that's our fault.

Alot of older people I know (my parents age) were forced to get jobs at 14 and all that nonsense.

I'm tail end of Gen X but I have a millennial sister.  I've heard her generation called &quot;entitled&quot; a lot.

I never really gave it much thought until the other day when my mother brought up how everyone knows that millennials are over-entitled.<br><br>I was really surprised she was say something so obviously dumb, when millennials are the most screwed over generation in over a century.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The millenials have a lot of unique traits.  I have actually been working on a project team to determine how our company can adapt to millenials and position ourselves for success.<br><br>I have not seen such a bleak prediction as in the OP (that millenials will never own a house or a car).  That seems like some serious fear mongering.  There are actually a lot of reasons that millenials are going to be okay.  Namely that baby boomers are retiring at a rate of 7,000 per <em>day</em>.  And generation X is less than half the size of the baby boomers so they can't fill the voids.  The millenials are about <em>three</em> times larger than Gen X.  So a lot of then are going to get fast tracked.<br><br>The millenials that &quot;play ball&quot;, strive to learn, and to assimilate to corporate culture... they are going to find a lot of opportunities.  And the millenials that don't...will be working for the ones that do.<br><br>So things aren't as bad as OP suggests...but things <em>are</em> harder than they were for previous generations.  So to answer the question..why?  I think there are a few things.  First of all, money is more concentrated into fewer hands than ever before.  So there is more people fighting for a smaller pie.  <br><br>The other big thing is attitude.  There has been a major attitude shift with the millenials.  The millenials have been raised being told &quot;you can be anything you want&quot;, to &quot;do what you love&quot;, and &quot;you are a special person&quot;, to &quot;work with your brain and not with your back&quot;, etc.<br><br>So that is exactly what they have done.  Everyone thinks they are unique and special and that they deserve to have their dream job.  No one wants to do physical work.  Everyone wants to make a great living right away and no one wants to work up to it.<br><br>And this is particularly a problem right now because loyalty is at an all time low.  Employees a less loyal to employers than ever and are willing to move from job to job.  And employers are less loyal to employees than ever.  They are willing to lay people off, slash benefits, freeze merit increases, etc just to save a few extra dollars.<br><br>All of these things push wages down.  And this is why money has been concentrated into fewer hands.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The problem is, things are different now. People shell out for degrees, expecting it to earn them a job, in spite of the fact that a degree proves NOTHING on whether or not you actually know <em>anything at all</em>.  <br><br>I'm a melinnial. I have no education to speak of. No high school diploma, no college education. I'm 24, make 86k a year, have a house, own a car and 4 motorcycles. I'm an IT security architect. Yes I know, I'm underpaid, which is why I'm currently in several interviews across the US for a more appropriate salary. I started my career when I was 19. The thing is, most people don't realize you do NOT need a degree. They're worthless. Employers do NOT care about them, and if they do, lie about them. If you're actually knowledgeable about your field they won't even question whether or not you have a degree.  <br><br>How many computer programmers do you know that have degrees in completely unrelated fields? Or none at all? So many times I've interviewed people with masters or BS degrees in information technology, yet they have NO IDEA what a <em>protocol analyzer</em> is, of all things - or they can't even walk through a simple data structure. <br><br>The quesrion isn't whether or not to get a degree. It's how well you've actually educated yourself in the field. Unlike some of you computer science students on Reddit, when is the last time you actually sat down and learned something useful? What you learn in degree courses in almost every field is considered common knowledge in the field. They want to know that you have knowledge about the <em>specifics</em> of the job you're applying for. The most an employer will ever say about a degree these days is something along the lines of &quot;cool story bro.&quot;  <br><br>If you want a job somewhere, study on your own terms for it. Find an entry level position, and read between the lines in the job description for what they're <em>really</em> looking for. Just because it says they're looking for a degree with 5 year experience doesn't mean they'll take people based on that alone. They want someone that can do the work. Lie on the resume, tailor it specifically to the position you're applying to. You're fighting for the position. <em>Always cheat, always win</em>. If you know they'll be asking about access control lists or something in the interview, read up about them in the days or weeks leading up to it. You want to be able to answer every question they send your way. You'll get the job. Since it's entry level by the time you're 2 years in you'll be able to afford the proper certificates or credentials and jump to a better position. You'll learn on the job as you go. Never stop studying.  </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>If we're looking at real (inflation-adjusted) wages in the US, it is true that income growth has been more or less stagnant for the median income household over the past few decades.  However, this may not be a great measure for comparing the relative well-being between the millenials vs. say, the boomers.  Mainly because the price indexes that we use to adjust for inflation have changed quite a bit in their composition.  What households tended to buy in the 1950s-1960s is very different than what millenials buy today.  People tend to substitute towards higher quality, less expensive goods over time and this results in most price indexes tending to over-state actual inflation (especially over very long periods of time such as a few decades).  So using wages adjusted by a price index to compare quality of life isn't actually all that fair.  Millenials may actually be better off if we appropriately account for overall quality of life.<br><br>With respect to home and car ownership, the trend for young people in the US has been moving toward 1).living in urban areas, 2). getting more education, and 3). delaying getting married.  All three of these things mean that, if you are comparing a 20-something millenial to a 20-something boomer back in the day, a millenial is less likely to have made those big life purchases at the same age as his or her parents.  However, I am not sure that this means millenials are worse off.  It's just a different lifestyle.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There are a lot of factors at play and other posters have brought up good ones, but many people seem to forget that today, we spend a lot more money on a lot more things than they did. The following points are meant to supplement, not replace, the other answers you see here. <br><br>How often do you go to the bar with friends? Odds are your parents didn't go out as much as you. <br><br>What kind of computer do you own? Did your parents spend money on that?<br><br>What kind of phone do you own and how much do you spend per month on it? Did your parents have these expenses?<br><br>How often do you travel? How often did your parents get on an airplane? <br><br>Odds are you have a lot more things and do a lot more things than your parents did. Owning a car just isn't your priority when most bus systems are so much better now than they were 30 years ago. <br><br>As for owning a home, if you don't live in a major city, they are typically still affordable on a good paying job. If you do live in a major city (e.g. New York City), remember that no city in the world 30 years ago had the same demand so of course the prices have changed considerably. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WADemosthenes" target="_blank">WADemosthenes</a>
		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I can speculate 4 specific reasons for our poor generation.<br><br>1. <strong>Globalization</strong>:<br>There is <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/17/aid-trade-reduce-acute-poverty" target="_blank">less poverty now than ever</a> as wealth is more spread around the world. Technology as increased efficiency and productivity in so many industries that communication and travel are much less expensive. Other labor markets are able to compete with ours because of cheap shipping. Developing economies are able to compete better. As the world gets more connected, those in developed countries get exposed to the cultures of those in less developed countries. This fosters empathy, and richer countries are less inclined to take advantage of poorer counties. Many developed nations spend billions on foreign aid every year, and even war is on the decline. These are all very good things, but they do take potential increases in wages from our middle class in developed nations.<br><br>3. <strong>Economic Power</strong>: Those with more money have the power to hold on to what they have, and can more easily make more. As long as nothing gets shaken up, money in a capitalist society will concentrate at the top over time, and we've had quite a stable situation for the last few decades. <em>Why is this?</em> It takes a certain amount of money to stay alive, and a certain amount of money to protect against inevitable catastrophes. Once you have more than this amount, you can use money to make money. The power of this excess money increases exponentially the more you have. Those who have more than this amount tend to make more, and those below tend to stay where they are at.<br><br>2. <strong>Political Power Shift</strong>: As political institutions age, they often become easier to manipulate. Many industries have a strong lobby expansive control over politics. Many large corporations pay very minimal taxes, and investors pay less taxes than wage earners. There really is no lobby for middle class wage earners, and a lot of what happens in politics ends us being either some sort of pandering to a large population of voters, or actual changes that usually only effect the rich. There are exceptions of course, and many in politics are trying to do something good. I think a lot of good things happen, but what I describe above also happens all the time.<br><br>4. <strong>Generational Differences</strong>: This may be a small effect, but I think it's worth mentioning. Baby boomers are seen as more financially successful, selfish, and special. Millennials, on the other hand, are seen as caring about money less, idealist, and lazy. If there is some truth to these cultural definitions, it would make sense that boomers would be richer. At the same time, it's possible that the economic situation millenials find themselves in contributes to their identity, and not the other way around.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Yes, housecalls by the family doctor were a real thing, and my not-long-out-of-college father paid the doc without noticeable grumbling. One parent could work and earn a good living to support the entire family; the other parent could stay home with the kids. A bottle of soda cost 5 cents. <br><br>What happened began in 1913 with creation of both the Federal Reserve and the national income tax -- two forces that soon were pulling HUGE amounts of wealth from the pockets and bank accounts of productive Americans and shoveling it into the maw of government and connected corporations and individuals. America's needless entry into WWI was possible because of this river of money from the people flowing into Washington. Things have gone downhill from there. By 1933, the Fed had created so much phony money that Franklin &quot;<a href="http://www.pbs.org/childofcamp/history/index.html" target="_blank">Concentration Camp</a>&quot; Roosevelt took the gold from Americans -- up until then, a $20 bill WAS THE SAME AS a one-ounce, $20 gold piece. Silver was later removed from quarters and other small coins in the mid-1960s -- because our Official Counterfeiter, the Fed, had continued to print up money from thin air, making each existing dollar worth less and less. That has continued to the present moment.<br><br>When you take trillions of dollars from the citizens thru force and fraud, and continue doing that non-stop for a century -- spending the money on war, on a &quot;war&quot; to put pot users in prison, on propping up dictators, on creating mass dependency where entrepreneurship and creativity had flourished -- then you can expect that society to become poorer and poorer. Nothing surprising about this.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I have read a lot of comments saying that the price of going to college is the reason why the millennial generation seems to be poor. Let me tell you that it is the laziness/bad choice of major is why the generation seems poorer. Phycology degrees do not get you anywhere anymore so stop majoring in useless degrees (English, sociology, etc.). <br><br>I graduated with a Engineering degree about a year ago. When in school, I saw so many people who where not in a STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) program like Phycology, sociology, English, etc., have good grades but never got a good paying job. I busted my butt in school, limited my partying, studied about 20-30 hours a week plus the time spent in class (~15 hours a week) and graduated with honors. These non STEM majors were alcoholics by the time they finished freshmen orientation and hardly studied (I have friends who were non-STEM majors so I know). These people get $60,000 to $100,000 in debt and then don't get paid anything once they graduate. Through academic scholarships (again I busted my butt for them) I came out of school with around $18,000 in student loans (I was in school for 5.5 years, so not bad) and bought a new car three months after graduation. Even with bad grades, engineers still come out of school making $50k to $55k (if you can't live on that then there is something wrong).<br><br>I am sure that you are thinking that I was fed from a silver spoon and that I am probably academically gifted. That's no where close to being accurate. I was raised as a military brat by my single father (military pay is not very much but we still didn't qualify for Financial Aid) and I scored a 910 (English and math) on my SAT (In high school, I thought that I would get a free ride from football and my mentality was &quot;who cares about grades as long as I can play football&quot;). When that didn't follow through I had to change my game plan, I selected a good school and majored in something that I will actually benefit from. I went from a average Joe student in high school with a 910 SAT score to graduating with honors with a degree in engineering. <br><br>I see that the millennial generation appears to be poorer than the generations before and its due to one thing, laziness. Yeah going to school is expensive and the prices continue to go up but you can get a college education for free if you try. Going to college is not like high school where you put in 20 hours a week, its a full time job where it is expected of you to work over the standard 40 hours work week. Our generation has to stop being lazy and apply yourself to something that will benefit you in the long. It is bad that universities still offer these non-stem majors knowing that their students will not live a comfortable life. <br><br>Its all about the money I guess.<br>My favorite quote: &quot;Money doesn't buy you happiness&quot; this may be true but the thing you buy with your money will make you happy...</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There are obviously a bunch of reasons, but one that hasn't been mentioned here is consolidation. Companies need to increase the amount of money they make to keep stockholders happy. However, at a certain point you end up spending more money fighting for market share than you make. So it makes more sense to buy another company and add their markets to yours. Do that 10 times, and you have a huge company, with a lot of extra employees. So you cut them to increase margins. Now there are fewer middle management (collage grad) jobs. Now that there's only one big company, a lot of the other extra jobs, like say outside advertising, no longer are required. So that business is gone too, and those jobs.<br><br>Another is the 5 year investment approach for equity capital companies. They want to make their money back fast. And they want to make a lot of it. So they cut important employees and adjust prices above sustainable levels to make more money, and make the company appear to worth more to the big companies looking to buy I mentioned above. The companies will often fail or become less prosperous after they are sold. Again, less jobs.<br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Plus, we're not just competing against each other, we're also competing against Baby Boomers who, not only are living longer, but didn't save much (as a generalization, I know) for retirement, and many had their retirements hit hard by the recession. While I've heard folk of this generation complain about how far behind they are in tech knowledge and that they're overqualified for a lot of positions, I think many of them are better off in the competition than many of us.<br><br>I <strong>do</strong> think we are are going to be a more flexible generation than the Baby Boomers, kind of similar to the Greatest Generation. (I'm the first to admit, WWII and the Great Depression were way worse than what we've gone through and those folk were/are badasses.) I think we're going to be innovators. Make our own opportunities.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Maybe the fact that, in the population of millennials to attend college, on average students graduated with $30,000 worth of college loan debt. This is predicted the cost the housing market 2 BILLION dollars in 2015 alone. Don't have the figures for the automobile market or things like investments or travel but i'm guessing its not good. Yet no one complains this and you never even hear this criticism because our political economy has become so utterly, shamelessly focused on exploitive capitalism and consumerism that everyone is just &quot;expected&quot; to have money. In my experience most of the kids I went to college with came from pretty darn wealthy families, and I didnt even go to an affluent or prestigious university in any way. (Wonder where all the middle class college students went? Oh right economic data post 2000 shows the middle class is stagnating/shrinking) And apparently no one over the age of 40 can comprehend the flaws of this system, its always &quot;awh shucks back in my day I held down 2 full times jobs, commuted here and there.. blah blah blah.&quot; Well when tuition skyrocketed to around $10,000 a semester(at a cheap school) not including books or living expenses that really hasn't fucking become feasible anymore. So basically graduating with debt has become normative and in 5-10 years when we realize how badly the fucks in washington have raped us we'll be in a crippling recession and it will be way too late to help ourselves. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<a class="author" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/comment_redacted" target="_blank">comment_redacted</a>
		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Several things are going on. <br><br>First, unfortunately millennials began hitting the work force just as the world began to go into its biggest economic crisis since the 1930s. Events such as this will always unfairly effect the more &quot;expendable&quot; workers within the workforce, such as those just starting out because what business is going to be able to hire in those circumstances.  This will eventually correct itself, but it will come at the cost of several years of underemployment for some. <br><br>Second, we now live in a society where it is, relatively speaking, almost a sure thing being able to get a student loan. There are very few rules imposed on universities on how they can use those funds, and so it has basically created limitless demand. This means colleges can just continue to raise rates, build buildings, and do whatever they want pretty much. In turn this pushes much more wealth-destroying debt onto millenials. <br><br>Accompanying this is the fact that universities are not leveling with college students about the workforce. For example, and this is not hyperbole, nearly anyone with a STEM degree of some kind can almost immediately find a job in this country. It's been that way since at least the 1990s. Most medical related degrees see good demand and will for a few more decades. And anything energy, oil, and gas related such as petroleum engineering is in extreme high demand and new hires are able to command salaries in some cases much higher than their tech industry peers. Colleges do students a huge disservice by not telling them this and simply taking their money. There's no incentive for colleges to do that though... Why risk turning someone off from college and losing their money when they can just give people what they want?<br><br>Fourth, and this is due to a few different things going on, millenials don't have the housing wealth that their parents did at the same age. Part of this is due to the recession making it harder to buy a house for the reasons above. Part is due to the recession causing house prices to go down, and therefore home owners net wealth to go down, because overall fewer people can buy houses right now and sellers must drop prices to entice buyers. Part is also cultural... Many millenials who can simply don't want to buy a house right now. Often times that is because they are still single, and marriage is being put off now perhaps into their 30s. This means that what has for past generations been the single largest accumulator of wealth is now being put off maybe a decade, and if you know anything about money you know that time is money and holding onto property for less time means less wealth. <br><br>Finally, I thhink with older millenials who managed to weather the recession and have a good job, many of them were so spooked by the recession pullback on stocks that they aren't infesting. Or, they were investing but when the crash happened they pulled all their money out... Losing about half. If they had simply let it ride within two years they would have been seeing double digit increases year after year. They were young and just didn't really grasp the big picture. You've just got to stick with it and think for the very long term. <br><br>The good news is that anyone can become very wealthy if they just put a set amount into the market and stick with it for a long time. Even someone with an extremely modest income can become a millionaire if they invest. Now granted, it's going to take a long time, decades, but it is possible. Anything big is going to take time. Millenials have had some tough breaks, but they need to dust themselves off and get up and keep going. Maybe that means if you're still in college taking a harder look at what degree or college to go after... Maybe it means saving up and buying a house now or setting up a 401k. If you're living at home, although this can seem bleak, it also means you're basically incurring no expenses... If you can find any employment at all this would be nearly 100% cash flow for you. If you check out /r/personalfinance or /r/financialindependence you'll find posts from many people who are not only making it work, they are totally pulling themselves out of circumstances and rocket-powering their wealth forward. <br><br>Hope this was useful!<br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Lots of reasons honestly. One thing I've personally noticed (besides all of the economic reasons outlined elsewhere in this thread) is a shift in perception of college education by generations.<br><br>For example, it seems more common for pre-Millenials to see college as a place to go to learn a career. For Millenials, it's a place to go after high school. Somewhere along the lines the connection between careers and college degrees seems to have been lost. <br><br>This has lead to a lot of young people getting worthless degrees (in terms of earning potential / job prospects) and then wondering what went wrong. I do chuckle a bit when people in these situations blame their parents, saying &quot;they told me if I went to college I'd get jobs!&quot; Way to take control of your life, pal.<br><br>In my opinion, the responsibilities of the adult world such as ownership of one's own life / decisions and so on are being pushed further and further out. Late teens used to be fairly common for people to feel like adults and make their own decisions, now that seems to be late twenties instead of teens. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>It's not just college education costs.  Previously, you didn't need a computer to communicate - not internet.  You didn't <em>need</em> that smart phone - just a land line.  TV had rabbit ears if you didn't want to pay for cable and the TV itself - I got my first one for $20 at a yard sale.  It was a color TV and had dials.   I managed to hook it up to the VCR I had so I could use the remote to change the channels.  <br><br>Right now, just the internet/tv/phone bill for me is about $250 a month.  I'm one person.  For a family, it goes much higher.  I don't have an outrageous phone plan - just the most basic for the smart phone.  I don't have every channel ever either on the TV - I went with one step above the basic there so I could get HD.  In this day and age, you can't live without Internet so....$250 a month it is.  That $250 includes the outrageous taxes however.  In my county - not just my state but the actual county level- you are charged $25 a month for having a cell phone.  Add on all the state and federal taxes on that and a good 1/4 of my bill is actually taxes.<br><br>Add in the increase in energy costs due to the EPA (not saying it's a good or bad thing, just a fact), increase in water costs (my water just went up again), increase in taxes overall and a mortgage seems way out of the picture for a lot of people.  In the B'more/DC area I live in, it's particularly hard. If you want a decent neighborhood, you are buying the zip code and not the house.   My house is just starting to not be underwater anymore.  However, my property taxes have increased by over $100 a month over the past seven years I've owned the property.  (Try figuring that one out!  My property has lost value but the county wants me to pay more for it.)  Since I live in an HOA that collects their fees plus the taxes, my HOA fee/tax has gone from the already ridiculous $365 a month to $496.   This is just for the HOA/Taxes, not the mortgage.  My house?  543 sq ft.  Somehow, I have two bedrooms and a sewing room out of that.  <br><br>And yes, I'm planning on selling it soon.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

There are a lot more expensive goods that are necessary to functioning in society today that not too long ago didn't exist! Laptops, desktops, cell phones, data plans, game consoles, the list goes on. These goods take away from our disposable income, often regardless of income level. The kid making 25,000 a year probably wants a ps4 and an iphone just as much as the fresh graduate making 60k does, and they are both probably going to buy it.

<li>Increasingly bloated university administration size and salary (ironically the actual pay and benefits of the professors---you know, the people who actually do what the university is ostensibly there for---are decreasing), <br><br>1. Increasingly luxurious facilities (both for students and faculty: hotel-like dorms, $200K conference room tables, pools with lazy rivers and fake beaches, gyms with rock climbing walls, and so on), <br><br>1. Little to no incentive to rein in spending because students can always just take out more loans to pay for the tuition hikes.<br><br>1. Disincentive to change the system because it's very profitable. Student loans are essentially modern indentured servitude. They're risk-free since they they can't be discharged in bankruptcy and in many cases are federally guaranteed, yet they can still charge nearly credit card like rates on them (mine, all federal loans btdubs, are 7%, my lowest credit card is 8.99%, my highest 12.99%). Compare that to something like a mortgage which will only get the lender about 4% right now. Yes, yes, that's secured by a house, but a student loan is secured by a human being's soul. The only way out is death or an injury so crippling you literally cannot be put to any productive labor. Can't find a job? Fine, we'll let you off the hook for awhile and let another 10% accrue to what you already owe. <br><br>Sure, students technically knew what they were getting into here. But (1) 18 year olds aren't exactly the best decision makers. We recognize this in the fact that we don't let other financial predators like casinos take advantage of them until 21, but because at one time student loans were a good thing we don't look at it in the same way we do something like gambling, which has really always been a dumb idea. (2) Most students are highly encouraged by their parents to just fucking do it because when they went to school a degree was worth a lot more in helping you land a job and didn't cost nearly as much, and if they even had loans they were easy to pay off, so they often don't realize how much the calculus has changed. I'm not even necessarily saying college should be free. I just think it's evolved from a bargain struck to a scam for naive children. I wish someone had discouraged me from just going to college and taking out loans to pay for it. I had nearly full tuition scholarships every year, worked 20 hours per week during the school year and full time during the summer and somehow still ended up with substantial loan debt (not as bad as some of my friends, but enough that my payments are more than my rent). And I'm pretty lucky. I actually have a job requiring a college degree and no private loans, so I didn't get completely F-ed in the A.<br><br>TL;DR: Fuck this stupid country.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The problem with this kind of discussion is that people aren't just paid in wages. We should be looking at total compensation.<br><br>It's also important to remember that the portion of compensation that is non-monetary has changed over the years. In 1960 it was 9.9%; today it is 20% on average.<br><br>If your total compensation in 1960 was 10,000, 990 of which paid for healthcare, today with inflation adjusted &quot;stagnation&quot; you'd make 9010 in wages, but now that $9010 is only 80% of your compensation, meaning total compensation must be at least $11262.50, and that's before considering the increased cost of healthcare itself(which for the purposes of this exercise let's assume is all non-monetary compensation).<br><br>So 11262.5-9010=2252.5, but it's tripled after adjusting for inflation, so 6757.50, which added to 9010=$15767.50. Does this mean median compensation is up 57% since then? probably not as not all non-monetary compensation is healthcare, but this is simply an exercise to point out the flaw in ignoring compensation that isn't wages.<br><br>Much of one's increases in wages have been in the form in the increasing cost of benefits. That together with the distortions in real estate and education subsidization have inflating the costs of education and housing in a feedback loop: school is too expensive for some, subsidize them, demand goes up but schools don't expand classrooms commensurately--&gt;price goes up. Before anyone claims that subsidization isn't doing this by pointing to other countries, remember that guaranteed loans from the US government aren't vetted on merit of completing an education like some of those countries limiting who gets said subsidization, but more importantly the amount is not capped, so there's no check on what the college does with the money. They can just buy new fancy dining halls and stadiums to sway youngster to pick their school instead, and just ask for ever higher tuition with the expectation someone will pay it.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A machine or computer can do many jobs that a human had to do fifty years ago. Individuals in areas with lower costs of living can also remotely perform many jobs that were once necessarily local. In addition to having lower costs of living, these individuals often don't care about things like healthcare, job safety, or collective bargaining. These factors disincentivize firms from hiring Western workers. This results in less demand for Western workers.<br><br>While our production has become more efficient and less costly, our (the USA) population has also increased in size. We have less demand for labor and a larger labor supply.<br><br>In an ideal world, our cost of living would reduce to reflect the more efficient production that is possible now. We would also have fewer children or enact labor immigration protections, because we don't have an economy that can sustain an increasing population. Until these issues are addressed, our quality of life will continue to drop and our real wages will continue to drop. <br><br>If these issues aren't addressed, your children will basically be born into servitude. They will have to attend a very expensive college to get a degree to get a very low-paying job. Their monthly expenses (rent, loan payments, insurance, utilities, etc) will not even be payable if your child works three low-paying jobs. Our economic system does not and will not permit low-income people to be born without debt; your choices are to enter into a system where you implicitly accept debt, fight in manufactured wars, or go to prison.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

As someone who has been teaching English in developing countries for a very long time I can't believe just how far a 'reasonable' salary can go in these countries. I'm now in China. When I first came here in 2011 I was on 10,000 RMB a month (nothing in dollars) but with that salary I have a great apartment in the center of a city about 4 hours away from Shanghai in the South-East. Enough money for food, clothes and to enjoy myself. Fast forward to now 2014. I am a co-owner in a private English school catering to trading companies and &quot;vip&quot; high-school kids with an inkling to immigrate or study overseas and I give myself a wage of 13,000 RMB not including my take from the company which both my partner and I keep in the school for expenses for the time being. When I go home (Australia) to visit friends and family I am shocked to see how little my friends can afford on 40-50K a year.. It really is disheartening to see that. <br><br>Everyone in today's generation lives to work.. all my friends are rapidly becoming worker bee drones who work 50-60 hour weeks just to survive.. and that survival is not exactly laden with fun..

That precious hour a day you have to yourself is what keeps you going it's sad.. <br><br>In China their whole culture is based on live to work not work to live, they do not know anything different the average employee we have contracted for 40 hour weeks but most of them do 60.

These things were nice to have things back then and now they are &quot;must haves&quot;.  <br><br>2) College was expensive for me but is much more expensive today.  I I had to pay $4,000 a semester at a public university.  i delivered pizzas and didn't take out any loans.  The living conditions at my college were spartan.  Today, the local university near me (Arizona State) has dorm rooms that are like luxury apartments and the university seems to engage in lot of real estate development instead of trying to deliver a quality education as cheap as possible.  $4,000 wouldn't go far.<br><br>3) The college kids have higher expectations out of life.<br><br>I drove a piece of shit car and I lived in a house with 4 other guys.  I was focused on getting through school, getting a real job, and then maybe meeting someone and getting married.<br><br>ALL of the kids I manage live with their girlfriends, which results in much higher expenses.<br><br>4) They are getting the wrong degrees.<br><br>I work as a computer programmer / web developer.  We have a massive shortage of skilled workers in this country that do that job.  My company pays $70k to guys and girls right out of college to do that job.  We have to import workers from India just to find enough.<br><br>Meanwhile every young unemployed person I meet has degrees in fine arts, communication, massage therapy, culinary arts etc.<br><br>All over town I see massage therapy, art, a cooking schools but not schools teaching computer skills.<br><br>which leads to the really big problem.<br><br>5) It's too easy to get expensive student loans doing careers with terrible job prospects.<br><br>My neighbors kid has a $65,000 student loan to repair motorcycles.  His starting pay was $11 / hour with little chance to make more because that school is graduating lots of students and there are limited jobs repairing motorcycles.<br><br>I know at least four 23 year olds with $100,000+ in loans with fine arts degrees who work as bartenders and are talking about &quot;going back to school&quot;!<br><br>All these for profit schools are killing these kids with these expensive loans.   <br><br>This generation needs to go to school to make more money and this country needs more skilled workers.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>We are basically locked in a battle of generations. The old generation created rules that favor them, not so much by malice, but more likely by incompetence in considering the long term consequences.<br><br>The housing market is a great example, the old generation created loads of restrictions in the creation of new homes, from building height limits, to setting minimum sizes for bathrooms and rooms, land allocation bureaucracies, etc. <br><br>The effect is that few homes are built, and the pace at which new people join society (by being born or migration) is a lot greater. In Sydney for example, in 2012, 11 thousand new homes were built, but 40 thousand people moved to Sydney.<br><br>The end result is that house prices goes through the roof, and the people who happen to own homes already benefit greatly (mostly the older generation)<br><br>Education is another great example, things like tenure, setting high bureaucratic standards for new teachers to join the profession, not allowing technology to replace repetitive work, etc, makes the demand for teachers greater, benefiting the older generation that happens to hold those positions; and making hard for the younger generation to get jobs<br><br>Retirement is another great attack on the younger generation. In most countries, people have the illusion they are contributing to their own retirement... That's not correct.<br><br>They are giving their money to the currently retired generation, and we have to pray that there will be enough of a younger generation to contribute to our retirement.<br><br>But the older generation made some serious mistakes when doing the math on retirement... <br>They supposed that there would be a lot more younger people contributing then there are retirees, but that number is getting close to 1 to 1. They supposed they would only live a few years under retirement, but with the advance of medicine, they live several decades earning our hard won money.<br>They supposed costs for everything would fall, so the money they expected to have would be enough. While that has been true (a car from the 70s costs a lot less now than it costed in the 70s), they didn't realize that they would need to buy the new technologies (which are expensive), mostly in terms of health care, so they raised their own retirement payments (even though they contributed a lot less or not at all), and hoped for the best in terms of where that money would come from.<br><br>Even war is another way the young are used as a tool for the older generation purposes. The government (mostly composed of the elderly) decides when to declare war, but it's the young who are sent to die.<br><br>The question that rises then is: What is the solution?<br><br>I have the impression the young generation has found a very practical solution that works on an individual level: run away.<br><br>I met lots of american students in Germany for example, saying they moved there to study for free, instead of getting 100k+ student loans in the US. But them they end up staying because they got used to the place, found partners, have now lots of friends, found an internship, etc. The end result is that they might never return to the US, and in consequence, make the problem of retirement payments there even worse.<br><br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Lots of people here have given reasonable answers to the question/problem -- everything from being overly coddled to wanting the latest gadgets, spending money on items that only lose value, not saving money, being the cell phone and internet generation with the attention span of a goldfish, a rising population as fewer career-track jobs are available, etc.  All of it is true to an extent.<br><br>But it's a complex problem.  Part of it has to do with the way previous generations sold out our future for their own short term gain, particularly baby boomers.  This generation also largely failed as parents, as did many generation X'ers.  <br><br>Wage stagnation since the 1970s is also a BIG part of the problem, and it has nothing to do with anything millenials did.  <br><br>If you want a more complete picture of how our economy has evolved and why debt and wage stagnation are the new norm, do a YouTube search of Richard Wolff and 'Capitalism Hits the Fan.'</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The radical explosion in economic complexity and sophistication that has occurred through the Hydrocarbon Era is plateauing as the daily production of crude oil stops expanding as fast as it has for the previous 150 years. As the flows of cheap energy that have enabled advanced western lifestyles dwindle, as the price of energy stays high, the modern hydrocarbon-powered economic machine is stalling out, sputtering. The fact the population has exploded to seven billion from just one billion in two hundred years has put vast pressure on natural capital and resources. There is less for each these days. We'll be lucky if we avoid collapse. Be happy with the small things, what you have and can have. Because humans aren't the smartest when it comes to economic planning over the long-term. We let a constant-growth economic system run out of control. Constant-growth based on the flow of a finite energy source, is, at some point, a deeply conflicted economic policy. The generations who came before enjoyed the growth phase of this unique era of radically expanding energy availability that defined the hydrocarbon era. Productivity advances are marginal, can't overcome the bigger trends. Geology trumps technology. your generation gets stuck with the entropic bill, will live through the pollutive effects of the one-time bursting of the hydrocarbon endowment. Sorry 'bout that. Turns out the clever monkeys are not as clever as many think. this era, the hydrocarbon era, is, at the end of the day a single-pulse event of duration one. Basically. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>The 2008 recession annihilated the small amounts of wealth most Millennials (and many, especially younger, Gen X'ers) had managed to accumulate since graduating from college or grad school, wealth they were going to use to buy their first homes. As they were in the first wave to be laid off, long-term under/unemployment consumed those savings.<br><br>If they managed to find a job when the recession ended, post-recession incomes have stagnated while home prices have rebounded and residential rents have gone through the roof (making it even harder to save for a home). <br><br>The relative lack of car ownership seems to be a cultural thing that's been percolating since before the recession rather than something forced by economic necessity (though the two are likely related). <br><br>Edit: on top of that, the younger generations are MUCH more in debt from school than older generations. Paying $500 or more a month on loans for two decades is not unusual. This makes it much harder to save, afford a car, afford a house, etc., a problem compounded by (again) income stagnation.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

But if you are an anti-conspiracy theorist, read on what I mean</strong>.<br><br><strong>ELI5</strong>: after the 40's, the US entered an unprecedented era of prosperity fueled mainly by the ever dropping price of oil. Until we reached peak oil, the price of extracting oil was going down steadily as technology and exploration was finding more and more accessible deposits.<br><br> This, combined with the mentally <strong>retarded</strong> and outright <strong>psychotic</strong> markets' need for &quot;growth&quot; meant that we were coasting on a slight downhill incline all that time. I'm not talking huge numbers here, I'm talking fractions of a percent or maybe a percent or two.<br><br> When peak oil arrived, the free ride was over and we had to get back to reality. All of that easy growth vanished, and all of the things that you see happened. Many people blame outsourcing to india and china without ever wondering <em>why</em> it happened. This is why it happened: the north american economy was used to that gentle down slope.<br><br> The outsourcing phenomenon was simply this in a different form. The slow outsourcing meant that momentarily, companies could show more profit and thus satisfy the market's &quot;growth is a sign of success&quot; mentality.<br><br> Well, eventually, that form of &quot;cheap oil&quot; ran out too and the people that got laid off no longer were able to buy anything.<br><br> And now, here we are. <br><br><br> Really, it is nothing more than resource starvation. <br><br>Funny thing is that this all was predicted in the 60's and 70's.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>My personal opinion: people no longer know how to differentiate between needs and wants. They spend too much of their income on wants thinking they're needs. What we need hasn't changed. A roof over our heads, clothes on our backs and good food in our bellies. The problem is branding and marketing.<br><br>People think we need big houses, fancy clothes and trivial gadgets that we think make our lives easier. Don't get me wrong these things are nice to have. I have many of them myself. But only because I treat myself with them. I focus my goals on paying off the mortgage, stating debt free (we have no major loans and no credit card balances). If I want these toys or gadgets or devices I save for them. I don't buy them until I can afford them and because of that I appreciate them more. My wife is the same way. We take care of our needs first. We save and dream for our wants and get them when we can - not because we want to show off or &quot;keep up with the Joneses&quot;. <br><br>Wants are just that. Wants. And the line between wants and needs is becoming so blurred that people think too many wants are needs and they lose focus of the future. This is what's causing our generation to go into massive amounts of debt and being stuck there. If you can't afford something don't freaking buy it. Learn to live without it and you will truly appreciate it more when you finally do get it - if you even do. Many things I thought I wanted I learned to live without and then didn't care if I had it or not later and then didn't get it and used that money for something I did still want. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>It's because the previous generations took a lot of the benefits, so younger generations have less. For example, take home prices. It is in the older generations for home prices to skyrocket. They make this happen through zoning laws, tax laws, etc. But for our generation, it would be better if housing prices were low. But the older generation make the rules and have the political power. So we get screwed. <br><br>For example, a few decades ago, your parents could've bought a nice home for $80K. Now, it's great for them to sell it to the chinese investors for $800K. But it's fucking awful for you because you can't afford the $800K home which a few decades ago was $80K. <br><br><br>And this doesn't just apply to housing. For pensions, social security, medicare, etc, they created laws that would benefit them greatly at your expense. It was a generational debt bondage. You weren't even born when these laws were made, but you are bonded by them nonetheless. You have to work to subsidize the previous generations because even if they did contribute to these programs, they will take out much more than they put in. So you have to make up that difference. <br><br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

I had friends with rich families , poor families , friends who been arrested countless times , friends who died from drugs . I even have classmates I was some what friendly with who murdered people and ended up on the news . <br><br>Our generation is so fucking lazy and likes to point fingers . From the rich families some of the kids are dead or drug addicts and some of them are making high 6 figures and had houses by the age of 25-30 ( some with some without parents help ) .... The broke family friends is the same many of them are rich , getting rich  and on the other side of the spectrum many of them are fucked ... Blame parents , blame the govt , blame the boss . <br><br>The same denominator keeps popping up in my point of view and the millennials who are doing well all work extra hard , put in a lot of hours , save money , stop fucking around with drugs and bullshit by choice and grew up without having someone baby them... The bums my age all never take responsibility and blame anyone but themselves and can't see that they are lazy .</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I had a giant, multi-paragraph response here with the history of various generations and stuff, but I'm no good at that sort of thing.  <br>I recommend reading <a href="http://www.cracked.com/blog/5-ways-we-ruined-occupy-wall-street-generation/" target="_blank">this</a>, <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/wait-but-why/generation-y-unhappy_b_3930620.html?utm_hp_ref=fb&amp;amp;src=sp&amp;amp;comm_ref=false" target="_blank">this</a>, and <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lea-grover/the-question-that-ruined-generation-y_b_3977056.html" target="_blank">this</a>.  <br>  <br>Long story short, we were told to get educated, that we could do whatever we wanted, that we were special and unique and that we could shoot for the moon and failure would still land us in the stars.  <br>  <br>The reality is, we grew up entitled and care-free.  We were told we were better than waiting tables and flipping burgers and so we dreamed of bigger and better things.  <br>I can only speak to my own experience: I was born in 1990, and while my parents <em>pressured</em> me to get a job and a car and a decent major in college, I didn't get my license until I was 18, I got my first real job in my junior year of college, and I majored in Political Science.  <br>  <br>I can't really blame anyone because at the end of the day those choices were mine to make.  I'm not using my degree at all and I probably never will.  I was lucky and ended up graduating debt-free (my dad served in the Air Force and I lucked into some benefits because of it).  I'm doing alright, I have a full-time job working at the corporate headquarters of Best Buy, and life is ok.  While I am secure right now, I have trouble imagining owning a home.  I own a car, but my girlfriend bought it from a good friend years ago.  I have trouble envisioning being able to afford to take care of future kids.  My girlfriend of 9 years is waiting for a engagement ring (though there are plenty of other reasons why that hasn't happened yet), and I am not sure if we'll be getting engaged anytime soon.  <br>  <br>I just turned 24, and I'm still not sure where I'm headed.  I don't have any big dreams anymore; I was never really able to answer the question &quot;what do you want to be when you grow up?&quot; and that has only gotten more difficult over time.  I'm here, I'm working, I'm paying taxes and taking care of myself, but I have no idea where I'm going.  <br>  <br>  <br>Edit: This ended up being multiple paragraphs anyway...oops.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

The late boomers who came of age in 1980 were just as fucked as the current crop of millennials but nobody ever remembers that anymore. (Go ahead, try buying a house with a 14-17% interest rate.  My brother and his wife worked and saved their asses off to pay 14% on a tiny 2 br / 1 ba house, and no they didn't earn enough for a tax break.)  Some subgroups of millennials will fare better than others and some are doing much better than their agemates right now.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>I am a Gen X'er, born in 1972. I suppose I am an anachronism. I am college educated, single, have a mortgage on a small home, and a car loan on a late model car. I live in Ohio, and have had commutes as long as an hour one way, so there is no way I could live without a car. Until recently, I made more money annually than my father did when he retired. (I just accepted a job for 20-30k less per year than I had previously been making.) While my house is still fairly modest, I paid more for my it new in 2008 than my parent's house was worth after 36+ years of ownership. I think I escaped the stereotype for a few reasons: 1. I managed to graduate without college debt.  I worked and paid as I went, plus a family member worked at my university, so I received substantially discounted tuition the last couple of years. 2. I did have credit card debt when I graduated, as opposed to student loans which normally would be worse, but was able to pay that off a few years after I graduated. 3. I remained (by choice or otherwise,) single, without kids, and usually without a girlfriend on which to spend my money. 4. My family was not particularly good with money, and while we no means poor, I have always been conscious of that and have tried to live within my means. I am very much &quot;debt averse.&quot;<br><br><br>I suspect a large part of the current income disparity has to do with the insane increase in the cost of college tuition over the past 20 years. I seriously have no idea how anyone can afford college anymore. Especially when you potentially spend decades paying it off. I can understand the increasingly common decision to not attend college altogether.<br><br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

That means we get slave labour building the cheap crap. That means that good paying manufacturing jobs go away. What ever anyone tells you about manufacturing not being needed in the new economy they are wrong. Manufacturing and good paying jobs are what brings wealth to the middle class. Paper pushers and desk jockeys do not make anything of value they move imaginary numbers around. That does not create real wealth. Why do you think countries like China, India, Brazil and Mexico are thriving? People are gulible chumps that have gone along with the corporate owned media into believing that a living wage for a factory worker is out of the question if you want to keep buying cheap crap. Well if they aren't paying anyone that isn't in awhile collar job anything more that peanuts where is the trickle down going to come from? The rich just hoard their cash, they aren't out there buying the equivalent amount of consumer goods that the middle class would if their net wealth was spread around to working families with the day to day needs that are required for the non-elite.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Wages are stagnant and the cost of living has gone up. The reason wages have stagnated is because there is a flood of over qualified college graduates in the job market who are desperate enough to accept a job below the pay grade they had set their eyes on and, often, are willing to accept any job outside of their field just to make ends meet. This gives employers much more room to pay less, as there will always be someone willing to take the job. The reason there are so many college graduates in the job market is because it was pounded into our generation that a college education meant a good job, more money abd happiness. the amount of people going to college, combined with the readiness of loan programs willing to help almost anybody do it, colleges everywhere began to skyrocket their tuition prices. Now, we have a whole generation of people with little to no job prospects, a college degree, and a mountain of debt just trying to survive. Buying a decent car and a house get put on the back burner, because it's not smart to add debt onto debt when you're barely making enough money as it is.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>From a blue collar perspective -<br><br>With the blame on the politics, they can only take up so much of the culpability of the problem, for this analogy I'll say 49%. WE are the 51%. <br><br>This generation (and the past 2) have been all about NOW. I went to school with a Japanese kid who lived with his parents, siblings and brother in law in a small three bedroom apartment until he finished high school, then the gen ed at El Camino (local community college), then moved on to UCLA (currently) studying social work, has amazing opportunities lined up for him and will be able to buy cars houses etc. <br><br>BUT he WAITED, he saved, him and his family did not indulge, they chose to take the bus, buy cheap, and have a few pairs of shoes. They had a nice TV but they didn't crave all the things that we do. Think about how much we spend on things that we really could go along without, even used car expenses add up to tens of thousands (gas, insurance, repairs) after a few years. TAKE A BUS. What about clothing? Cheap clothes can last DECADES, when it tears, take a minute and sew it, you don't need a degree to make a stitch. Co-habitate for a while, a LONG while, that will save. Instead of going out every weekend, work on the side, study longer, SAVE SAVE SAVE. We can blame politicians and our parents, but IT DOESNT COME EASY! What are you spending money on this holiday season? What did you buy this summer that you really don't even have or needed? WE are a RICH nation, we just don't realize it and act like we are poor.

I think one answer to that is that as a consumerist culture, we have way more stuff.

That, combined with the different economic era of the time (our parents had more of a manufacturing based economy and thus needed less schooling, one income household was often enough, and they experienced periodic economic booms) where &quot;our generation&quot; has experienced an economy that has shifted causing job loss, and our economic confidence is less rosy).  <br><br>lt;rd/ELI5: I dunno how to do it/I'm lazy, someone else do it:D/Mebbe I explained it like I'm 16<br><br>ReELI5: Timesrdiffern't</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Because the previous generations were so unbelievably stupid in terms of politics, future planning, diversification of jobs that all they cared about was themselves and the present. All companies/councils etc had so much money to throw around in the UK about 10 years ago it was ridiculous, so much bureaucracy and bullshit that created jobs that were not needed.<br><br>These days getting an average office job in the council is difficult even with experience/degree. My brother and his (fairly dumb, iq around 100 at a guess, you know the type who watches reality tv and just talks about her children) wife both have been in the same job for about 10 years now, whilst I dont know exactly what they do I know the general idea and it really is easy typical council work where they REALLY REALLY DONT need a job, typical bureaucracy that created jobs for no reason other than employing someone<br><br>The type of job that I can pick up within a few weeks, they both earn over £35,000 a year in their early 30's whilst having nothing higher than a high school education (which they both didnt do that well at) yet they were born at the right time to be able to get a good paying job in a very stable area.<br><br>I am fairly computer savvy, not programmer savvy but I do a bit of coding and have been messing about with computers since a child and in any job I have ever had I can generally pickup what people over 35 do in a matter of days and normally surpass them like most of the younger generation fairly easily yet its impossible to get a job like that. My brother/s and others his age managed to get good jobs that they now cant get fired from despite being useless, they all have their old contracts get to work 9-5 5 days a week and get regular payrises. Me, I work a shity low hour contract job in a place I hate for a shit wage.<br><br>So many people I work with, some with degrees some with just high school education who are in the 21-28 age group who are very intelligent and know alot more than the people now in their mid 30's who got all the last of the comfortable jobs who just cant catch a break. Sure theer are pletny who do but we are such a wasted generation, we grew up with technology and we learned from it, we are a fairly intelligent generation and have experienced both sides of the modern life that the news kids are born into will never know yet we are a lost generation, so many people working dead end retail jobs with no government help to improve their standing and trying to get into education which so many before enjoyed at a lot less of a cost or didnt even need to get a job is becoming increasingly difficult with extortionate fees and a over saturated market of graduates with bullshit degrees. The baby boomers fucked this world up IMO, so selfish and never thought of the future. SO many lives wasted of my generation due to their parents inability to care about the future, thats the real issue I think, parents not really putting the effort it.<br><br>See the kids these days, all 4 of my nephews participate in about 3-4 sporting activities each week and are made sure they are put through their paces and do their work, study, plan, schedule. I cant recall many people in that situation when I was growing up, only the people from wealthy backgrounds and its not like alot of them things cost money, I just think in general most peoples parents really didnt give a shit.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Alright, let's see. My parents are essentially the youngest of the baby boomers, so let's compare things.<br><br>They both worked shitty jobs while in highschool. McDonalds still sucked back then after all.<br><br>But right after highschool, they both went straight into good work. Mom at a factory, Dad at the phone company, both with $14/hr starting wages and the promise of frequent raises. Both made in the high 20's per hour when they retired, with lots of overtime pay to boot. My dad owned a house when he was only 2-3 years out of highschool. Even more, he was able to take 2 full semesters of college before deciding &quot;eh, this isn't for me&quot;, with no financial burden whatsoever.<br><br>Compare now. That same phone company job now either requires a degree. You can still get the &quot;go out and fix people's internet&quot; job without one, but the pay hasn't gone up in years.<br><br>I myself tried to get factory work for a year or two to pay off college, but the factory has only hired one small group of people in tbe last 3 years. Most people  there have to work through a contract company, getting paid near minimum wage. My entire time there, the pay was $7.50 an hour. I hear they upped it to $8 recently. Still, $8 in 2014 is nowhere near $14 in 1980.<br><br>Then you have the rising cost of education. You now need a degree to get a decent job. The cost of tuition is going up several hundred dollars a year. I'm currently paying 10,000 a semester. When I started 4 years ago, it was closer to $8,600. When my dad went to college, he could easily pay off a semester working full time the summer before, while also paying off a house payment, a car payment, car insurance, utilities, and even having money left over to go out on the weekends.<br><br>Contrast- I have a decent job through my school. Pay is pretty good at $15/hr, which is more than any of my non-college friends make.  The only bill I have to worry about is the school bill, and I'm only taking half of a full course load. That alone is right at half of my paycheck. If I only bought the cheapest bread and peanut butter to make lunch sandwiches, and only spent my money on gas to get to/from work, I could not make enough money to afford a full semester of college.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

We have a little in the bank but live paycheck to paycheck. It's nuts, my wife is very successful. Our jobs in the 80s and 90s would of meant a bigger house and money saved. My advice is don't buy a house. You end working for the things you need to live. And get penalized for making too much money, while not having the ability to save. Don't buy a house, don't buy new cars. I could quit my job and break even with what the state and feds will give us in taxes and other benefits.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Ha ha. I posted a response here saying that Millennials didn't actually have it bad, they were just whiners. No one opposed my point of view with any facts or coherent argument. Instead, my comments got downvoted into oblivion. <br><br>THAT is the problem. Rather than hear the truth, some here would rather just pretend that it doesn't exist. They're not the 'millennial generation', they're the 'overly coddled' generation. Their failures have been whitewashed by teachers and parents all their lives, in fear of hurting their delicate little feelings. They have no idea how to take and use criticism, and as a result they never learned how to work hard or solve their own problems. They'll blame everything around themselves rather than take responsibility. And they'll be fucked, because in the real world, Mommy won't always be there to wipe their asses when they cry. They'll cry and they'll cry and they'll cry. But Mommy isn't coming any more. Welcome to the real world, Millennials.<br><br>Of course, I could change my mind if some Millennial proved me wrong. I would welcome that. <br><br>First, show me solid evidence that the Millennial generation is 'much poorer than those of their parents' [when the parents were the same age, of course]. I suspect that Millennials have average higher incomes at this stage of their lives, even adjusted for inflation. Definitely the quality of life is better.<br><br>Second, I am not sure that Millennials have lower home ownership for their age than previous generations. Someone show me data.<br><br>Third, Explain to me why home and car ownership is a true measure of wealth rather than simply a lifestyle choice that reflects increased urbanization. Why not use cell phone ownership as a measure of wealth? Or access to the internet? Or college education? All those things are way higher for Millennials compared to any previous generation.<br><br>Of course, no Millennials will take up my challenge, because most of those babies got upset by the end of my first paragraph, downvoted me, and stopped reading. And the few who managed to read this far no doubt balked at the fact that actual <em>work</em> would be required to refute my opinion, and gave up.<br><br>Am I right? <br><br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>This isn't directly related, but working in a retail type job I have some input on what big corporations will do.<br><br>I work at a movie theater owned and operated by Carmike Cinemas. <br><br>At movie theaters, depending on when you open, you generally have 4 major rushes of customers. Usually at around 12, 4, 7, and 10. Friday and Saturdays will almost always be busy, and Sundays can be iffy.<br><br>Carmike actively monitors how much money you are making vs how many employees you have working.  <br><br>Sometimes if your theater is slow earlier in the day, the theater managers will be forced to cut shifts from employees not only early in the day, but also later in the day, despite not knowing how busy they will be later.<br><br>This means that if the theater does get busy, you now have less workers, long lines, and angry customers. But the customers aren't going to leave. Movie theaters generally aren't super close together. Maybe people drove from two different locations to get there.<br><br>So they'll sit there, be angry, yell at the people who are doing their best to get through the lines, and the corporation gets even more money because workers were cut that probably should have been working.<br><br>They don't really give a Damn about their employees or their customers, as long as they can keep making money off of people.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>There has been a revolution in this country over the last 40-50 years. Before that the country had been on course for increasing incomes, pensions, low cost education for all, more income equality and generally broader support for improved quality of life for citizens. Instead, the philosophy that no one owes anyone anything has been sold. And the argument against anyone protesting this philosophy is that it is your own fault. You have not worked hard enough so stop blaming anything or anyone for your problems. You can read this philosophy expressed everywhere here on Reddit and in the media. It is ascendant and because of the complimentary recent developments of one dollar one vote it will probably stay that way in the US without changes. <br><br>Interestingly, the supposed selling point for this philosophy is that individualism is the force in opposition to authoritarianism. However, the reality is a reduction in the people's collective power, which in turn leads to the consolidation of power with the government, the wealthy, and corporations. Like many things in politics and economics, it is counter-intuitive. <br> <br>It is really a moral choice for a country to make. We have been convinced of a path that has led to stagnate wages and income inequity -- whether you believe it or not that is the result. Conversely, the rest of the 1st world has generally following America's earlier path. They are societies that spend money to make it easier for people to work and live. The idea is we do owe each other support and that we all benefit when we support each other. </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>2 things happened.<br><br><br> 1. Over the years taxes on the rich where lowered, and allowed to &quot;escape&quot; by loopholes in tax law.<br> This leaves a tremendous amount of wealth out of the economy.<br><br> 2. Moving factory employment overseas destroyed the power of Labor unions, which as a consequence meant that salaries never had the ability to rise with inflation.<br><br>A market economy is like a tug of war with three sides. Every side NEEDS to pull as hard as it can or someone is gonna end faceplanted into the mud.<br><br>Under this system it would be incorrect to always blame the rich (the capital class) for taking the wealth of society, they are just doing what they are supposed to do, pull as HARD AS THEY CAN.<br><br>But the problem is when the worker (Labor) loses their ability to pull equally hard, through powerful labor unions, they are the ones that end up in the mud. And society as a whole will suffer because of it eventually.<br><br>The third side is the Consumer, which needs proper consumer protections to make informed market decisions. (Which product is truly better or cheaper then the other product?)<br><br>So we have a one sided, three way tug of war, where the Investors, the owners, the Capital class has pulled both the other sides into the mud. They get the most protections from the government, they have the most power and freedom in the marketplace. And this upsets the balance of the market. The poor will get poorer and the rich get richer.<br><br>A system like that is called Capitalism. (Because the CAPITAL has an unfair advantage), and is skewered version of the Free Market System.<br><br><strong>So, how come so many people defend Capitalism?</strong><br><br>Again, 2 reasons.<br><br>1. They are misinformed and think that Capitalism = Free Market. This is untrue, but a common misconception.<br><br>2. There are a lot of people that truly believe in Capitalism. <br><br>It's an idea that stems from Feudalism. Where only the High born were allowed to own land. The idea was that the average peasant was not intelligent enough to handle wealth. He would not make informed decisions, and it would ultimately not be beneficent for society to allow lower classes too much wealth.<br><br>This carries over into Capitalism. People genuinely believe that the rich are smarter and better people then the rest of us, and will make better, even altruistic decisions that will ultimately benefit all of us.<br><br>This line of thinking is called Trickle down Economics.      </p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Well, as a millennial, we grew up wanting everything and getting everything. We were the first generation where everyone participated and got trophies and ribbons. So, we lived in a fake world.  Take that sense of self worth (think inflated chimp chest out and I am the king of the world titanic) and then take the fact that wages have gone flat, or down compared to inflation on prices of bare necessities over our lifetime (think one gallon of milk here ... It's almost 5.00 in now for a &quot;premium&quot; brand).<br><br>Then add that we can't save money, invest money, or know what retirement will look like, and our future is bleak. <br><br>Think of a parabola. We are so over the bell curve, and people assume that increasing the minimum wage would fix the problem. <br><br>But increasing wages also causes businesses to, whether needed or not, increase costs too, usually at a close or similar rate. <br><br>And without education on savings, investments, and basic money management, raising wages doesn't automatically decrease debt. <br><br>Now add that we have a mindset that we all need secondary education. And that the costs have gone up at rates even higher than inflation.<br><br>Add that we have students who don't know how to manage money getting school loans. <br><br>Add that school loans can't be forgiven in most bankruptcy. <br><br>Add it all together, costs, wages, debt training, money knowledge, schooling, and we come to the fact that my generation won't see the same American dream as previous generations.<br><br>To fix it, it starts in grade school.  Teaching money management to right year olds. Then in high school. Teach kids the evils and goods of loans, different types, and all the highs and lows. Teach kids how to invest in their future. <br><br>And hopefully these kids will teach their parents, and our generation as well as theirs can be saved. <br></p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

That's why people seems &quot;poorer&quot;, it's because it's not possible to educate everyone at a high level.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Everyone's answer has been incomplete.  Due to simple political policy, the middle class has been shrinking while wealth has becoming increasingly concentrated to fewer Americans.  In the 70s, the employee to employer ratio was 1:30 where not it is roughly 1:309. This concentrated wealth has resulted in tax policy to only benefit the wealthy creating bigger and bigger wage gaps.  This wasn't felt entirely due to initially, the feminist revolution creating a dual income which allowed stagnant wages to not be economically felt.  Then the housing boom in the Clinton administration helped boost the economy as well.  Combine all this with legislation that showed manufacturing to be moved overseas and the inflation of education ( again due to poorly crafted legislation by wealthy elites).  Basically, the middle class has been under assault in every possible direction starting from the Reagan administration and has steadily been exploited to allow increased wealth inequality.  Let's also take into account that the middle class has largely bared the burden of being in constant state of war, and paying for the housing crash of 08.  There's many more reasons but it all petty much is a result of the richest quintile crafting legislation and letting their effective tax rate.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Then you look at the federal budget for military spending, and it really fucking makes you question what the priorities of the country you were born in are...???</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

In Los Angeles, the median home sale prices is $560k. In Buffalo NY, the median home sale price is $88k.<br><br>The population is growing. New residences have to be built.  There are 100 million more people in the 2010 census than the 1970 census.<br><br>Surburban real estate development is cheap, not as regulated as urban development and for 60 years has been heavily by subsidized by governments.  As a result housing became extremely affordable for our parents. In fact, it still is if you want to live in a smallish city or far away in a suburb.  My brother lives in a city where one could get a 5,000sf newly built mcmansion for several hundred thousand dollars less than a 1,000sf shack in my neighborhood.<br><br>Construction in urban areas will cause noise, sight and traffic annoyances. So NIMBY (&quot;not in my back yard&quot;) policies rule.  In San Francisco, water borders the city on 3 sides. There is almost literally no place to build but up.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>My opinion (which is not based on concrete evidence or data but merely deductive reasoning based on my observations), is that part of the reason why is because our generation are not really studying the right major to get a job in today's economy. Today's economy is more reliant on jobs that require master degrees, such as Geology, or technology jobs, such as programmers and the such. Unless you go to a tech school, I can guarantee you that there aren't enough students learning this skills to keep up with demand. That's why companies are having to import foreigners, and there are actually millions of jobs available. A lot of kids don't know that they should be studying these subjects, or can even afford a college education and graduate school to get these qualifications, due to the much mentioned absurd cost of education nowadays. Obviously this issue has many, many different sides to it, but I believe that if we encourage students more towards these kinds of jobs rather than encouraging them to major in your classic liberal arts degrees, then one of the bigger specific problems that contribute to this will be solved.  </p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Hell, you could switch to a budget cell phone and provider (and stick with it for five or six years, forsaking the new POS smartphones and their $800 price tags), stop smoking, eat out half as much, put all that money directly into paying off the house and be done with it in under a decade.<br><br>This is what our parents and grandparents would have done.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>From the Philippines here, so some of the thigs I say may or may not be applicable to you. There are a lot of reasons:<br><br>1. Placing too high a premium on college education. To get a &quot;good&quot; job here, you need to graduate from a reputable university, with respectable GPA and a pleasing personality. Knowing people on the inside of the company is a massive plus. That said, eith the millions of people graduating every year, damn near everyone has these qualifications. 1000 people could be fighting for the same 10 spots! Take note: the difference in starting salary between a &quot;normal&quot; engineer and an engineer that graduated with honors and topped the board exams is just around $20 a month. If you have a starting salary of $400 a month, you're already considered to be in the big leagues.<br><br>2. Skills gap. There are a lot of opportunities out there, but the mentality that &quot;I have to use my degree or what I studied&quot; is stifling. There is a belief that if you get a carreer that isn't related to your degree, then your degree is a sunk cost, so you go out of your way to find a job with at least a small relation to what you studied, even if the pay is horrible. Working a blue collar or sales job will not even occur to them because it's below them and their pride can't handle that.<br><br>3. When all else fails, go BPO. But then again, even if you swallow your pride and went that route prepare for derision and people saying &quot;what a waste&quot; when referring to your degree.<br><br>These are all partly due to the educational system where you learn absolutely nothing about HOW to hold a job or even just HOW to get paid using your skills, and the terribad economy with corrupt politicians pulling strings. To most people, the only way to make money is to hold a job. They're too afraid of risk to try and venture into Entrepreneurship.</p>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>Regarding the impossibility of house ownership: there was a choice (here in Canada) by almost all levels of government to let the cost of housing increase uncontrollably.<br><br>It began in the 80's by governments de-funding affordable housing programs. This happened just when lots of people were moving into major cities (where the jobs were), and also when the baby boomers were entering the housing market in the greatest numbers. The income tax system was set so capital gains (the amount that your house increases in value from the time you buy it to the time you sell it) are only taxed at half the rate of other forms of income, so it makes property speculation very attractive. Finally, changes to various building codes to make houses safer, healthier and less likely to fall apart (all good things) but made building new, affordable housing much more complicated and basically not profitable. All these changes led to far too little supply and too much demand. Typically a house in Toronto or Vancouver that sold for $20K in the 1960's now sells for $2M, a hundred-fold increase.<br><br>For you free-market thinkers let me point out that most of the factors I've mentioned are the result of public policy, not &quot;the invisible hand&quot;. In most of Europe there is a widely supported perspective which is just the opposite of North America's: people there are prevented by taxes and regulations from making abnormal profits just because they happen to own the place they live in.<br><br>Another way to look at this is that for 50 years there has been an unstated but obvious strategy to transfer wealth from the young to the old, and from the poor to the wealthy. People who already owned property supported this policy because they could use their equity (the ever-increasing value of their houses minus the ever-decreasing amount they owned the bank) to borrow more money and upgrade to even bigger, more expensive houses. This worked great as long as the value of real estate was increasing faster than interest rates (true almost continuously from the early 80's until the crash). People who didn't already own (the young and the poor) saw the amount they need to save as a downpayment go from one or two years of income to 10 or 15 years of income, for the exact same house.</p>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><p>A lot of people aren't even answering your question. The top answer isn't doing that. It's just saying that things cost a lot more. Listen, here, if we're talking about America, every era in American history has had something that provided America with a great deal of money.<br><br>- If we're going way back, America had slaves. They were the greatest trader of slaves, and they lived off the prosperity of slaves.<br><br>- Then came along the industrial revolution, and slaves were gone, and America was great at manufacturing.<br><br>- Then as that kind of wound down, the USA became a huge oil producer. They were the middle east of North America.<br><br>- Then there was the invention of the automobile, and its surge in popularity, with all that cheap oil. America used to be #1 in the automobile industry.<br><br>- Next you have the period, where the USA dominated the skies, with their airplanes, and airlines.<br><br>- Of more recent times came the computer revolution, and the internet boom.<br><br>Now, since other countries have caught up, there's nothing that America is doing really well, other than war. But war doesn't make you money. The lack of prosperity isn't just due to greed. It's also because of the lack of innovation, and sources of income. America is entering a period in its life, where it no longer finds itself the leader of any particular industry.<br><br>That said, it's important for America to invest in education. College/university should definitely be free, if the country wants to be ahead of everyone.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>		<div class="replies-controls">
