		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because it's much cheaper just to give you an adjustable knob. No cost for temperature sensors or automatic adjusters.</p>
<p>Really, the current system is hot water pipe + cold water pipe, and you choose the mixture. Sometimes the hot water is colder due to colder pipes in cold weather, sometimes it's hotter due to someone having recently used the shower before you, sometime the cold water is warmer due to summer heat, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They make them. Pretty expensive but they are out there.</p>
<p>A shower or even a sink for that matter generally works like this:</p>
<p>There are two valves, one hot one cold. The more you turn the knob towards COLD, the cold water valve pushes more water out than than the HOT water valve. Same works for hot water. If you put the knob on HOT, more water will be pushed from the hot water valve than the cold. </p>
<p>When you turn the knob, you're not exactly putting it on a &quot;temperature&quot;; you're adjusting the water pressure between the hot and cold water valves until it feels ideal on your body.</p>
<p>Not really sure how the new thermostatic temperature controls work in a shower but I would imagine they read the temperature of the water as it flows through the valves and automatically adjusts to your desired temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
