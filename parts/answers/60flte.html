		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holy shit! Table salt is amazing! It does two incredibly important things in cooking: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It breaks down and releases sodium when it dissolves in your mouth. The sodium bonds to one of the major flavour receptors in your mouth (i.e. salty flavour). This has a synergistic effect on other foods; particularly savoury flavours (see point 2). </p>
</li>
<li>It draws moisture out of foods, speeding up the caramelisation of sugars/carbohydrates in food. In food chemistry terms, these are called Malliard reactions. In ELI5 terms, it helps foods (particularly meats) brown and give that delicious seared flavour. These seared flavours activate other flavour receptors (particularly umami/savoury receptors, and sweetness receptors). It's like a sensory gang-bang in your mouth. </li>
</ol>
<p>Pepper contains glutamic acid (an umami/savoury flavour) and activates heat sensors in your mouth. It's like a bit of nitro for your taste buds. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fun fact: if you're wanting to add a savory flavor to a dish, and you're already using a lot of salt, add some vinegar. Not a lot, mind you, but it does the same thing for a dish that salt does and accentuates the savory flavors of whatever you're cooking without all of the sodium. I wouldn't use it as a replacement of salt, but when salt just isn't doing everything you want it to do. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt chemically activates your sense of taste. It basically amplifies any other flavor in a dish. </p>
<p>Not entirely sure about pepper, other than adding a savory component. It may just be culturally expected</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Salt is the easier answer, as others have mentioned. It just kind of makes flavors bigger and bolder by its chemical nature.</p>
<p>Black pepper is more complicated and the short answer is simply that it's a spice we've become accustomed to having in our food that is complementary to a lot of savory foods.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's probably a good combination of 20 reasons why these two seasonings are often used. They all come down to versatility, shelf-life and taste.</p>
<p>They are so easy to use that even amateurs can add these spices to a dish without making a mistake. When you're cooking on the stove top or oven, it's usually meats, cheeses, breads, vegetables, which salt and pepper go well with. Most other spices require some balancing to make sure they're not conflicting with something else. You can't put cumin or cinnamon on anything and come out with a well-balanced meal.</p>
<p>Salt has been historically used to preserve foods, most importantly meats. Without refrigeration meat is only good for a day--without seriously risking bacterial and parasitic infection. Even with refrigeration they don't last longer than a week or two. Through drying, curing, smoking meats, they will last months longer, perhaps even years. All of these processes work better with salt. If you live in an older society that doesn't understand &quot;germs&quot; but you can preserve meats and vegetables much longer, you'll see why it's always been extremely important and sought after. It also never spoils, if preserved correctly.</p>
<p>Pepper also has a long shelf-life. Granted, freshly cracked pepper is a thousand times better, whole peppercorns are still good for 4 years. When they've been cracked, they will slowly lose that flavor, but they still retain a lot of flavor compared to dried herbs. Some dried herbs don't have a lot of flavor even when done correctly (parsley, cilantro) and others will lose their flavor in about a year.</p>
<p>They also go together in most styles of cooking. It might not be traditional to use them in any cuisine, but they work well in almost any country's savory, cooked foods. Most spice blends will have salt and a lot also contain pepper.</p>
<p>I think these reasons kind of sum up why they get added to just about every recipe. And once it's become popular to do so, more recipe writers just end up throwing it on there without thinking twice. They almost always enhance cooked, savory food with very few downsides.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
