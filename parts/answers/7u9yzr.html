<p>Light that passes through the Earth’s atmosphere that doesn’t hit the surface will be bent around the curvature of the Earth by refraction and leave the atmosphere at a different angle.</p>
<p>Here’s a decent diagram demonstrating this:</p>

The red color is caused by scattering in the atmosphere, as explained by others. That red light is bright enough to illuminate the Moon so that it is still visible from Earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As mentioned, it's light refracting and scattering around the edge of the Earth that hits the otherwise-shadowed Moon. </p>
<p>Since blue light is scattered much more easily than red light, it's usually only red light that can make the full journey through our atmosphere and end up at the Moon, thus producing the characteristic red color of a lunar eclipse.</p>
<p>However, this also depends a lot on what's going on in the atmosphere at the time - and that will affect the appearance of the eclipsed Moon as measured by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danjon_scale" target="_blank">Danjon scale</a>. If there's relatively clear weather around much of the limb of the Earth as seen from the Moon, a lunar eclipse will take on a bright coppery appearance since lots of light is able to pass through our atmosphere. </p>
<p>On the other hand, after the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883 - which threw tons of ash into the stratosphere - the Moon all but disappeared in the lunar eclipse of 1884. Here's the astronomer W.F. Denning's observation notes:</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The firmament grew as dark as on an ordinary night when the Moon is entirely absent, and but for the indistinct outline of our satellite projected upon the dark background of the sky, there was nothing abnormal in the appearance of the heavens. Small stars could be distinguished with the customary readiness, and the Moon herself, high in the southern sky, looked like a large, ill-defined nebula with indeterminate outlines, or like a planet struggling feebly through a very thick haze.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's the same reason sunsets are a gradual shift from light to red to dark, rather than a sudden switch to darkness. In fact, the red color is itself the cumulative light from all of Earth's sunsets and sunrises reflected off the Moon at once, while the Earth itself blocks the rest of the usual white light from the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
