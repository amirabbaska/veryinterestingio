Today, there is simply the tenuous halt of combat. This is not peace because if provoked either side would gladly restart the fight. </p>
<p>It's like ending an argument with both sides angry. Ending the argument is not peace. Hashing out your differences and becoming friendly towards each other is attaining peace. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an international development/education class I took in grad school, the professor put it like this: there's positive peace and negative peace. Negative peace just means that there isn't an active, armed conflict right this moment. That doesn't necessarily mean that people are secure or that social problems are being dealt with or that the threat of future conflict isn't there. It just means that there aren't bombs exploding around you or soldiers shooting people. Positive peace is when society actively works to solve social ills (which often exacerbate or cause conflict) and people feel secure. </p>
<p>Or to put it another way, it's like being not-sick and being healthy. If you just don't have cancer or pneumonia or the flu right now, that doesn't necessarily mean that you're healthy or there isn't anything medically wrong that could become a worse problem later. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a &quot;peace scientist&quot; we conventionally think of peace in terms of the absence of conflict.  This is largely because we conventionally study the &quot;correlates of war&quot;, or, the factors that lead or do not lead to peace, the most influential factor typically being the regime types of two states.  Consider the democratic peace, which typically holds that two states that are democratic do not go to war with one another. That does not tell you about whether the two states have peaceful relations, but rather, just do not go to war with one another. </p>
<p>Consider the enduring rivalry of India and Pakistan.  While the two states have not gone to war recently, one can hardly call their relationship peaceful.  It is in a stalemate, where truth be told, war could occur at any point in time should the two states determine that commitments they previously agreed to were now not credible.  </p>
<p>Alternatively, consider the relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.  They haven't been at war in a while, but, they've transitioned into a period of positive relations marked by common affinity, partnership, and peacetime military cooperation.   </p>
<p>For an extensive answer, see &quot;The Puzzle of Peace&quot; by Goertz, Diehl, and Balas.  This is a new approach to understanding what we often refer to as &quot;positive peace&quot; (peace) in addition to &quot;negative peace&quot; (peace in absence of war).  In the peace science tradition, we are just revisiting the idea of positive peace, which has largely been neglected since the 1950s and 1960s.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I offer a Christian answer?  Jesus talked about both sides of it.  </p>
<p>In favor of peace, he often talked about living at peace, having peace, and getting that peace from him.  If you believe what he preached and live it, one way to sum it up is to say that you'll have eternal peace because he's made everything right between you and God for all eternity.  So, if all eternity is settled, the little bit of time (in comparison to eternity) you have on Earth should be indicative of that peace and security.  John 16:33 is one verse that relates to this.</p>
<p>But, he also said he didn't come to bring peace, but division (or even a sword).  This points out the division that will occur within families and between friends when the principles that Jesus preaches come into conflict with some deeply-held or practiced values such as self-preservation, pride, safety, greed.  I've seen this first-hand when Christian missionaries to foreign (sometimes hostile) countries face severe opposition from parents who accuse them of neglect of their grandchildren who the missionaries take into less-safe cultures.  Matthew 10:34-39 talks about this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
