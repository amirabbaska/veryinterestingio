		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Welcome Dr. Pilcher! And thank you.</p>
<p>How do you consider the problems associated with maternal and environmental effects when considering the problem of resurrecting extinct species?</p>
<p>Just to elaborate a minute...a ll organisms living today have ancestors to give them not just genetic inheritance, but to teach them behaviors, give them hormones and yolk and nourishment and mitochondria and social systems and much more. All the serious conversations I've seen on this topic fail to account for these dramatic sources of inheritance , so I fear we by focussing on simply one aspect (nuclear DNA), the vast number other sources of missing phenotypic determinants will mean that what we do create will be much less than the original.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Helen,</p>
<p>Thanks for doing this AMA. The great Dr. Ian Malcolm (jurassic park) once said:</p>
<p>&quot;Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether they could, they didn't stop to think if they should.&quot;</p>
<p>In your opinion, SHOULD we bring back a dinosaur? And more broadly, what are the most significant ethical dilemmas associated with that kind of endeavor?</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Dr. Pilcher! This is coming at it from an odd angle, but your self description intrigued me. I'm a high school senior who's about to go into college, with a STEM education background and a love for writing and comedy. I'm struggling to balance a &quot;safer&quot; science career with a much riskier desire to write or perform comedy. </p>
<p>My question(s): How did you get into science writing? What tips would you have for someone looking into science writing and/or writing comedy? What's been your experience in balancing arts and sciences?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
