		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>O-type blood provides a bit of resistance to malaria. Also, some blood types are much more valuable for blood donation. O- blood can be donated to 100% of the U.S. population, and O+ blood can be donated to 84%, so people with those blood types are encouraged to donate blood as much as they can. On the other hand, people with AB- or AB+ blood are universal plasma donors, so they're encouraged to donate plasma instead of blood.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are genetic advantages for certain blood subtypes to confer protection from diseases, most notably malarial infection. But that's as far as I know. There is no other tangible or intangible (such as physical prowess or heightened mental acuity) advantages from having a different blood type to others. It's just an evolutionary variation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In parts of east Asia, especially in Korea, blood-type is a big deal for some, equivalent to star-sign in the west.  Different blood types have different personalities.  That's why on Korean game shows and the like you'll sometimes see contestant's blood-type given when they're introduced.</p>
