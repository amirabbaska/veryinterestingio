		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By having a wide product line.</p>
<p>Start by making 100 drums of fresh unaged.  Don't sell any the first year.   year2, sell 90 of those as cheap stuff, produce 100 more drums of fresh unaged.  You now have 10 of 1 year old, and 100 fresh.     Year 3, sell 90 of 1 yr old as cheap stuff, you now have 10 2yr, 10 3yr. Produce 100 more fresh.   </p>
<p>Somewhere round 5 year. You can start selling 1-2 barrels of medium grade 5 year stuff. Leaving you with 7-8 barrels to keep on aging</p>
<p>Repeat for 30 something years </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know how common it is, but a whiskey destillery in Sweden used and alternative I have not seen here yet. They basically did &quot;pre orders&quot; and made the aging process a part of the product.</p>
<p>They sold small (like 5-10 liter) casks and put it in storage. Then they let the owner (and whoever they brought with them) come in and taste it something like every 6 months to experience how it matured. Then they bottled it and put on a label you choose when you thought it had mature enough. It seemed like quite a hit among hotels and bars in the local area as well as whiskey enthusiasts.</p>
<p>They made all the money directly, and the small casks gave a matureing time of about 2-5 years so the customers did not have to wait forever. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
