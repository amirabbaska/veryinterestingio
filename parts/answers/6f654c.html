		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're one of the few animals to eat a high-carbohydrate diet, a diet only possible because we grow grains as crops with agriculture. Because we eat carbs, we leave lots of delicious bits of sugar behind on our teeth for bacteria to feast on, causing tooth decay. If we don't brush, we can get painful cavities and our teeth can fall out. This is a huge health problem, and was even worse before modern oral hygiene practices.</p>
<p>Domestic dogs that eat corn-based dog food also need to have their teeth cleaned, which wild dogs don't need. Luckily there's chewy dog treats you can give your dog that do a decent job at cleaning their teeth so you don't have to do the unpleasant task of literally brushing your dog's teeth with a toothbrush. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our diet is rich in sugars, which bacteria love, because most our foods contain complex carbohydrates: think wheat, potatoes, fruit. Our food simply leaves a buffet for bacteria to feast on behind in our mouths.</p>
<p>Second: we learn. We've discovered that certain foods do this more than others, and we've learned that fluoride helps counter this effect. That means brushing alone is already neat (the calcium (chalk!) in the paste scrapes away most of that buffet), and that brushing with fluoride actually counters most of the effects!</p>
<p>How we've discovered fluoride does this: we observed that over the span of decades, some towns' people suffered tooth decay less than others, and we looked and found that their water supplies contained more fluoride. Off to the lab to check if fluoride indeed does this, and yup: it does.</p>
<p>Voil√†, fluoride based toothpaste became a thing.</p>
<p>Add SLS to make it bubbly through friction, so that the bubbles can get the fluoride more between your teeth; add mint to make it nice and fresh; and bam: modern toothpaste for you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other animals don't brush their teeth but there are several that have other animals clean their teeth. Sharks have little fish, crocodiles, hippos have small birds and there's probably other teeth cleaning relationships.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Human diet is normally rich in sugar, and animals and even the people of Pompeii before the eruption have been found to have good teeth and no cavities. And correct me if I'm wrong, but i believe the people of Pompeii used honey to sweeten their food instead of sugar. But then, sugar isnt the only thing that effects teeth, sodas, do aswell. So i believe its carbohydrates that effect teeth and there wasnt much of that for probably, 90-95% of recorded history.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While a high-sugar diet that everyone else talked about is the main reason, we're also the only animals to shave, wipe our butts, wash our hair and use deodorant. It's kind of just another part of hygiene in human society to have clean teeth and breath that doesn't stink.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
