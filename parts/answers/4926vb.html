<p>In particular, shifted towards the red, or... redshifted. That's gravitational redshift. That's for going up; going down it's blueshift. You don't need a black hole, btw, you can do it in Earth's gravitational field, read up on the Pound-Rebka experiment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It depends on where the light starts.</p>
<p>Scenario 1:  You are hovering near a black hole.  You shine a yellow flashlight towards your friend, who is far from the black hole.  Your friend reports that the light is reddish.</p>
<p>Scenario 2:  You and your friend are far apart, with a black hole near the midpoint between you.  You shine your yellow flashlight towards your friend.  Your friend reports that the light is yellow, just as it normally is.  (However, another friend, who is hovering near the black hole, disagrees and says it's definitely bluish.)</p>
<p>Warning: Do not try these experiments at home.  It's not realistic to expect to hover that close to a black hole; and with the distances involved, your friends might have a very long wait.</p>
<p>As the light approaches the black hole, it becomes blue-shifted (increased in frequency, i.e. decreased in wavelength) and then as it moves away  again from the black hole after going past it, it becomes red-shifted (decreased frequency, increased wavelength). If the distances are the same, these two effects cancel out, leaving the light looking the way it did when it started.</p>
<p>Edit: The light would also change direction as it passes the black hole, its path bent by the gravitational field, so it's best if the black hole is placed not midway between the friends but off to one side.  You shine your flashlight in the general direction of the black hole, and some of the light bends around at just the angle needed to end up going towards your friend.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In fact, all light gets redshifted as it leaves the gravitational effect of a regular star or any mass.  Gravitationally speaking, and sufficiently far away, a black hole is no different than a star of the same mass.</p>

<p>You can think of this as the photon expending energy to climb out of the gravitational distortion of a heavy mass, and the only way that a photon can change energy (and remain a photon) is by changing wavelength.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm posting a top-level comment here to address something that was repeated multiple times deeper in the comments :</p>
<p>It has often been stated on this thread that the apparent loss of energy due to gravitational redshift can be seen as the photon &quot;doing work&quot; against the gravitation field, and so the photon gains gravitational potential energy.</p>
<p>However, according to <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/physics/9907017" target="_blank">this paper</a> (which is very readable), there is no such thing as photon potential energy, and trying to derive an equation for the photon's potential energy this way gives results that don't match experimental results.</p>
<p>Instead, they (and most major textbooks, they say) prefer the approach that the photon does not change in energy, however the clocks down the gravity well run slower and therefore they measure an increased frequency for the same photon compared to clocks further out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
