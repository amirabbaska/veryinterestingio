		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partial melting of the substrate is uncommon (at least I'm not aware of this being common and certainly isn't the case for preserved lava flows I've seen in the field, and I can really only imagine this being possible in extremely selective settings on a very small scale where a high temperature lava, e.g. basalt, was erupted onto something with an extremely low melting point, e.g. carbonate, where you could possibly get a tiny bit of partial melting. But the lava flow will lose heat so quickly at its margins, generally it will not be able to melt other rocks). Alteration of the substrate (i.e. some amount of physical erosion, breaking up of the material from boiling of fluids, 'baking' previously unlithified sediments/soils) is very common. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava#Lava_morphology" target="_blank">wikipedia article on lava</a> provides a little description. The base of the lava flow itself also is affected by contact with a much cooler substrate. The portions of the lava in direct contact will start to solidify (and these bits will have a very fine grained texture because they cool quickly) but the interior is still hot enough to remain liquid and so the flow continues, which will tend to rip up these partially cooled bits and drag them along (with the cooling process continuing for new bits of lava that come into direct contact with the cool substrate). This can end up leaving the base of the flow with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breccia" target="_blank">brecciated</a> texture (but this is again for the volcanic material itself, not the substrate). There are lots of places where we can observe cross sections of volcanic stratigraphy to get a view of the variety of the basal contacts of lava flows. <a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1029/JB087iB08p06429" target="_blank">Here is an example of a paper (hopefully available to everyone, hard to tell since I'm at work)</a> describing the volcanic stratigraphy in Iceland, which gives a lot of great details of how the texture of flows vary in cross-section and some discussion of the substrates. </p>
<p>Caveat: I study non-volcanic mountains, so I'm still hoping a volcanologist will show up to provide more detail.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally by the time the lava arrives at the surface, it isn’t going to be hot enough to melt the surface it lands on / flows over.   The heat is likely to trigger combustion of organic matter that it flows over (grass, flowers, wooden houses, etc), and evaporate water and so on.  But generally speaking - you have a relatively small amount of hot lava mixing with a very large amount of air and ground (or water) and it cools quickly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Volcanologist here,</p>
<p>So I'm going to assume you're talking about AA (pronounced ah-ah) and pahoehoe (pronounced pah-hoy-hoy) basaltic lava flows like those we are currently seeing in Hawaii? </p>
<p>Pahoehoe:</p>
<p>Pahoehoe lava flows are known for having very low viscosity and developing ropy textures on their flow tops. They propegate in an interesting fashion called inflation where by a lava lobe develops a visco-elastic shell in contact with the ground and air. The shell acts as an insulator, shielding the interior of the flow from releasing too much heat to the outside.  The lobe will sort of blow up like  a balloon for a while.  Once enough pressure builds from continuous effusion of lava at the vent, the lobe has a 'break out' to form a new lobe which is connected to the old one. This process of inflation continues inflating old lobes and producing new ones.  In some regions (Columbia River Flood Basalt province in the PNW), this process has created flows 100's of meters thick.  This will continues until there is no more effusion providing pressure to propegate the flow. The shells that develop do a well enough job to shield the ground from the heat.</p>
<p>AA:</p>
<p>These flows are generally a bit coolder to begin with and when they move the lava breaks and crumbles on the outside of the flow to form an 'auto-clastic flow breccia', which means that the outsides are covered in sharp prickley bits of basalt, which if you stepped on you would probably find yourself saying &quot;ah, ah!&quot; Escentially as AA lavaflows progress they generally move in conveyor belt fashion where the top of the flow moves to the front and then falls on the ground and then is ridden over by the rest of the flow.  This cooled breccia acts as an excellent insulator and protects the underlying ground from being too affected by the heat.</p>
<p>From a chemical prospective, soils generally need to heat to very high temperatures (above 900°C) and be wet to have a chance to even partially melt.  There is a concept called solidus and liquidus where by any chemical mixture has a wide range of temperatures and pressures whereby that mixture can exist as a partial melt consisting of liquids and solids (think crystals floating in a magma chamber!). The interior of the flows would definitely be hot enough to partially melt these soils, but because of the shielding properties of the lava flows, there just isn't enough heat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, rocks are super good insulators and have a very high heat retention (they take a long time to heat up and cool down).  So the soils quench the exterior of the flows without absorbing too much heat, and then the qunched exteriors insulate the flow.</p>
<p>I hope this helps, feel free to ask more questions!</p>
<p>Edit: a few wording issues.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Can I piggy back on this and ask what happened to that car that was &quot;consumed&quot; by the lava?</p>
<p>Did it melt?  Will there be a mold of it under there?  Did the gas tank rupture, and if it did, will that cause an explosion within the lava flow and the bubbles create a &quot;mini eruption&quot; where they burst out of the surface of the flow?</p>
<p>I'm genuinely curious.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm answering a question and I hope you don't mind: What happens when melted candle wax pours down the side of a lit candle? </p>
<p>The underlying wax and the melted wax exchange energy (the rate varies depending on the heat conducting properties of the substance). The melted wax also exchanges energy with the relatively cool, surrounding air. With this in mind, the melted wax cools faster than the solid wax heats up, especially considering that the solid wax has a lot more surrounding cool wax to dissipate the heat energy to. Eventually, without an outside source to keep adding energy (such as a flame or a lava flow) all of the substance cools to resting temperature. Layers are formed due to variance in makeup, covered erosion, and density of the respective layers of wax/rock upon cooling. That's why resolidified wax looks less concentrated.</p>
<p>Edit: *lit candle not &quot;lot&quot; candle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
