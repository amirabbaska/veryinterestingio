		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see a lot of people talking about how dolphins can get water from their food, however most aquatic lifeforms have blood salt concentrations higher than what's acceptable for a mammal so dolphins have relatively strong kidneys that they use to remove salt from their blood and into their urine. So they literately piss out the extra salt. Other salt water creatures that don't have the same salinity in their blood as in the sea water have other various means to get rid of extra salt such as in the form of salt glands in certain reptiles birds and sharks, so they &quot;cry&quot; out the extra salt instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They get water from their food, and that food is mostly a carnivorous diet perhaps for this reason. Marine herbivores end up taking in a lot more salt and have to have mechanisms in place to deal with this. They also have kidneys that have a better processing system then most so they can pass more salt through their urine but it seems like most of this isnâ€™t well studied and is as of yet mostly theory.   </p>
<p>Some are known to drink fresh water when they can. seals will eat snow for this reason and people in Florida sometimes leave a hose running into the water so manatees will come and drink.</p>
<p>It's a really interesting question and there aren't a lot of solid, one size fits all answers. the best TLDR i could give is, we don't know 100%, but it seems like a lot of them deal with it in different ways, and we don't know all of them yet. </p>
<p>Most of my information is from this article if you want to read more. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason salt can dehydrate things is because fluids always want to be where there's more salt. It's relative, meaning wherever there's more salt, no matter how much it is, the fluid wants to go there. We have a salinity based on our own environment, and higher salinity will dry us out. So simply put, sea animals are more salty than we are. If you put them in fresh water, all the water penetrates their cell membranes, because they are saltuer than the water around them. Their cells burst, and they die. This also happens to us if we drink too much water!</p>
<p>This isn't the entire solution, as fish aren't exactly as salty as the sea though. But they are salty enough to withstand the sea salt.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Their kidneys are better at removing salt from the bloodstream than ours.</p>
<p>This isn't unique, cats can stay hydrated after drinking saltwater due to their kidneys. </p>
<p>With that said, this is hard on their bodies/kidneys, and cats can even experience kidney problems in captivity because they drink the minimum (very small) amount of water to stay hydrated. But in the short-term, they tolerate more salt/less water than humans.</p>
<p>So tolerance for salt varies between &quot;similar&quot; animals (i.e. mammals) which can be shown from many examples other than aquatic mammals. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
