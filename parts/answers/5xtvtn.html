		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you assume that the one man and one woman are the only source of genetic information, then you have short term issues with incest.</p>
<p>Long term, variations will come about through genetic mutation which will allow for a genetic base for a sustainable population.</p>
<p>The key to doing it right is planning.</p>
<p>The first couple needs to make a large number of children, at least 4 boys and 4 girls. Those children will have to mate with each other, one boy having a child with each of the four girls, making 16 grandchildren.</p>
<p>Then pair off the grandchildren so no pair shares a mother and father, increasing the possibility of a variety of genetics to emerge. </p>
<p>After that, you track the genealogy of all members of the growing society. The 16 grandchildren make up 8 starting families. For the first few generations, make it so no children mates with another from the same parents. The next few, restrict it to grandparents as well. By the 10th generation, you can restrict it to great-grandparents and stop directly planning the families.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They would need to have as many offspring as possible, and their children would jeed to each have as many children as possible. </p>
<p>The problems associated with incest are statisitical, not absolute, so the more offspring, the more likely it is to have a child that is not a carrier for a given recessive gene.</p>
<p>That said, many offspring a couple of generations in <em>would</em> likely be suffering varrious developmental disorders. As the rest of the human population wouldn't be around to judge them, this would likely cause a rediscovery of the ancient practice of &quot;exposure&quot; where deformed young would be discarded to die in the wild rather than consuming the limited resources of the community.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There would be a number of genetic flaws that would come out over time, but these could be culled by natural selection. People inbreed animals all the time in labs to preserve genetic traits, and the results aren't as bad as we are led to believe. It's still not a good idea to inbreed, but it would work as long as the two source parents didn't have any major genetic flaws. </p>
<p>As far as how long it takes, this depends. One woman recently died after matching the record at 69 children in her life. This is an outlier obviously, but let's go with some assumptions. The two people are 18 years old, and the woman should be fertile for 25 years (no twins). Assuming some small gaps without children, let's say they give birth to 32 children. 30 of those survive to adulthood and are not sterile (50/50), and each woman makes another 32 children (30 who survive). You would have about 6-8 generations in 100 years or nearly 1 million people. So, this could happen quite rapidly. </p>
<p>Now, in reality, the genetic flaws will result in some number being excluded from breeding for health sake or not survive as a result of them, but it's quite feasible to have a very significant population in a few hundred years from only two people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem as I see it would not be from inbreeding directly. Yes it produces health problems, but in normal circumstances in developed countries those problems are treated. A couple on a desert planet would fail to start a civilization not because they were inbreeding but because they don't have any doctors or hospitals. If they <em>did</em> have medical care, perhaps because they've got a spaceship full of robots and computers to do it for them, then they'd certainly be able to expand the population. It might be 'unhealthy' but with a sufficiently advanced medical system that doesn't matter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
