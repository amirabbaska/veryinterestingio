		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Thomas. I'm curious whether you have glial cells in the mix, and specifically whether you account for microglia? Since they're created in the yolk sac and not derived from the same source as neurons and other glia, it seems like it would be very difficult to incorporate them, but it would be difficult to understand neurotoxicity and even early development without them as their absence lead to improper regulation and connectivity of neurons.</p>
<p>If they're there, I'm super curious what specific cells they're being created from (Langerhans macrophages?) and how easy it is to get them to populate the brain.</p>
<p>If you do not account for them, does your model suggest anything interesting through their lack of presence?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sounds like very interesting research, and the implications for saving innocent animal lives are tremendous. Congratulations!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi Dr. Hartung, </p>
<p>Thank you for doing this AMA! I have a few questions: </p>
<p>1) In your system, how do you know that the connections being made/networking/spine formation/etc. are comparable to those made in the brain? If so, could your system be used to study things like developmental neurobiology (I know that there's some thought that pruning issues during development might be one of the causes of Autism-spectrum type phenotypes.) Additionally, do you think your system would be a good model for learning and memory/neuroplasticity? </p>
<p>2) Does your system contain an analog to glia/microglia/other non-neuronal cells that are contained in the brain? Even though glia aren't electrically active, they contain such amounts of things like glutamate that they're incredibly important for normal, tonic neuronal activation. </p>
<p>3) What is the advantage of your system over primary neuronal cultures, or over expressing relevant receptors in a  heterologous system? Your system sounds incredibly impressive for <em>in vivo</em> work, but wouldn't the higher volume/higher throughput capabilities of heterologous system be more efficient for things like drug screening? </p>
<p>Thank you so much for taking the time to do this! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
