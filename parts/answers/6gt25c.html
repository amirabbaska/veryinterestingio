		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So, I don't know if you know this, but Blackstone did just what you are suggesting.  </p>
<p>After the housing crash of 2009, they went out and bought up homes in different cities.  They put them all under the umbrella of a REIT (real estate investment trust) called &quot;Invitation Homes&quot; and then spun it out in an IPO a few years ago. $INVH is the stock symbol.</p>
<p>Here's the website:
<a href="http://www.invitationhomes.com/" target="_blank">http://www.invitationhomes.com/</a></p>
<p>You can see from the website, they own and rent out 50,000 homes in 13 different areas.  The company's total market cap is $6.7 billion.  </p>
<p>However, it's no where close to controlling a significant part of the housing supply.</p>
<p>To do what you are suggesting, you would need just one or two companies to control all the housing in a city.  I just don't see it happening.  Even if you get down to 10 companies controlling all the housing options, you'll have plenty of competition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In Norway all secondary housing you own has 85% of it's value added to your wealthtax. In Oslo they are considering upping this value so it's not worth buying and renting out anything you can get your hands on. Hopefully it will work because the prices are stupid high for what you are offered, but time will show if this is a worthwhile move.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an ideal market, companies inflating the price of housing would encourage builders to build houses to sell to these buyers until the market is flooded and the price falls to a more reasonable level.  Housing is not exactly a fixed resource and with skyscrapers, land can be split many many times.</p>
<p>In some regions like San Francisco, regulations prevent tall construction and thus prevents this kind of correction from occuring.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Taxes, in particular high land use taxes. A land use tax is a tax on the assessed value of the use of the property instead of fair market value. This can allow municipalities to put rental properties in one tax bracket and residential ownership in another.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The biggest reason is the idea of &quot;continually acquiring housing&quot; just doesn't work out.  There is almost $15 trillion in mortgage debt in the United States.  If we ignore all the equity in houses, this means to buy even 1/15th of the housing market would require $1 trillion.  Apple, one of if not the richest companies as far as cash on hand, has about $250 billion in the bank.  So if it went all in on buying houses, it could only buy 1/60th of the market.  Hardly enough to make a dent as far as locking up rent.  So for even 1/10th of the market to be locked up, you would be looking at 20 or 30 of the richest companies in the world investing all their capital in real estate.  Also, the scarcity driving up cost would also work against the companies attempting it.  You would start driving up the cost of purchasing houses but you would reach a point where you could not pass this on to consumers in the form of rent.</p>
<p>Secondary reasons it would never happen is there are fairly strong consumer protection laws for renters (owner covers most maintenance, difficult to evict non-payers, etc) which decrease how much of your rent income is actually profit, laws you would have to adhere to vary heavily by state and even city making it a compliance nightmare, long-term (30+ years) in many areas house values decrease relative to inflation reducing what you could charge for rent or make off of selling them, etc.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
