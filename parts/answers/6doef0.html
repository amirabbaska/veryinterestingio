		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thanks for the answers. I was predicting that it was a part of, let's say, a licensing agreement or other such legal hullabaloo, but that's strictly a guess. Frustrating for me, because while knowing full well music is one of the final steps, at times it can kick the emotional content up in ways other components of a production can't touch, and I always felt the people involved should be credited. But I am something of a completist, after all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, it all boils down to whatever is contractually obligated.  To answer your second question, the AFM (musicians union) doesn't have any specific language in their contract requiring that musicians be listed in credits of film, so it just doesn't happen.  For films that are recorded non-union, most likely it's actually the players themselves that don't want to be listed, as a lot of films record on &quot;dark days&quot; meaning union players playing in a non-union recording session, which is against the AFM bylaws. (In other words, if an AFM player did a non-union indie dark, and then had their name in the credits, they'd find themselves in trouble fairly quickly and facing some serious fines)</p>
<p>For songs in film versus TV being listed, if often does come down to the time constraints of music being one of the last things to be finalized.  For TV, it's quite often that the end credits for a show have already been completed for a particular episode before final music choices have been made, so there isn't a way to include it.  Additionally, there can be upwards of 20-30 songs (that you would see listed used in a film) in a single 30-minute TV program, and there just isn't time to list them (TV end credit beds are pre-determined length and rarely vary from episode to episode).  </p>
<p>Tldr; contracts require different things for different formats</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I know, the top answer is the correct one, But another contributing factor is this:</p>
<p>TV shows want to save as much time as possible, because they have a small window of time to fill, and the tv stations want people to keep watching, so television shows try to have as short of credits as possible. They will usually do the minimum required, and have the credits go as fast as possible. Often leaving out things like VFX people and merely mentioning the VFX companies involved. </p>
<p>Movies however are not concerned with how long the credits are, and longer credits actually make a movie seem like a bigger deal. So a lot of movies pad out the credits with as much information as possible, not only do they list every person who worked at each VFX company for example. They even have absurd new things they're doing like &quot;production babies&quot; which is just a list of all the children that were born to employees who worked on the movie during its production. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes a party is mentioned in the credits in lieu of payment. The classic example is the Arkansas knifesmith who made the Rambo knives: he supplied them at no charge, in return for a mention in the credits and the right to market copies as &quot;Rambo Knives&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On the studio musicians point, you have to differentiate between score and soundtrack. Scores (i.e. instrumental music written specifically for a film) do sometimes list musicians, but you would think they could or should do it all of the time.</p>
<p>But for non-score songs, it does come down to the point you make about them being added &quot;after the fact.&quot; These songs are already existing pieces of work, not specifically for the movie, which is why not all musicians are listed.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
