		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two parts to this:  how long it takes the signal to travel the physical distance involved, and how long the &quot;routing&quot; takes (the logic needed to decide where to send the signal at each &quot;stop&quot;.  More commonly known as a &quot;hop&quot;, I believe, by the way.)</p>
<p><strong>Transport (100 msecs)</strong></p>
<p>The first part is pretty straightforward:  Sydney-&gt;Tokyo-&gt;Taiwan-&gt;Tokyo-&gt;Sydney is about 20,000 km.  Most of this is via <a href="https://www.submarinecablemap.com/" target="_blank">undersea cables</a>, where light travels \~31% slower than in vacuum, so that's a minimum of 100 msecs just to push those shitty <del>electrons</del> photons from point A to point B.</p>
<p>(Edit: To clarify, the speed of light is slower because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submarine_communications_cable" target="_blank">undersea cables use fiber-optic lines</a> - i.e. really long glass strands - and the speed of light is slower in glass than in air or vacuum.  It has nothing to do with the cables being in/under water.)</p>
<p>Note: Some data may go via telecommunications satellites, but these orbit anywhere from 2,000 to 35,000 km above the earth, so involve greater distances = more time.</p>
<p><strong>Routing (140 msecs)</strong></p>
<p>The second part, routing, is a little more complicated.  Basically there are three &quot;levels&quot; to the internet: <a href="http://www.mcmcse.com/cisco/guides/hierarchical_model.shtml" target="_blank">Access, Distribution, and Core</a>. For an ELI5, we can just say the hops you're seeing all take place at/between these levels, each of which involves dedicated hardware specifically designed to make receiving, processing, and retransmitting of data as fast as possible (especially at the Core layer).  Still, this part takes a significant amount of time.</p>
<p>Edit: ... and I'll refer you to /u/MavEtJu's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/9aeptg/eli5_how_does_the_internet_work_so_insanely_fast/e4uxfxm/" target="_blank">answer</a> for details of what's involved here.</p>
<p><strong>Commentary</strong></p>
<p>Empirically, what you're seeing is that the routing portion of each of those 16 hops takes 140ms in total, or  \~9ms each.  That may or may not seem like a long time, but consider that a modern quad-core CPU can perform \~100 million operations in that 9ms.  And that's for a general CPU.  Network hardware is using purpose-built chipsets more akin to graphics processors (i.e. optimized for specific logic w/ high throughput), which can do 100x that.  Surely such fast hardware shouldn't take that long... right?</p>
<p>Well, consider the amount of data involved.  Your data packets are travelling along the backbone of the internet where a <em>tremendous</em> amount of data has to be processed.  For example, there's a Hong Kong-&gt;LA cable that does <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/telecom/internet/submarine-cable-goes-for-record-144000-gigabits-from-hong-kong-to-la-in-1-second" target="_blank">144,000 gbps</a>.  Even  though your packets may only take a nanosecond to deal with, they have to wait in line (buffer) while the ones ahead of them are dealt with.</p>
<p>P.S.  Check out the <a href="https://www.linode.com/docs/networking/diagnostics/diagnosing-network-issues-with-mtr/" target="_blank">mtr</a> CLI (requires install).  It's <code>ping</code> + <code>traceroute</code> on crack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>It has 16 &quot;stops&quot; between me and the destination. Doesn't something have to happen at each of the &quot;stops&quot; that would take time? </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, and that is where the 240 ms also comes from.</p>
<p>There are several factors on the time-&quot;distance&quot; of a remote site:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Speed of light in a fibre is about 200 Mm/s, 2/3rd the speed of light in a vacuum. So every 200 meters takes one microsecond. From Sydney to Melbourne, about 1000 km, takes 5000 microseconds which is 5 milliseconds. There is nothing you can do about this, this is just a speed of light limitation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Serialization delay, the time it takes from a serial signal into a parallel signal. For your 1 Mbps ADSL link takes 12 ms to convert the 1500 bytes of an IP packet in memory to go out of the ADSL modem onto the copper wire. </p>
</li>
<li>At every stop the IP header gets inspected to find out if it is still valid (TTL&gt;0, checksum okay) and where it needs to go to (IP destination address). Its TTL gets decreased and the IP checksum gets recalculated (&lt;--- major stupid idea in the IP protocol, the TTL should have been left out of the checksum, IPv6 doesn't have one). After inspection it gets put in the right outgoing interface and waits there to be transmitted. You have here queueing delay and yes, serialization delay again.</li>
</ol>
<p>So between hops you have the speed of light delay, and at every hop you have serialization delay and recalculation delay. The speed of light delay is relative large, serialization delay is large at slow links but the recalculation delay is minimal. The queueing delay is hopefully none if the network is not congested.</p>
<p>Now why is the total of these numbers still well below one second? Because fibre links are fast, serialization delay is minimal on fast links, the routers at the hops are fast and there is no congestion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
