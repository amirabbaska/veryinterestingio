		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There have been many different estimates given for the total number of species on planet Earth. Some estimates are mere educated guesses by experts, while others are more grounded in statistics. A famous estimate was provided by Terry Erwin, an entomologist working for the Smithsonian Institute. He sampled beetles from the Amazon basin by pumping insecticides into large rainforest trees and catching the dead insects that rained down into nets (this method is now called 'fogging'). Using these samples, he observed that many species of beetles were only found within a single species of tree. By sampling lots of different species of tree, he found that on average, each species of canopy tree had roughly 160 species of beetle that were only found on a single tree species. So then, estimating that there are about 50,000 species of canopy trees, he simply multiplied 160 x 50,000 to come up with 8 million. Since it is relatively well known that beetles make up approximately 25% of all described species on Earth, he then multiplied 8 million x 4 to come up with 32 million. This estimate received a lot of attention because of how large it was. It also received quite a lot of criticism, given the extrapolations that he used. For example, his estimate of 50,000 Amazon tree species is likely too high, and the number of endemic beetles per tree species is also highly variables from one tree species to the next. Today, most scientists think the Erwin estimate is probably too high.</p>
<p>There have thus been many other estimates provided by different groups over the years. A good one that comes to mind is described in a paper by Mora et al. 2011 in PlosONE (<a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127" target="_blank">http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127</a>). The authors identify an important relationship that helped them to derive an accurate estimation of global species diversity. That is, there tends to be a linear relationship between the log number of taxonomic units found within different taxonomic hierarchies (i.e., from species, to genus, to family, to order, etc.). While we have a poor idea of the total number of species on Earth, we do have very good estimates for the total number of genera and families, etc. So, using these numbers, the authors simply plotted the number of taxonomic units found within all hierarchies above the species level (i.e., from genera to phylum). Using the linear model obtained from this procedure, they extrapolated their data to the species level and found the model to land on the number 8.7 million. Given the fact that about 1.2 million species have been described, 1.2/8.7 = 14%, bringing us to your original question. </p>
<p>This number is widely regarding as being a fairly accurate estimation of global species richness. Most biologists expect this number to be somewhere between 6 and 12 million now. However, it is important to point out that these estimates ignore microbes! We really don't have a clue what the diversity of prokaryotes looks like, so they are largely left out of these types of estimations. Advances in genomic sequencing will hopefully help us get closer to an answer, but we are still in the very early stages of developing techniques for describing microbial diversity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's basically extrapolating from data. One way of finding new species is (nowadays, less invasive methods are preferred) to go to the Amazon (or any other biodiverse ecosystem) and find a large tree (which shouldn't prove much of a challenge), spread a large sheet beneath the tree and then gas the whole tree to send every (formerly) living thing flying down onto your nice big sheet. You can then easily classify every animal. Scientists would then find that a large percentage of the animals collected were previously unknown species. This process would be repeated on several other trees in the area, with similar results. From this, we can tell that there are a whole lot of species we don't know about yet</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add to the explanations discussing samples from a population, there is a concept called the &quot;species discovery curve&quot; or &quot;species accumulation curve&quot; that helps to visualize this: <a href="https://terrestrialecosystems.com/species-accumulation-curves/" target="_blank">https://terrestrialecosystems.com/species-accumulation-curves/</a></p>
<p>If you're still discovering a lot of species, you are necessarily part of the steeper curve, and as you keep coming across known species, you are part of the flatter part of the curve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have to bear in mind it is believed that approximately 99.999% of microbial species are yet the be discovered. You have to take this into account as well. </p>
<p>Im not saying you are, but a lot of people hear 'all living species' and just think of things we can see with the naked eye, which mostly fall into the animal or plant kingdom.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't <em>know</em>, they're estimating. There are lots of very interesting mathematical models/theory that tell you: if you have discovered <em>this</em> many things in a population at <em>this</em> rate and the rate of discovery is changing at <em>this</em> rate (second derivative), your population is probably somewhere around <em>this</em> size. Couple that with knowledge about how many species live in certain areas/climates and which areas are more or less explored, you've got a good estimate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
