		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I agree with /u/somedave that the answer is No.</p>
<p>If we met the total energy demands of the entire world with fusion (4x10^20 Joules per year) then we would produce something in the region of 100,000 kg of Helium as a byproduct. Compare this to an annual Helium usage of the order of 10,000,000kg and you see there is no way it is covered. </p>
<p>With no way to produce resonable quantities of He, we will run out one day but that day is 100's of years away. The most likely way to avoid this is to get better at recycling it and/or to discover high temperature superconductors that allow us to use a different coolant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think the answer is most likely &quot;no&quot;.  <a href="https://www.nap.edu/read/9860/chapter/6" target="_blank">Estimated Helium usage is about 72 million cubic meters / year,</a>, or 0.179 * 72 million Kg ~ 13,000 Tons, which is a hell of a lot.  Also it would be hard to capture all the Helium you produced in a typical fusion reactor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Helium is created by radioactive breakdown. It comes up with natural gas. The reason there's a pending &quot;shortage&quot; is because nobody (primarily the wells in the USA) is capturing it currently. It's kind of a pain in the ass, and the USA had a massive underground storage facility that we've been selling from for years. As soon as it becomes financially feasible, companies will start storing it again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would, however, prompt action in terms of collecting minerals outside of our own planet. The moon is constantly bombarded with helium-3 due to the lack of atmosphere and the expulsion from the sun. It would be a good place to source the helium necessary.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The world energy consuption is estimated to be 3.9*10^20 joules.</p>
<p>Fusing 1 gram if hydrogen into helium releases 6.5*10^10 joules of energy. But over 99% of the mass remains as helium so we can ignore the mass loss for this estimation.</p>
<p>This means 6.0*10^9 grams of helium is produced to meet the energy requirements of the world. That equals to 6000 tons. Assuming the value of /u/somedave gave of 13 000tons is correct, a 100% efficiency reactor would create almost half of the used helium, or 5% if we use the 10% value you gave in the question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
