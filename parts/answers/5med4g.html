		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most people I know are not okay with eating moldy cheese unless it's specifically cultured mold such as is found in blue cheese. Molds used in blue cheese are safe for human consumption and enhance the flavor, but they are a specific type of mold. The fuzzy stuff that eventually appears on both cheese and bread tastes horrible and has a risk of triggering an allergic reaction or some other negative reaction.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mold on bread is from random spores in the air.   The mold on cheese is a specific kind that was used to make the cheese so it's edible.   People don't eat just random mold that grew on cheese like cheddar.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A thing I am not seeing mentioned is mycelium (analogous to roots).  In a hard cheese visible mould can be trimmed one inch in on all sides and this will remove the entire organism.  In a soft cheese or bread, there is no guarantee that the mycelium has not already spread throughout and thus it is no longer safe for the public and/or you (but do what you want at home).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>At least in my experience, it is because cheese seems much less porous than bread. I can just cut the mold off of cheese and eat what is underneath, where as mold on bread seems to spread to the inside and throughout. </p>
<p>Edit: I know this is not really the case, and mold is more than just on the surface. Im just pointing out what we can choose to ignore and what we won't. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
