		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://www.iflscience.com/physics/what-would-happen-if-every-single-nuke-in-the-world-went-off-at-the-same-time/" target="_blank">This</a> site gives a pretty good run down but makes some big assumptions. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Assuming they’re evenly spaced out across the world’s cities and towns, and maybe a village or two, this will annihilate 94 kilometers (23 cubic miles) of land immediately – but that’s nothing compared to what happens next.</p>
<p>232,000 square kilometers (90,000 square miles) of infrastructure will be blown away by the air blast. That’s about 295 metropolises the size of New York City turned to dust.</p>
<p>A fireball 79,000 square kilometers (31,000 square miles) will vaporize literally anything it touches, and anyone within a 5.8 million square kilometer (2.2 million square miles) area would get third-degree burns. So everyone in the same space as 3,700 cities the size of London would be scorched.</p>
<p>Lastly, the fallout and ionizing radiation would contaminate an area of the world about 284,000 square kilometers (110,000 square miles) in size and give most of the initial survivors radiation sickness. Of course, a lot of this fallout would reach the lower atmosphere and spread across the world, so casualties would be far higher in the long term.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That means that a fireball adding up to the size of Maine would be instantly vaporized. </p>
<p>People would get 3rd degree burns in an area the size of half of Europe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, first it wouldn't &quot;blow up&quot; the earth. On a planetary scale the earth is small, but on a nuclear explosion scale it's pretty big. Depending on the spread and altitude of the nukes you could easily kill 99% of all life but not the entire planet. Even if you managed to &quot;crack&quot; the earth our gravity would keep the planet whole, so no chunks of California getting blown off or anything like that. </p>
<p>Space is a bit different and poses other problems. The explosion in space would do little immediate damage, but the after-effects could be very very bad. </p>
<p>The blast wave would likely destroy the orbits of almost every satellite orbiting earth, either by directly knocking them out of their orbit or by causing a chain reaction of collisions in space. Basically, a massive sphere of space junk would make future space launches almost impossible. </p>
<p>Then you've got the emp and radation that would slam into the earth. Best case scenario is temporary electronics blackouts and a total loss of GPS. Worst case is blasting the entire planet with radiation. So we all die, but slowly and painfully. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It take a lot of power to destroy a planet. There are not enough nukes on Earth to do it, even if you put them all in the exact center of the core.</p>
<p>What would happen is that the entire surface of the planet would be massively irradiated and sterilized of nearly all life. Certainly anything bigger than an insect would die. On top of that, all the soot and ash released into the atmosphere would obscure the sun for decades, lowering the surface temperature to the point that whole planet is basically a giant snowball. A giant, radioactive, inhospitable snowball.</p>
<p>Creatures that COULD survive include cockroaches, tardigrades, and some species of wasp, as well as certain extremophile bacteria. Creates that live in the deep ocean might be okay, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Assuming all devices are a W76 type warhead and an estimate of 14,900 warheads the math should be pretty simple. The W76 is a 100kt device so roughly 420TJ. 420*14900=6258000 or 6.258EJ or 6.258x10^18 joules. To put that in perspective, the energy of sun striking the sun facing side of the earth every second is only 1.7x10^17 joules, while the total mass-energy conversion rate of the sun per second is 384.6YJ or 3.846x10^26 joules.  </p>
<p>For a more down to earth perspective on just how much energy this is we will use a <del>banana for scale</del> Reddit standard. We are going to round off the <del>banana</del> Reddit standard weight at 200g. If we lift this <del>banana</del> Reddit standard by 1 meter from the surface of the earth it would require 2 joules of energy. The same amount if we dropped it from 1 meter above the surface of the earth. So all those nukes would be equivalent to dropping 3,129,000,000,000,000,000,000 (3.129 Quintillion) <del>bananas</del> Reddit standards from 1 meter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
