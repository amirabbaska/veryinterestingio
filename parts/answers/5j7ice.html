		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just examples, but:</p>
<p><strong>Well acted</strong> - a really good actor can communicate a character's thoughts, personality and emotions with very little. The way their voice trembles when they say &quot;I love you.&quot; The way they stand when in the background of a shot. The way their eyes seem to flare with rage when the villian is talking and they're not. All little details that can make a big different.</p>
<p><strong>well written</strong> - You can write whole novels on how to write moves. But typically, a well written script delivers a plot that builds at a good pace without overwhelming or boring the audience, characters who say things that are interesting and novel and explain their personality <em>while still</em> being believable enough to not break the sense of immersion. </p>
<p><strong>Directing</strong> - directors have a lot of control over the &quot;feel&quot; of a movie, and usually set the direction other crews act on. The original script specified this scene to be a dark and stormy night in a city... is it almost cartoony scene, with the buildings illuminated blue and convienently-placed streetlamps highlighting the intense makeup of the actors? Or is it gritty, covered in shadow and drained of color, looking like at any moment someone could get murdered? While the staging/lighting/makeup crew are going to put this together, the concepts and what direction they go in are ultimately the director's call. And that's just one tiny facet of the show! Directors also get say in how ridiculous we're going with action scenes (Jason Bourne or Fast and Furious) the soundtrack (orchestra? electronic? tie-in soundtrack by a big-name artist?) and many other bits that are usually someone else's job to actually <em>put together</em> but they need the creative direction and vision to see all those different bits congeal into one effective whole movie.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While good direction, acting, and writing, are all important to the making of a good movie, I think what makes it &quot;good&quot; is highly subjective. There are a few movies I can think of that are very important to me but which would not touch another person for the same reason. A good example, I think, is &quot;Drive.&quot; The writing in that movie is nothing to really speak of, the acting is fine, but the overall tone of that film, and the mood it evokes, is so viscerally stirring. Credit needs to go to Gosling for giving such a silent yet magnetic performance, and the director for so expertly crafting the look and feel, but the individual elements are nowhere near as powerful as the sum of the parts. And all of that said, I know people who were bored stiff by the movie. </p>
<p>This is how my SO feels about the film &quot;Dark City.&quot; It's not really my cup of tea, but he has watched it, in his words, &quot;probably 100 times,&quot; because there is something in that movie that he connects to and is fascinated by. (For the record, I do think the film is gorgeous - but I also think it's a bit silly.)</p>
<p>I'm also a big sucker for Woody Allen films, which, again, highly subjective. I have friends who can't stand him. A lot of people don't like his dialogue, don't like his acting, don't like his stiff directing, and plenty of people can't watch his stuff without feeling grossed out by his personal scandals. But there is a rhythm and a &quot;reality&quot; to his work that strikes me to my core. Again, my SO feels that way about Kubrick's films, but I absolutely HATE those. To some cineastes that makes me worse than a heathen, but I'm sorry, his films are cold and boring and I cannot sit through a single one. That's my opinion. </p>
<p>What's interesting to me is that there's a big backlash against sequels and remakes and all that going on right now, but I don't think that sentiment is really hitting the nail on the head. Sure, it's terrible that sequels and remakes outnumber original works, but whoever said sequels and remakes have to be terrible? They're terrible now because most films these days are created based on a template of stereotypes and film cliches that superficially work but don't stay with you. Watch any classic film from the 1970s, during the New Hollywood era, and you will FEEL something. They were personal stories for adults that, no matter the wildness of their subjects, resonated BECAUSE of how personal the visions were. Most mainstream Hollywood movies are now tightly monitored by producers and studios that strain individuality out of films. Big budget blockbusters are created to be simple, machine-manufactured spectacles that will have broad appeal for international audiences. </p>
<p>And you know what? It makes sense that that's how it is. Movie making is a business - a highly profitable one - and studios will do what they have to for that almighty dollar (sorry, got a bit political there). If things continue this way (and there's no reason to believe they won't), it is unlikely we'll ever get visceral, interesting Hollywood films back. Every now and then something will come along that breaks through to the mainstream, but mostly what we'll get is a stream of middling movies that toe the line and play it safe to appeal to the broadest demographic. </p>
<p>And sometimes those movies end up meaning something to people. Again, my SO, for all his Kubrick/Dark City love, is a sucker for the Fast and Furious movies. I hate hate hate hate those stupid things, but he is a 30+-year-old man and his eyes light up when we watch those in the theater. He's adorable, and it makes me hate the film a little bit less to see him enjoy it. But they are still super dumb and yes I understand they're supposed to be super dumb but that won't make me like them, ever. Fight me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Director is the guy who turns a written script into a movie (They get lots of help though). The Director usually helps pick the actors, says what the camera angles look like and how they transition. They likely yell at the actors and tell them they need to do a scene a different way or with a different emotion. Basically, its their vision of the script that the movie studio wants as the final product.</p>
<p>I feel like a great director can take a shitty script and cast and still make a halfway decent movie with them. On the other hand, I feel like a terrible director could have taken a film we think of as a blockbuster... lord of the rings, star wars, whatever -- and totally ruined them.</p>
<p>This isnt to say that writers and actors arent important, but the Director is basically the boss and the person who decides what you see and hear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Great acting makes you forget you are watching an actor and allow yourself to suspend disbelief long enough to accept them as their character. A lot of variables depend on the viewer themselves, and their preference for reality vs fantasy, and if they are willing to accept situations that they have familiarity with being reacted to differently than how they reacted themselves (think someone who was in a catastrophic event and their reactions or training for said reactions, vs what the actor is doing on the screen). At the end of the day, no matter how an actor approaches a character, a script and a performance, there will be those who dislike it, cannot suspend disbelief to &quot;buy in&quot; to the performance, or otherwise take issue with pieces, parts or the whole of the performance. Universally renowned performances vary between the ultra-realistic and the highly fantastical overdone, and neither is right or wrong, but perhaps are great examples of a films tone matching with what the actor is bringing. Which leads to...</p>
<p>Well directed films are ones which the viewer can again suspend disbelief during the performance/film, and can buy into the situations with minimal to no issues with pacing, feel or performances. The director can, as the name would imply, direct the actors to get the optimal performance for the feel of the picture. Stanley Kubrick for example, was notorious for grinding his actors and actresses to get the ideal performance from them, usually by using methods of near torture to gain reactions he felt were ideal. Scenes can take days to weeks to shoot, not because of technical issues, but because directors are waiting for a specific feel to a scene that is most times impossible to properly convey, and since showing an actor what you want is an insult called &quot;reading&quot;, you end up shooting it over and over until it is right.</p>
<p>Well written, again, depends on the viewer as some prefer ultra-realistic language, while others prefer simple or flowery language, along with a plot that twists and turns, or is comfortably predictable. Its hard to say a film is poorly written unless the dialogue is both boring, unrealistic and most importantly, not entertaining. If it avoids two of those three categories, the dialogue at least is well written. As for plot, pacing of the story, and with foreshadowing/call backs/ surprises, it all has to fit the story, and the directors attempt to make it real. </p>
<p>Many times, a story begins with its writing, at its purest, and most easily capable of being a good film. Then, it is the job of the director to take the written word and make it an entertaining film that conveys the story properly and brings life to the written word. Finally, it is the job of the actors to bring the words of the writer and the ideas of the director into action, using every piece of their humanity to create the performance desired. If one of the three (actor, director, writer) fails, the film falls apart, usually. Great actors can be in amazingly well written movies, but a poor directing choice can sink the film. Similarly, a bad lead actor can ruin an otherwise strong film. Bad dialogue can also sink a film even with incredible acting and directing, because the actors, try as they may, cannot make bad dialogue sound genuine.  I find that often both the best and the worst films have an writer/director. Sometimes they are capable of producing a film that their written work created, and sometimes they are not. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When a movie or book is well written, the sequence of events flows in an unpredictable but logical manner. It gives you the information you need without making it feel like they are throwing exposition at you. All of the places the characters go and interact with each other make sense for those characters.</p>
<p>To give an example, bad writing is when things are thrown in for convenience or because they just want a certain plot point. In some movies, they'll often have two of the main characters have some sort of misunderstanding to create some artificial drama so that they can have a nice makeup/reunion scene. </p>
<p>Or maybe they'll bring up randomly that one of the characters was an expert horse wrangler just so that they can have that character expertly wrangle horses in a later scene. In this example, it isn't bad writing for one of the characters to be an expert horse wrangler, rather it is bad writing for them to be an expert horse wrangler without it playing into their character in any sort of way.</p>
<p>It is fine to have a nerdy character that is really good with computers and can hack them, because then when some issue comes up that requires hacking that character can show their skill... but it isn't ok for there to be some character who when faced with a locked computer terminal says the line &quot;finally my computer science degree from MIT is coming in handy&quot; because this aspect of the character is only there to solve the logical plot problem of there needing to be someone who can hack a computer.</p>
<p>Perhap an effective way to frame this character is to make them a bit mischievous and to somehow describe how they used to play pranks on their high school teachers by switching their desktop to something offensive.</p>
<p>I am kind of rambling on a bit, but I'd say a movie or TV show with good writing is one in which when watching it you didn't really know where it was going but could follow it all the way through, and upon rewatching you see more clearly how all the puzzle pieces fit together.</p>
<p>I'd argue that Game of Thrones has some very good writing. George Martin needed ways to get all the big players to interact with each other, but in a way that wasn't forced. He needed people to do certain things, but without compromising their characters. He needed certain people to get certain people to certain places without creating arbitrary reasons.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
