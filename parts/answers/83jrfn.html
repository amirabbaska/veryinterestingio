		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blacklight is actually ultraviolet light, slightly higher energy than visible light.  When fluorescent surfaces absorb ultraviolet light, they give up that energy in two or more steps.  One is in the form of visible light, which is what you see as purple, even when other luminous sources of light are turned off.  The other step(s) are lower energy light that we cannot see, such as infrared.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Follow up question: Why do they bother my eyes? </p>
<p>Background: I have a lens implant in one eye due to a juvenile cataract. Even though I have very little sight in that eye, black lights are one of the very few things that bother it. That said, they bother my normal eye too, just not as much. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
