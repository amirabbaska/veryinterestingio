		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hello I'm an advertising guy. Most of the replies in this thread are not incorrect, but seem to lack knowledge deeper than &quot;because of the brand&quot;.</p>
<p>Start by understanding that advertising is a huge, huge world. In that huge, huge world, you have lots of different 'methods' of advertising. Each type of advertisement will be seen by different people, at different times, will promote different products and will take different forms.</p>
<p>For instance, your advertisement can appear in a magazine, a newspaper, on a webpage, on a flyer, on the radio, on a billboard, or on the television.</p>
<p>Let's assume it's 7pm on a Monday, in a country with a population of 100. 2 of those people will be reading magazines. 3 will be reading newspapers. 10 will be on the internet. 8 will be outside. 1 is listening to the radio. 9 people are not exposed to any type of media. But a whopping 67 people are all watching television!</p>
<p>Your advert can appear in any of the media I just mentioned. But you need to consider the question, 'why am I advertising in this instance?' Are you trying to get people to buy direct from you, there and then? Or are you looking for exposure – for instance, because you're launching a new product?</p>
<p>In the first instance, your advert will be considered &quot;direct response&quot;. Think of an ad you see in the newspaper that has a coupon attached to it. &quot;20% off with this voucher!&quot; You take it to a store, buy a product, and now the store knows that you bought a product after seeing an ad in a magazine. It's instant feedback. Direct response isn't just print, mind you: ever see a TV ad that tells you to ring a phone number? How about an email that takes you straight to an online store? These are all forms of direct response marketing.</p>
<p>In the second instance, the ad is classified as &quot;ATL&quot;, which stands for above the line (direct response is sometimes called below the line; the two definitions are hard to stick to, however, because some ATL advertising can also be direct response, and some BTL may use ATL tactics). You're not looking for quick sales, probably because you're already an established and trusted brand, but you do want to uplift sales – perhaps you're approaching the end of this quarter and you need a sharp uplift in sales to meet your forecast. Or something like that.</p>
<p>Now, let's assume your product is what's classified as an FMCG, which stands for &quot;fast moving consumer goods&quot; – basically anything you buy off the supermarket shelves. Soft drinks, packets of crisps, fruit and vegetables, dairy and laundry detergents, as well as some pieces of hardware, furniture, and electronics.</p>
<p>You don't care who buys your stuff, because there isn't a specific audience. Everyone drinks soft drinks. Everyone sits on sofas. Everyone uses toothpaste. So, at 7pm on a Monday, when you can assume almost everyone in your country of 100 people will be at home, in front of the TV, after a long day's work, that's the best time for you to advertise.</p>
<p>You're just letting people know you're there. But in the week after you've played your TV advertisement, 99% of people in your country will have visited a supermarket or mini-mart. Some of them will want soft drinks. Some of them will want toothpaste. And when they stumble across your product on the shelves, the brand exposure they have already experienced is enough to increase their odds of purchasing your product – and that's a fact.</p>
<p>It's not guaranteed, of course. Your competitors might have run an ad campaign themselves. Or they may have a product next to yours on the shelves that is lower in price. They may even have advertising in the store, which we call POS (point of sale advertising). Such is the wonderful world of marketing.</p>
<p>So, I guess, TL:DR is: you may not pay attention to advertisements, but many other people do. And even if they're not asking you to buy there and then, TV advertising is proven to make you more likely to buy in the long-term.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's say that you were shopping at the supermarket one day and you decided you were going to buy some laundry detergent.  For the sake of simplicity let's also say that in the laundry goods aisle there were only two product brands to choose from: Soapy Suds, and Sunshine detergent.</p>
<p>Now let's assume that at this point you had NEVER even heard of Soapy Suds before.  You know almost nothing about the product except that it's laundry detergent because it states so on the product label, and besides that it's in the laundry detergent section of the store.  However, while you also know little about Sunshine detergent let's assume that you have actually heard several commercials on the television talking about how great the product is.  So you've at least HEARD of that product before, if only in passing.</p>
<p>Faced between purchasing a product you had never heard of before, and purchasing a product that you had (even perhaps a semblance of a passing notion of) it would be human nature to choose the one you had heard of before over the one you knew nothing about.</p>
<p>This is the essence (highly oversimplified) of the power of brand recognition.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most TV commercials are about creating and reinforcing a brand.</p>
<p>Quick question: off the top of your head, when you think of NFL football, which beer comes to mind? If you live in the US, chances are you answered &quot;Bud Light&quot;. And that's because TV advertising works.</p>
<p>It doesn't necessarily mean you are going to go out and buy a case of Bud Light right away, but next time you're in the liquor store staring a fridge full of cases of beers, you will &quot;know&quot; something about Bud Light, as opposed to the 30 other beer brands you've never heard of. And that &quot;knowledge&quot; might influence you to buy Bud Light, because hey, you like NFL football, and it's the official beer of NFL football.</p>
<p>TV ads work because we as human beings simply don't have the time or inclination to exhaustively research every single thing we spend money on every day. We make the vast majority of decisions based on what we &quot;know&quot;, not really caring how we got that information, or taking the time to judge its relevance or verify its accuracy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not necessarily about purchasing something &quot;different&quot; than you normally would. In some cases it's just providing a slight push. Restaurant/fast food ads are a big example here. Sure, if you absolutely never eat fast food or at chain restaurants then those ads mean nothing to you. But most people do have fast food or eat at chain restaurants, even if it's only occasionally. </p>
<p>We live in a age where, if you live in a decently sized town (in the US at least), you have a lot of options when it comes to eating out. There's local restaurants/diners, big chain restaurants like Olive Garden or Outback Steakhouse, and of course fast food. Some people develop habits and just go to the same few places over and over again, but most people want some variety. How do you choose where to eat/order from? Usually it's based on what you're &quot;in the mood for.&quot; Restaurant ads won't make you go anywhere that you'd never be willing to go without the ad, but they can provide a small nudge in one direction or another that could make you choose one place over another:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're hungry and are thinking about getting food. If you see ads for pizza, you might think &quot;hey, I haven't had pizza in a while.&quot; You might decide to get pizza instead of Mexican food or Chinese food or whatever, because why not? You like pizza and it's been a while. </li>
<li>You decide to get pizza. Your options are some local pizza places, or one of the big pizza chains. Maybe there's a local place you like, but it would cost more than you want to spend today, so you decide to go with one of the chains. You vaguely remember that Pizza Hut has some new garlic bread pizza thing, and that Domino's has a some sort of cheap carry-out deal, etc. Some of the things you know about these chains will be from personal experience, and some of the things you know will be from ads. You're not going to make a decision that you'd never be willing to make in the first place, like ordering from a place you hate, but the ads can nudge you into choosing one place over another, for reasons that are perfectly natural.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, ads can nudge &quot;getting food&quot; into &quot;getting pizza&quot;, or nudge &quot;getting pizza&quot; into &quot;getting Pizza Hut.&quot; It won't work all of the time, or even most of the time. But as long as it works on some people some of the time, it's going to have a sizable impact on a chain's business. Maybe they affect your pizza-buying decisions once a year. Even if ads only affect the pizza-buying decisions of every pizza consumer once a year on average, ads would still be responsible for millions of pizza purchases every year. Maybe most of those purchases would still happen without the ads, but the ads will affect which chains people purchase from, as well as whether or not they order from a chain or from a local place. </p>
<p>Now, it's possible that if all the pizza places just agreed to stop advertising, they could save money and people would still buy tons of pizza, because people love pizza. But there are a lot of reasons why that would never happen.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Car adverts aren't to make you go out and buy a car that very same day. They're placed to make you aware that the Volkswagen Jetta is a thing. So that when you decide it is time for a new car, the Jetta might come to mind before the Chevrolet Malibu.</p>
<p>Some adverts are intended to induce rapid buying. Often these are placed by stores. An example would be a grocery store saying &quot;bananas just 39c a pound, fresh Illinois watermelon just $2.99 each, now through Sunday at Food Lion&quot;</p>
<p>I'd like to say it doesn't work, but I know I picked my plumber based on adverts. There's probably other things that don't immediately come to mind.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
