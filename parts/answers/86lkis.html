		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is a castle. Germs are invaders. Your castle has thick walls but needs gates so you can see out of it, take in supplies and get rid of rubbish.</p>
<p>Gates are weak spots so get attacked more often. The throat is the most open to attack as it is moist, warm and we are constantly moving air (containing viruses/bacteria), food which we've touched with our filthy hands etc. across it.</p>
<p>The throat releases chemicals to make it swell up to deliver more blood (and therefore more infection fighting cells, nutrients etc.) to the site of attack. Swelling causes pain, presumably to make us go easy on parts of the body which are under attack.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Infections cause swelling in the lymph nodes which means water goes into them (due to inflammation). There are a lot of lymph nodes in the throat area.  Therefore due to the inflammation and water loss your throat becomes sore. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add on to the lymph node thing, it's also because your body produces mucus when you're sick. Generally even if there isn't enough to be a runny nose it can still go down your throat at night and this dries out and irrates your throat causing it to feel sore in the morning. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you damage your skin like a burn, or a scrape, how does that feel? You feel the damage as a kind of burning, like your skin is torn up. It's the same for your nasal cavaties, throat, esophagus, tonsils, etc. </p>
<p>When a virus infects a cell, it hijacks the cells DNA factories, and causes it to pump out copies of the virus, until it literally pops under the strain. Where as a burn destroys cells from a mechanical damage, a virus destroys cells from a cellular damage. Both result in damage to the tissues, pain, swelling, and talking like the guy from Independence Day &quot;Ooh I got to call my mother!&quot; </p>
<p>Illness can also be caused by fungal infections, or bacterial infections. Fungal infections can cause a layer of fungal cells to spread out across the throat in patches, causing discomfort, and sometimes the fungal cells attack the lining of the throat or feed off it, like mushrooms breaking down a fallen log in the woods. Bacterial infections can similarly result in cellular damage, oozing, and bacterial colonies killing off healthy cells. </p>
<p>We have these bacteria and fungal cells in us and on us all the time, but they are usually kept in check by each other (competition) and by our bodies immune system. If we become weak from illness, drugs, lack of sleep, physical exhaustion, etc, they may gain a foot hold and start an infection. Often times taking antibiotics for instance can lead to a thrush fungal infection in the mouth, taking steroids like methylprednisolone (used to relieve symptoms of severe flu and allergies) can lower the bodies immune response, allowing bacterial infections, etc. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
