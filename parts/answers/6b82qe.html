		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are, many of them former from trapped gas pockets during volcanic eruptions, or groundwater eroding softer stone and then changes in flow leave the chamber intact but unreachable. </p>
<p>There are several ways to find such voids, we can detect them by drilling when the bit drops unexpectedly, if they are close enough to the surface using ground penetrating radar, from orbit if they are large enough by temperature variances where none should be there, or using a technique to measure electrical resistance across a given section of dirt in areas with the right soil type and moisture content (the void space doesn't conduct electricity so the value is lower than a solid chunk)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This reminds me of this cave  in Romania that was undisturbed for millions of years. </p>
<p>When they stumbled upon it they found a bunch of insects and the like that had evolved differently - because there was no light they were blind and had little or no colour to them, but their antenna were longer and more sensitive. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many 'caves' that have no opening to the outside will likely be filled with hostile gasses from hydrogen sulfide near fossil fuel areas like the Permian Basin, or just regular carbon dioxide, so they would be fatal to visit simply because they can't exchange air with the atmosphere. These caves wouldn't have the stalactites and stalagmites as that also requires outside air for the CO2 to degas from the water droplets so they can drop their mineral content. These voids are basically toxic spaces, but there is no way to know how many there are. Some are quite deep too, like 1,000 feet below the surface. Carlsbad Caverns, for instance, has 5 main floors. They all formed with no connection to the surface until the uplift of the Guadalupe Mtns about 8-10 million years ago lifted the gypsum filled voids out of the acidic water table. Once the entrance collapsed in, air could exchange and the scenic formations began to grow, the bats moved in, etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Karchner caverns in Arizona were found by observing bats. The cave was kept secret for decades till the state could protect them. Even the rancher that owned the property wasn't told. What's interesting and pertinent to your question is that the rancher knew where the cave was before they told him the location. He could hear a hollow sound when he rode his horse over the top of the cave.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are still plenty of caves we DO know about that have not been explored. The Mammoth Caves in Kentucky have over 400 miles mapped, and there are plenty of known branches that nobody has yet explored. They know the water in the Mammoth Caves flows into another mapped cave system that is over 100 miles long, but they have not found the connection yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
