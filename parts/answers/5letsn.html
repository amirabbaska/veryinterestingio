		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Newspaper columns are justified on both the left and right, which means that the left margin and the right margin are both straight (see <a href="http://www.visionengravers.com/support/images/CNCEngravingGlossary/Justification.gif" target="_blank">this image</a> for a visual explanation).</p>
<p>There are a couple of techniques you can use to get both margins straight, and usually you use a combination of both: you can use hyphenation to break up longer words, and you can adjust the spacing between words, or between individual letters.</p>
<p>In most publications you barely notice it, but newspapers typically use very narrow columns. Because they use such narrow columns, it's harder to get the text to justify correctly, and often words or letters are spaced out so far it becomes noticeable.</p>
<p>In the days before computers were used to set type, this was done by hand, and it's a very difficult thing to get exactly right: newspapers had to be printed very quickly, so text justification was often done poorly. With modern technology, the process can be automated, but now the problem is getting the software to understand what looks neat and professional to a human, and what doesn't.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The composition software they use to format the columns figures out how many words will fit on a line without hyphenating anything, and then evens out the spacing between the letters to exactly fill up the whole line. Sometimes a line doesn't have a lot of characters in it, so the spacing ends up really big. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I worked at a company that published scientific journals. If the journal's style guide specified justified we would often spend an hour on a single article adjusting kerning to get words to bump to the next line to fix these kinds of issues. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All of the space on a news page used to be considered expensive real-estate back in the day. Of course, it still is today, just not so much. Even to this day, there's actually a bunch of rules that are applied to use as much of the available space as possible, and justification happens to be one of them.</p>
<p>Justification is when lines of text are spread out to use the entire line, rather than just moving to the next line when the next word won't fit. This often involves hyphenating the last word after a syllable. However, this isn't possible for single-syllable words, and a highly spaced out line like what you're referencing is the result. </p>
<p>Some other rules involve wording article titles so that the entire width of the article is used (for however many lines long the title is; usually no more than two), and making sure that the story uses the entire length of the column it's allocated--no more, no less. This second rule usually involves omitting sections of the original story, adding a few &quot;needless&quot; lines, or in modern days where we can waste space anyway, adding a quote block from the story. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We used to get weekly readers in elementary school. I noticed the weird typesetting and asked the teacher why it was like that. She explained that when a word couldn't be broken up with a hyphen, they would space the letters to make the column even on both sides. Before then I always thought that it was a way to show your eyes that this line had some kind of importance above all the others.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
