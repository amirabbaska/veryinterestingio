		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most cultures have &quot;coming of age&quot; rituals, whether they realize it or even recognize what they are. For Americans, getting a car is one, as well as moving out on your own. A lot of this is stemmed from the fact that we value independence and self motivation so much. Staying with your parents implies that you are being lazy, or continuing to be a burden on them. It's similar to people judging someone who is letting their children breastfeed at six-years-old. By staying with your parents, who don't need your help and are often eager to get you out of the house, you are &quot;delaying&quot; maturity.</p>
<p>Personally, I think this stems from a couple of different things. Historically, Americans had their children young, and had a lot of them. My grandmother never went past the 4th grade and had three children by the time she was eighteen. While she was married, my grandfather was in construction and would use that as an excuse to leave them months at a time, drinking all of the money he earned and never giving her any. So she stayed with her parents. This was considered shameful. While she was working in a shirt factory, my great-grandfather was the main means of support for them, even though he was older and had health issues. She was a burden on them. </p>
<p>In Asian cultures, there is a big emphasis on staying with your parents and getting a good job so you can send them money in their old age. But in the last fifty years or so, American culture has gotten accustomed to the idea that parents are wealthy enough to take care of themselves, so your filial duty to your parents is more akin to making sure you visit them. But even then, when the economy has required most people to move for their jobs, it's commonplace that children live states away, which compared to Europe, is like having all of your children live several countries away from you.</p>
<p>Now, we have a conundrum. Young adults struggle to find non-service jobs, and when they do, they are still struggling to support themselves on one income, leading them to stay with their parents. While they are belittled for this, within a decade or so, that same generation will have little to nothing saved up for retirement. With medical expenses looming, they are starting to demand that children who don't live with them to come back and help them.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, our society was capable of the older generation sustaining themselves while the younger generation did the same in the same immediate area. This led to a lot of our current perceptions. But now, good work is scarcer, causing people who stay in their hometown to have jobs that barely keep them floating above water, or moving and not being able to care for the family that once wanted to kick them out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><em>TL;DR</em>: <strong>It's not all about money</strong>. There's all sorts of different reasons why it's worth shelling out a lot more cash for.</p>
<p>A big one is pride due to social expectations. There's a certain negative and slightly embarrassing status associated with living at home versus a more adult-seeming being-in-charge of your own surroundings when you're living in a bachelor pad or equivalent. It's doubly so when your peer group of friends or workmates all have their own places and you don't have the freedom to invite them over. Ditto the mooching aspect of being a stay-at-home adult/child. Eventually, to a lot of people, it just doesn't seem... right or fair and so they move out. And we as humans want to &quot;own&quot; stuff, and be able to look around at our own little spot and say &quot;this is mine because I'm paying for it / renting it out of my own pocket.&quot;</p>
<p>Some people find that being too close to their parents eventually drive them nuts. They want to live a certain way or not have any limitations on their behaviors. But there's often conditions on having someone else's roof over your head and those eventually become too onerous. OP asked about this from an American perspective, and so it's quite appropriate that one of the key reasons is &quot;freedom&quot;. :)</p>
<p>Others reach a point in a relationship where it's too clumsy and confined to enjoy that relationship at their parents. Most parents don't appreciate their kid having a sex-buddy in their bedroom for a whole weekend. Thumpthumpthump from the second floor becomes old rather quickly.</p>
<p>The parents have a say too, particularly if they're approaching retirement. &quot;Junior, get the hell out so we can live our own life and we won't have to waste our limited money on feeding you!&quot;. They want the house to look and feel the same as before they left for that one-week tour in the camper, not come home to an empty fridge and an unwashed sinkful of dishes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Independence is pretty important in American culture. That's why so many Americans move far from their hometown upon graduation, this usually begins in College. Americans get their first taste of &quot;freedom&quot; from the dominance and control of their parents. We want to be able to do the things we like, without judgement from the previous generation who may not agree with the decisions we make.</p>
<p>On the flip side, not leaving your parents home in your 20s is seen as negative here if you are a healthy fully functional adult. It is viewed as incompetence or laziness from some Americans because you don't have the financial independence or education to provide for yourself, let alone a family.</p>
<p>It is also seen as more acceptable for a woman to be living with her parents than a man. That I don't really have an explanation for besides maybe it's a sexual/dating thing. If both parties live with their parents then who's home would you go to? Since still in this day and age men are primarily considered the providers, they're the ones more likely expected to have a place of their own. This also speaks for financial independence which because of the previous statements is typically viewed favorably on a man by the opposite gender.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an middle aged American, there was a time especially in the 1970s
and early 1980s that you would be publicly ridiculed if you hit 19 yo and you were not:  1. At college, 2. In the military, 3. Living in your own apartment while working a full time job. The terms &quot;loser&quot;, &quot;moocher&quot;, &quot;deadbeat&quot; were common insults heaped upon those legal adults still living at home with their parents. The reason was that apartment rents, cars, college tuition, food, utilities and entertainment were ridiculously cheap compared to today's world. You could work a factory job 40 hrs a week and could afford a new car and your own apartment if not your own home. That world is gone today. Wages have generally stagnated for the past 40 years but the cost of living has skyrocketed. I can't think of a single person including me who borrowed money to attend a university because it was pretty cheap especially the state colleges. Unfortunately, parents today who are my age think that their kids are not doing as well as they did due to their own fault. This is ignorant and naive thinking. Smart kids will not even go to college at all today and start a small business like a pizza place or get a skilled trade. Animal house is long, long over folks.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a somewhat complex question because I believe many factors come in play. In more eastern cultures, children don't move out until they have graduated university or landed their main full time job (source: am easterner). In many western families it's 18-out. And I think a comparaison of these two philosophies goes a long way. And I think it's hard to ELI5 it. Basically IMO the western culture one (note: not every western family does this obviously) puts you in a shit position at first, you're young and poor and clueless. But you learn on your own and become very responsible because of that. On the opposite, the eastern one, you move out only when you're comfortable financially. You live no pressure and arguably an &quot;easier&quot; young adulthood. But is that good? Maybe it causes more happiness due to less stress. And it might also make you less responsible and auto-sufficient because you haven't been through the shit those 18-out people have.</p>
<p>I think a middle ground is ideal. But to answer your question, it's a mixture of social expectations in the west, and also getting the person to be able to live on their own. Kinda like the bird mama who watches the baby birds jumping off the nest so they can eventually fly on their own thing. Idk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
