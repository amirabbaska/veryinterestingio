		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surgeon here, from UK. Excellent question! And one that I didn't know the answer to until actually went through it! I previously worked in a hospital in London when there was a large fire within the building, in the basement.</p>
<p>Although there was no fire actually within the operating theatres, it affected the ventilation system and smoke was entering the ORs.  The Clinical lead (head doctor of the hospital) informed all theatres that all operating to cease ASAP. </p>
<p>What ended up happening was: Those that were almost finished hurried up, those that had just started stopped, those that were literally half-way through just covered up as best they could (made it as a safe as possible, cover the wound etc) and the still-anaesthetised patient was wheeled to a &quot;pop-up&quot; ITU somewhere safe &amp; away from the smoke. </p>
<p>As it happened the fire was quickly brought under control, ventilation system was disabled and the few (1 or 2) patients that needed it went back to theatre the next day I think. </p>
<p>Although less than ideal patients can be kept anaesthetised for quite a while and could even be transferred to other hospitals if required (which is what I'd imagine you'd have to do if someone was actually on CPB (cardio-pulmonary bypass). Would be a massive pain in the arse logistically, but when there's a need these things get sorted. </p>
<p>There wasn't any cardiac at this hospital so that particular scenario wasn't encountered... </p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many hospitals have their fire alarms set up in zones. So each wing/floor/area is its own zone. When the fire alarm is activated in a zone, either from a pull station or a detector, the audible alarm will only sound in the affected zone. It will also close all the fire doors in the area, which are held open by magnets. The fire department receives the activation and responds while hospital security will go to investigate if there is a fire. Hospital staff or the fire department can expand the activated areas as needed, and usually the rest hospital will be notified of a fire alarm somewhere in the hospital by an announcement for a &quot;Code Red.&quot; along with the area of the hospital that is affected. Because of this set up, its unlikely the surgical procedure would be impacted at all. Even if the activation was in the same zone, they would most likely continue as long as no flames or smoke were seen.</p>
<p>This may not be the set up in all hospitals, but has been in the ones I have worked with.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everyone in the hospital is taught race and pass before you even get to your station. Hospitals are built to compartmentalized fires so race:</p>
<p>R = Recuse &amp; remove anyone from immediate danger
A = activate alarm
C = Contain - close the doors, most systems do this for you these days
E = extinguish small fires or evacuate if in harms way</p>
<p>P = Pull
A = Aim
S = Squeeze
S = Sweep</p>
<p>You do not evacuate a hospital because a fire alarm is triggered. It is common to be triggered because of the lab and other departments. Like a high rise in a major city, unless immediate damaged presents itself you wait for instruction before evacuating. The only difference between a hospital and any other building is the design to compartmentalized the fire and not allow it to spread. Other buildings besides hospitals are erected this way but not your standard house or high rise due to cost.</p>
<p>You could ask what happens during surgery and a power outage. The simple answer is very expensive generators with flkywheels. You won't even see a blip in the lights.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Where I'm on placement, hospitals are designed with this in mind using a concept called compartmentalisation. Each ward/section/area is a different 'compartment' separated by fire resistant walls and separated by fire doors with an estimated time of 60 minutes (i.e. They are theoretically able to withstand a direct flame for a total of 60 minutes). This both buys time for moving patients and limits damage caused in the event of a fire. </p>
<p>Therefore, throughout the hospital there are two fire alarm types:</p>
<p>1) Continuous: the compartment you are currently in contains a fire. In this event, if it is not a false alarm, measures may need to be taken in order to stabilise and move the patient into another compartment, in order to continue the surgery there. </p>
<p>2) Intermittent: a compartment adjacent to the one you are currently in contains the fire. I imagine in this case, the surgeons would attempt to continue with the operation in the assumption that they are not under any immediate threat, as in theory even in the event of a serious fire, their compartment will not be at risk for another 60 minutes, in which time emergency services will notify them of the very real danger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've been in an operating theatre when the fire alarm went off - a naked acutely psychotic man was crawling through the ceilings of the hospital, setting things on fire. Seriously. </p>
<p>False alarms go off quite often, so nobody panicked, just rolled their eyes. But smoke started seeping in under the theatre door so then we knew it was real. </p>
<p>We were doing abdominal surgery on a 1 year old child. Very calmly, the surgeon and anaesthetist stated that if the smoke became stronger they expected all the other theatre staff to leave, and they would stay until they were overwhelmed. </p>
<p>Luckily the smoke didn't become stronger..... we didn't have to find out at what point the surgeon and anaesthetist would abandon their patient. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
