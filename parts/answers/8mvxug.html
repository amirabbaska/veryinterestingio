		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have gone into the software, but another factor is the hardware.  All the electronics, including the screen, have to be able to work in an extreme range of temperatures.  That screen needs to work on a winter day when it's-40 just as well as a summer afternoon when the inside of the car is 150 degrees.  Touch screens that can handle temperatures swings like that aren't known for their responsiveness, and are not cheap to boot.  </p>
<p>Your cheap Amazon tablet is not made to work in those conditions, or to repeatedly cycle between them.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another factor that someone with more expertise could expound upon is the fact that cars are subject to very stringent regulation. This makes the development and testing of large software programs meticulous and expensive. Thus, manufacturers tend to stick to the bare minimum.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest explanation is that car companies are terrible at building infotainment units.  This is because of a few factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cars don't get &quot;upgraded&quot; - you refine one component, and then reuse it for several years in many models without a plan for replacing it in already existing cars.  If a head unit is passable in 2005, it will be trash in 2009 but still be installed in new cars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliability/safety standards - car makers do not like building things that fail quickly.  As a result, infotainment setups tend to be bulky and use well-tested (which translates to slow) hardware.  They also lock users out when the car starts moving, because every single time someone slips up and hits the gas instead of the brakes, they start a media frenzy.  Look how bad it is for Tesla - people ignore Autopilot's repeated warnings and crash, but it's still somehow their fault.</p>
</li>
<li>&quot;Not made here&quot; syndrome - Luxury cars <em>have</em> to be exclusive.  This means that every automaker tries to build their own system.  None of them are actually willing (or able) to invest the money to make them polished and smooth, and it shows.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are slowly changing with companies like Tesla and services like CarPlay and Android Auto, but broadly speaking none of these apply to cheap Android tablets or phones.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
