		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Higgs boson was the last major prediction of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, but for many years it's discovery eluded physicists.  The Higgs mechanism tells us how elementary particles get their mass.  You can imagine the Higgs field being like treacle.  Particles which couple to the Higgs field will slow down from the speed of light in the field.  If they do so, they have mass, like the electron.  If not, they are massless, like the photon.  There Higgs boson is an excitation of this field, like a vibrating spring in a mattress, and finding one confirms that the field exists and the mechanism is correct.  </p>
<p>But the Higgs boson was predicted to have a very high mass (although the exact value could not be predicted), and therefore would be very short lived because it could quickly decay to lighter particles.  This means you don't see many of them hanging around, so you need to put a lot of energy into one place to make one.  This is one of the reasons why scientists built the LHC, as it allows us to accelerate particles to extremely high energy, smash them together, and see what the energy of that collision makes by analysing the products.  They managed to do this in 2012.  </p>
<p>So, finding the Higgs boson confirms the last major piece of the Standard Model.  But it also has more potential than that.  While the Standard Model does a great job of explaining everything it tries to, it leaves a lot out, namely gravity.  If we can find any irregularities in the properties of the Higgs from what the Standard Model predicts, we might be able to find a lead to the new physics we desperately need to connect quantum field theory with gravity.  More analysis of the Higgs will be done in the coming months and years to see if we can find any such leads.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok so quick tl;dr version of  quantum field theory. </p>
<p>1: A field is a function defined over some region space and time. If that sounds scary it's not. You're used to some of these, think gravitational fields and magnetic fields. </p>
<p>2: In the case of quantum fields, they're what give rise to the fundamental particles. Individual particles are excitations in their related quantum field. Basically this means there is for example one electron field and every election can be described as an excited state of that field. That's a littreal scarier, but the nutshell is that if you find a fundamental particle, it means it's field is also a thing. </p>
<p>3: The interactions between those particles can be described by the interactions between the corresponding quantum fields. The higgs field in particular is of major interest, because interactions with it are why some particles have mass, which is why everything isn't traveling at light speed and why we're here talking about this. You'll note the lack of qualifiers in that sentence, a couple years ago the words &quot;we think&quot; would have been included there. </p>
<p>4: Those fields are a PITA to study directly. You can use QFT to make empirical predictions and etc, but you can't realy point at something and go &quot;yup that's the higgs field&quot; </p>
<p>5: fortunately if the field exists it has a corresponding particle, and particles are things you can point at. So if you find the higgs boson (which is the particle associated with the higgs field), and its properties  match the theoretically predicted ones by extensions you've gone a long way to confirming the existence of and the properties of the higgs field. Which is kind of a big deal, if you do that you get to move from &quot;we'll this is probably right&quot; to  &quot;yup this is definitely how things work&quot; </p>
<p>In the case of the higgs boson it was a big deal because it had been predicted to be a thing back in the 60s and half a century of waiting for confirmation is a long time to build hype, especially when it proved to be much much harder to create and detect than initially expected. The LHC was built in large part to finally find the damn thing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It verified parts of our current mathematical model of the fundamental functions of our universe, which predicted the existence of the particle, though that partical had never been observed.</p>
<p>That means our current model of the universe is close to correct in this area, and is therefore useful for predicting how certain things behave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In science we need to keep on pushing and discovering to make sense.</p>
<p>We are eager to break our own theory.</p>
<p>For example, once atom was considered to be the unbreakable.</p>
<p>And now we know it can be broken to protons, neutrons and so on.</p>
<p>Finding smaller elements opens up new explanation, better understanding and hopefully some application.</p>
<p>Sometimes, we get stuck because of our past discoveries. New discoveries helps us in finding whether we should keep doing it or find different ways.</p>
<p>Hope this helps. Stay Awesome.</p>
