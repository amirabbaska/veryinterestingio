<blockquote>
<p>MentalFlossÂ reports smell plays a large part of our sense of taste, so Jelly Belly's resident flavor scientist starts by finding a source for the scent. Once the source is found, it is then placed in a gas chromatograph, which turns the item into vapor - typically after it's been dissolved, boiled, or heated - and examines its chemical makeup.</p>
<p>After the chemical makeup has been identified, it is then turned into a flavor maker. These flavor makers serve as the starters used by the team to create jelly beans.
This process has been used to create a number of the more unique flavors found in Bertie Bott's Every Flavored Beans and Jelly Belly's BeanBoozled line, including stinky socks and rotten eggs.</p>

Dug up the recipe and tweaked it for the Bertie Botts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
