<p>There are two possibilities : </p>
<p>1) The universe is infinite</p>
<p>2) The universe is finite, but has no boundary. The universe would be looping on itself, and when you travel to one edge you just end up on the other side. This is the 3D equivalent of a pac-man world, in which when you cross the boundary on one side you're back on the other.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others point out, the universe probably doesn't have a definite boundary, and even if it did it is outside the observable universe. However, that shouldn't prevent us from imagining what such a boundary could look like.</p>
<p>From a General Relativity perspective, there are several ways of designing a universe with a a definite boundary. The simplest one is probably the reflecting boundary condition. Here is a toy metric with that property:</p>
<p>ds^2 = -Heaviside(x)^(-1) dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2</p>
<p>This metric has an infinitely tall gravitational potential for x&lt;0 (Heaviside(x) is the Heaviside step function, which is 0 for x&lt;0 and 1 for x&gt;0. I'm using it here because I assume you want a hard edge rather than a fuzzy edge), making it impossible for anything to move past it. All matter and radiation would be reflected, so it would look like a perfect mirror. Flying into it with your spaceship would be like flying into a copy of yourself coming from the opposite direction.</p>
<p>(It might be tempting to use the metrix ds^2 = -dt^2 + Heaviside(x) dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^(2), since that looks like a metric where the x coordinate becomes meaningless for x&lt;0. But this doesn't actually work - it's just an extreme unit change for x&lt;0).</p>
<p>More complicated behavior is also possible. For example, space could become 1-dimensional:</p>
<p>ds^2 = -dt^2 + dx^2 + Heaviside(x)(dy^(2)+dz^(2))</p>
<p>or fray into a web of rolled-up dimensions, or whatever.</p>
<p>However, all of this falls into the domain of &quot;metric engineering&quot;. I'm just writing down these metrics without any accompanying explanation for how they would arise, or whether they would be stable, etc.. I'm not aware of any reasonable theory that predicts a hard edge to the universe like this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe as a whole (ie well beyond the <em>observable</em> universe) most likely has no boundary. It is either just infinite and open, continuing forever, or finite but closed, like a torus.  So there's no real way to talk about the edge of the universe because it isn't a prediction of any sophisticated cosmological models.</p>
<p>However, there is a related question I think is more meaningful: if inflation is correct then inflation is most likely eternal.  This means the universe consists of an expanse of still inflating regions, dotted by tiny pocket/bubble universes where inflation has stopped, with new bubbles constantly forming.  Our observable universe is just a subregion of one such bubble.  </p>
<p>These bubbles, as far as I understand it, are finite, and therefore have boundaries.  So I think it is meaningful to ask what the conditions are like at the edge of our bubble.  Even though we can never access this region of spacetime, such a place does exist (unlike a boundary for the <em>total</em> universe).  However, I don't know the answer to this.  But whenever your question comes up, the answer is always to correctly reject the premise of a boundary for the total universe, and not mention this parallel question with respect to our local bubble universe.</p>
<p>To some extent, I think the answer is unclear because there is also an idea in eternal inflation that various constants in physics (eg particle masses and symmetries, Higgs vev) are restricted to bubbles, and vary from bubble to bubble.  So possibly the edge of our bubble would be a place where our normal physics just stops working.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To start, making a reply to this question within the rules of &quot;AskScience&quot; is practically improbable.  The question is setting an environmental variable that is in its own nature &quot;speculative&quot;.  The answer would fall into the category of speculation because we have to define what the boundary is.  We can only speculate on what the boundary is, because we don't know for a fact what the boundary is.  As such, this question should be a discussion.</p>
<p>In order for the human eye to see something, there must be energy particles radiating from this boundary that are inside the human eye's visibility range.  Otherwise, there must be energy particles radiating that an instrument can detect and report said anomaly.</p>
<p>If the boundary is an endless void, it really is not a boundary, and matter or energy can move beyond it and back.  This is basically an observed boundary because nothing exists beyond this point.  Anything that leaves beyond this point has no means to return, as there is nothing to act upon to have an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>If the boundary acts like the context of a blackhole where anything that passes beyond will never return, then there is nothing to radiate light and nothing to bounce radiated light from.  Therefore, it will appear as an endless void, and anything that passes into it will disappear, forever.  This is a special applied case of the endless void, except the boundary actually exists in nature.</p>
<p>If the boundary does not allow anything to pass beyond it, never lost to an endless void or blackhole condition, then anything hitting that boundary should bounce off of it, perfectly.  As such, it should appear like a perfect mirror.  If this boundary does not perfectly reflect everything, then that means matter or energy can be destroyed.  Otherwise, it is a wall that could be broken through, and therefore no longer qualifies as a boundary to the universe.</p>
<p>Alternatively if the boundary does not reflect everything that hits it perfectly, there is a special unknown anomaly that can create a visible wall on some spectrum where whatever hits it is converted from one arrangement of matter or energy into another energy, and yet all energy and matter hitting this barrier must be released elsewhere along the barrier.  Under this condition, I have no idea what such a boundary would look like unless I know how the energy and matter return from it.</p>
<p>For the last consideration of a possible boundary, I must set this example with navigating the surface of Earth.  If I move in one direction, I will never reach an &quot;end&quot; to the Earth because the surface wraps around a sphere, but the surface of this sphere has a finite area.  Due to that finite area, we can draw the surface like a map, setting &quot;boundaries&quot; where moving beyond one boundary wraps you around to the other side of the map, or basically the map repeats itself beyond that &quot;boundary&quot;.  Consider this boundary in the universe, you would continue to see the universe, as the universe would continue infinitely but has a finite volume of space that can be mapped and such imaginary boundaries set for where the map repeats itself.</p>
<p>Another note, nothing can radiate from beyond this boundary because nothing else exists beyond the boundary, except for the case where space has finite volume but repeats itself in every direction.</p>
<p>Multiple edits, because I keep forgetting something...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This isn't really a question that science can answer. You're basically asking &quot;if things weren't as they are, how would they be?&quot;. It'd be like saying &quot;if 1 + 1 didn't equal 2, what would it equal?&quot;. They're nonsensical questions that could have any completely arbitrary answer.</p>
<p>There's no indication of any sort of boundary at the &quot;edge&quot; of the universe. Our best guess is that it either goes on forever, or it loops back on itself (possibly in some complex geometry). If it didn't go on forever, and also didn't loop back on itself? Well, then it's anybody's guess what the edge would look like. But that's just it - any idea would be a wild guess without any evidence backing it. One thing we know for sure is that the universe <em>is</em> larger than the observable portion of the universe, so even if there were some sort of edge we're never going to be able to see it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
