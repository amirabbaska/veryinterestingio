		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;helium shortage&quot; is actually a reaction to massive helium stockpiling of the US starting with the Helium Act of 1925 for use in airships and later on as a coolant during the Cold War and the Space Race. The idea was that it may be a critical natural resource similar to oil, but the progression of technology determined that it wasn't really that important and it was decided that the billion cubic meters of the gas we had collected should be sold off.</p>
<p>This dramatically dropped the price of helium for decades, as the US government was selling a seemingly unlimited supply off at bargain prices. The &quot;shortage&quot; is that the US is coming to the end of their fire sale of helium which means the price will begin to rise to the actual cost of production, which means applications designed around the historically low cost of helium now are looking at a big price bump.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't a shortage, and there isn't likely to be much of one in the future.</p>
<p>Helium can be collected as a by-product of natural gas extraction.
The US has large, helium-rich natural gas reserves, and during the Cold War, stockpiled it into strategic reserves.  When they decided to liquidate those reserves starting in the 1990s, it depressed the price of helium.  People go used to cheap helium, and it became unprofitable to collect from natural gas and was simply allowed to escape into the atmosphere.  In addition, one particularly large helium reserve in the US is starting to run dry, and is expected to be depleted by the 2020s.</p>
<p>Should there be a shortage of helium, the price will rise, and it will once again become profitable to collect it, increasing supply.  This is  in fact already happening.  Qatar has nearly tripled their helium production since 2008, and has become the second largest producer in the world.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was reading <a href="https://www.wired.com/2016/06/dire-helium-shortage-vastly-inflated/" target="_blank">this article</a> which says that the shortage isn't what you think it is.</p>
<p>Basically, we waste so much helium when going after fossil fuels, that if helium were to become more valuable, they would extract the helium instead of just letting it go into the atmosphere.  With the price of helium as it is now, it's not worth their time to extract it.</p>
<p>Washington Post had a similar article on the same day as the Wired article.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That is a very good question. It's not that there is a shortage of helium it is that while the supply of helium is steady, the demand is increasing. As long as there is uranium in the earths crust, we will have helium getting trapped in non porous rock and mixing with natural gas and petroleum. </p>
<p>The constant but limited supply, changes in usage and storage, and increased demand has however caused prices to rise. Novelty uses for helium simply charge more for their products to make up the difference, but it's use in science is usually not for profit. And so it puts a dent in the budget of universities and scientific research. </p>
<p>Scientific use scenarios often reclaim any helium used in the experiments so the net loss is low. But novelty uses allow the helium to leak into the atmosphere, float up to space and literally float away. That is the real problem. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
