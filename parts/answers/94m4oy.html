		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><ol>
<li>
<p>High stakes games are often built around a few wealthy players who are not pros and who usually lose a lot of money to the pros.  With seven pros and three rich guys who are almost sure to lose, most of the pros are likely to come out way ahead.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mid-stakes are where most pros play, and non-pros far outnumber pros in those games.  A large fraction of pros just grind out a $50,000 or so income in these games in local casinos around the country, and arenâ€™t trying to play against the top guys in the world.</p>
</li>
<li>Tournaments typically have far more non-pros than pros.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's also worth noting that there's a lot of tournament deal making at large tournaments, which makes the prize pool not so top heavy.  Perhaps the last four players decide to split - everyone gets a percentage of the combined top 4 prizes.  Other times, players will buy a percentage of winnings.  I'll pay $10000 for 5% of your winnings.  You're guaranteed $10000, and I get a large cut if you go far.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sponsorships which only became big after internet poker must help a lot.</p>
<p>It is very hard to pay expenses in a physical tournament: travel/lodging/food/entry fee (house cut, I mean) and come out ahead in the long run. Many top players or players who had a string of successes end up in serious financial difficulties.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
