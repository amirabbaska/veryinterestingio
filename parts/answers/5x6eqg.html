		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll copy <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/1lncep/why_are_tornados_predominantly_a_north_american/cc14g8x" target="_blank">one of my old answers</a>. It's not exactly for five year olds, but I hope it's easy enough for the layman:</p>
<p>There are many factors which go into making a large part of the US the perfect tornado breeding ground, but the most important are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Access to heat and humidity for a large portion of the country.</strong> A major ingredient needed for tornadoes is heat and humidity near the earth's surface, as this allows for high <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convective_available_potential_energy" target="_blank">Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE)</a>, or atmospheric energy which can be converted into rapid rising motion found in strong thunderstorms. Because the eastern half of the US is north of the very warm Gulf of Mexico, and the central portion of the US is flat with very few terrain features, heat and moisture can easily stream north and cover a large portion of the country.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To expand on the above point, <strong>large areas devoid of major terrain</strong>. Tornadoes, while powerful, are quite sensitive to terrain variations. Tornadoes can occasionally form in mountainous areas, but it is much easier to form tornadoes in a flat region, such as that found in much of the central and southeastern United States, than it is in a mountainous region. Trees, however, have little or nothing to do with the prevalence of tornadoes: the southeastern US is heavily forested yet still sees <a href="http://www.ustornadoes.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/violent-tornadoes-f4-ef4-and-f5-ef5-in-the-united-states.gif" target="_blank">a great deal of violent tornadoes</a>. A few people on my original post fairly criticized my point that tornadoes need a flat area to form. This may not be entirely true: the vast, flat plains of the central US do allow for warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico to easily flow northward, which is a major factor in making favorable conditions for tornadoes over a large area, but while <a href="http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/WAF957.1" target="_blank">it's generally accepted that rough terrain may impede tornado formation</a>, it's certainly not proven, and strong tornadoes can and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teton%E2%80%93Yellowstone_tornado" target="_blank">have occurred</a> in mountainous areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Location in the mid-latitudes, 30-50 degrees from the equator</strong>. This is important because further north tends to be too cold (which inhibits CAPE), while further south lacks access to the <a href="http://ww2010.atmos.uiuc.edu/%28Gh%29/guides/mtr/cyc/upa/jet.rxml" target="_blank">jet stream</a>, which provides upper-level winds that are required to maintain <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercell" target="_blank">supercell thunderstorms</a>, which spawn almost all significant tornadoes.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>A large mountain range and high desert in the west</strong>. This reason is quite complicated but arguably the most important. The high terrain allows for the formation of a warm, dry layer in the mid-levels of the atmosphere known as an <a href="http://bangladeshtornadoes.org/EML/emlpage.html" target="_blank">Elevated Mixed Layer (EML)</a>, which is then transported eastward over the rest of the country. This EML works to promote tornadoes in three ways. First, the warm layer acts like a &quot;lid&quot; on the atmosphere, preventing thunderstorms from forming right away and allowing the sun to warm the surface for longer during the day. Second, once the storms do begin to form, only the strongest updrafts will make it through the layer, preventing weaker storms from using up the available instability. Third, once the strong storms do form, the rain evaporates in the hot, dry layer, which causes it to cool and increases the surface-based instability even more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit: as for why they are relatively rare in the rest of the world, most other areas lack one or more of the above ingredients, and those areas that do have all the same ingredients are much smaller. For example, the one tornado hotspot that probably rivals the central US in severity is Bangladesh and far eastern India, but this area is only about the size of Iowa, so tornado outbreaks tend to be smaller and less common..</p>
<p>I'm more than willing to provide clarification or answer follow-up questions.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A meteorologist is going to tell me I am wrong, and if that happens go with them over me! But the way the jet stream runs across America it is one of the few places on the world where you have vastly different temperature changes in a very short amount of time, while also having flat terrain for these temperatures to mix on. Desserts are hot, tundra's are cold, mountains are rough, valleys have odd wind currents. So when cold and warm fronts meet they spin around each other which is what causes tornados. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Tornadoes don't just form on a whim, there are certain conditions that need to be present in order for one to occur. The most deadly tornadoes spawn from supercell thunderstorms, which are rotating thunderstorms with a well defined radar circulation, called a mesocyclone. Some areas are more prone to tornadoes because the conditions are conducive to the storms that produce them. In Tornado Alley, for example, the plains get very hot, creating updrafts. When unstable hot air near the ground rises in these updrafts.These collide with the cold, polar air up in the clouds, generating convective precipitation along the collision boundaries. In addition, air in the mid-latitudes often flows at different speeds and directions at varying levels of the troposphere, which causes rotation within the storm cell. So, simply because the large number of convective storms and the favorable conditions, the odds are increased that some of these storms will produce tornadoes. A good percentage do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
