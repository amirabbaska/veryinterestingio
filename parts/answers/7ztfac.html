<p>We strongly think so, especially given the younger age groups and stronger strains available. We won't currently say definitely yes but we're basically warning you this is gonna be a problem someday just the same way alcohol or candy are when you overdue it. It definitely affects the brain and memory and we think the brain isn't that great at fixing things that wear down. We also think there are people who will be just fine and people who get affected so heavily by a small dose they it messes with our results.</p>
<p>TLDR: people should be enjoying occasional low doses as a treat just like anything else.</p>

<p>Marijuana has the capacity to accelerate apoptosis (the natural death of a cell) in cells that are already moving toward death.</p>
<p>The old wives tale that marijuana kills brain cells is true.  They just fail to mention the fact that it's the old, dying brain cells that are being killed, leaving plenty of space for the young, healthy neurons to take up the mantel.</p>
<p>Since memory is stored in certain pathways between neurons in the brain, the individual cells themselves don't hold the memory so much, so you are unlikely to have significant memory loss from marijuana ingestion.</p>
<p>Note:  This applies to individuals over the age of ~25.  This is, roughly, when the brain drastically slows its maturation and development, meaning the vast majority of your memory ingrams are already in place and not as effected my chemical manipulation (i.e. smoking the reefers).</p>
<p>Smoke before age 25, or before your brain has fully matured, CAN lead to some memory issues.  This is because the THC and other cannabinoids interfere with the hormones and chemicals spearheading brain development.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>THC is a systemic depressant, meaning it’s very similar to the brakes in a car. THC slows the body down. If your brain is slowed down chemically, it won’t be able to work as fast as if it was normally functioning. This is something that can contribute to its negative effects on memory. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
