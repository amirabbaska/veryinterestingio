		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Alcohol can be consumed in vapor form as well, although this is very dangerous due to a variety of factors to include; inhalation gets it into your bloodstream much faster (get drunk faster off of less alcohol) which causes more extreme impairment if you don't regulate yourself better, you bypass the liver function of breaking down the alcohol (good if you have a bad liver, bad if you want to have more than a few shots), overdosing becomes extremely easy because you're bypassing the liver, and others.</p>
<p>It can also be consumed by snorting, using the powder you mentioned. This has all the downsides of vapor inhalation.</p>
<p>Finally, it can also be consumed in edible form by turning the liquid into gelatin. Gummy bears are popular. You can also infuse foods with high moisture content, such as cupcakes or fruits.</p>
<p>BONUS QUESTION: All injectable drugs are liquid or become liquid during the process of cooking. You can use cocaine, heroin, meth, and amphetamines this way. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Alcohol is the chemical ethanol. Ethanol is a liquid at most temperatures we consume food at. That limits the choices. Frozen ethanol is cold enough to damage us. Vapor ethanol is a thing, but dangerous.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since Ethanol(the type of alcohol that we drink) itself is a liquid, any solid food or powder containing it needs to absorb or contain it somehow, which limits what you can do with alcoholic consumables. You can for instance, as another commenter mentioned make cakes or similar foods containing alcohol, but such foods will either be sort of liquid(such as a pudding or sauce) and/or have fairly low alcohol content(as most alcohol will evaporate when say, baking a cake).</p>
<p>It's also notable that alcohol is consumed in far greater doses than most other drugs, which is why ethanol being liquid matters. If you compare marijuana for example, the THC(the active substance in marijuana, i.e. the stuff that actually makes you high) is 5-10% of the mass of a joint, which are usually only a few grams to begin with, whereas a beer with a similar % alcohol content is 330 ml, and if you actually want to feel drunk you'd probably drink quite a few of those. </p>
<p>TL;DR: Alcohol is consumed as a liquid because it is liquid, and unlike other drugs you consume a lot of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>why there aren't, for example, alcoholic pills</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most drugs that you'd find in pills are potent enough that you only need 10s or 100s of milligrams of the drug to see an effect.  This can be stuffed into a pill easily.</p>
<p>Let's say it takes you 3 beers to get drunk.  Using a standard can (12oz = 355ml) and assuming a strength of 5% ABV, that's 50ml of pure alcohol - a whole shotglass worth.  You'd either have a lot of pills or a <em>very</em> large pill.</p>
<p>...this ignores the fact that pure alcohol is <em>not</em> gentle on your system and having all the extra water in your beverages helps prevent damage.  It also ignores the fact that anything with 100% alcohol is dangerously flamable.</p>
<hr />
<p>BTW, if you ever start wondering &quot;why can't we just have some pills for food&quot;, the same logic applies.  Fat is the densest form of calories available.  Butter is pretty much straight fat and a stick of butter only has 800 calories.  These &quot;food pills&quot; would amount to eating 2+ sticks of butter per day.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
