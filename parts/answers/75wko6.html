		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, in Newtonian circular orbits, escape velocity is about 41% greater than orbital velocity. In highly eccentric elliptical orbits, the orbital speed at the closest point in the orbit (periapsis) can get pretty close to escape velocity. However, you must remember it's called escape velocity because it's the velocity that lets you escape.</p>
<p>There is also the case of photon orbits around black holes, which are technically at the black hole's escape velocity but it's a different set of physics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Isn't this a somewhat tautological question? Escape velocity is by definition the speed an object must go to leave the gravitational pull of another object. An orbit is by definition tied to the gravity of another object. Isn't it logically impossible to do both?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By definition escape velocity will not result in an orbit if there's no additional deceleration. The only possible exception to this I can think of is if you start below the surface but since gravity reduces the farther below the surface you get, I'm not sure this changes anything. Note that any point within a spherical shell receives 0 gravity force from the shell.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but it wouldn't be an orbit in the normal sense.  Your rocket would require a thrust vector aimed at the center of the planet/star to make up for the gravity not being strong enough to counteract the centrifugal force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One thing that the other posters neglected to mention is that this only holds true for Newtonian mechanics. Since you specified plant/star, this technically correct, but, if your orbiting around a black hole, relativity rears its ugly head and allows for orbits at escape velocity (or, potentially even, above escape velocity).</p>
<p>Scott Manley made a youtube video that explains this quite well: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM8HvoaKsBU" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IM8HvoaKsBU</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
