		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The photons don't decay, they get absorbed by the walls, furniture, and other things in the room. When they get absorbed, they are essentially turned into heat. If you leave a light bulb on in a room, it will get warmer. If you've ever been in a very bright room, such as a photography studio (with poor air conditioning), you may have noticed that the room is very warm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/Auricle_ explained it well, but for those asking why the room doesn't get brghter if the absorption of the walls is low:</p>
<p>No matter how low the absorption (as long as it is non zero), there will be a brief moment of time where the room is getting brighter, as there is more photons, but soon after that the equilibrium state would be reached, where the same amount of photons are emitted by the light and absorbed by the walls. Because the speed of light is so big, that brief moment of non-equilibrium is so small (i would say of the order of magnitude of size of the room/speed of light) that we don't notice it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, it does!</p>
<p>The photons your flashlight emits bounce around the room until they strike a surface that absorbs them. (One of those surfaces is the retina at the back of your eyes, which is how you see.) The more photons there are bouncing around the room, the more are being absorbed. So at a certain level of illumination, the rate at which your flashlight emits photons will match the rate at which photons are being absorbed. Then the system is in balance.</p>
<p>When you switch your flashlight on, the room gets brighter and brighter, until it reaches that balance point, and then it stays at that same level of brightness. This all happens in a tiny fraction of a second so that, as far as an ordinary human is concerned, the room is instantly illuminated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you ask this same question about <strong>sound</strong>, actually you <strong>CAN</strong> make the room louder and louder as you continue producing sound. If anyone's interested, read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_modes" target="_blank">room modes</a>, the possible frequencies at which sounds will form standing waves by exactly reflecting onto themselves. Basically, you just need to make a sound with the wavelength that matches the length of the room (or multiples of this length). There's an image on the page to visualize it.</p>
<p>For sounds humans can hear, the wavelengths are in the meters to millimeters range, which is also the sizes of rooms. For light humans can see, the wavelengths are in the nanometers range, so it's a lot harder to line up walls precisely enough to bounce them around and set up a standing wave, like you can easily with sound.</p>
<p>By the way, this is an easy demonstration to try yourself. Just find two parallel walls (or floor/ceiling) that reflect a lot of sound (concrete is good). Sing various pitches, increasing slowly. At some point, you'll start to notice the room get much louder. If you stay on that frequency, or its octaves, the room will get very loud!</p>
<p>I mean, all this aside, you can also just use normal reverberation, like in a gothic cathedral. These are designed specifically to be instruments (yes, the whole cathedral is like an instrument) with reverberation times around 8 seconds. That's why singing a Gregorian chant in your living room sounds silly, but in your shower, the sound sticks around a lot longer!</p>
<p>Anyway, sound and light have some similarities in that they're both forms of energy that travel in waves, but their different speeds allow us to understand sound easier by hearing its delay (sound echoes) whereas your eyes can't perceive the delay of a light reflection (light echoes).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The photons are absorbed by the stuff in the room, and re-emitted at a lower frequency (infrared). However, the frequency if emitted light is related to the temperature of the object. If you had a bright enough light, eventually the room would get brighter because the temperature of the stuff in the room would increase to the point where it emits visible light (actually most rooms would catch fire before that but if there was no oxygen I guess).</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
