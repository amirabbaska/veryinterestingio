		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Good question! A tone is composed of more than just the base note.  When you hear a tone, it is actually composed of the root note, called the fundamental, plus a bunch of higher frequency notes, called harmonics or overtones.  When a man and woman sing the same note, they may produce the same fundamental, but their voices will carry different harmonics in varying ratios which produce their characteristic timbres.  The same can be applied to any instrument.  So even if a violin and saxophone play the same note, they will sound distinct because of the different harmonics. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The singing mechanism is a little different between male and female voices because of how the bodies change during puberty. Singing higher is often more difficult for men because their vocal folds are longer, while singing lower is more difficult for females because their vocal folds don't stretch as much as men's do during puberty.</p>
<p>The average ranges do overlap a little bit, but those notes are in a different spot for men compared to women. For example, middle C (C4, or 261.6Hz) might be kind of high for a bass/baritone, while it would be comfortable for an alto or maybe a little low for a soprano. This will affect how those singers sing these notes, including the overtones they produce when singing it.</p>
<p>Overtones, in a nutshell, are what make different things sound different to us. When you hear an instrument or singer produce a pitch, you mostly hear that one pitch, called the fundamental, but there are actually many other pitches being produced above the fundamental, which blend together and are often harder to pick out.</p>
<p>An instrument's/singer's unique combination of overtones will result in their unique timbre, which as someone else mentioned, is kind of the sound equivalent of texture.</p>
<p>So when a man and woman (or any two people for that matter) sing the same note, we can still distinguish the two voices because of their different timbres.</p>
<p>There are of course exceptions to this; countertenors are men who can sing in the upper register very easily and can sound strikingly similar to a woman, and some women develop to have deeper, &quot;manlier&quot; sounding voices. Their voices simply developed in a way that they produce similar overtones to what is normally perceived as the opposite gender's timbre.</p>
<p>Tenors and altos generally sound very similar as well because they sing in the same range and have developed to produce similar overtones in their range, despite male and female differences in vocal development.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Each voice sounds different because of differences in timbre, which is a combination of mostly inaudible overtones above the pitch you hear. When people sound the same, it's because they have similar overtone patterns, and when they sound different, they have different overtone patterns.</p>
<p>Source: I studied voice in college. I'm a singer and not a pathologist, so some of my terminology may be a bit funky, but the basic explanation is there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fine answers so far. Yes, it's a difference in timbre. What hasn't been explained is why men and women have different timbre.  The instrument is the same human voice, right?</p>
<p>TL;DR: Women have smaller vocal folds, which means they use a different level of tension to sing notes. Each individual voice also has subtle differences, which means you can also easily tell the difference between a tenor and a baritone singing the same note, or between a friend and a stranger.</p>
<p>A voice creates pitch by altering the thickness of the vocal folds.  Basically, if the vocal folds are made thinner, it makes the vocal folds vibrate faster. This means the tiny puffs of air come out at a faster rate, creating air waves of a higher frequency. </p>
<p>Making the vocal folds thinner means you're making more tension in the vocal folds. There are two ways to do this.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The  thyroarytenoid muscles, which make up the bulk of the vocal folds, contract, making the tissue thinner. This action is called the chest voice, because it usually causes noticeable sympathetic vibration in the chest bones. </p>
</li>
<li>The cricothyroid muscles also can pull down on the larynx, stretching the tissue even further, into what is called the head voice, because it causes a feeling of vibration in the head.</li>
</ol>
<p>So you can notice a big difference in your own singing depending on what mechanism you use.  For men, try singing around an E above middle C as fully as you can (not falsetto).  You may feel like you're straining, with a very thin tone.  But as you descend down the scale, you will notice a fuller, richer tone.  That's basically the difference between head voice and chest voice.  Trained voices don't sound thin in head voice, necessarily - it's full and &quot;ringy&quot; but doesn't have the same richness of chest voice, provided by the lower overtones.</p>
<p>So women are singing that E above middle C in chest voice, while men sing it in head voice (or a mixture of head and chest). </p>
<p>But then again, women have flexibility. If you're a woman, try singing that E very fully, like Adele &quot;belting&quot; it out. Then try singing it lightly in head voice. Women have some pretty easy flexibility there.  </p>
<p>So you see, even regardless of sex, it depends on what kind of mechanism is being applied.  </p>
<p>Different voice types also have remarkably different timbre, too.  I know some singers who have the same range as a tenor, but their timbre has more of that &quot;heavier&quot; sound of the chest voice, and so they are classified as baritones. I personally have a hefty chest voice, but because my upper range opens up to a lighter sound, some consider me more of a baritone than a bass. </p>
<p>Their are also tiny other differences in a person's larynx and resonators that distinguish our sounds, meaning you recognize the difference between any two singers singing the same note. On the other hand, I'm sure there are many men and women who sound the same signing an E!</p>
<p>I'll leave you with a video of two sopranos, one female and one male, singing a favorite duet of mine with perfect blend:</p>

<p>Vocals have a quality known as timbre. I was taught in music theory classes that this is more or less the “texture” of the sound. Female timbre is softer and smoother than a male voice. A male voice has a rougher, more masculine timber. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
