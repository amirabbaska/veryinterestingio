Drinking water with your food actually helps digestion because churning food with a liquid breaks it up better than without (your stomach &quot;churns&quot; food to a degree.  The liquid component gives more surface area for enzymes to contact it the food.</p>
<p>This is why liquid diets are preferred for the very very weak and sick; they are absorbed faster.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not in a real day-to-day scenario.</p>
<p>In order to hinder digestion noticeably, you need to raise pH from 2 to 3.5 (at this point digestive enzymes denature). You'd need about half a gallon of water to do this, so you'd be too full to eat anything else way before this happened.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your stomach has cells that line the outside of it that produce something called &quot;Gastic Hydrogen Potassium ATPase&quot;. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_potassium_ATPase" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_potassium_ATPase</a>) It's essentially just a natural proton pump designed to acidify the contents of the stomach which is mostly just water and whatever you recently ate. </p>
<p>You stomach always has some amount of water in it that is full of these acidic particles. As it fills up from food, more water is pulled in and more acid is produced as it passes through your small intestine (which is really just an extension of your stomach). Then the large intestine pulls most of the water along with nutrients out of there. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
