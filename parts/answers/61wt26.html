		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Our brain isn't &quot;doing&quot; anything in that sense besides sending and receiving neural signals. Let's take the bending of your arm for example. An overly simplified explanation of how that works is the brain fires a signal down the nerve that is connected to the muscle. At the nerve-muscle connection, various processes occur that cause the muscle to contract and raise your arm (depolarization of cellular membranes, release of calcium ions from the the sarcoplasmic reticulum, attachment of myosin to actin, etc.). All your brain had to do though is fire a signal. It doesn't need to know or understand the steps that happen downstream. </p>
<p>An analogy would be to turning on a television. You control the power for the television. When you want to turn it on, you press the power button. Does the fact that you push the power button mean you intrinsically know exactly how the TV is turning on? Just because you know &quot;to turn the TV on I push this button&quot; doesn't mean you understand all of the computers, wires, and electrical signals that actually cause the TV to turn on.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of your experience of the world and your body as though you are using a map to navigate to a destination. The map is able to represent roads and mountains fairly accurately, and you know how to use the map to get somewhere, but the map doesn't tell you what mountains are made of or how roads are made, or what these actually look like in reality - it's just a tool you can use to navigate.
Similarly, your brain doesn't represent true reality, it just takes a select few stimuli and creates a map of the world that you experience as consciousness and it allows you to move limbs and think so that you can survive. There is no need for the brain to inherently understand what an atom is or how muscle contraction works in order to survive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What you're missing is the difference between automatic and voluntary processes. You don't consciously tell your heart to beat or your eyes to focus or your stomach to digest food. All of that happens adjacent to human consciousness. If you do force your body to act outside of its normal happy place, it simply cuts you out of the equation. Hold your breath or otherwise screw up your breathing on purpose, and you will just pass out while normal automatic processes take over. In a sense, we are piloting a plane on autopilot, not moving every single part needed to maintain safe flight. We might tell the flight computer where we want to go, but we don't make the adjustments it takes to change course.</p>
<p>We are our brains. We are every automatic process that makes up alive. But how we know what we are is as much philosophical as it is scientific.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We 'instinctively' know how our body works! We can move our body without thinking about which muscles to activate, we feel when we need to eat or shit and know when we eat it turns to shit when it comes out. We also have an instinct what's bad and what's good for us.</p>
<p>Humans are pretty much like children driving cars: They test the pedals and turn the steering wheel a bit and see what happens; after a bit of experimentation any 6 year old can drive. If they put in fuel and drive, out come exhaust gases; if something hits the car something breaks, if something breaks it doesn't work anymore... That doesn't mean kids know how the car works specifically! and they don't need to to be able to drive. And they won't learn how it works until they look under the hood of the car.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Technically speaking, our brain does &quot;know&quot; how our bodies work, its just that we aren't consciously aware of that knowledge at all times. The brain is not a monolith, there are different regions of the brain which engage in different functions. The parts of the brain which control bodily functions are predominantly the lower brain, which is no more advanced than the neural networks we see in primitive creatures like worms and crabs. It simply does not operate on a conscious level and is automatic and reflexive in nature. Most higher order thinking occurs in the upper regions of the brain, which operates in a much different manner than the lower brain. </p>
<p>Think of it this way, say the regions of the brain each have their own language. The lower brain deals with an entirely different subject matter than the upper brain and speaks an entirely different language. The signals being sent out by the lower brain are so different from the ones in the upper brain that the upper brain is unable to &quot;translate&quot; them to a form in which it could be fully conscious of.  And the upper brain is unable to send signals to the lower brain which would fully translate in a way to significantly alter their function. They just operate differently. That is why your body doesn't shut down if you pass out or fall asleep. </p>
<p>And if you want another explanation, the lower brain really doesn't &quot;know&quot; all of what it does. It is mostly automatic, kind of like when a moth is attracted to light. It is something which is beyond its own control, a reflex that occurs naturally. It is simply wired differently from the other parts of your brain which control consciousness. It's the same reason why your toaster can't play video games on it and why your smart phone can't heat up pop tarts. Even though they are both machines, they are wired in entirely different ways and perform entirely different functions. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
