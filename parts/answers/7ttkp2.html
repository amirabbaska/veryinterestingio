This means that there's a sheet of liquid crystals in between a bunch of other screens and filters, and behind all of that is a light. When you apply an electrical charge to liquid crystals you can change their shape, and when that happens the direction and color of the light as it passes through can be changed.</p>
<p>But you can also change the shape by pressing on them through the filters. Because this is much less precise than you can get with an electric current, it sort of warps into a blob of colors instead of a coherent image. When you remove pressure, the electrical current takes back control and forces the liquid crystals into the correct shape again.</p>
<p>Its hard to predict the colors since you have to take into account the previous configuration of the liquid crystals, the amount of pressure you're putting on them, the location of the pressure, and the type of light and filters used in the display. So it usually just creates a strange gray sort of color.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
