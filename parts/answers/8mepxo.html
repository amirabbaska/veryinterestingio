		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a combination of two major factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ice cream has a lot of surface area, which means more nucleation points. More nucleation points mean more bubbles.</p>
</li>
<li>Milk and cream have a higher surface tension than water. This means the bubbles are stronger.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>The reason why Mentos in soda makes it fizz is because all the pits and holes means the surface area is <strong><em>huge</em></strong> compared to the volume. You could get similar effects from a spoonful of sugar or sand.</p>
<p>Easy experiment: Get a bottle of seltzer or clear soda. Get it nice and cold before opening and pour it into a glass. Pour slow so it doesn't fizz too much. Wait for the bubbles to stop and drop in a few grains of sugar or salt. You will see that the bubbles will form around the granules until they dissolve. Use a few grains of sand and it the bubbles will keep forming until there is none left, which will probably be longer than you are willing to sit around.</p>
<hr />
<p>/u/GaidinBDJ has the dissolved gases issue backwards.</p>
<p>Hot liquids will hold more solids (salt, sugar, minerals, etc.) while cold liquids will hold more gases (oxygen, carbon dioxide, methane, etc.) </p>
<p>One of the worries with global warming is the amount of methane dissolved in the ocean. Warm up the ocean and the methane comes out. Methane is a much more effective greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. If enough methane gets into the upper atmosphere, the global temperature will skyrocket in a runaway reaction and life as we know it is <strong><em>fucked</em></strong>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thats a good explanation, but why does root beer foam more than others? I've used cream soda and orange soda (I'm pretty sure it was orange) and they didn't foam nearly as much as RB. But the explanation suggests that it should be the same, or nearly the same, no matter the flavour of soda</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rootbeer has foaming agents added to it.  Originally it was made with sassafras that naturally had a head when poured.  Well turns out sassafras will give you cancer so when they replaced it they had to add stuff to keep the head. </p>
