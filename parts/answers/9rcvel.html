		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The most common way air sanitizersbcurrwntly work is by using s chemical called cyclodextrin.</p>
<p>This chemical has a cup shape <a href="https://vgy.me/nH4cGs.jpg" target="_blank"><a href="https://vgy.me/nH4cGs.jpg" target="_blank">https://vgy.me/nH4cGs.jpg</a></a></p>
<p>It binds smell molecules on the inside, and prevents the smell molecules from making direct contact with sensors in your nose.</p>
<p>Another way of removing smell is by overloading your smell system. Very strong (and less unpleasant) odors will numb your nose for other smells. The &quot;pest doctor&quot; vinegar sponge works like that.</p>
<p>And a way to actually destroy the smell and not just hide it is using a chemical called Ozone. Ozone will break down most molecules that cause smell. Since Ozone is toxic to humans, this can only be done when there's no people around. For example thoroughly cleaning a car works by putting a small machine in the car that turns Oxygen from the air into Ozone, and then wait for several hours while the Ozone does its job. Afterwards you air out the car, and obnoxious smells will be gone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
