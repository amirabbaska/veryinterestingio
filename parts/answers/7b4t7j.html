		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The origin of the super-massive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way (and most but not all other galaxies) is still a bit of a mystery.</p>
<p>Clearly, the general ingredients are there: typically galaxies are much denser in the middle (even without the supermassive black hole), and if you have enough stuff in the middle, then it makes sense that you might find a giant black hole there. But the question is how exactly does it form?</p>
<p>There are several scenarios. One is that you basically have a big concentration of gas in the centre of the galaxy, and it just all collapses together into a giant black hole. Another is that the galaxy forms a whole bunch of stars in the middle of the galaxy, which eventually go supernova and turn into neutron stars and black holes, which all merge into a single supermassive black hole. There are numerous other ideas, but it really is unknown. We know why there's a lot of &quot;fuel&quot; there to form a supermassive black hole, but we don't know exactly which way all this stuff combined to form the supermassive black hole.</p>
<p>Additionally, it looks like galaxies collide with each other all the time. The most commonly accepted theory for the evolution of galaxies on a big scale is that they basically build up from small galaxies to big galaxies through a lot of mergers over a long period of time. These galaxies can have their own supermassive black holes. After a merger, the new supermassive black hole will &quot;sink&quot; to the centre of a galaxy, where it will merge with the existing supermassive black hole. This isn't the origin of the supermassive black hole, but it could be an important part of how it grows. They can grow in other ways as well, by slowly accreting gas and tearing apart stars that come too close.</p>
<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> It makes sense why a bunch of mass in the middle of a galaxy, but we have too many ideas about how this could collapse into a supermassive black hole, and we're not sure which idea is correct.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is lots of speculation in this thread! </p>
<p>The details of SMBH formation are not well understood. (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1003.4404.pdf" target="_blank">See here for a comprehensive review</a>). </p>
<p>Supermassive black holes <em>probably</em> have to start as &quot;seed&quot; black holes. <strong>Maybe</strong> these can come from the first population of stars that had only hydrogen and helium in them. These first generation stars could have been very massive and lost less mass at the end of their lives because of the opacity differences between hydrogen/helium and heavier elements, which ultimately means forming (potentially) larger black holes at the end of their lives (maybe this also explains the <a href="https://www.ligo.caltech.edu/system/avm_image_sqls/binaries/91/original/Mass_plot_black_no_gap.jpg?1508029040" target="_blank">larger black hole masses that LIGO has been detecting</a>, but that's only one possible explanation for the LIGO events). </p>
<p>Another possible source of seed black holes is that star formation is suppressed and direct gas accretion into smaller black holes through instabilities in an accretion disk. Another is that star formation <em>isn't</em> suppressed, but that the star cluster that forms from the gas cloud collapsing is dense and leads to trees of merging black holes, forming the larger seeds that build to a SMBH.</p>
<p>The common theme to all of these mechanisms is that smaller seed black holes form first, and then somehow grow into a larger black hole.</p>
<p>These seed black holes have to then grow <em>extremely</em> rapidly, within the first billion years (since we can see them at that time period, we know that they have to be able to form by then). </p>
<p>This is one of the major problems of modern astrophysics, and there is no definite answer at this point for how we got from the Big Bang to having a SMBH at the center of our galaxy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
