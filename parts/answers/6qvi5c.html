		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Could it be one of those companies that are pretty much only in existence to delay government contracts? I remember reading a bit ago about these companies where they hire out their services to make bids on whatever controversial project they are hired to disrupt, they then delay the process by launching protests after contracts are handed out. The GAO does not allow a contract to move forward until all disputes on it are dealt with. I already heard about delays on the border wall from several companies protesting contracts. I assume this is one of those mole companies. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a General Contractor also in NYC I can tell you this is just another over selling contractor that wants to be given a contract for a faulty project. I've seen many Contractors that take big jobs far beyond their capability and become a money sink as they will change contract request change orders and more money for work they say isn't in their contract. We see these guys at union committees and subcontractor gathers all the time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
