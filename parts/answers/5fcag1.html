		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many reasons.  Heat releases more volatile compounds from the cheese which you will detect in your retronasal cavity much more strongly when you eat the cheese (more ELI5 - you smell the food from inside your mouth, so you taste it more).  The surface area of the cheese will also increase, causing you to pick up more flavours as well.  The creamy texture of the cheese sends a stronger 'I'm eating fat' signal to your brain.  Certain enzymes, sugars, and proteins will be altered by the heating process, so the flavour of the cheese is actually physically altered as with anything that gets cooked. Oil is also released from the cheese, so it coats your mouth more completely than solid cheese.  Sweetness and bitterness tend to be intensified by higher temperature, and since most melting cheeses don't have a lot of bitter compounds, melted cheese tends to taste sweeter.  Your brain likes this too.  Depending on how hot you have the cheese, certain flavours can be muted as well, so the overall flavour of the cheese probably becomes subordinate to your physiological reaction to eating something that feels fatty and seems sweet.  So it's comforting. </p>
<p>Now I really want melted cheese. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if cold melted cheese taste any different from cold non-melted cheese.</p>
<p>If they taste the same, it would come down to <a href="http://www.foodnavigator.com/Science/Food-temperature-affects-taste-reveal-scientists" target="_blank">taste being more sensitive when things are warm</a>. This would mean with warm, melted cheese you can pick up many more flavours and that's why it tastes different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the heat from melting the cheese denatures the proteins in it. This changes the size, shape, and characteristics of the cheese, altering it's flavor, smell and texture.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Temperature effects the structures of all things, for example Ice and Water are the same chemical but are different structures.</p>
<p>Taste is our taste buds sending messages to our brains based off of the chemicals and their structures that touch them.</p>
<p>Therefore when structure changes our perception (taste) changes as well. I think you'll find more research on the topic of chocolate at different temperature if you do a quick Google search.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a side note, about heat affecting flavor, it's why beers should be drank a little warmer than they're typically served in the US.  Being cold subdues the (subtle) flavors in the beer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
