		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It originates in Japan, the land of all the crazy things. Because it's known that if you get less than a C you have failed there would only be 3 grades you could get if you finished a level (as they often did not have +- modifiers), S class was introduce something difficult to give people a sense of achievement and something to work towards getting. Then came the SS and SSS ranks to create even more grades to get because more letters clearly means it's better.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>The <strong>XF</strong> grade is a failure for academic dishonesty - like cheating, copying work, or plagiarism. Sort of like the opposite of S. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japanese video games. When they introduced scoring systems for levels, they stopped at A because the developers didn't expect anyone to do any better than that. But of course players exceeded all expectations and demanded a higher rating.</p>
<p>A means you didn't do anything wrong, as such, in clearing the level. It would seem unfair if you did a perfectly good play through with no major mistakes and were graded a B, even though your run was as good as can be normally expected.</p>
<p>But the hardcore players demanded a rating for players who go above and beyond, so S was created, then later SS and SSS and such. I don't think it's universally agreed what it stands for--some say super--but everyone just uses it these days.</p>
<p>Edit: A reply has pointed out that some Japanese universities also use S above A, but I did a bit more digging and couldn't find anything about which came first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
