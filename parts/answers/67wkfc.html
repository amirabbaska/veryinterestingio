		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, but not in most medical situations.</p>
<p>X-rays behave roughly the same as normal light, but have a much higher energy. This means they go through objects easier, which is how we're able to use them to look at bones and other things. This is obviously handy for medicine and engineering, but not very useful for taking photographs with them.</p>
<p>There are ways of steering and focusing x-rays, that usually work with a complex array of mirrors as it's easier to reflect the x-rays than change their direction using normal lens effects. This is both complex and expensive though, and is usually only used for very specific applications. As always, more info on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray_optics" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>To get around this problem, most people use a very large sensor, or piece of film, and place it directly behind whatever they want to look at. If the x-rays come through straight enough, you can get a sharp enough image to be useful.</p>
<p>So to answer the original question, yes, x-rays can have a depth of field, but only if you're working with focusing x-ray optics systems, which most people don't.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No, there is no lens used to create an x-ray image, so there are no depth of field problems. Ideally the part of the body that you are imaging is placed directly on the imaging detector, and then you get an accurate image caused by an attenuation pattern. There are a whole bunch of other exposure issues, but these are related to other issues such as the amount of radiation used, and the energy of the x-ray photons.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a lot of misconceptions in many of the answers here. X-rays are just light. They are electromagnetic waves. The same equations dictate how light works at all wavelengths and energies. People just don't seem to know much about cutting edge x-ray imaging.</p>
<p>Medical x-rays project from a small source, through your body, onto a detector. That's called &quot;point projection.&quot; There is blurring but it's not a &quot;depth of field.&quot; Blurring in point projection comes from the source not being a point, and from the subject not standing still, and from diffraction of x-ray light through the subject.</p>
<p>Beyond medical x-rays, scientists have <em>numerous</em> ways of controlling x-ray light. At synchrotron and free-electron lasers, the source is incredibly bright, and incredibly small. They can even generate coherent light, like a laser. X-rays have diffraction, interference, attenuation, just like any light.</p>
<p>The most common x-ray lenses are <strong>curved, glancing-incidence mirrors.</strong> They work by a phenomena called &quot;total internal reflection.&quot; Think about visible-light and water (or window glass). At normal incidence, water (glass) is mostly transparent. But at glancing incidence (like when you're at the beach or on a boat) light at low angles is strongly reflected. The same thing happens with x-rays. At normal incidence, reflection is weak. At glancing incidence (think 1 or 2 degrees, or smaller), the reflection can be strong, <em>if the surface is exceptionally smooth</em>. So if you put a smooth curved mirror into an x-ray beam, you can steer the light to a focus. A two dimensional version is a Kirkpatrick-Baez mirror pair: one for horizontal and one for vertical, often displaced along the beam.</p>
<p>Another way to focus x-rays is with <strong>refraction.</strong> This typically works at high energies only. The index of refraction is slightly less than 1 for x-rays, so refractive lenses have a shape that's <em>the opposite</em> of regular lenses. Think of an empty space in a material that the x-rays can penetrate. So take a block of Beryllium, or Aluminum, drill some holes in it, and the x-rays will bend and focus.</p>
<p>Another way is to use what are referred to as <strong>Fresnel Zone Plate (FZP) lenses.</strong> They are typically alternating rings of light and dark (i.e. binary) or alternating phase-shifting material. They work by diffraction. So if you know how a diffraction grating works, imagine making one that's circular or cylindrical. Tune the line density so that all the rays focus to one point. FZPs are essentially holograms of a simple, single lens. Because of the short wavelengths involved, FZPs are typically small. There are big ones beyond 1 cm, but most used for high quality imaging are well under 1 mm.</p>
<p>Another kind of x-ray lens is called a <strong>multilayer laue lens</strong> (MLL). It's similar to a zoneplate, but made in a different way that allows the zones to be smaller.</p>
<p>All of these are ways to focus x-ray light: reflection, refraction, diffraction. They all have a wavelength, numerical aperture, a focal length, and a <em>depth of focus</em>. The diffractive ones are miraculously good, but suffer from chromatic aberrations, meaning that the properties change with wavelength.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are different energy ranges called x-rays. Medical x-rays are called <em>hard x-rays.</em> At lower energies there are <em>tender x-rays</em>, and below that <em>soft x-rays</em>, then <em>extreme ultraviolet</em> and <em>vacuum ultraviolet</em> before coming to the parts you're more familiar with.</p>
<p><strong>Why do scientists care about x-rays?</strong> Good question. Soft x-rays are amazingly good probes of matter. Every element, and every chemical has a signature in the absorption spectrum that allows us to identify very minute amounts of materials, and to see how they are bound to their neighbors. With circularly polarized x-rays you can study magnetism. With their short wavelengths, you can take x-ray images and resolve features down to about the size of chromosomes, around 10 nm. You can label biological samples and probe them at that length scale. You can make non-destructive measurements of things like soil samples, batteries, and comet pieces captured in space. Another killer app for x-rays is protein crystallography. The wavelength is close to the spacing between atoms. So you can take a small amount of something like a new drug or a protein in the body, and with diffraction and reconstruction, you can see precisely how the atoms are arranged, structurally. You can see how proteins fold and give molecules the properties they have.</p>
<p>TD;DR: X-Rays are awesome. They are also just... light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>With typical radiographs, the biggest factor in the &quot;focus&quot; of the image is actually what's known as geometric unsharpness. </p>
<p>The geometric unsharpness is determined by the source size (smaller is sharper), source-to-object distance (farther is sharper) and object-to-film/detector distance (closer is sharper). </p>
<p>It works much the same way as casting shadow puppets on your wall. Moving the flashlight away from the wall and your hand closer will produce a sharper shadow, while moving your hand away or the light closer will cause enlargement and loss of definition of the shadow. </p>
<p>There are other things, like using lead screens, which reduce the number of low-energy photons that interact with the film, which can help produce a sharper image. </p>
<p>Additionally, an improper film development process can ruin what should have been a sharp image. </p>
