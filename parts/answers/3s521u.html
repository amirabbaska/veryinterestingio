You can coat a piece of glass with a layer of gold 100 atoms thick and still see through it. <a href="https://i.imgur.com/bT65wH4.jpg" target="_blank">This</a> is what a piece of glass with a single layer of carbon looks like; it just gets slightly darker.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thin film coating expert here... &quot;Most&quot; of glass windows you see in the world are coated with metals for reflecting heat energy. Rarely do you ever see &quot;clear&quot; glass.  Actually, multiple layers of different metals are commonly used.  Each layer is about 10nm thick, up to 10-12 layers! Google Low E glass for further details.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All the answers in here are great, but if you want a more tangible example, grab a CD and look at a light source through the data portion. Its pretty dark, but definitely still translucent through its metal layer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another way of looking at this is in terms of the skin depth, basically the distance an electromagnetic wave has to travel into the metal before its almost all absorbed (86% or 1/e^2). </p>
<p>This is in the order of 10 to 50 nm for metals whereas the diameter of a gold atom (for example) is 166 pm. So the atomic layer of gold is about 1/250 the thickness of material required to attenuate the light to nearly 0. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
