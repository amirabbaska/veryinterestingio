		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has a nuclear reactor on board.  It's not the same kind of nuclear reactor that you see in power plants or large naval vessels; it just has a piece of radioactive material which gets hot thanks to its radioactivity.  You can harvest a little bit of electricity whenever there's a difference in temperature between two places.</p>
<p>The nuclear reactor is able to produce a <em>ton</em> of energy over the course of its life.  I'm fond of <a href="https://xkcd.com/1162/" target="_blank">this</a> comic showing just how massive the energy density of nuclear fuels is compared to chemical fuels like coal and gasoline.  Nuclear fuels get their energy from Einstein's famous E = mc^(2), where the energy you get is equal to the mass the fuel destroys when it decays, multiplied by the speed of light squared.  The speed of light is a huge number, so you get a <em>ton</em> of energy this way.</p>
<p>Over time the fuel runs out, though.  The rate at which fuel is radioactively decaying is proportional to the amount of fuel that's left, and the energy it produces is proportional to the amount of decay.  This means that when you first build the reactor it produces the most power, but over time it produces less and less.  Voyager uses Plutonium 238 as its fuel; Pu-238 has a half life of about 88 years, so every 88 years the power production will have dropped by half.  The other components of the reactor also degrade, so the power loss is somewhat faster than this.</p>
<p>The Voyager probes have been in space since 1977, so the reactors are now producing about 1/4 less power than when they were launched.  To compensate for this the probes have been shutting down systems as necessary to conserve power.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The spacecraft actually carry two types of fuel—one to power the thrusters, the other to keep the electricity humming. The propellant is hydrazine, a simple concoction of nitrogen and hydrogen that smells like weak ammonia. It was chosen—and remains favored today—because it's cheap and has a very low freezing point. The Voyagers' jets are used to orient the vessels; the geek term for the hydrazine is &quot;attitude control propellant.&quot; (There's no need for constant propulsion, of course, because space is gravity-free, so the initial boost went a long way; the spacecraft additionally took advantage of the outer planets' gravitational fields, which act like slingshots to increase speed.) NASA estimates that the Voyagers' fuel efficiency is upwards of 30,000 miles per gallon of hydrazine.
ger 1 has enough hydrazine to keep going until 2040, while Voyager 2's juice can keep it hurtling along until 2034. (Though the spacecraft are identical,Voyager 2 has had to expend more hydrazine visiting Uranus and Neptune.) The real limiting factor is the other fuel, plutonium-238 dioxide. This is what powers the Voyagers' scientificinstruments and communications equipment. The plutonium is converted into electricity by onboard radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs), which feed off the heat generated by the radioactive fuel's decay. The fuel spheres are encased in a special iridium alloy, to prevent contamination in the unlikely event that the Voyagers crashed shortly after takeoff in 1977.</p>
<p>The plutonium's radioactive decay means that the fuel is generating less and less heat as the years go by, and consequently the RTGs are producing less and less power. At launch, the RTGs were cranking out 470 watts worth of electricity; now it's more like 315 watts. NASA is trying to combat the problem by shutting down non-critical systems, and alternating which instruments are on and off. But come 2020 or so, there won't be enough plutonium left to keep the heaters working, and everything of value will shut down.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Take two pieces of metal and put them very close to one another. Then heat one of the pieces of metal. The resulting temperature difference between the two pieces of metal generates a very small electric current.</p>
<p>Voyager 1, 2, Cassini, Galileo, Curiosity, and New Horizons use a small pellet of Plutonium to create this heat difference. The radioactive decay is what generates the heat. It doesn't provide very much electricity but is extremely long lasting.</p>
<p>EDIT: Been logging in and out for a few hours now answering some folks but its bed time. Also obligatory thank you to the generous redditor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Each Voyager spaceprobe is carrying a chunk of plutonium-238 oxide in an iridium case. Pl-238 generates a lot of thermal energy as it decays (it spontaneously glows red hot in sufficient quantities). This heat is then converted into electricity. As the fuel decays, it produces less and less heat, allowing for the generation of less and less electricity. IIRC some non-essential systems have already needed to be deactivated, and total system shut down will likely occur around 2025. The reason power can continue to be generated for so long is that Pu-238 has a half-life of 87.7 years.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
