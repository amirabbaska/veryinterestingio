		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few reasons:</p>
<p>1) they're cheaply made
2) they don't have good cooling so they are exposed to exterior air for cooling (allows sound out)
3) very expensive blenders can be quieter, but they aren't what you'd buy at the store normally.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Source: I used to work for one of the big appliance makers in the US. One of my roles was designing kitchen counter-top appliances (blenders, food processors, stand mixers, etc.)</p>
<p>1) Cost - The standard manufacture's markup is 3X. So if it costs $50 to make, it will retail for about $150. Some makers take more profit, some take less. But that $30 Oster will cost about $8-10 to make. (I did competitive cost studies on this stuff. I would consider an Oster disposable)</p>
<p>Everything else comes from decisions on how much is it going to cost. So the jar, motor, controls, body, packaging, etc. all needs to be allocated.</p>
<p>2) Motor choice. The basic motor for a blender is a brushed motor. They are used because they are cheep. Well really the controls are cheep so the systems cost is cheep. A brush-less motor actually costs less than a brushed motor to make (typically), but the controls for a brush-less motor will be 2-3x the cost of a brush motor control (MOS-FET vs. triac controls). Brushed motor are noisier than brush-less motors. Brush-less controls operate at frequencies above human capacity to hear. Triac (brush) motor controls operate at 60Hz - which can be heard as a high pitch whine given higher order harmonics and commutator noise. That is in addition to the noise from the brushes. (The brushes don't actually touch the commutator in operation. They ride on a plasma field. 5 cent factoid: Brush-less motors where developed by NASA as plasma can't exist in the vacuum of space.) Triac controls operate by clipping. They basically skip voltage cycles. So the power applied to the motor isn't smooth. MOS-FET controls operate by PWM (pulse width modulation). Long story short, MOS-FET controls are smoother in operation and hence quieter. (edit: MOS-FET controls can be used on brushed motors, typically DC motors. The noise generated by Triacs is higher order than 60Hz, but it's in the audible range. MOS-FET noise is much higher frequency noise.)</p>
<p>3) Coupler. The biggest single contributor to unloaded noise. This is how the jar and the motor base can be disconnected. Some cheep blenders are all in one and don't have this. (the cheep Ninja is one - don't buy it - piece of crap. They spend a huge % of their SG&amp;A on infomercials and shopping networks). Higher priced blender will use better geometry and better materials that may have sound absorbing properties. </p>
<p>4) The Food load. Putting frozen stuff in the jar is just noisy. No real way of getting around this. Some blender marketed for bar or restaurant use have an outer cabinet the blender sits in to quiet noise. Try running a blender without food in it and it will be rather quiet. This is by far the biggest % of the produced noise.</p>
<p>The best blenders to buy? KitchenAid or the Vitamix. The Vitamix ones have a decent guerrilla marketing campaign so take that with a grain of salt. Their blade design is slightly different then the KitchenAid one though. It is dull which actually mashes food better than the sharp blade of the KitchenAid one. The KitchenAid ones are typically easier to clean. Flat membrane controls and smooth body. </p>
<p>TL:DR: It is cost and the food load in the jar.</p>
<p>(edits: spelling and clarification on controls)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The noise in the blender is twofold:</p>
<p>One) Even in &quot;High End&quot; blenders (Like Blendtec and Vitamix), they only have so much space to work with and still have a compact, easily movable kitchen counter appliance. No one wants a 25lb blender, so they have to skimp on sound insulation/cooling systems for the motor. Also, the RPM, oh sweet god the RPM. </p>
<p>You essentially have a reasonably high powered electric motor with minimal sound insulation for weight and portability reasons spinning at 20,000 RPM.</p>
<p>Two) What you are blending. A blender is essentially just a violence machine. It takes whole foods, frozen, solid, whatever, and turns them into less solid versions of themselves. This will be noisy. The items you are blending, combined with the ridiculous RPM you are blending them at, all the while contained by a 5mm thick plastic container is basically a perfect recipe for noise. </p>
<p>This is why the blenders at Booster Juice or other smoothie stands have a second cover that goes over the main blending jar as well as a bigger base. More room to insulate the sound all round. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The one very important thing I don't see other commenters realizing is that electric motors on cars spin very slowly compared to blenders.</p>
<p>A direct drive motor on a car wheel spins at around 600 rpm if the car is going 60mph. A blender may spin 11,000! THAT is most of why they are so noisy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called a universal motor. It's a motor that works on both DC or AC. It's far from ideal since indeed it makes a lot of noise, the brushes it uses wear off and it isn't really as efficient as other types. </p>
<p>However, it's extremely cheap to make (~$5 made in china), it can run at high speeds and has a decent starting torque. For short and light use (household blenders, drills, ... ) it's great! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
