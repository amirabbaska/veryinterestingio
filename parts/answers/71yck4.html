		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When it comes to rail in the U.S., there's basically two places: The Boston-New York-Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington corridor, and the rest of the country.</p>
<p>Rail used to be the main way to get between cities in the U.S., but the Interstate offered faster and more convenient travel for those with a car, and really long distances like going from one coast to the other can only be done quickly by air. (For instance, even the fastest high-speed trains wouldn't be competitive for the New York to Los Angeles route.)</p>
<p>Amtrak, the national rail company, doesn't own its tracks in most of the country, so its trains often have to wait for freight trains to go first. Coverage and routes are limited. If you live in Memphis, you can go to Chicago fine, but getting to St. Louis might take days even though it's only four hours by car.</p>
<p>For the big cities between Boston and Washington, rail is still ideal. Traffic is bad, many people don't use cars, and airports are far from the city center. Traditional rail still does pretty well, and high-speed rail would be incredible. There's still two problems. One is crash-test regulations, which force trains to be heavier and slower than foreign counterparts. (Other countries don't have such strict regulations; rail collisions are quite rare, and traveling by train is much safer than by automobile anyway.) The other is simply the cost of building rail lines in that area which can handle high-speed rail. Amtrak's proposal for true high-speed rail in that corridor is projected to cost over $100 billion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of reasons, all of which are covered very well in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbEfzuCLoAQ" target="_blank">video by wendover</a>.</p>
<p>Population density is partly to be blamed but there are certain routes (eg DC to Boston via Philly and NY) that would be perfect for a high speed train. There is an existing rail system and in fact it has been doing very well.
Amtrak is a company that was created with the aim to make &quot;train travel great again&quot; and to build high speed trains in the future. Unfortunately <del>it is fairly new and other</del> <em>freight</em> companies already own the train tracks and Amtrak has to rent it. Comparatively, the SNCF in France owns all the tracks in France. So now, if BNSF has a train on the tracks and there is an Amtrak train coming, the latter will have to wait for the slower  train to finish first. You end up with a cyclic problem of the train suck and with people thinking that it sucks, less income to improve it. Building new tracks is extremely costly and is not really a project that any sane person would like to undertake. </p>
<p>Edit: BNSF not BNCF and strikethrough/italic</p>
<p>Hopefully we get the hyperloop though and that will be amazing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of comments here. One I haven't seen mentioned:</p>
<p>The US has the most efficient and heavily used <strong>freight</strong> rail system in the world. <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/16636101" target="_blank">Economist</a></p>
<p>We have a lot of rail, we use it for moving stuff rather than people. The transcon mainlines move a crazy amount of cargo. Hundreds of trains a day like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oZtPUDlnmZ0" target="_blank">this</a> going across the country on them.</p>
<p>Moving stuff efficiently and moving people efficiently are largely incompatible. Freight efficiency means huge, slow (comparatively) trains. Moving people efficiently means high speeds. You basically can't mix a lot of both on the same tracks and get anything useful out of it. Europe opts using it's rail primarily for people, we use it primarily for stuff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Population density. The population density of France is about 300 people per square mile, and that's one of the lower values for Europe. Germany is 600, Italy is 500, Netherlands are 1000, UK is 700.</p>
<p>There are only 8 US states with a population density above 300/sq mi, and except for Florida, all of them are in the Northeast, where the US does have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acela_Express" target="_blank">something resembling high speed rail</a>. </p>
<p>35/50 states have a population density less than 200/sq mi and 24/50 are less than 100/sq mi. </p>
<p>So it's just too few big cities too far apart. You could maybe extend the existing Northeast system south to Charlotte, NC and west to Detroit or Chicago, but after that, the number of big cities starts dropping off pretty fast. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Enough of our cities do not have self-contained public transportation so HSR between cities will not be convenient enough to deter people from driving. This is because once you get to a city, you still need to get around. Although you can Uber, the combined cost of HSR ticket and Uber make the convenience of driving yourself the &quot;best&quot; option.</p>
<p>Before we invest in HSR BETWEEN cities, IMO, we should invest in building public transportation WITHIN cities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
