<p>Since we (obviously) can't see these muscles, we never really become aware of moving them, but if you stay up for a long time (I'm talking well over 24 hours) while focusing on something close to you, they will get noticeably tired. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Here are all the muscles that control your eyes' movements. As you can see there are quite few so your eyes are able to move quite precisely.</p>
<p>Not much for an eli5, but the way the muscles move are like balancing a ball on a board that you can move up and down like this game: <a href="https://goo.gl/images/CcyLwv" target="_blank">https://goo.gl/images/CcyLwv</a></p>
<p>You can move the ball all directiom because you control the board in 4 directions: front, back, left and right. Its the same as with your eyes only woth your eyes it's up, down, left and right.</p>
<p>Edit: first picture is now in english, with the muscles showing what motion the eye makes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few tiny muscles attached to the back of the eyeball. They can point it or even rotate it.</p>
<p>Fun fact: you have 2 systems in your brain to control your eyeballs. Look at a moving object and you have no problem following it with your gaze. But try to look at a wall and smoothly move your gaze over it - that's impossible. Your eyes will move in discrete jumps instead. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is there ever a position where the muscles are at rest, like just closing your eyes and having them point straight ahead? Kind of like a car in neutral. When sleeping I know we look around such as in REM state, but are they actually ever, well, in neutral? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partly related and blew my mind the first time I read this: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronostasis" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronostasis</a></p>
<p>When your eyes move from one point to another, you should technically be seeing a blur. Instead, your mind cuts out the blur and replaces it with two scenes: one from before the movement, and one from after.</p>
<p>This results in an illusion known as the &quot;stopped clock illusion&quot; where the second hand of a clock appears to stay still longer than 1 second when you first look at it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
