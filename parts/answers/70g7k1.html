		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The plutonium will not cause an uncontrolled nuclear explosion, it is not designed to do so.</p>
<p>The 'damage' done will be in the form of kinetic impact. </p>
<p>Consider what 20 grams of steel travelling at 900km/h does to a human (aka a handgun bullet).</p>
<p>Cassini was more than ten thousand times that mass, and hit Saturn at around fifty times that speed.</p>
<p>That said, Saturn's upper atmosphere is hit by larger kinetic impactors quite regularly. Cassini would have flared up and burned just like a larger-than-usual meteor burning up in Earth's atmosphere. </p>
<p>Picture the Chelyabinsk impactor from 2012. It was about 12 tons, and hit Earth's atmosphere at around 50000km/h. Cassini would have been less impactful than that.</p>
<p>(Edit: Correction from /u/scifiguy95 below - the impactor was 12000 tons)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Getting fissionable material to undergo the kind of ultra-rapid chain reaction of a nuclear explosion is unimaginably, mind-bogglingly difficult.</p>
<p>You would not believe the effort and levels of precision in engineering, physics, electronics, and materials science needed to make one work.</p>
<p>So, to put it simply, no.  Dropping a chunk of fissile  material into a gravity well will not cause a nuclear explosion.  It will just scatter the material.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Impact does nothing to radioactive materials.  It's not nitroglycerine.</p>
<p>SOME- only a few, actually- isotopes have the ability to capture a loose neutron from another source, undergo a forced decay and emit one or more other neutrons.  This is a reaction.  Under some very well-controlled conditions- very high density- the reaction can flash over immediately and a significant portion of the fuel reacts almost instantly.  It's VERY difficult to make happen.</p>
<p>Cassini's plutonium-238 is <em>entirely</em> spontaneous decay.  It ONLY emits alpha particles, which do not cause nuclear reactions in anything.  <strong>Pu-239</strong> is nuclear fuel because, if hit by a thermal neutron, emits multiple neutrons.  But it does not create any neutron decay spontaneously, only alpha- it must be initiated by a very strong, instantaneous flash of neutrons from elsewhere.   And it must be in a tight, dense critical mass for this to work.</p>
<p>Cassini's Pu-238 can't undergo a reaction.  It's only spontaneously decaying.  It was glowing red hot when densely contained, it scattered and cooled.  But none of its isotopes can be destroyed this way either, none of it &quot;burned up&quot;, all its mass was simply scattered.  Well elemental Pu-238 can combine to plutonium oxide or other chemical combinations- but it does nothing to change its nature as plutonium-238.  It continues to decay and produce alpha.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
