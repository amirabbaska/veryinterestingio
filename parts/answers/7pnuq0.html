		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Strictly speaking, we CAN use most nuclear waste. Breeder reactors can be used to consume pretty much all usable fissle materials and produce a much lower volume of equivalent waste with different properties.</p>
<p>Breeder reactors can be used to manufacture weapons grade fissile material though, so there's political aspects, as well as economic ones-- uranium is fairly abundant.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Radioactivity, by itself, is not that useful for generating power. What is useful for generating power is the induced splitting of <em>lots</em> of atoms at the same time, not the slow trickle of energy release you get from radioactive decay alone. To put it another way: nuclear reactors don't work because their fuel is radioactive, they work because their fuel is splittable by neutrons. Those are not the same thing (all fuel splittable by neutrons is radioactive, but not all radioactive atoms are splittable by neutrons). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Check out &quot;Reprocessing&quot;; it's the step we removed from the current nuclear power cycle, and a major reason why our nuclear waste is so hard to store.</p>
<p>Basically you take the used fuel rods and extract the parts that can be reused in reactors as fuel, separate the super-highly radioactive stuff that can't be used in a reactor for short term storage, and then you're left mostly with stuff that's more dangerous from heavy metal poisoning than the radiation (U-238 eg).  </p>
<p>It was stopped in the us by president Carter because of concerns about nuclear proliferation; I guess he thought we'd be clever enough to figure out how to safely store nuclear waste without a reprocessing industry, but so far we haven't, which is why we have spent fuel rods piling up.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is very usable, just not in our current nuclear reactors. Uranium fuel rods are pellets of uranium held together by a metal casing. Being inside a reactor causes the metal to become brittle, and the life of the fuel rod is determined by the life of that casing. </p>
<p>In other reactor designs, like molten salt reactors, this casing is not used. The fuel stays in the reactor for much longer and much more of the potential energy is extracted. This results in lower volumes of waste that is much less radioactive for much less time than that coming from traditional reactors. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nuclear fuel becomes “waste” when it no longer produces enough neutrons to sustain a nuclear chain reaction. The kinetic energy of neutrons drives the heat cycle that produces power. The gamma and beta radiation produced by “waste” isotopes contribute very little.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
