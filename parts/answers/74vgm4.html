		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A helicopter flies by using an engine to spin a primary rotor, but that rotor has inertia so when trying to spin it there is a force pushing back that tries to spin the helicopter body too.</p>
<p>Counter torque is provided by the tail rotor and ensures that only the main rotor rotates around the shaft and the body of the helicopter isn't also spinning around the shaft.  This is why a helicopter that loses the tail rotor starts spinning out of control</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Remember Newton's third law of motion? Each action has an equal and opposite reaction.</p>
<p>Imagine a helicopter with no tail rotor, and the main rotor spins counter clockwise. The helicopter's body will spin opposite to the helicopter's blades. So without a tail rotor, the body will just keep turning clockwise. In order to stabilize the body from turning in circles constantly, the tail rotor provides a force that pushes the helicopter's tail counter-clockwise, balancing out the torque provided by the main rotor.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2tdnqZgKa0E&amp;t=6m39s" target="_blank">Here's a video on YouTube that provides a visual example and explains the mechanics behind a tail rotor.</a></p>
<p>There are helicopters without tail rotors, but they have some sort of mechanism at the tail that produces the same effect a tail rotor does: provide a force at the tail opposite the helicopter's spin.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People here are mixing up the air resistance of the rotor with the torque from the engine.
The torque that makes the helicopter spin comes from the engine spinning the rotor.
If the rotor spins and is braked by air resistance no torque is applied to the body.  This is actually very important, as it allows you to do an autorotation (landing without engine power) if the tail rotor fails.<br />
.<br />
Also there are helicopter designs that do fly without any sort of tail rotor or torque compensation.
E. G. You can pump gas through the blades, that comes out at the tip of the blade pointing backwards.  This induces no torque on the body<br />

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The main rotor is constantly cutting into the air in one direction. If there was nothing bracing the body of the helicopter it would start turning in the other direction. Just like if you try to push something heavy while standing on a slippery surface you could go backwards, instead of pushing the object forward. </p>
<p>A helicopter has a vertical rotor on the back to counter the spinning of the main rotor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The helicopter isn't attached to anything, so as the main rotor turns, the helicopter will start to turn with it. Something has to counteract that or the helicopter will just spin eventually. The common way to do that is with a tail rotor, which pushes against the direction the helicopter would otherwise spin. The tail rotor is countering the torque of the main rotor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
