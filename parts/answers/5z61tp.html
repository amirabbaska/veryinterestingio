		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sounds are usually described by three characteristics - pitch, loudness, and quality (or &quot;timbre&quot;). Pitch is determined by frequency and describes how high or low a note is. Loudness is what it sounds like (forgive the pun - I simply mean loudness is self-explanatory). Everything else is generally categorized as &quot;timbre,&quot; which is what allows you to tell the difference between a piano and violin playing a note at the same pitch and loudness.</p>
<p>Quite a bit goes into timbre such as harmonic content, attack and decay, and vibrato. I don't really know enough about those to explain them further other than to say they are characteristics of sound waves that affect how you hear, but don't change the pitch or loudness. If you can find an app that lets you play around with a synthesizer, you can usually change those settings directly so you can play around with how they affect sound.</p>
<p>Edit: There are some more technical responses below from people who know more about this than I do. Check them out for more details. And thanks to everyone who provided more details!</p>
<p>Edit 2: Most of the comments below are saying that attack (the beginning of a sound and how long it takes to get to peak volume/loudness) and slight variations in the pitch and loudness are the physical properties that create different timbres, though the area is still being researched. Apparently when you play a note on an instrument the part of the instrument producing the note actually produces multiple frequencies and can have slight variations in loudness. The frequencies not associated with the pitch you hear are called overtones. You generally only perceive the fundamental frequency (the pitch of the note), but the overtones change how you perceive that. To bring it back to your original question, you can tell the difference between a piano and violin playing middle C because they have different attack, overtones, and the loudness during the note will change slightly. And you might not be able to tell the difference if you didn't hear the attack (the beginning of the note). </p>
<p>As an added bonus, if I understand correctly, the different overtones result in a different spectral flux and the changing loudness over the duration of the note results in a different spectral envelope.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oooooo!!! Somebody asked about the best electives we took in college, and I unwittingly answered this exact question in my excitement (with bonus radio info, because that's what I do for a living now)!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Physics of musical acoustics, what I remember of it, mostly went extremely in depth on what makes audio audio.</p>
<p>For instance, the timbre, or the <em>kind</em> of sound, is determined by the type of waveform.  A guitar, for instance, has a sine wave, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5X11Z4-fmE8" target="_blank">can be easily seen in slow motion</a>.  A violin, on the other hand, has a sawtooth wave, due to the <a href="http://waynestegall.com/politics/earthmusic.htm" target="_blank">string constantly catching the bow as it vibrates</a>.  Percussion has a scattered waveform that doesn't resonate well, hence why most people don't think of it having &quot;pitch&quot; in the same way other instruments do.  What we think of as electronic sounds are usually <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/uploaded_files/21451/SquareWave.gif" target="_blank">a square waveform</a>.</p>
<p>The pitch of the sound is determined by the frequency of the wave, or how many times the wave &quot;cycles&quot; in a given time period.  The slow motion guitar video I posted above does a great job of showing this, actually.  The thicker strings do not vibrate as quickly as the thinner ones do, which is why they are lower in pitch.  You can change the amount of cycles these strings will emit by tightening and loosening the strings.  The same thing is done with the air pockets in instruments like the oboe or the trumpet--by changing the size of the vibrating space, you change the pitch.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the amplitude.  Going back to the slow motion guitar, you might think that the cycles would be affected by how hard you plucked the strings.  But if you've ever played a guitar, you know that only the volume is affected by how hard you pluck the strings, not the pitch.  This is because they vibrate further up and down, not faster or slower.  So, simply put, the amplitude of a waveform is your volume.  The higher up and down the wave goes, the more powerful it will be.</p>
<p>Now where it gets tricky is when you get radio involved...  Amplitude modulation (AM), for instance, changes the amplitude of a radio signal that is of a much higher frequency than we can hear, and, then your radio when it receives that Very High Frequency (VHF) signal, then knows what frequency to strip off of it (the frequency you tuned your radio to), and leaves only those minor variations that were inserted in the signal.  Those minor variations in amplitude?  They're the audio that was originally inserted into the signal, called the &quot;intelligence&quot;.</p>
<p>Frequency Modulation (FM) does the same thing, only it inserts minor variations in the frequency of the signal, then strips off that frequency in the same way and takes the difference, leaving just the original audio frequency.</p>
<p>Anyway... physics is awesome.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/tellahthesage is right on the money: timbre is what defines it all, and there's a lot that goes into it.</p>
<p>Let's start with a pure tone (i.e. a sine wave) at 1000 Hz, or 1kHz. (For reference, that's close to the C two octaves above middle C.) <strong>Harmonics</strong> are multiples of the frequency at lower levels, e.g. 2kHz, 4kHz, 8kHz, and so forth. Adding different harmonics in different mathematical patterns will result in different wave shapes and different sounds. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-sinusoidal_waveform" target="_blank">Wikipedia has some good links on the subject</a>, including sample clips of the main wave forms.
Incidentally, a given instrument may 'voice' two (or more) notes simultaneously, with a harmonic series for each note, which adds complexity and in some cases (like percussion), perhaps noise.</p>
<p>Now that we have a wave form, we can vary the pitch of it by a little bit. This is <strong>vibrato</strong>, and is described by a width (how much it varies - maybe a quarter tone for example) and frequency (how fast it varies). A similar (but not identical) effect can be got by varying the <em>volume</em> by a small amount, which is called <strong>tremolo</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, you can change how fast the note gets up to 'full' volume (<strong>attack</strong>), and how fast it fades away afterwards (<strong>decay</strong>). A flute has a relatively slow attack. A hammered piano note has a much faster attack, and a glockenspiel (with metal bars and hard mallets) is faster still. A violin note doesn't actually decay as long as the musician is bowing it continuously, whereas a damped xylophone will fall off very quickly.</p>
<p>And that's...most of it. Except for all of the other parts. :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Everything mentioned here is great! Superb answers, all. One thing is missing tho: noise, and its colours. </p>
<p>In addition to the basic tone and its various overtones, there is always some level of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise" target="_blank">noise</a> in any given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timbre" target="_blank">timbre.</a> Noise can mean many things, but in this context, it means sound that is not recognizable as one focussed frequency, but is spread out across the spectrum; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise" target="_blank">white noise</a> being probably the most well-known variety. </p>
<p>White noise was given the name because, like white light, it was once thought to be sound spread evenly across the spectrum, AKA all frequencies at once, evenly distributed. This has since been disproven, but among <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colors_of_noise" target="_blank">the other colours of noise</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_noise" target="_blank">pink noise</a> has been found to truly give an equal loudness to all audible frequencies.</p>
<p>That's just a fun tangent tho; no physical instrument consistently produces any one colour of noise perfectly, but they all do produce different colours of noise, changing along with the other elements of timbre. </p>
<p>Elements of noise like the breath of a flautist may increase or decrease with loudness, or the flautist may deliberately make their sound <em>more breathy</em> (more noisy) by varying the shape of their mouth, AKA their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embouchure" target="_blank">embrouchure.</a></p>
<p>The bowed instruments are a classic example; the bow produces a <a href="http://knutsacoustics.com/files/Noisy-instruments.pdf" target="_blank">fairly noisy and complex timbre,</a> as the sound is produced by friction, an action we all have experienced as being &quot;noisy&quot;.</p>
<p>Once you get into electronic instruments, noise becomes a fully malleable thing; you can increase it, modulate it, make it reactive to loudness/pitch/time in new ways, or just completely neglect to add it, for a decidedly unnatural yet pure sound.</p>
<p>Incidentally, noise is a vital component of modern emergency vehicle sirens; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directional_siren" target="_blank">it helps our ears detect where the sound is coming from,</a> an incredibly useful thing in busy traffic.</p>
<p>Hope this was as fun to read as it was to write!</p>
<p>Edit: Whoops! Turns out I was wrong, and pink noise isn't equally loud across the spectrum; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grey_noise" target="_blank">gray noise</a> is the correct answer, I just like pink noise better, and my desires hijacked my memory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three elements of sound: pitch, amplitude, and timbre. </p>
<p>Pitch refers to the rate at which the sound is vibrating, measured by frequency over a second. A440 refers to a sound vibrating at 440 times a second, for example. This is measured in hertz (hz).</p>
<p>Amplitude refers to attack, peak, and decay of a sound. So essentially how fast and loud does the sound peak to its max volume, and likewise how does it decay back into silence (or the next note). </p>
<p>Finally, and most importantly, is timbre, which refers to the harmonic qualities of a sound. This is what determines the unique quality of any instrument or voice. </p>
<p>Essentially, every sound made by a physical source (hitting a cymbal, striking a piano note, attacking a string on a guitar, etc.) is composed not just of the “principle” or “fundamental” note — what we might call “middle C” — but of lots of other notes or pitches that aren’t as prominent as the fundamental. These other notes that compose the entire sound of a given pitch on an instrument are called “harmonics” or “overtones.” (Technically there are some minor differences between these two words, but for the purposes of this explanation, don’t worry). </p>
<p>The best way to illustrate how this works this is to google “sine wave,” and you’ll hear an electronic generated sound wave that is only composed of a single note, such as just a 440hz. It sounds really odd and unnatural. This is because there aren’t any other </p>
<p>The reason every instrument sounds different is because the amplitude of these overtones are varied. For example, the fundamental pitch of the note is twice as loud as the first overtone, which is an octave higher than the fundamental. The first overtone is four times as loud as the second overtone, which is a fifth higher than the first overtone (and an octave and an a fifth higher than the fundamental). This continues on a loose logarithmic scale, with the amplitude of each successive overtone decreasing at a given rate. </p>
<p>What this rate is for each instrument and the “harmonic” composition of each pitch is different for each instrument (and each person’s voice, or any physical sound). You can, interestingly, map the composition of an instrument visually or mathematically. </p>
<p>This is how electronic instruments attempt to “sample” or “synthesize” real physical instruments through electronic means. There is software out there that, for example, has spent thousands of hours sampling real string instruments to such a precise degree that it’s nearly impossible to tell the difference between the electronic and real versions of, say, a violin. You can adjust for all three elements of sounds. And there’s a reason that this particular plugin costs somewhere around $5,000. </p>
<p>Hope that helps. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
