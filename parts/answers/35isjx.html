		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If no one has gone in depth, I will later (on a phone), but its a highly variable process depending on the organic material being deposited, the nature of the deposits, the &quot;oil generation kitchen&quot; available with respect to the processes of diagenesis, catagenesis and metagenesis and the rates at which those processes are occurring.</p>
<p>The mesozoic (age of reptiles/dinos) was fairly prolific for deposition due to climactic reasons (largely algae) and why people often think that oil is Dino bones or Dino blood, but the Dino's are coincidental to the oil production.</p>
<p>Today's climate isn't great for deposition, so it certainly wouldn't be looked upon as prolific no matter what the geology does going forward.</p>
<p>[Here's a primer on the Dia/Meta/Catagenetic process if you're curious.] (<a href="http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780120885305/casestudies/01-Ch26-P088530web.pdf&ved=0CDUQFjAH&usg=AFQjCNHKzYTvt-lh3UK7oaq9e_u7B1_BmA" target="_blank">http://booksite.elsevier.com/9780120885305/casestudies/01-Ch26-P088530web.pdf&ved=0CDUQFjAH&usg=AFQjCNHKzYTvt-lh3UK7oaq9e_u7B1_BmA</a>)</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>  I should be clear -- when we talk about prolific periods of oil generation in petroleum geology we're referring to that source rock / the period in which the organic matter that will eventually become oil was deposited (and sometimes the overlying reservoirs).  Things get a while lot murkier when we start asking about the time periods in which that source got cooked in the oil generation kitchen.  Its certainly happening as we speak in a variety of source rocks around the world but it would be incredibly hard to quantify.</p>
<p>One noteworthy one in north america is the Bakken -- it's actually (generally speaking) an undercooked fairly prolific source upper and lower black shale with a silt or sand between that some of our oil has migrated into.  If we left it alone it would likely continue to generate.  It's Devonian, so older than most reservoirs but also a less thermally mature source rock than most, which speaks to the difficulty of figuring out when oil will be generated from a particular source. </p>
<p><strong>EDIT2:</strong>  To flesh this out a little further now that I'm in front of a keyboard:</p>
<p>The first thing you need to produce oil is organic matter.  When it's part of a sedimentary rock, we refer to this organic matter as Kerogen.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://spec2000.net/text106fp/toc11.jpg" target="_blank">four types of Kerogen</a>, in descending order for potential oil productivity. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Type I / Sapropelic / Alginite.  Marine &amp; Most productive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type II / Exinite / Amorphous Kerogen. Mostly Marine &amp; second most productive </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type III / Vitrinic / Humic.  Tough sledding for oil production, only under extreme circumstances.  Great for coal and methane production</p>
</li>
<li>Type IV / Inertinite.  As the name might suggest, useless decomposed organic matter.</li>
</ul>
<p>So the first step to producing a quality source rock is to get Type I and Type II kerogens buried in the sea floor in an anoxic environment (if there's oxygen available, you'll end up with decomposed Type IV kerogen, which isn't going to help even if we have algae dying and raining down in quantity).</p>
<p>Next step, once we have our buried kerogen, is to cook it.  <a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SppkVCspMu8/UnzxgoX-SrI/AAAAAAAAAsk/y9DHj9-DqTo/s1600/tn30_f01.jpg" target="_blank">This occurs in three phases (two of which we're looking for</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Diagenesis:  Microbes are going to have at our kerogens below about 60 degrees C, and will largely produce some get some biogenic gas from our kerogens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Catagenesis: From about 60 degrees to 150C, increasing temperature will result in thermal cracking, transforming our kerogens into the oil we're looking for, in addition to some gas... increasing wet gas fractions as we get to the upper end of that range.</p>
</li>
<li>Metagensis: If we turn the temperature up too hot (&gt; ~ 150C), we're going to keep cracking our kerogen and coal into dry gas / methane and carbon residue.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the ELI5 on the process, if you're interested in the chemistry, the link in my original post above goes through it in greater detail.</p>
<p>So to accurately know the rate at which the earth is producing petroleum, you would need to know what the volume and type of kerogen rich source rocks worldwide that are currently going through these various phases as well as the volume of kerogen rich source rocks currently being deposited and take a stab at their geologic future.
, as well the volume of kerogen rich source rocks that will one day end up in catagenesis.</p>
<p>In terms of <em>actually producing</em> that oil, we would need to add on a lengthy discussion reservoirs, porosity and permeability.</p>
<p>tl;dr I wouldn't be comfortable even taking a stab at your question OP, but I hope that the above helps to explain why it would be so difficult to make that calculation...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a lab it can take hours or days. </p>
<p>But you mean, &quot;naturally&quot;, right? The actual process (catogenesis) is quite fast - getting the raw materials into the situation where it can start in the first place is the hard part and that is the bit that takes a long time. This means that natural oil production is not like an industrial process that is done a gallon at a time ... but millions of barrels in one setup. n a typical petroleum system such as the Mississippi River delta, it may take 10 million years to bury the material deep enough for it to reach temperatures of catagenesis. Add in some volcanic activity that makes a high geothermal gradient and that timing may be quite short and no longer in millions of years. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not sure that's an imminently answerable question.  It would depend on the rate of <del>animal</del> <em>organic</em> matter making it into sedimentary rock, which is very very slow. </p>
<p>The world's total future and historical unproven reserves of oil is approximately 2.5 trillion barrels. (+/- 1 trillion).  The age of the oil is almost all under 350mya.</p>
<p>This quick (and dirty, inaccurate, etc) math gives us ~7,000 barrels per year.   It's probably not right, but I'd wager it's within 2 orders of magnitude of reality.  </p>
<p>Fermi Approximation is our friend here and says &quot;about 10,000 barrels per year&quot;:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a previous answer stated, it mostly occurred in the mesozoic.
basically what happened was a period of increased primary production in the ocean, and a lack of oxygen in the ocean. This allowed the organic carbon from the primary producers to sink without being taken up by oxygen, creating what is known as a black shale. Black shales are basically oil or natural gas deposits in colloquial terms.
This process happens all the time, but about 1/3+ of the world's fossil fuels are believed to have been created during the ocean anoxic events of the mesozoic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Geologically most of the coal in the world is from the 50 million period where tress had evolved however fungi hadn't caught up - thus they piled up, allowing the conditions required to be met easily. These days the conditions can still be met, however it is much rarer... Also the process itself does take millions of years, so my views are coal is very much a finite resource.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
