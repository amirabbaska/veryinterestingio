		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Manufacturers (or more accurately their marketing departments) sometimes use the terms interchangeably but in the most common usage, AWD is safe to use on dry pavement and 4wd is not.  The reason for this is the <a href="http://www.cars.com/go/advice/vpedia/center_differential_popup.jsp" target="_blank">center differential</a>, a set of gears that allows the front wheels and rear wheels to turn at different speeds when turning.  You have a differential between the two drive wheels of a 2wd car or truck as well, if you didn't, your drivetrain would wear out extremely quickly as the inner wheel needs to turn slower than the outer wheel during any kind of turn.</p>
<p>In a typical 4wd truck or jeep with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_case" target="_blank">transfer case</a> you have essentially a rear-wheel-drive vehicle with an extra gearbox that allows you to engage another driveshaft to power the front wheels. (and also typically a gear reduction so you can put both driveshafts in low range.)  It's a better system for hardcore offroading and simpler to manufacture, but it has the limitation on dry pavement that both driveshafts are mechanically linked together, putting a similar strain on the drivetrain as a 2wd car with no differential. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are technical differences between the 2, but the core is this.</p>
<p>AWD is intended for use 100% of the time.  Most AWD vehicles do not include the ability to turn it on or off.</p>
<p>4wd vehicles are normally RWD unless 4WD is engaged.  It is not considered a good idea to engage 4wd on dry pavement or at normal driving speeds.  4wd is intended for use in off road type situations only, not in normal day to day driving. </p>
<p>Normally 4wd is only offered on trucks or vehicles that are based on trucks.  AWD is a much newer technology that's often available on smaller SUVs or cars. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When in lower than ideal traction situations with wheels slipping/stuck:</p>
<p>2WD: 1 of 2 drive wheels will spin</p>
<p>4WD: 1 front and 1 back wheel will spin</p>
<p>AWD: 1 of the 4 drive wheels will spin</p>
<p>This can be modified with things like locking differentials, limited slip differentials, and other fancy stuff like brake assisting</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
