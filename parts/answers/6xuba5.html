		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The compression on the chest squeezes the heart, pushing some blood out of it. When the compression stops the change in pressure allows the blood to fill the heart again, much as it does between heartbeats. The valves in the heart keep everything going in the right direction. </p>
<p>The compressions also ventilate some air in and out of the lungs as the chest size expands and contracts. It is not as good as regular breathing though or having a bag mask, but it should be enough to keep the bare minimum of oxygen circulating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The CPR compressions only provide about 1/3 the usual blood volume that would normally be put out by the heart beating regularly. Also, research shows that it takes a few minutes for the pressure in the system to build up adequately each time you start compressions. </p>
<p>So it's essential to compress hard, compress fast, and avoid even momentary interruptions whenever possible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your heart is made up of four chambers with valves. Blood comes in the right side from the body, goes to the lungs to pick up oxygen, then returns to the left side of the heart before going to the body.</p>
<p>During cpr the chest is compressed which squeezes the blood out of the heart (into both the lungs and the body) the compression of the chest also causes negative pressure which causes the heart to fill with blood. This is why you want to minimize hands off time during CPR and why the standard in adults has changed to 30:2. </p>
<p>As an important note your blood has some oxygen in it even without respirations. Studies indicate oxygen levels can supply about 10 minutes of compression only CPR. This is why a lot of protocols have been down playing the importance of respirations (paired with the risk of infection and the concern of lay responders about doing it improperly) </p>
<p>If you are having an cardiac arrest because of an electrical disturbance in the heart you will likely need a defibrillator to stop the disturbance and allow the heart to beat properly again. If it has another cause CPR can provide time to treat the problem with medicine, surgery or fluid.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know if I'm allowed to post a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjqgjziR1WA" target="_blank">3D CPR animation</a>. If not, sorry and feel free to delete my post.</p>
<p>In the animation, you can clearly see that by applying pressure on the sternum and indirectly on the heart, it makes the blood flow through the body, especially the brain. Plus, it also applies pressure on the lungs, which keeps the air going in and coming out of them. As expected, with such constant and high pressure, the ribs are often cracked.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
