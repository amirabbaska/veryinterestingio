		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You mean &quot;micro gravity&quot; as &quot;anti-gravity&quot; is more of a science fiction term (<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-microgravity-58.html" target="_blank">micro-gravity is NASA's term</a> about living and working in/on spacecraft). Or more likely just &quot;weightlessness&quot;.</p>
<p>Female astronauts have the option of carrying their preferred pads or tampons while in space (<a href="http://www.popsci.com/brief-history-menstruating-in-space" target="_blank">Popular Science 2016</a>). If they choose to not get their periods they can medically induce amenorrhea, or stop their periods from happening (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/04/menstruating-in-space/479229/" target="_blank">The Atlantic 2016</a>). There was <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npjmgrav20168" target="_blank">a scientific paper</a> written on medically induced amenorrhea in female astronauts in 2016. </p>
<p>There are several ways to induce amenorrhea, through hormonal pills, injections or intrauterine device (IUDs). While it is safe to have your period in space, it may not be all that convenient to switch pads or tampons and deal with disposal. The water treatment is also set up to recycle water from urine, but not menstrual blood so that is also an issue (<a href="https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2014/acs-presspac-april-9-2014/recycling-astronaut-urine-for-energy-and-drinking-water.html" target="_blank">American Chemical Society 2014</a>).</p>
<p>According to National Geographic (link below) if a woman spent three years in space she would need about 1,100 pills, which adds some weight to a mission but is less unwieldy than many tampons. Alternatively, three years worth of tampons (or pads) still weighs more than three years worth of pills.</p>
<p>Female astronauts' periods have a long history. National Geographic has a great opening paragraph in one of <a href="http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2016/04/22/how-do-women-deal-with-having-a-period-in-space/" target="_blank">their articles</a> on the subject:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sally Ride’s tampons might be the most-discussed tampons in the world. Before Ride became the first American woman in space, scientists pondered her tampons, weighed them, and NASA’s professional sniffer smelled them—better to take deodorized or non-deodorized?—to make sure they wouldn’t smell too strongly in a confined space capsule. Engineers considered exactly how many she might need for a week in space. (Is 100 the right number?, they famously asked her. No, Ride said. That is not the right number.)</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think what you were getting at is how does the blood come out without gravity? Because in that case it actually doesn't require gravity, the muscles in the uterus push it out sufficiently enough that it's unnecessary to worry about, but the comments about how you would deal with it are all correct and quite frankly hilarious on the scientists part. As a physicist who is a part of mission planning it's obvious that none of the men (who make of 90% of the field) would have any idea how to deal with such an issue. </p>
<p>Edit: source! This article mentions how the uterus does the work. <a href="http://www.today.com/health/do-you-get-your-period-space-why-microgravity-menstruation-matters-t87711" target="_blank">http://www.today.com/health/do-you-get-your-period-space-why-microgravity-menstruation-matters-t87711</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
