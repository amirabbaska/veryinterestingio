		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of times nausea is caused by your stomach being very full, not necessarily just with food but also with air.  If you have a bit of soda it can make it easier to burp and release some of the gas in there which puts pressure on the top of your stomach and nerves that make you feel uncomfortably full and nauseous.  Release some of that air and there is less pressure and less nausea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Carbonation stimulates the pyloric valve (the sphincter between the far end of the stomach and the small intestine), allowing it to open longer than it usually does. Carbonation allows you to empty the stomach more quickly in the proper direction. Other ingredients (ginger, for example) may be helpful, but plain carbonated water does the trick, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To everyone saying it doesn't help- that is a narrow view. One sip of diet soda can help with nausea I sometimes get in the mornings.  Sometimes I also get very nauseous along with the urge to sneeze. When I sneeze, the nausea is instantly gone. I've never met anyone else with the same symptoms. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
