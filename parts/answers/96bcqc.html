		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Primarily by making it happen to a very very small amount of material. 5.5 Trillion degrees sounds like a lot, but in terms of mass x thermal energy, the sample size at that temperate is so small that if you distributed all the energy there into a bucket of water, it wouldn't boil.</p>
<p>The LHC is aiming to create a very specific set of conditions on a very small sample.  They use a lot of energy to smash stuff together and witness high energy interactions, but it happens using a very small amount of mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>All Celcius in this comment, but it works for any temperature scale. </p>
<p>Imagine you have a bucket of water at 80 degrees and another bucket of the same size at 40 degrees. You mix them in a bath tub and then you have water at 60 degrees. Half and half gives you the temperature in the middle.</p>
<p>If you have a bucket at 23 degrees (room temperature) and a single drop at 99 degrees, mixing them is going to give you a bath tub of water at 23.0001 degrees. Not even close to the middle temperature, but that's because there is not much hot water.</p>
<p>The same idea applies but there is WAY less than a drop of matter at 5 trillion degrees, it's a few particles (atomic particles) in a machine that weighs thousands of tonnes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert on the LHC, so I'll let someone else explain that, but an important basis for this is the definition of temperature, which is the average kinetic energy in the random movement if particles. It might make more sense to call it the &quot;average particle shakiness.&quot;</p>
<p>Your body right now is at about 310 degrees Kelvin (the absolute temperature scale used so that Zero Kelvin is absolute zero, or no shakiness). But you have a massive amount of molecules inside you. For our purposes, let's say it's about a trillion trillions. This means that if we could somehow suck all the thermal energy from your body and put into just 1 trillion molecules, they would each have a temperature in the range of trillions of Kelvin (or Celsius, which is basically the same).</p>
<p>This doesnt explain HOW energy is given, but hopefully it helps illustrate what temperature means. A single particle at a high temperature is nothing compared to the amount of energy in any visible substance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nobody seems to have explained how they measure the temperature. Well the short answer is they don't measure it, they calculate it. At that high of temperature there is nothing that can be done to actually measure it as it would melt anything that touched it (ignoring a couple other things that would make this impossible as this is eli5) and the blackbody radiation emmited from it would be such high frequency that we could not measure it based on that, and for samples of this size it would rarely emit even single photons. The way that they figure out the temperature is actually quite simple. They measure the amount of energy they put into or measure the amount of energy that can be extracted and use the amount of energy and the number of particles to figure out the temperature. For example if you put water in the microwave for a minute you would be able to figure out the temperature based on how much water you put in and the power of your microwave.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
