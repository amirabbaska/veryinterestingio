There may be a more complex hormonal interaction behind it, as well. Drink a liter of water, eat a light snack, and do some stretches and squats.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your brain releases melatonin every evening depending on your sleep cycle. So you feel sleepy , tired and tend to get rest. When it’s time to wake up, the melatonin level reduces and you are all set to start your day with higher vital signs and blood pressure. </p>
<p>But if you stay inactive/over sleep, you disturb the melatonin cycle and the body gets confused about whether it needs to rest or not. Your body says it’s doesn’t need melatonin but the brain thinks it does. So there is an irregularity. In this case you feel tired yet not sleepy. </p>
<p>Basically it’s all about the melatonin release rhythm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I remember from school, there are chemicals released in your brain while you sleep, and oversleeping can result in more of that being present.  </p>
<p>Because of that, your brain becomes “soggy” for lack of a better term, which makes you feel tired or groggy instead of refreshed and awake. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's best to wake in-between deep sleep cycles rather than in the middle of one. Waking in the middle of REM can lead you to feeling groggy during the day. If you wake during non-REM you're more likely to feel alert and attentive as the day progresses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There’s a common misconception that hours of sleep is this magical number and if you hit it then you should feel fine. How you get those hours is incredibly important as well. Most people need 7-9 hours of sleep. Some people need more, and some lucky bastards need less. </p>
<p>It’s important to wake up at the same time EVERYDAY. This includes WEEKENDS. If you’re waking up for school/work everyday (for the sake of this post) at 6am. Then you go and wake up at 9 am on the weekend. You will feel groggy during the weekend, it’s essentially your body’s clock going “wtf are you doing, you were supposed wake up three hours ago. I’m super confused right now, idk what to do, let’s just make this dingus feel tired.” If your body’s clock is confused then you feel like shit. And unfortunately your body’s clock is a bit fragile</p>
<p>How do you fix this? Wake up at the same time everyday and don’t wake up more than 15 minutes before or after the time you woke up the night before. I wake up around 6 AM six days a week. I allow myself to sleep in one day during the weekend if I go out with my friends the night before. It works well for me and Monday’s are much more tolerable. </p>
<p>I also want to make clear that if you’re up until 3 AM and then you wake up at 6 AM you will feel like shit. You still need to get your 7-9 hours of sleep</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
