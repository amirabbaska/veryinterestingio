		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can look at <a href="http://www.enigmaathome.net/" target="_blank">http://www.enigmaathome.net/</a> to see some actual working examples.  They decrypted 3 previously unknown Enigma messages and it took the equivalent of 7748 years, 303 days, 14 hours of PC time based on a single Athlon 3500+ PC.  This was basically a brute force effort, using all the known weaknesses of the Enigma machines.</p>
<p>For a generic example, Wikipedia says &quot;If the wiring is secret, the total number of possible configurations has been calculated to be around 10^114 (approximately 380 bits); with known wiring and other operational constraints, this is reduced to around 10^23 (76 bits).&quot;</p>
<p>At 100 GFLOPS (decent modern processor), this would be about 3.17x10^94 years for the more complex case (longer than the universe has existed).  For the limited case where we assume we've captured an Enigma machine and know the wiring &amp; limitations of the system, it's about 3,169 years on average to brute force it.  This jives fairly closely with the practical enigmaathome results above.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer depends on whether you're trying to brute-force the answer, or trying to use the weaknesses of the Enigma and its usage protocol to break it the same way the allies did in WW2.</p>
<p>The top comment tells you about the brute-force case: this would still take a very long time, because there are many possibilities to check. But the problem in the war was that many possibilities could be eliminated by clever logic. Using this method with a simulated Bombe, enigma messages can be decrypted in a few seconds on a home computer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Not really relevant to the question, but this guy always comes to mind when the Enigma is mentioned on reddit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
