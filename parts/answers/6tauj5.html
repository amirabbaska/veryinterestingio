<p>Briefly, the color of something can depend on the environment, particularly the polarity of the solvent. When the solvent evaporates, the environment changes and so does the color.</p>
<p>Less likely possibilities are the dye being volatile and evaporating or the color not really changing, just the amount used is small enough that you can't detect the color in a thin layer like you can in a thick bottle.</p>
<p>If you have particular products in mind, we can try to find the composition and determine if one of these hypotheses is correct. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another possibility (although I don't know if this is responsible in your case) is simply that the large dye molecules, when hit by UV radiation, sometimes break apart into non-colourful smaller molecules. Since sunlight contains UV radiation (it's what tans our skin), anything that spends a long time in the sun might fall victim to this effect. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
