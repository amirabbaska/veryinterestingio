		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You use a piece of software called an &quot;input method editor,&quot; which allows conventional-looking keyboards to produce the thousands of characters used in written Chinese. There's no standard system, though, so two Chinese keyboards may not look exactly the same and they may not function in the same way.</p>
<p>In the Peoples' Republic of China, most computer users type out their Chinese in transliteration, using the standard Roman alphabet keys on a QWERTY keyboard. To generate a character, you type out its sound according to the same spelling system—called Pinyin—that represents the name of China's capital with the word &quot;Beijing.&quot; The computer automatically converts the Pinyin spelling to the correct Chinese characters on the screen.</p>
<p>Or at least it's supposed to. There are lots of Chinese words that sound similar but look different on paper. If you're using the Pinyin input method, you'll have to put in some extra effort to make sure the right characters show up onscreen. First, you can follow a syllable with a digit, to indicate which of several intonations you want. If the computer still doesn't have enough information to pick a character, you'll have to choose from a pop-up list of possibilities.</p>
<p>The best Pinyin input methods can guess what you mean to say according to the context and by suggesting the most commonly used characters first. In this way they function a bit like the text-editing software on most cell phones. Some input methods let you set arbitrary shortcuts: If you found yourself typing out the Chinese word for blog—&quot;bu-luo-ge&quot;—over and over again, you could assign it to a simpler letter combination, like &quot;b-l-g.&quot; Even with the fancy software, though, typing in Pinyin can be a drag.</p>
<p>Speed-typists in mainland China use another input method called Wubi. To type a character in Wubi, you don't spell out how it sounds—you punch in a sequence of keys that corresponds to what it looks like and how it's drawn. A Wubi-configured keyboard looks just like the Western version but has additional labels on each key. The QWERTY keys are divided into five regions for different types of pen strokes: left-falling, right-falling, horizontal, vertical, and hook. You &quot;spell&quot; a character by typing out up to four strokes, in the order in which you'd draw them on paper. (For intricate characters made of many strokes, you'd type the first three and then the last one.) If he knows what he's doing, a Wubi typist can produce up to 160 characters per minute.</p>
<p>Older people who aren't comfortable with typing might be more inclined to use an electronic writing tablet instead. The precise strokes of Chinese characters make them relatively easy for a computer to distinguish. Many other methods exist as well. The stroke-count system, for example, lets you type in the number of strokes required for a given character and choose the right candidate from a long list. The four-corner system lets you draw out a character by entering numbers for the graphical element in each corner: A &quot;1&quot; makes a horizontal stroke, a &quot;2&quot; is vertical or diagonal, and so on.</p>
<p>Bonus Explainer: Bloggers in mainland China would likely use a different keyboard and input method than bloggers in Taiwan (or even bloggers in Hong Kong). A standard Taiwanese keyboard lets you use the Zhuyin input method, which is based on an alphabet for sounding out Chinese words that was designed in the early 20th century. The Taiwanese also use an input method called Cangjie, which works sort of like Wubi but lets you type out the full set of traditional Chinese characters (rather than the simplified set used in the PRC).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The others have explained using words, here's a picture of how it looks like for Japanese on an iPhone. Two ways to go about it (I messed up the upload so the order is reversed, sorry):</p>
<p><a href="http://m.imgur.com/gallery/DJYpo" target="_blank">http://m.imgur.com/gallery/DJYpo</a></p>
<p>2nd pic: Roman alphabet equivalents on a QWERTY keyboard. The IME converts it to hiragana by default as soon as it recognises a syllable. In the screenshot I ended the word in an 'n', which <em>can</em> be a syllable, or can be the beginning of a syllable. Since the software is undecided it still shows me the roman alphabet letter until it can be sure. </p>
<p>The iphone software shows you possible kanjis/katakana for what you've written based on word frequency. The word I spelled is a very common one that is usually written in kanji, so it was easy for the software to assume what I mean. The software also offers alternative readings (since many words can have the same pronounciation). In this case, there are no other common words with the same readings, so it is just suggesting the plain hiragana and katakana readings in case I want them. </p>
<p>On a computer it would be pretty much the same, but instead of an autocorrect layout you get the word automatically converted to the most common kanji reading, with a drop down menu in case you want an alternate reading. </p>
<p>1st pic: This is what japanese people use for their phones. Rather than writing down roman alphabet letters, you just use a hiragana keyboard. Each block here is a group of syllables, you press the group you want and select the syllable you need. The autocorrect functions as with 1). Some laptops have hiragana keyboards, though I've not met anyone who actually uses them.</p>
<p>(Eli5 level N.b.) Japanese has 3 writing systems used in different settings. Hiragana represents basic syllables and is used for grammar and some vocab,  katakana are the syllables but mostly used for loanwords or for aesthetic effect, kanjis are ideograms which are used for vocabulary. In the screenshot I wrote in the word for simple, which is kantan in roman alphabet, かんたん in hiragana, 簡単 in kanji, カンタン in katakana. </p>
<p>N.b. 2: since syllables start with a consonant (or lack of), they are grouped depending on the first letter (in the picture you can see the T group: ta te ti/chi to tsu)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My wife sometimes types in Chinese and Korean and both of us sometimes type in Japanese. Others have addressed Chinese/Japanese input methods, however, so I'll go ahead and address the Korean side. </p>
<p>Although Korean (Hangul/Hangeul) isn't technically character based in the same sense as Chinese or Japanese, it isn't really rendered using the familiar Latin/Greek/Cyrllic style alphabet system either. Rather, Korean &quot;letters&quot; combine into syllable blocks. For example, 한 (han) is a single &quot;character&quot; block that is made up of three &quot;letters&quot; h+a+n. On a normal keyboard or telephone you can't easily type 한, but you can type those composite parts. I know of two input methods that enable this.</p>
<p>First, you can type the romanized equivalent of the sound and have it generate a Hangul &quot;letter.&quot; So you might type h, which will then show as ㅎ. Continuing in sequence, you'd type a forㅏ and n for ㄴ. At this point the computer recognizes a syllable block and combines them into 한. </p>
<p>In the alternative, you can actually type Hangul letters. Unlike Chinese characters, and similar to Kana, the total number of Hangul is relatively limited, which means keyboards and context sensitive menus can be directly mapped. So you could manually type ㅎㅏㄴ and then it'd become 한. </p>
<p>In a lot of ways, electronic Hangul production is like building different miniature puzzles with a shared set of pieces!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan has 3 writing systems: one for ordinary words, one for foreign words and the chinese characters. We can type the syllable in roman letters 'kanji' and it comes up automatically in the first system like this: かんじ (this means chinese character) then if then hit space on a keyboard it converts to the chinese characters like this: 漢字. There will be multiple options if the word has another meaning eg kanji also means feeling, so it could be 感じ.</p>
<p>On a cell phone there are two keyboard layouts- the qwerty layout or <a href="http://cdn-obs.line-apps.com/line/r/lineq/c/81c2ce13-b2a5-456d-ae3b-08f530599a5acc1a92t0497a833/200x200.rf" target="_blank">a number layout like this</a></p>
<p>The way you type certain syllables using roman letters is strange though, if I want to type Hello Kitty in Japanese it'd be typed 'haro-kitexi' where the - makes an elongated vowel and the x makes a small vowel change to the previous syllable. It's weird but you just get used to typing like that. Japanese are awful at spelling English words though and the keyboard system really doesn't help. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Native Hindi Speaker here. </p>
<p>Similar to the Chinese and Japanese language keyboards, Google also has Hindi keyboards which work through transliteration. If I want to type hello or namaste in Hindi, I'll use the Google Hindi Input keyboard and type in hello (हेल्लो) or namaste (नमस्ते) which it transliterates into Hindi. One gets a few options to choose the correct spelling though, for e.g., when we write N in English it may mean न or ण in Hindi (slight difference in pronunciation. There are quite a few such examples). This is one of the easiest methods and is also available for desktop PCs/laptops.</p>
<p>However, many mobile companies in India are nowadays giving their own Hindi keyboards which have their own layout with Hindi alphabets and vowel sounds instead of the English alphabets.</p>
<p>It is upto the individual to choose which one they prefer.</p>
<p>The specific Hindi keyboard has been available for quite a few years as my mother used to type out Hindi/Sanskrit question papers for exams since at least the last 10 years. However, it was on a desktop and you had to use the English keyboard with a software that would allow Hindi typing on an English keyboard. That was quite laborious (though with regular use my mother did become quite fast) and did not work on all computers. So it would show Hindi on our computer but just garbled English characters on other PCs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
