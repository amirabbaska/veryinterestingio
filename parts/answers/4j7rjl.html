		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The trampoline thing is mostly crap. Maybe there's a good analogy in there somewhere but personally I think it creates much more confusion than anything else. I disagree with popularizers dropping it like it's nothing, without any actual explanation of how it relates to reality (very little actually).</p>
<p>So set it aside.</p>
<p>2D black holes are very cool. By this I mean you build general relativity but instead of in 3+1 dimensions  (space + time) you work in 2+1 dimensions. It turns out empty spacetime is always flat in this theory! Therefore there is no actual gravitational force. The equivalent of a black hole in this theory does not attract you. It's a conical defect, in that the length of a circumference around it of radius r is not 2Ï€r, but actually less, and the angle defect is proportional to the mass. (This is entirely analogous to what happens with strings of mass in 3+1D, see cosmic strings).</p>
<p>2+1D gravity is what one calls a topological theory, in that locally nothing of interest actually happens, as there are no gravitational waves and no curvature outside of a massive body, but there still are global gravitational effects such as the angle defect mentioned earlier which can only be measured by enclosing a planet in a loop and measuring its length. A local observer with its small ruler cannot see these global observables.</p>
<p>This makes 2+1D gravity very tantalizing because it's much, much easier to solve than normal gravity, and so to quantize, which is a very important subject of research. Moreover, Ed Witten has argued for a couple of unexpected equivalences of this theory with other bizzare theories which have made it possible to partially explicitly solve this theory in its quantum version and also to reveal subtle relationships with completely different areas of theoretical physics such as CFTs and gauge theories; this kind of relationships reek of string theory generally so probably there's a connection.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never mind a mathematical 2-D BH, here's a practical way of making an <em>actual</em> 2-D Event Horizon (Black Hole not so much).</p>
<p>Imagine a large pool of water, not very deep, say 2 feet deep, but several hundred feet in each horizontal direction. In the middle of the pool is a hole in the bottom, acting as a drain, and indeed water is draining out of the pool.</p>
<p>Now, as you can easily imagine, the nearer the drain you are, the faster the water is moving towards the drain. In fact since it's a 2-D situation not 3-D, instead of an inverse squared law we use a simple inverse law, no squaring needed. So the rate of flow towards the drain is proportional to 1/r, (not 1/r^2 ).</p>
<p>At some distance from the drain, assuming the drain is actually big enough to be draining a lot of water, the speed of water moving towards the drain will be equal to the speed of sound in water. This is an acoustic Event Horizon: any sound emitted inside that boundary can never get to, let alone past, the boundary. Thus it behaves just like a BH with an EH, but for sound not light. But you can (so I read somewhere) still do useful experiments with a setup like that.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not that it's a good analogy (As others said), but in the trampoline analogy, it should just be a really really deep, sharp depression in the trampoline (as if you pushed down the trampoline with a very sharp implement or single point, with a lot of but not infinite force). Not all that exciting, really.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Other people have mentioned the trampoline model being bad, so I thought I'd dip my best to explain what it really means.</p>
<p>Imagine the trampoline has a grid printed on it.  When you place an object on the trampoline it depresses, creating a cone-like shape.  This, however, isn't really the effect you're looking for.  What the simulation is actually trying to show is the lines of the grid all warping towards the object when viewed from above.  This has a larger effect nearer to the object than father away from it.</p>
<p>A black hole is essentially a really heavy object placed on this trampoline.  The distortion effect near to the object would be massive, and it's effects could be seen really far away.</p>
<p>A common misconception is that, since a black hole is so small, the effect would look like a huge spike.  In reality, the size of an object only effects the gravitational field near the surface of that object in a meaningful way.  The father you get, the less the size of the object matters.  A black hole would create a depression with a very wide visible radius.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
