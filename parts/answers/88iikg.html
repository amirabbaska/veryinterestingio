		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When an atom is nearly halfway across an event horizon of a super massive black hole, such that the nucleus is still just outside the horizon but nearly half of electron cloud is inside, does it temporarily behave as a highly
charged particle? </p>
<p>Does the electrons remain in their original energy states throughout the crossing despite temporarily losing interaction with each other?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The field lines surrounding the particle get stretched and spread out around the whole horizon, <em>before</em> it falls all the way in. As it approaches the horizon, its electric and magnetic fields as seen from far away merge with the fields from the black hole itself. </p>
<p>Strangely enough, an observer falling with the charge wouldn't see any of this. The charge would look and act normal to them even as they cross the horizon, at least until they get far enough into the black hole that tidal forces rip them apart.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
