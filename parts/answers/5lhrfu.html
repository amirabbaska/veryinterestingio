		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The regulations forbid embedding non-edible things inside food. While banning bits of plastic in chocolate bars is a good idea in general, it also catches kinder eggs. The legal versions have a ridge on the plastic capsule which sticks out of the chocolate, like <a href="https://consumermediallc.files.wordpress.com/2013/03/chocolate-egg-with-capsule-and-ridge.png?w=680" target="_blank">this</a>. Legally, it's now two pieces of chocolate on the sides of a piece of plastic, not a piece of plastic embedded in a piece of chocolate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The knockoffs circumvent the rule against a non-food prize entirely enclosed in chocolate. One version featured two chocolate halves surrounding a plastic core. The seam where the halves met was the plastic outer rim of the inner shell.</p>
<p>Just today I saw that Kinder has finally solved the problem--sort of. They're now offering the Kinder &quot;Fun&quot; egg, which is two half-egg plastic pods. One side holds the toy prize, and the other holds Kinder chocolate paste and two crunchy candy balls. There's a small scoop between the halves you can use to eat the chocolate paste. </p>
<p>Edit: seems I remembered the name wrong. Yes, it's &quot;Joy&quot; not &quot;Fun.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The only place I've seen the knockoffs is at mom and pop type marts and privately owned grocery stores. There was no plastic piece separating the chocolate like the picture posted above. It was small plastic toys inside a full chocolate hollowed egg. They were delicious but also probably bought illegally. Now if they realized it was illegal or not I have no idea. I bought the entire pack and my kid loved it! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
