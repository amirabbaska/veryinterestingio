		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A big fraction of the germs that live in our mouths are commensal bacteria, which means we share common interest, we offer them the right temperature, nutriments and convenient humidity to live while they stop any infection from arising by other microorgnisms, this of course, is in case of a healthy body. If the commensal barrier is broken (for a general cause or local such as high and prolonged acidity) then we will see all sorts of chaos in that ecosystem. I guess we are on very fragile terms with the friendly bacteria.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Our bodies and specifically our mouths have a tremendous amount of bacteria. The reason we don’t get infections (as often as we might think) is many fold.</p>
<p>1- our saliva composition has components that actually destroy bacterial cell walls such as lysozymes and other anti microbial properties
2- anywhere in your body you have a lot of foreign microbes and potential for infection your body has set up white blood cells and other protective cells. In fact your guts might as well be the demilitarized zone in Korea.
3- The regenerative ability of your body is incredible and your mouth is incredibly fast at repairing its self with rapid cell division.
4- when you are injured it triggers an inflammatory response (redness, swelling, ect) this is because your body opens up blood vessels in the area to bring in a swat team of white blood cells to clean up
5-finally your body made it sensitive to touch in order to keep you from continuing to injure the area.</p>

One strong example of this is people who are prone to mouth breathing at night have bad breath a lot of the time.

<p>Two reasons: the inside of our mouths have a bunch of friendly germs that help stop some of the nasty mouth germs from hurting us. Also, our mouths are very important to us (we have to eat right?!) because of that, our bodies are very good at healing our mouths if we get hurt. In fact, the only part of our body that heals faster is our eyes - which makes sense because we need those a lot too!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
