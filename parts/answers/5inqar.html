		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What my eye doctors have told me, is that your eye <del>is like a muscle</del> consists of many muscles. You can train your <del>eyesight</del> ciliary muscle (thanks, /u/quartrine), which is responsible for the shape of your lense, by focusing on objects that are at varying distances. </p>
<p>Screens like TVs and PC monitors are usually static, so staring at them for several hours a day will not give your eyes the exercise they need. After a while they will become worse at focusing, leaving you seeing things blurry.</p>
<p>edit for more detail: </p>
<p>If a eye's lense does not correctly project the image <a href="http://www.augentagesklinik.com/sites/default/files/styles/image3/public/bilder/atk_normalsichtigkeit_ferne_0.png?itok=XHwEk9Ik" target="_blank">onto the retina</a>, it will appear blurry. If the focal point is <a href="http://www.augentagesklinik.com/sites/default/files/styles/image3/public/bilder/atk_kurzsichtigkeit_ferne.png?itok=zHJrVuUj" target="_blank">before the retina</a>, it is called shortsighted or nearsighted. If the focal point is <a href="http://www.augentagesklinik.com/sites/default/files/styles/image3/public/bilder/atk_weitsichtigkeit_ferne.png?itok=5IyH0Usv" target="_blank">behind the retina</a>, it is called farsighted.</p>
<p>This is similar to setting up a projector and having to manually twist the lens to get a sharper picture. By doing so, you are trying to move the focal point onto the screen (retina). If the lens is not set correctly, the picture will be blurry.</p>
<p>As the eye and the space between the lens and the retina continues to grow, the focal point will move, so it is not uncommon for shortsighted children to become increasingly shortsighted, until their eye stops growing (usually around ages 18-21). This is why it is not recommended to perform laser-eye surgery on kids or young adults whose eyes are still growing. </p>
<p>Many parents (read: mine) don't know this and blame their childrens' media consumption with their deteriorating eyesight. The last generation was said to watch too much TV, millenials played too much video games and the next generation is spending too much time on their phones. </p>
<p>TLDR: It's not the screen/TV itself, but the fact that you are always focusing your eyes on an object that is the same distance away from your eyes, not giving it the proper amount of exercise. Also kids eyesight will often change as a result of their eyes growing and not have anything to do with their behaviour.</p>
<p>Source: Had -10 / -9 diopters before I was finally old enough to get artifical lenses (IOL) implanted into my eyes. Have had 20/20 eyesight since the surgery.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Majority of the experts agree that watching TV or staring at computer screens for a long time does not damage your eyesight permanently. </p>
<p>But these activities do cause eyestrain which occurs when you focus your eyes on something especially something  that is bright for a long time. Just resting your eyes will prevent eyestrain.</p>
<p>But your question is not actually a myth at on time there was a reason for saying it. Old TV's emitted a lot of X-Rays and overexposure to X-rays can be dangerous. In fact the screens were made of lead glass to   the rays from escaping. TV manufacturers warned children to not sit close to TV's for more than an hour due to the X-rays shooting through the vents on the bottom of the set. </p>
<p>Somebody asked so I had already told this in a comment but thought I would add this too -The Health officials refused to accept that it was any danger and the manufacturers soon rectified the problem but the myth was already spread and parents associated sitting close/for a long time to the TV with bad eyesight</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not a myth, but it is also not a settled question. One thing though is that there is nothing special about TVs or screens here - the key factors under study are looking at things that are <em>close</em> and looking at things that are <em>inside.</em> (Which might nevertheless be on the other side of the room and therefore fairly far). Of course, if you're sitting three feet from a TV, you're both inside and looking at something close.</p>
<p><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1475-1313.2011.00884.x/abstract;jsessionid=6D135C459200B0F2EBF741DEE25BC47A.f04t02?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+unavailable+on+Saturday+17th+December+2016+at+09%3A00+GMT%2F+04%3A00+EST%2F+17%3A00+SGT+for+4hrs+due+to+essential+maintenance.Apologies+for+the+inconvenience" target="_blank">This study</a> summarises what we know: more time spent doing &quot;near work&quot; (looking at things close up) and less time spent outdoors is <em>associated with</em> short-sightedness. That's not the same as these things causing the condition, but it is an indication that they might be.</p>
<p>Hypotheses for a cause include the fact that focusing on nearby objects exercises the muscles controlling the lens in your eye, perhaps adapting it to that kind of focusing. In contrast, looking at things far away involves these muscles relaxing. Another possibility is that outdoor light releases chemicals which prevent the eyeball from getting too long (which would make you short-sighted.)</p>
<p>It's important to note that all of these possible causes have studies which found no link at all. But what is clear is that there is <em>some</em> environmental factor at work, because short-sightedness is a condition which has become far more common in the past century - too common for a genetic change.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Current understanding is, that <strong>one factor</strong> in getting Myopia (short-sightedness) is <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/the-myopia-boom-1.17120" target="_blank"><strong>not being exposed enough to natural outdoor light</strong></a>.</p>
<p>So the <strong>myth around staring at the TV will get you bad eyesight has some basis in the fact</strong>, that at this times you are indoors and exposed to artificial lightening.
More indoor hours watching TV will prevent you from having beneficial effects of being outside in the sun (or natural lightening in general).</p>
<p>EDIT: as u/Badbullet pointed out: I make it clear that lack of exposure to natural light is <strong>one factor</strong> that has been validly identified in semi-experimental settings and therefore shows it is a cause.</p>
<p><strong>Genetic disposition</strong> is still another factor. And others to a minor extent (for example diseases, accidents, diet, etc.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A study of people born in Singapore but raised in either Singapore (urban area, indoor lots of time) or Australia (rural area, outdoors lots of time) showed that eyesight was significantly better for the Aussie cohort.  Participants had similar genetics, culture, food....</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the difference is that exposure to sunlight and actively focusing on both near and distant scenery helps prevent the loss of distance vision that commonly occurs as we mature.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
