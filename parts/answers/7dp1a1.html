		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insects go through stages culminating in the final “imago”, the adult insect that is distinguished by its precursor stages in that only it can reproduce.<br />
So caterpillars can totally live a long, full life of caterpillary wholesomeness, but they can’t have descendants until they transform into a butterfly or moth.  </p>
<p>Realistically speaking, in most species the vast majority of larvae get eaten by something bigger long before they reach adulthood, and those who make it are the rare exception. So in a way, many caterpillars actually do live their whole life in the larva stage, never growing up... but probably not in the way you imagined. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not aware of any caterpillar examples, but there are insects in which the female doesn't really turn into (on the outside) into an adult looking insect, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larviform_female" target="_blank">Larviform</a>.  They'll have reproductive organs and by definition be an adult, but they still look like the larval stages mostly.</p>
<p>There are unnatural ways of keeping them in the larval stage. Manipulating their hormones can cause them to stay in the larval stage longer than normal and get a lot bigger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding on to the other answers, there are <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/lab-rat/arctic-creepy-crawlies-part-ii-woolly-bear-caterpillars/" target="_blank">woolly bear caterpillars</a> that can take up to 14 years to become moths because they only eat around 5% of their lifetime, while most of the time they are in hibernation in freezing or near-freezing conditions, having broken down their mitochondria to synthesize glycerol in order to survive those temperatures.</p>
<p>While there's no hard evidence for the idea, it's speculated that they could last much longer if they were to only able to eat the minimum amount to sustain themselves instead of storing enough to change into a moth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As an add on to the important points made in previous comments, a lot of it boils down to evolutionary pressures - sure, if conditions remain terrible for metamorphosis a caterpillar could stave off its transformation and never reach maturity before death. However, that individual would then never have the opportunity to reproduce and pass on their genes to a new generation. The caterpillars that quickly progress to metamorphosis and successfully reproduce are those that make up the new generation and majority of the population, and so shape the behaviors of future caterpillars. There is a pressure from natural selection for caterpillars to eat as much as they can and quickly get through metamorphosis before they are eaten as vulnerable larvae.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
