		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people here seem to be missing the point and attempting to reconcile your example by pointing out flaws in the exact situation that you've considered.  I imagine that what you're really trying to ask is &quot;How is it that body A can heat body B to a temperature higher than its own temperature?&quot;</p>
<p>The problem is that the Stephen-Boltzman law is not exactly what you believe it to be.  The Stephen Boltzman law states that the energy emitted/absorbed by a body is proportional to its surface area times the <em>difference</em> in temperature to the fourth power.  This means that as the colder body heats up and the warmer body cools down, the temperature term approaches zero.   So, as they reach the same temperature, the energy exchange becomes zero, thus they reach equilibrium at the same temperature and the second law of thermodynamics holds.</p>
<p>EDIT:  I'm getting a lot of responses pointing out that the Stephen-Boltzman law indeed states that the emitted radiation of a body is proportional to its absolute temperature to the fourth power.  This is true, but you must consider that the body is also <em>absorbing</em> energy from its surroundings.  This means that the <em>net</em> energy gain/loss is proportional to the difference of the objects temperature to the fourth power and the surrounding temperature to the fourth power.  In the case that OP describes, the two bodies can be considered to be surrounding each other.  </p>
<p>To be clear:  when I say &quot;difference in temperature to the fourth power&quot; I mean T1^4 - T2^4 , NOT (T1-T2)^4 .  I was unclear in my initial response because the end result is the same: equilibrium when T1 = T2, so it was unimportant to stress the semantics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The sun approximates a constant temperature in the real world, as it loses heat to space.</p>
<p>In your example, you are supposing you can channel all the heat from the sun, to your planet.</p>
<p>Now, the planet will warm up. The sun would also start warming up, since it's radiating a lot of heat, which can only go the planet, then back again, but you've artificially fixed it to have a constant temperature.</p>
<p>Your essentially saying, your sun is producing power ~AT^4, but you've fixed the T, so you've just said your sun produces constant power. Your system consists of only one object which can heat up, the planet. So of course you'll get nonsense, since you've defined a closed system with constant power input, with only one object which can vary in temperature. Whatever magical device is keeping the sun cool, has to dump that heat somewhere, so it's dumped on your planet.</p>
<p>[EDIT] As other people have said, the other problem with your supposition, is that you need to take the Area into account for absorbing the heat, as well as emitting it. The large sun will only have its energy focused down at the other focuii to the same area as the sun, while your planet is much smaller. This means the planet will only receive A2/A1 * the input energy.
Image your idea without the planet, and just a spherical mirror. Now you have a sun outputting P power, but fixed at temperature T. Where does the heat go? Well, it obviously is going to your magical sun-constant-temperature machine...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Parabolae are the wrong shape: there's no way to build a pair of parabolae that will focus <em>all</em> the power from one body onto another without intersecting each other.</p>
<p>What you want is an ellipsoid, with the Sun and Earth at the two foci.  But that won't work either.  Since the Sun is a finite size, not all of its light will be projected to the opposite focus.  Instead, the mirror will form an image of the sun that's <em>about the same size</em> as the Sun.  Since the Earth is smaller, some of the light in that image will miss the Earth, bounce off the mirror again, and (probably) go back to strike the Sun.</p>
<p>There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I made a beautiful <a href="http://imgur.com/a/Z2SkS" target="_blank">diagram with paint</a> with how I understand your question. </p>
<p>While you are correct about the power emitted from each black body, all of the energy from emitted energy from body 1 does not go to body 2. The radiated energy does not radiate normal to the surface, but rather radiates in every direction at the surface.</p>
<p>So every point on the mirror would have to reflect the incoming radiation from multiple directions into one direction which isn't possible.</p>
<p>In a vacuum without the mirror the answer to your question would be view/shape factors. Probably could do some really complicated math in your mirror system to find the view factors remain the same. (this last part is just my assumption based off my knowledge)</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Then, all the power radiated by either body will be focused on the other.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Firstly, how does this follow?  </p>
<p>Secondly, Stefan-Boltzmann's law is a RESULT of Planck's law (i.e. black-body radiation).  So certainly doesn't contradict it.</p>
<p>But thirdly, enough about the lenses.  Just imagine I have two objects, object A and object B encased in a vacuum surrounded by a set of perfect mirrors.  And let's imagine that the fusion of the sun simply stopped, so that there is no more heat energy entering the system.  All you have is two thermal reservoirs exchanging energy/heat through radiative heat flow.  You get a net flow of heat from the hot object to the cold object until they reach thermal equilibrium.  That's pretty much it.  Imagine the case of two parallel planes.  They just swap energy back and forth bringing each other towards equilibrium.  Now imagine one plane was smaller, the colder plane, so there cross-sectional areas are not the same anymore.  So now, in our prison of mirrors, some of the light emitted by the larger object misses the other object and reflect back to it (and is presumably absorbed).  ALL that means is that the heat flow from the hot plane to the cold is SLOWER.  Not that you've beaten the tendency of hot to flow to cold.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Thus it follows that</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can't just set these things to be equal.  Even if lenses were magic, how would that make this equal?  All this tells us is that IF the Earth were the same temperature as the sun  THEN it would radiate its heat away through black-body emission at a slower RATE.  Which tells us nothing about the thermodynamic equilibrium of the Sun-Earth system.</p>
<p>At the end of the day a lens just exposes some solid angle of emission of one object to some solid angle of the other.  This neither tells us anything or changes anything about how the net flow of energy between that connection works to bring them into thermal equilibrium.</p>
<p>Fourthly, what's with all the lens questions in the last few days?  Is it all because someone read What If that was published years ago?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
