		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historically, European commoners didn't have last names.  It wasn't until the the early 1200's, that England and few other European countries forced their populations to adopt last names, for tax and census purposes.  A person's work was commonly used as their last names.  Such as, Blacksmith, Whitesmith(silver and metal shiner), Tanner, Brownsmith(copper makers), Fisher, Taylor, Baker.  And sometimes people will shorten their last names to just Brown,White, Smith,etc.  There were no work associated with Blues, Oranges, etc.  </p>
<p>edit: had to make corrections when I found the updated list of old trades. Got myself confused with the German trade names vs English)</p>
<p>edit2: Regarding green, if the person is Jewish, it's short for Greenberg, or &quot;green mountain&quot;.  If British, then Greensmith, &quot;worker of copper&quot;.</p>
<p>edit3: Regarding John Handcock... you damn kids!  Hand is an old term for sailor(all hands on deck!). Cock means young.  So just &quot;young sailor&quot;.</p>

<p>Trick question: what's the Queen's last name? Answer: <em>she doesn't have one</em>. There's no reason for her to have a last name because &quot;Elizabeth, the Queen&quot; isn't ambiguous &quot;for tax and census purposes.&quot; The royal family uses Windsor, after their residence, to follow convention. It's unnecessary, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a Blue! Despite never knowing another Blue, I still didn't realize it was that uncommon of a name until reading this...</p>
<p>Fun fact: I'm a white female, yet when I searched the last name &quot;Blue&quot; on Casenet to see if I could find my mugshot picture from when I was seventeen, the only results for &quot;Blue&quot; were black men. </p>
<p>Even weirder: According to <a href="https://www.houseofnames.com/blue-family-crest" target="_blank">this</a> website, the surname has a Scottish/French origin. </p>
<p>Ugh, all of this is making me really sad that I don't have an account on Ancestry.org.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
