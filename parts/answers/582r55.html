		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>(I will ignore the difficulty in defining and identifying &quot;play&quot;. I will also ignore the possibility that animals do NOT become less playful over time.)</p>
<p>Most of the answers in this thread offer the conventional explanation that play is about learning. We shouldn't consider this to be a fact, it is a theory that fits into certain expectations of what constitutes a correct answer, especially within evolutionary biology. The answer, we suppose, must offer some fitness benefit across many generations. And, though many possible fitness benefits may be gained from &quot;play&quot; the notion that play is about learning seems to be the most popular one. It is not the only one, though. Maybe play has nothing to do with learning but is entirely about social bonding. Such possible answers require detailed examining of fitness benefits and such evidence is quite difficult to obtain and even more difficult to analyze (eg. we may wonder if play improves hunting ability in cats. We may try to test this by isolate a group of cats from play and allowing another group to play freely and see which group makes more successful hunters. But does such isolation inhibit things other than play? Does it ignore risks associated with play - like injury, or predatation?). In short, the explanation that play is about learning is a feel-good fictional explanation that aligns with our expectations but has very little empirical support.</p>
<p>There is also an obstacle to this answer. If play is an efficient method of learning, then why (as the question suggests) would animals ever stop playing or become less playful? Bodies change, environments change, social  contexts change. Because of this, one should suppose that play (like learning) would be a lifelong process offering substantial fitness rewards throughout an individual's reproductive life. So your question really does offer a challenge that is not answered by the responses given in this thread. </p>
<p>edit: (others have claimed that investment in self improvement is most beneficial early in life. Thereby accounting for why play should be concentrated to childhood. I have no objection to this. In conjunction with some alternative argument for particular fitness advantage of play, such an economizing of energy investments may offer a reasonable explanation for why play takes place early in life. Though, it should be emphasized, that the assumptions on cost (eg. energy)/benefits (eg. better hunting) of such argument of economy are subject to the same difficulties of noted previously - that we generally have scant highly tenuous empirical data to support the general answers that we offer to such questions).</p>
<hr />
<p>I like to think (playfully) that animals, like humans, become wiser over time, less naive, more familiar with pain, difficulty, loss, futility. And that the adult individual is overburdened with awareness of the challenges of simply living that the young have yet to be traumatized by.</p>
<p>edit: (please note, the last paragraph is not intended to be a claim that would supplant the notion that play is for learning. It is a whimsical idea. A whisper on a unicorns eyelash.)</p>
<p>edit 2: my post seems to have gathered much upvoting not from my critique but from the whimsical note thereafter. The intent of the whimsical note was to add the possibility that the diminishment of play in an individual's life may not have an evolved function at all! That this possibility is always something to keep in mind. Natural selection does not need to execute complete control over every single portion of a living thing that we deem to organize into a &quot;trait&quot;. There are possible explanations for play that we do not even consider because our overarching narrative of evolution and fitness shapes the kinds of explanations that tend to emerge from these questions. Of course, we should not take my objections as a warrant to reject evolution, or the work of scientists who examine play, or that play is definitively not about learning.</p>
<p>ELI5 - I am noting a need to be critical of questions that ask &quot;why&quot; something evolved or &quot;how&quot; evolution accounts for some trait. I emphasize a need to recognize multiple possible explanations, the tenuousness of evidence in establishing selection pressures in (especially diverse) evolutionary trajectories, and that there is no promise that a definitive answer to such questions can be found.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the crushing weight of grotesque, pointless, stultifying, responsibilities and life's inevitable and unrelenting onslaught of disappointment, failure, and humiliation slowly erode one's defenseless, vulnerable, ethereal, soul, the urge to engage in play is gradually replaced by ever-intensifying waves of crippling, horrifying, existential nausea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Play is all about exercise and learning. Part of it is simply about increasing strength and coordination. A lot of it is about learning valuable physical skills like stalking, fighting, chasing, catching etc. And a lot of it is about learning non physical skills. For instance a lot of young animals (including humans) can be hugely annoying in their persistence to do mischief because it teaches them about social boundaries.</p>
<p>Young animals go too far in their play because they only learn about social boundaries when an adult puts them in their place. Along the same lines, they learn about appropriate consequences by watching adults mete out discipline and watching adults interact with other adults. Ie. causing mischief is punished by a slap or a scolding but not by a maiming bite. When an adult faces another adult in a territorial dispute it’s preferable to threaten before resorting to violence. </p>
<p>And finally play teaches young animals about their personal limitations. They’ll teach it to climb fearlessly because it knows what it can and can’t do. It’ll know how fast it can run, how far it can jump and so on. It’ll help them learn that their abilities increase as they grow because they run faster and jump farther than they could last week during the same game.</p>
<p>Play tends to be unique to animals whose abilities change and grow with them. You won’t see much play among insects, arachnids and most reptiles for instance. They’re born fully capable (even though practice and learning can improve their capabilities).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans learn everything by trial and error, and they require a lot of lessons in order for a particular learning to take hold. Children need to learn a lot: how to walk, how to walk while holding something, the fact that they can't walk up walls. They need to try try try all this stuff many times and absorb the results. What do you call someone who's relentlessly bouncing up and down trying different things? Playful.</p>
<p>Someone on Reddit once asked the question: &quot;does a tennis player's brain actually solve physics equations in real time in order for them to know where the ball is going to go next?&quot;</p>
<p>The answer was no, they've just played a lot of tennis and they have a model in their brain of &quot;where the ball usually goes in a situation like this.&quot; Observing one bounce doesn't provide enough information. The brain needs more data, more statistics to make educated guesses.</p>
<p>Adults know how to walk across the floor while holding something in each hand, because they've now done it enough times to have a working model of how their legs will interact with the floor, etc. </p>
<p>Kids don't have that model yet, and their brain knows it needs one, so they generate lots and lots of &quot;trials&quot; so they can find the &quot;errors&quot; and learn. This is why kids bounce off the walls.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd argue we don't become less playful per say, it is just that as we and other animals age, we have to support ourselves, whether that is hunting for food (wolves, lions, bears) or paying mortgages (humans). </p>
<p>When it comes right down to it, most animals still enjoy play. As humans age, we still play with friends, take our kids on trips, buy new things we want, experience new locations, travel, hang out, etc. </p>
<p>It isn't so much that we lose our will to play, but that we lose all the spare time we had when we were all 10. At that age, you don't really have any responsibilities. Okay, maybe school and chores, but other than that, you pretty much have all day. Adults work, we come home, we cook, we wash clothes, we feed our kids/pets, we pay bills, we take care of the house, etc. </p>
<p>But, we all still like doing fun things on the weekends. It isn't that we lose our desire to have fun and play per say, but that we tend to have less time to devote to things like having fun and playing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
