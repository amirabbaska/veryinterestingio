		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The females have more to do! They have to make sure they get the best sperm (though there are lots of ways to do this), they have to lay the eggs, and often they have to carry/protect/provide for the young. </p>
<p>This isn’t always the case, though. In American Burying Beetles, the male and the female both care for the young. In many dragonflies and damselflies, the male has to catch and subdue the female. In giant water bugs, the female lays her eggs on the male’s back, and he has to take care of them! </p>
<p>Generally, when you see big females and small males, it’s a sign that the female is the one who needs to do the most work to make sure their offspring have a good chance of becoming adults. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You've already gotten some good answers, but I just want to point out that while sexual dimorphism is the result of various different pressures on males and females, there are few hard and fast rules about which sex will be bigger or smaller or stronger or weaker in a taxonomic group as big as &quot;the insects&quot;.    Even if the females are all in charge of making the eggs and sometimes raising the young, and the males are basically just flying sperm delivery units, the males might wind up being stronger.  For example: </p>
<p>I study honey bee behavior, and in my bees the males are much larger than females, they're much faster fliers, they take more time to develop, they eat more, their eyes are bigger, etc.  They're terrible at doing almost everything.  Their smaller, slower, quicker-to-develop sisters the workers are in charge of doing absolutely everything in the hive.  The males can't even clean themselves.  Why are these big beefy males not using all that strength to work?  Because they've evolved to be amazingly good at spotting flying virgin queen bees with their huge eyes, flying to catch them with their huge flight muscles, and mating with them in mid-air.  Like other male insects that have been discussed in this thread, they've evolved to be little more than sperm delivery mechanisms, but male honey bees are nonetheless the larger of the two sexes of bee even though they do less &quot;work&quot;. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can also be asked: why are male mammals usually larger/stronger? There are exceptions of course, like the Spotted Hyena. I suppose it depends on the environmental pressures that can lead to weak or strong sexual dimorphism. Birds still have strong dimorphism but usually only for courtship, otherwise things are a bit more equal between the sexes (you'll also see many birds that are monogamous, something less common with mammals). </p>
<p>Whereas male birds compete by appearance, song, and other courtship rituals, male mammals seem to generally fight (or avoid fighting by just being the biggest) - this is extremely evident with elephant seal &quot;beach bullies&quot;, where the biggest asshole basically keeps a harem (though it turns out, females are still secretly mating with smaller males - who also won't crush them to death like the beach bully can).  </p>
<p>There are some exceptions with insects too, like certain beetles that have large males (who need to be large to fight other males). The best examples of what you are talking about are seen with eusocial insects like ants, bees, and termites. In those cases, males merely have the responsibility of providing sperm and in most cases, either go off to die after or just hang out and die of age (the queens living much longer), though IIRC termites have a &quot;king&quot; - a male that stays with and continues to mate with the queen. There is one eusocial species of mammals, the naked mole rat, and they are utterly bizarre in so many ways (but like with eusocial insects, the &quot;queen&quot; is larger than the males; there are other females still but only one is dominate at a time, I <em>think</em>... ).</p>
<p>Probably the craziest example of this is with angler fish, which is some serious body horror. The tiny males latch on to a female and become absorbed by her, causing everything to atrophy but the testicles, which the female can now access to reproduce.</p>
<p>With arachnids, its about the survival of females being more important in order to propagate the species. In some cases, the smaller male willingly allows itself to be consumed after mating, the nutrition he provides allowing her a greater chance at laying and protecting her eggs. Its a lot more common with arachnids than mantises. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just insects - among pretty much all animals other than mammals and birds, females are typically larger than males.</p>
<p>Part of this has to do with the amount of energy necessary to develop their reproductive organs.</p>
<p>When there's a big size difference between males and females, one of two things must be happening. Either they mature at the same rate but one grows faster than the other, or they mature at different rates and the small one becomes sexually mature quickly while the other takes longer and gets bigger before they're sexually mature.</p>
<p>When insects mature at the same rate but to different sizes, that means the large one is putting energy towards size, while the other is putting that energy elsewhere.</p>
<p>In insects that mature at the same rate, male insect reproductive organs are much larger and elaborate than those of female insects, and relative to body size are much larger than those of mammals. So while the male is putting lots of energy into growing his fancy genitals, the female has energy to spare and puts it towards getting big.</p>
<p>And there doesn't seem to be as much advantage to getting large for many male insects, as there is for many mammals. Being large means an individual male can more effectively compete for mates. But if this is a hive insect, where breeding males are born into the hive where they will live, reproduce, and die, competition with other males might not really be a factor. And the breeding males aren't the ones fighting - that would be drones. They basically need just enough of a body to keep their gonads alive.</p>
<p>Or if they're solitary insects that very rarely encounter other members of their species, competition among males for breeding might be reduced or nonexistent. Then their biggest hurdle to reproduction is just finding a female. </p>
<p>That's where the &quot;males become tiny but sexually mature very quickly&quot; strategy is effective. They don't need to fight, they just need to start breeding ASAP. The small male develops faster, and then needs less food once it reaches maturity. This can lead to the most extreme sexual dimorphism, with males reduced to tiny dwarfs. In some cases, the tiny males mature so early they convert the yolk from their egg directly into sperm - they never have an adult morphology at all.</p>
<p>And the female also has to have a body capable of accommodating thousands of eggs. The larger she is, the more she can lay.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
