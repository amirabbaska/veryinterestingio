		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short Answer: The Sony Walkman.</p>
<p>Long Answer: The 3.5mm jack was created for use with transistor radios back in the 50s being a smaller version of the 1/4&quot; plug that was common in telephone and audio equipment beforehand due to a simple design and ease of use along with good quality. Sony, in creating the Walkman needed a small, but decent quality jack for their small portable tape player, so they chose the 3.5mm jack. It was somewhat popular already and had already been used in things like their transistor radios so it made sense to use. The walkman of course became incredibly popular to the point a lot of people would just call ANY portable cassette player a Walkman. This led to a ton of clones and headphone manufacturers going out and creating better 3.5mm headphones for use with portable tape players. This continued on with stuff like the discman, MP3 players, home computers etc. Why create a new jack when everybody already had a pair of 3.5mm headphones and it was small enough?  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It was small and cheap. Initially, there were 1/4 inch plugs and jacks for telephone patching and headphones back in the 19th century. The 3.5 mm was a logical adaptation. Initially it was mono only and used on transistor radios. Then a ring was added for stereo, and later another ring for video (camcorders) and microphones (cellphones). There are TRRRS (tip, ring, ring, ring, sleeve) versions now. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's compact, inexpensive, and most importantly, public domain, ie: there's no licensing. There might be a better design for a headphone/microphone connector for a mobile device, but any such connector would be covered by a patent for 20 years after its introduction, so it would need offer a huge improvement in functionality to be widely adopted.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Old guy here.  When pocket size transistor radios came out around 1960's not all mini phone jacks/plugs were interchangeable.  This situation gradually resolved into 3.5 mm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Secondary question, for line-level signals is a 1/4&quot; plug significantly better or is it mostly for the strength and standardization with the higher-power outputs?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
