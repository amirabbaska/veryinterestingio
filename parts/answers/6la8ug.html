<p>What does it mean when we say that the four fundamental forces are &quot;unified&quot; at high energies?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It means that they are all described by a single field theory, in which a certain local symmetry (a gauge symmetry) is restored at a high enough interaction energy.  Above that energy, interactions behave a certain way which respects that symmetry.  Below that energy, the symmetry is spontaneously broken and the interactions now behave differently; they do not respect the (newly-broken) symmetry but may still respect other unbroken symmetries, allowing some aspects of the interaction to be well-described as a different interaction with a different symmetry.  This is the case, for example, in electroweak theory, in which the SU(2) x U(1) symmetry describing an electroweak interaction is spontaneously broken, leaving behind a part of the interaction which still respects a U(1) symmetry (electromagnetism), plus a part of the interaction which doesn't (the weak interaction).</p>
<p>(Edits for correctness.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But how do we know at which energy levels this unification occurs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Experiment is the only way to <em>know</em> for sure.  But there can be strong theoretical hints.  In quantum field theory, interactions are characterized by a coupling constant related to the strength of the interaction.  Though calling it a constant is something of a misnomer, because the coupling constants &quot;run&quot; with the interaction energy level, becoming stronger (or weaker) as the energy increases.  One of the hints pointing at a &quot;grand unified theory&quot; that unifies the strong and electroweak interactions is the observation that under certain assumptions, the coupling constants for each of these separate interactions approaches the same value at a much higher energy level -- the &quot;GUT scale&quot; which is currently way, way beyond scales that we have the capacity to probe via experiment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And if we know this, why do we need different equations to describe the now-disparate forces?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Because the unified symmetry is broken at low energies; it isn't respected anymore so the character of the forces change.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shouldn't they, in principle, be describable by the same theory even at the lower energy levels we find them in today?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>They are describable by the same theory.  The same theory just makes phenomenologically different predictions at lower energy levels when the symmetry is broken than it does at higher energy levels when the symmetry is not broken.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may be useful to describe how electromagnetism and the weak force are unified into the electroweak interaction (Weinberg-Salam theory).</p>
<p>If we had been able to measure all of the particle masses and interactions in our universe before we came up with the theory, we would have measured the following: electric charge, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi%27s_interaction#Fermi_coupling_constant" target="_blank">Fermi's constant</a> (roughly the strength of the weak interaction), the mass of the W bosons, and the mass of the Z boson.</p>
<p>However, the electroweak theory derives these 4 constants from 3 constants. These are: the two electroweak coupling constants and something called the &quot;Higgs expectation value.&quot; The fact that the theory &quot;derives&quot; all four experimentally measured values from three fundamental constants is already telling you that the theory needs to somehow mathematically mix the two previous theories: quantum electrodynamics and Four-fermi/V-A theory.</p>
<p>Also important is the discussion of symmetry, which I think has already been done well by other posters. Crucial in the electroweak unification is a large &quot;hidden&quot; symmetry which is not apparent at low energies, but appears at high energy (called a &quot;spontaneously broken symmetry&quot; or SSB). The classic example of SSB is a magnet: the interactions in the magnet are rotationally invariant, but the magnetic field is choosing some arbitrary direction to point at low temperatures. If you heat the magnet up, the magnetization goes away and the rotational invariance is more obvious. But if you're a little dude living inside a magnet at low enough temperatures, it wouldn't be obvious to you that the laws of physics have rotational symmetry (credit to Sidney Coleman for this explanation).</p>
<p>Then the idea behind unification is that the Standard Model (plus maybe even gravity) fits inside a theory with even more symmetries. But the hard part is finding this theory.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>[Caveat: the analogy I use is meant as an illlustration of the idea of symmetry breaking.]</p>
<p>Imagine you have salt completely dissolved in hot water. Whenever you take a macroscopic sample, you have &quot;homogeneous salt water&quot;, i.e. there is no separate &quot;salt&quot; and &quot;water&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, imagine that you lower the temperature so that much of the salt precipitates (i.e. it is no longer dissolved).  At this point, globally, you no longer have a homogeneous system: you have some (less salted) water, and some pure salt.  What was &quot;unified&quot; before has become two separate entities, each looking very different from the other.</p>
<p>In principle, it might be possible to have homogenous salted water at the lower temperature; however, this is would not be the lowest energy state (which is to have some salt precipitates).  The slightest disturbance would result in the homogeneity being &quot;broken&quot;.</p>
<p>So, in this analogy, we have a symmetry (homogeneity of the solution) which is not a symmetry that is the most likely (ground state) when the temperature is decreased.  However, this symmetry for the system can be restored if we increase the temperature.  (Note that, if you imagine writing down equations for the system, these equations would be such that there would be no preferred point in space: you'd have homogeneity ... it is only the ground state that does not exhibit this homogeneity].</p>
<p>We have one successful theory (the electroweak interaction) which shows a similar pattern.  At high energy, we have 4 <strong>massless</strong> bosons which are the force carriers.  Three of them, that we can call &quot;W&quot; exhibit a perfect symmetry [described by the group SU(2)] and the other, called &quot;B&quot; has another symmetry [described by the group U(1)].  Also present is a scalar field known as the Higgs field. </p>
<p>At lower energy, the ground state of the system is such that the preferred configuration is a mixture of all these fields so that we have 3 <strong>massive</strong> bosons (usually called W+/- and Z), which are a mixture of the original Ws and B, and one massless boson, A (the photon) which is a different mixture.
The massive W/Z acquire their masses through the interaction with the Higgs field whose ground state &quot;breaks&quot; the symmetry at lower energy/temperature.</p>
<p>Due to the success of the electroweak theory and the experimental observation that the strength of the interactions (coupling constant) for the strong and the electroweak force, appear to converge to a common value at high enough energy, it is thought that this may be a sign that they are all different aspect of a single interaction with a higher symmetry than what we observe at low energy.</p>
<p>= = =</p>
<p>Attempting to answer your last question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How does this factor in the search for a quantum gravity theory?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once one gets convinced that &quot;given the evidence, there must be unification of the strong and electroweak forces&quot;, it leads to thinking that &quot;there must be a unification of all the forces including gravity&quot;.  Given that we do not have a satisfying theory of quantum gravity all by itself, instead of trying to &quot;just quantize gravity on its own&quot;, it leads one to seek a larger quantum theory that has enough built-in symmetry so that, its ground state at lower energy, could be seen as having the four separate forces we see.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm no expert in quantum field theory so take all this with a grain of salt, if you want to find this out for yourself you can look up &quot;renormalization&quot; and &quot;renormalization group&quot; on Wikipedia. Renormalization is a process that allows a quantum field theory to be applied at different energy scales (and hence distance scales). There are certain fundamental, dimensionless &quot;coupling constants&quot; such as the fine structure constant that represent the relative strength of a given force. These &quot;run&quot; with the energy level according to the action of the renormalization group. </p>
<p>For example, the fine structure constant has been measured to be approximately 1/137 at lower energies/further distances and increases to ~1/128 at higher energies/closer distances. This is attributed to vacuum polarization and the effect of charge screening by virtual electron/positron pairs. on the other hand the QCD coupling constant tends to decrease as energy levels increase; this is called &quot;asymptotic freedom&quot;. This happens because the color charge isn't screened but &quot;antiscreened&quot; since gluons, unlike photons, are themselves color charge carriers. </p>
<p>The unification of the electromagnetic force and the weak force is relatively well understood via  the &quot;weak mixing angle&quot; as opposed to the unification of the strong force and the combined &quot;electroweak&quot; force. </p>
<p>Quantum field theories are based on the concept of gauge symmetry, which can be thought of as an unphysical symmetry in the equations that define the field theory, which in QFT are called Lagrangians; they are integrals that measure the &quot;action&quot; of a particle moving in free space. The principle of stationary action can be used to derive more direct equations of motion from Lagrangrians or Hamiltonians.</p>
<p>Gauge groups are Lie groups that are used to represent the gauge symmetries. One pretty old idea is that the gauge groups of the strong and electroweak force, which are SU(3) and SU(2) respectively, will unify into a SU(5) gauge group. These are 3x3 and 2x2 complex Lie groups (with zero trace) and so they fit on the diagonal of a 5x5 matrix. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
