<p>When you bend metal it gets hot. The faster you bend it the hotter it gets. When you bend metal at several times the speed of sound it gets so hot so fast that you get little white-hot pieces of metal flying off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a decent amount of misinformation in this thread, so I'll try to correct that as simply as possible. Railguns generally don't work by &quot;Electromagnets in front of the projectile pulling it forwards&quot; as another poster said. A Railgun is made up of two parallel rails, with a conductive projectile placed between them. The Rails are hooked up to an immensely powerful source of electricity which flows along the first rail, across the projectile,onto the second rail and back to the power source, creating a complete circuit. All circuits create electromagnetism relative to the strength of their current. The interplay of an Electric electric charge and a Magnetic field creates something called a Lorentz Force. This is the force that drives our projectile. Lorentz force follows something called the 'Right Hand Rule' which means if you curl your right hand to represent the rotation of the Magnetic Field, the Lorentz Force is exerted in the direction of your thumb, in this case the Lorentz force pushes the connected projectile forward along the rails down the barrel, continuously applied as long as the projectile is connected to the rails, causing the projectile to accelerate quite quickly. However, the Lorentz Force is quite weak, about .2 Micro-Netwons per amp. This means Railguns require a truly prodigious amount of electricity to operate</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A railgun, put very simply, is a pair of metal bars placed parallel to one another and connected by a bunch of capacitors, which store electrical energy in a way where you can dump all of it into the rails very very quickly rather than slowly like a battery does. Your projectile connects the two rails, completing the circuit. When you switch the circuit on, suddenly those capacitors empty all of their stored electrical energy into the rails and cause the projectile to move along them.</p>
<p>This is called the Lorentz Force, and it's the result of an electromagnetic field acting on charged particles (in this case, the ones in the projectile). With a railgun, the enormous amount of energy released into the circuit makes that projectile move <em>extremely</em> fast.</p>
<p>When the projectile exits the barrel, if you look closely you actually will see sparks and flame erupting from the barrel. This is because your projectile is moving so fast that the friction it creates by rubbing against the rails causes the metal to become so hot it melts and flakes off. When the projectile travels through the air, however, it's not touching anything solid that can be chipped off or melted, so there are no flames.</p>
<p>So now we get to when your projectile hits something. Well, heat is just kinetic energy that's not aimed in a single direction. In hot things, the atoms bounce around and knock into one another, and when they vibrate fast enough, they can pull away from nearby atoms. In solids, this results in melting, and in liquids, they vaporise.</p>
<p>Your projectile has a <em>huge</em> amount of kinetic energy in it, which all gets transferred to whatever it hits in a very short period of time. So short, the projectile actually ends up getting <em>very</em> hot as it can't transfer its kinetic energy fast enough, so it violently explodes. Bits of molten metal and whatever it hit go <em>everywhere</em>, appearing as a burst of flame.</p>
<p>EDIT: couple of spelling errors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually no one is mentioning it, but most railguns do launch with a lot of flames.  Even though there is no combustion to launch the projectile, at initial launch the round is traveling fast enough to turn the air around it into superheated plasma.<br />
