		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To tackle this question, let's assume that light isn't the universal speed limit. </p>
<p>(The speed limit being infinite).</p>
<h1>We Know:</h1>
<p>It takes an exponentially increasing amount of energy to accelerate an object of mass x.  </p>
<p>Think of this as a 100m long ramp that grows steeper (as a function of mass) until it's completely vertical.</p>
<p><strong>Ramp of Heavy Mass:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
<p>_/</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ramp of Small Mass:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/</p>
<p>&nbsp;__/</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Ramp of No Mass:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;<strong><strong>__</strong></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h1>We Conclude:</h1>
<ol>
<li>
<p>We can travel fastest on the ramp that is level rather than one that's uphill. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is impossible to travel faster than the level ramp allows as negative mass and thus a negative declination cannot exist.</p>
</li>
<li>Therefore, When we have no mass, we travel the fastest.</li>
</ol>
<h1>Tying It Together</h1>
<p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>  Light has a mass of 0!  Thus using the logic from above, it is the fastest any thing can move on our &quot;ramp.&quot;</p>
<p>Let's scale it down to easier to manage numbers.  The speed of light is 299,792,458 m/s.  Let's Say instead that the speed of light is 100 m/s, traveling the ramp in 1 second.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From my understanding of it, light travels at light speed, the speed traveling through space at which it stops traveling into the future. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Defining The Future:</h3>
<p>In the above scenario, on one end of the ramp I have a flashlight.  You are on the other end.  Light has a mass of 0, and our &quot;speed limit&quot; we defined for that mass is 100 m/s.  When I turn it on, you should see the light 1 second later.  For time t(seconds)  from</p>
<p><strong>My Perspective:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>t(0)</strong> -  Present</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I Turn on the light.  It begins shining towards you, hitting you at: </p>
<p><strong>t(1)</strong> -  Future</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The light hits you 100m away.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Your Perspective</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>t(0)</strong> -  Past</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's dark.  No light.</p>
<p><strong>t(1)</strong> -  Present</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You see my light.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So our &quot;speed limit&quot; (light) caused:</p>
<ol>
<li>T= 0 to be both the Present and Past simultaneously.  </li>
<li>T= 1 to be both the Future and Present simultaneously.  </li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>If light doesn't travel into the future, then wouldn't that mean that it would reach a location at the same time that it started somewhere else? Shouldn't it take 0 time for light to reach a new location, meaning its speed is infinite?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Simple Contradiction Proof:</p>
<p>Assume:  Light has infinite speed causing it to not travel to the future.</p>
<p>That Means:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>t(0) Present: I turn on the light.</p>
</li>
<li>t(0) Present: The light hits you.</li>
</ul>
<p>The fact both of our times are t = 0 contradicts the <strong>law</strong> we defined above saying the fastest light moves is 100 m/s.  So we need another time reference point 1 second later at t = 1. That would mean we have a &quot;future&quot;.</p>
<p>TL-DR; I took a ton of adderall to study for a test and did this instead.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>By Metaphor:</p>
<p>If I freeze you, you <em>experience</em> no time.</p>
<p>When I ship your frozen body cross-country, the fact that <em>you</em> experience no time doesn't mean that the truck you are in doesn't take time to get there nor does it prevent me from drawing crude sentiments on your frozen face.</p>
<p>So the packets of light which we most simply call photons, do not <em>experience</em> time. That is if they had little minds those minds would not have any experience of existing. But the packet itself, with its wavy-ness and its particle-ness is moving and moving happens over time.</p>
<p>If a person were in a ship and they passed through the entire universe at the speed of light. The whole universe would come and go unnoticed because their sense of our time would be zero. They would be the ultimate frozen corpse, utterly untouchable by us. But if we had sensitive enough instruments we could note their passing as disruptions of gravity or whatever, and that disruption would go past us at the speed of light, so we'd know they'd passed, but we could never know they they were about to arrive because their passage and the signal of their passage are going the same speed.</p>
<p>So the old question: what happens if I'm driving a car at the speed of light and I turn on the headlights?</p>
<p>If you are going <em>almost</em> the speed of light then everything looks normal about you and the car, but the universe looks like a tiny speck right in front of you.</p>
<p>If you are going the actual speed of light you never turn on the lights because you have slowed infinitely. You don't even know you've frozen. If you ever slow down somehow you'd never know that you touched &quot;light speed&quot;... except for the fact that the universe is now gone from around you.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is part of how time is experienced differently by different observers. If you accelerate close to the speed of light, you experience less time than an observer in your original reference frame. Light itself experiences no time. (Because of Lorentz contraction, the universe appears to have been flattened to a pancake. Anything it's going to hit is right in front of it.) To outside observers light is traveling, well, at the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The frame of reference for a photon or other object traveling at the speed of light is <em>undefined.</em> </p>
<p>We cannot talk about the experiences of a photon or other such object because that frame of reference simply does not exist, it would violate a fairly central tenet of relativity. If there exists a rest frame at c, then there exists a rest frame in which objects <em>which move at c in every rest frame</em> are stationary, which is contradictory. </p>
<p>Saying photons 'do not experience time' is actually going too far. Photons <em>have no perspective</em> from which we could even make that claim, or its opposite.</p>
<p>None of this, however, means that an external observer cannot observe a photon pass through a finite amount of space <em>in the external observer's frame of reference</em> during a finite amount of the <em>observer's</em> time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know there are already a lot of answers here, but I'll try to contribute by explaining time dilation without using too much math. I'll probably need to sacrifice accuracy for simplicity. </p>
<p>To understand the answer to this, you'll need to know and accept a few basic things. </p>
<ul>
<li>The universe has no preferred frame of reference. </li>
<li>velocity = distance/time</li>
<li>The speed of light is always the same from every frame of reference. </li>
</ul>
<p>The speed of light is about 3.00 x 10^8 m/s. To make it simple, let's call the speed of light <em>c</em>. Let's say you're a stationary observer standing on something in space, and you see a spaceship travelling at a constant speed of 0.5c relative to you.</p>
<p>Let's say someone stands at the front of the spaceship and throws a baseball at a speed of 10 m/s measured from his frame of reference. You will measure the baseball's speed as 0.5c + 10 m/s. The speed of the spaceship relative to the observer and the speed of the baseball relative to the spaceship are added together to find the speed of the ball relative to the observer. </p>
<p>This isn't the case with light. If the person at the front of the spaceship turns on a flashlight, you will measure the speed of the photons as c, but the person on the spaceship will not measure it as c - 0.5c (half the speed of light). The photons will go just as fast relative to him, at exactly c. </p>
<p>Since speed = distance/time, the only way for the speed of light to travel at c for the observer on the spaceship is if the light takes less time to travel the same distance from his frame of reference, making the time term in the equation smaller. The distance term changes too, through length contraction, but let's focus on time. </p>
<p>So from the observer's perspective, time is slower, and less time passes per measurement interval. This makes the time term small enough for the speed of light to be c for the spaceship instead of the expected 0.5c. This means that for every tick of your clock, &lt;1 tick has passed on the observer's clock. So even though time is moving more slowly for the observer on the spaceship, he is still travelling at the same speed relative to you. </p>
<p>As the spaceship increases its speed and gets closer to the speed of light, the clock ticks on the spaceship get slower and slower (0.1 clock ticks/1 of your ticks, 0.01 ticks/1 of your ticks), until it doesn't tick at all. If the spaceship could somehow reach the speed of light, no time would pass from <strong>its</strong> frame of reference. But from your frame of reference, time does pass, and the ship itself gets older, even though the person inside does not. So from a photon's perspective, it essentially travels infinite distance in 0 time, even though it does not from your frame of reference. </p>
<p>Hope this helped! </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
