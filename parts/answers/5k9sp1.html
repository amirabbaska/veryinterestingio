		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Heated objects produce light.</p>
<p>Even room-temperature objects are emitting light. It just isn't <em>much</em> light and the wavelength is way too long to see (it is low-energy).</p>
<p>The more an object heats up, then more energy it emits. It also starts to emit more energy of higher frequencies (higher energy levels). So if it gets hot enough, some of that light is now going to be in the visible spectrum, since it will be energetic enough to produce red light (but not much of a higher wavelength like green or blue light).</p>
<p>If you keep heating it, it will get yellower and yellower as more yellow light gets emitted (relative to the other energy it is emitting).</p>
<p>Eventually it does reach a point where it emitting enough higher energy light that it has a considerable amount of green or blue light being emitted. However, at this point, so much light is being emitted (and a lot of it is still red light) that the object will just appear white to us.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is called black body radiation. Objects that aren't at absolute zero have thermal energy. The electrons present are constantly gaining and losing energy - which is emitted as light, one photon at a time. The color/wavelength of a photon is determined by how much energy it has. An electron will emit basically any energy it gets, almost immediately. At higher temperatures, more of the electrons can occasionally attain higher levels of energy and therefore emit &quot;hotter&quot; colors, but more electrons are gaining and losing the lesser quanta also.</p>
<p>We can only see a tiny range of light energy - from red (lower energy) to blue and violet (higher energy). Infrared, microwaves, and radio are examples of low energy light, below our threshold, while ultraviolet and x-rays are &quot;high energy&quot; colors of light. Anyways, even cold objects emit this thermal radiation, and continue to emit it in addition to that red glow. When you see red-hot metal, it's infringing into the visible spectrum, but there's far more light being emitted that we can't see - red is just the edge of the spectrum of light being produced by that hot knife. As it becomes even hotter, the spectrum shifts, we see even more red light in addition to the higher energy colors.</p>
<p>Because of the way human vision works, we don't see these colors separately. Instead, colors add up to appear more white. Ever see an RGB projector?</p>
<p>On a side note, that blue sky you see is actually mostly violet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This <a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/blackbody-spectrum/blackbody-spectrum_en.html" target="_blank">interactive tool</a> illustrates it pretty well. Every object in a room emits light at not just one wavelength, but across a wide spectrum of wavelengths. Changing the object's temperature will shift the <em>predominant</em> wavelength being emitted, but the other wavelengths continue to be emitted as well. That's why you get a transition from red to orange to white to blue, rather than a full cycle through the rainbow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When something is heated the atoms or molecules respond by moving more and in different ways. Air doesn't glow a color until it gets really really hot because it can move in 3d space, vibrate, bend (such as in water vapor), or rotate (but not about an axis of symmetry such as along the bonds between oxygen or nitrogen in the diatomic molecules of oxygen or nitrogen).</p>
<p>But metals (such as steel in a knife) are bound together in a lattice, they cannot move the way air can, so most of that heat energy goes to exciting electrons or vibration. Every atom or molecule has different energy states that electrons can occupy. When the energetic electrons go back to their less energetic ground state they release the energy as a photon that often is in the red spectrum. </p>
<p>However some metals can produce other colors and any impurities would cause different colors as well. Because each of these elements or atoms can have  different energy levels available to their electrons that may or may not be available to those in iron or carbon. And a lot of energy can cause a lot of different energy levels being accessible causing a white light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
