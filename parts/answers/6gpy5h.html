With training any person would be able to replicate smells inside their heads as well as any visual or auditory input. The main problem is cultural. Our western society does not value the sense of smell as highly as other senses: children are not taught to notice odors, our olfactory &quot;vocabulary&quot; is really limited, we are not used to rely on our sense of smell on a day-to-day basis etc.
The Jahai people in the Malayan peninsula is the best example I can remember of a culture that highly praises the sense of smell, having even specific vocabulary to describe odors: <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002771300214X" target="_blank">an article on Cognitive magazine about that</a>
edit: formatting.
edit 2: removing link to non-scientific article.
edit 3: changed &quot;remembering&quot; to &quot;replicating inside the head&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I can remember smells almost perfectly, especially distinct smells like citrus, lavender, rosemary, etc. Is everyone saying they can't recall what those smell like unless they smell it again?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cognitive scientist here. Keep in mind that the pathways involved in memory recall are very different depending on the type of information intended. Visual information is easily recalled and recognized due to it being objectively useful to remember (navigation, object recognition, food seeking, mating, etc), however certain sensory information is rarely required to be recalled in such a way so the pathways are much weaker/nonexistent. You are able to recognize a smell very easily, especially with other cues (if you smell something and see the name, you will easily state that the name is correct or not). Likewise, you can detect if that smell is beneficial or harmful very easily. However there is not much use in, and thus you don't get a lot of practice in, remembering the smell or taste itself. Humans do not use smell for object recognition (we prefer to rely on vision information for this, unlike other animals such as dogs) nor for communication (we rely on audiovisual information, unlike ants) and so these pathways, while able to exist (see blind case studies) do not get as much use and so recalling a smell or taste can be very difficult for us (without practice).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, thanks for all the replies! Secondly, I think, due to the poor phrasing of my question, that not everyone in this thread is talking about the same thing. What I meant to ask is why, and, as people have pointed out, I understand that this is a very subjective topic, I cannot recreate a scent or taste in my mind.  I can recognize the scent of a hotdog when I smell it, but when I'm hungry and sitting down in my bed, I can't just &quot;smell&quot; it like I can picture the shape and color of the hotdog. </p>
<p>People have attributed this to differences in culture and our dependence on hearing and sight for survival. I have also heard that the way we use a sensory system shapes the system itself. So, in theory, if I trained my scent or taste at a relatively young age such that I hadn't already developed a rich system, I would be able to recreate scents or tastes within my mind. </p>
<p>I find this all very interesting, so once again, thanks for all the amazing responses! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Psychology undergrad here: The big problem with your chemical senses (especially with smell) is that you can't properly assign a specific perception of an aroma to a certain stimulus. You know very well which porperties a stimulus for your eyes must have for you to perceive it as &quot;blue&quot; or &quot;red&quot;, but what properties does a molecule have to have for you to perceive it as &quot;cherry&quot; or even more difficult, which specific molecules do produce the aroma of &quot;coffee&quot;? Turns out that this is a very complex question, as many chemically very similar molecules are perceived as drastically different smells or vice versa. Taking this difficulty into account, a complex cognitive representation of the aroma stimulus in your memory seems very challenging. However, your smell is the only sense that doesn't connect with the Thalamus before reaching its corresponding cortex area and limbic structures like the Amygdala or the Hippocampus, therefore the emotional memory of an aroma is much more directly accessible, thus more intensive, and in some way that's compensating for a complex cognitive representation as your sight or hearing can offer. </p>
<p>Edit: Linda Buck and Richard Axel won the 2004 Nobelprize in Physiology or Medicine for their pioneering research on olfaction, you might want to take a look into this, as it uncovers the complexity of olfactory encoding:

<p>The idea of a certain cell assembly representing an aroma, thus creating an &quot;olfactory map&quot;, is further explored in this article:
<a href="http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)00021-0?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867400000210%3Fshowall%3Dtrue" target="_blank">http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(00)00021-0?_returnURL=http%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867400000210%3Fshowall%3Dtrue</a></p>
<p>All of this shows that neuronal representation of aromas is very complex and enigmatic, much more so than stimulus representation in the visual or auditory system.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
