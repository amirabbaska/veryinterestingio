		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Former pastry chef here. As some other users have pointed out, apple has a mild flavor profile. Why is that, though? One of the reasons is that apples are a pretty watery fruit, so it's less concentrated in flavor compared to fruits like strawberries or cherries. B-but wait, what about pineapples or watermelon? Those are watery and you see those in ice cream!</p>
<p>Flavor is directly affected by the sugar content of the fruit. Apples don't taste as sweet as other fruits commonly seen in ice cream and they happen to be on the tart side (tartness hinders the way we taste sweetness). The natural sweetness of a fruit is really important for seasoning products. If you make banana bread with bright yellow firm bananas, then the banana bread will be bland because of the lack of sugar development. You'll just end up with a sugar loaf with banana in it. Concentrate the apple flavor by means of reduction, add it to a base and you've got yourself some delicious apple ice cream. However, extra steps in preparation = extra labor costs.  </p>
<p>It really isn't about texture because people tend to be adventurous with fruit flavors. You can make almost any fruit agreeable in texture. I hope I could offer some insight on this. </p>
<p>Edit: Changed sentence wording and added a bit about tartness because I forgot.<br />
Edit 2: Edited banana bread sentence to be less confusing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>On a similar note, why does it seem like the only ice cream that is common which contains bits of actual fruit is strawberry or in rare instances, cherry? There's never bits of raspberry, blackberry, blueberry, mango, etc. In fact, aside from sorbet and popsicles, I don't often even see those flavors of ice cream in stores. It's just chocolate this, vanilla that, mixed with chocolate, fudge, marshmallow, or nuts.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know in the USA, but it's perfectly possible to find apple ice cream in Argentina (and I happen to be one of the few people who like it), but it's not a &quot;creamy&quot; ice cream but it rather has a harder, watered texture, likely pineapple ice &quot;cream&quot; has here. I've never been to the USA so I don't know if you have &quot;creamy&quot; and &quot;non creamy&quot; ice creams there.</p>
<p>Also, I don't know if it's made with actual apples or with artificial flavors. But it's still tasty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Apple has a very mild flavor. If you mix apple juice with ice cream base (milk, cream, vanilla, and sugar), and then freeze it (which further suppresses flavors), you will hardly taste the apple.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many of the fibrous fruits (apples, pears) don't blend well into a smooth product. You almost always end up with chunky or grainy ice cream.</p>
<p>Which means if you want those flavors, while still keeping ice cream ice cream - you need to use artificial flavors. And with so many other natural flavorings available it's not worth it to go artificial on those two. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
