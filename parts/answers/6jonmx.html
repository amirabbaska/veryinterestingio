		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fermentation with natural bacteria is the traditional method of pickling. The bacteria are anaerobic, so the do not use oxygen. The veg to be pickled is submerged in salt water to keep out oxygen and inhibit growth of dangerous bacteria.</p>
<p>Lactobacillus is the main bacteria that ferment pickled veg. These guys are everywhere all the time. They are rod shaped and use the lactic acid fermentation pathway. This makes an acidic solution that gives the characteristic sour taste to the salt brine. </p>
<p>Incidentally, garlic cloves turn blue during pickling. This was alarming the first time, but Google assured me it was normal and safe, and the garlic was delicious! For your first go, use 2-5% salt solutions  (20-50 g salt per liter water), sprigs of fresh dill, whole garlic cloves (peeled), and cucumber spears. Alum supposedly keeps the pickles crisp; that's my next project as my last pickles were slimy and inedible. I also recommend something like [this] (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017GFUDWQ?psc=1" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B017GFUDWQ?psc=1</a>) to vent the carbon dioxide has without letting oxygen into your pickles. Oxygen would allow dangerous bacteria to grow. </p>
<p>Good luck!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>PicklingÂ is a fermentation process involving lactobacillus bacteria that can tolerate a high salinity environment which kills almost all other micro-organisms. The lactobacilli break down the structure of the cucumber changing its structure and also produce different compounds which change the flavor and increase the acidity of the cucumbers. Additionally, osmosis infuses the pickle with flavors from spices added to the pickling liquid. You end up with a salty, acidic, spice infused pickle that is not only preserved against rot from the action of other micro-organisms but a much different flavor</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
