		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;atoms are 99% empty space&quot; thing is a big misconception. Particles do not have &quot;size&quot; as we typically think of it. An electron in an atom is a &quot;wave of probability&quot; and does not have a specific &quot;size&quot; or &quot;location&quot;, these properties don't make much sense quantum mechanically. In fact <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e7/Hydrogen_Density_Plots.png" target="_blank">these heat maps</a> are what the electrons look like in the atom. Most of that space is not empty. Each of those is a different &quot;orbital&quot;, the energy and angular momentum of an electron determines the shape of the electron and that's what we refer to as &quot;orbits&quot;. It's not that electrons are whirring around at different speeds, they just have different shapes around the nucleus.</p>
<p>What we can do is take electrons, shoot things at them and look at the scatter pattern. The things we shoot are also wave of probability, but based on the scatter pattern we can get a good idea of the sphere of influence of the electron. This gives us a notion of the &quot;size&quot; of the electron, though it's not good to think of electrons as hard  spheres of stuff floating around since they're waves of probability in different configurations. </p>
<p>If you want to compress things, though, you can look at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star" target="_blank">Neutron Stars</a> this is a star that is so dense that atoms cannot exist. They're like a dense plasma of nucleons held together by gravity. This is similar to what happened near the beginning of the big bang, the particles were too energetic and compressed to form atoms. In fact is was too energetic for even protons and neutrons to form, and was basically a plasma of quarks and gluons. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang#Timeline" target="_blank">wikipedia article has a good timeline</a>. Like Neutron Stars, a kind of star that is like this has been conjectured called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_star" target="_blank">Quark Star</a> that is supposed to look like the very beginning of the universe in it's core.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/functor has explained (very well) why the atoms are not empty. But we can nevertheless consider what would happen if you turned the whole universe into a giant nucleus. The nuclear density is around 10^(17) kg/m^(3), while that of the matter in the universe is around 10^(-27) kg/m^(3). Since the radius of the observable universe is currently 100 billion light years, the resulting radius would be (10^(11) ly)(10^(17)/10^(-27))^(1/3)=0.0001 ly=10^(9) km. This is around the radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun.</p>
<p>The thing is that once you go above a few solar masses, the density of a neutron star is so great that its radius is smaller than that of the event horizon from the same mass, because the density of black holes decreases with the square of the mass.  So the neutron star is really a black hole!</p>
<p>The ordinary mass of the observable universe is around 10^(53) kg or 10^(23) solar masses. The Schwartzchild radius of that black hole would therefore be around 10^(23) km, or 10 billion light years. So the universe is not so much bigger than it would be if it were a black hole (if the universe was made of matter and its density were at the critical density, the two would be nearly equal). That doesn't mean that the universe is a black hole, because the structure of spacetime is very different (dynamic and expanding) and dark energy exists, but it's very interesting, isn't it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Of course, the ball would not be stable, but immediately collapse into a giant black hole.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually, the universe compressed to the size of neutron star would not be stable, it would collapse onto itself and form a singularity (a black hole).
