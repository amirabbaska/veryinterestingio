		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That's an interesting question and the answer is a partial yes. The reason for vagueness is that when it comes to freezing there are two temperatures we can care about:</p>
<ol>
<li>the equilibrium freezing point</li>
<li>the temperature at which a liquid actually freezes</li>
</ol>
<p>The first quantity is what we usually think of as the freezing point, e.g. 0^(o)C for water at standard conditions. This is the point below which it is thermodynamically favorable for water to be in the solid state. It is very hard to change this point using electricity. It would take a huge voltage to noticeable change this point and as far as I'm aware this hasn't been shown experimentally.^1</p>
<p>However the second point is more relevant here. It turns out that with pure water it actually won't freeze as the temperature reaches 0^(o)C. The reason for that is that freezing has to first nucleate by forming a baby crystal. This process takes energy (an activation energy), which can make this process extremely slow. As a result the water becomes colder than its nominal freezing point, a process called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercooling" target="_blank">supercooling</a>. However if you take supercooled water and you disturb it, e.g. by adding an impurity or even putting it on another surface, it can freeze immediately <a href="https://i.imgur.com/g8klA3V.gifv" target="_blank">as shown in this neat example.</a></p>
<p>So that brings us to your question, it turns out that electricity can have an effect on where supercooled water can freeze. <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/327/5966/672" target="_blank">There was a nice paper in the journal Science</a> about this effect. For example, they put supercooled water on surfaces of LiTaO3. At -11^(o)C when the surface is negatively charged the water stays liquid. But oddly when they warm up the crystal to -8^(o)C and the surface becomes positively charged^2, the water freezes immediately! As a result you have an odd situation where heating up the container actually causes water to freeze. </p>
<ol>
<li>Actually I did come across one study just now where researchers were able to freeze a nanometer thin layer of ice at an electric field of &quot;only&quot; 10^(6)V/m. But the situation here quite a bit different from bulk water as the mechanism relies on interfacial effects in this confined geometry. </li>
<li>This change in surface charge is due to the fact that LiTaO3 is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyroelectricity" target="_blank">pyroelectric material</a>. That means that it can develop a voltage when they are heated or cooled. </li>
</ol>
<p>edit: added one more study</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This might not be the answer you’re looking for, but interesting nonetheless. I lived in a Rocky Mountain ski town at 8600ft as a maintenance tech. The temp would get into the negatives causing water main pipes to freeze under ground. The only way to thaw them was to hook up a giant welder and shock the copper pipe with big jumper cables. We would hook one cable at the curb stop outside and the other end of the cable to the main inside the house. The electric current would heat up that section of pipe and melt the ice inside. I assume the water melted because of the metal involved, not because of the electric current traveling through the frozen water. </p>
<p>Edit: welder not generator </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding solutes to water typically stabilizes the liquid phase. You can Google “Colligative properties of solutions” to learn more about that. Highly charged ions can alter the freezing point depression or boiling point elevation. So running a current through the liquid can definitely affect the freezing point.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes without question You can heat water by putting electrical current through it. In fact you can <a href="https://youtu.be/g8-0LijAKGU" target="_blank">Boil Water with Raw Electricity</a>.  You need high voltages to do it so trying it at home is dangerous. In the video salt is used to lower the resistance of the water so the water will boil with 120v but the salt would not be necessary if he had higher voltages avalebel. Alternatively it might work without salt if he moved the electrodes closer to each other.  Any material that has resistance (all materials) will heat to some degree when electricity is passed through it.     </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just a brief thing, but pure water doesn't actually conduct electricity as it is well known to do, it is impurities within water that actually conducts. This is because water has no free ions that can carry charge, and no delocalised electrons either, as they stay within each molecule and cannot move between.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
