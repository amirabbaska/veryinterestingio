		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are buried below the frost line which is a depth where the temperature of the earth doesn't go below freezing. Here in Chicago it's about 48&quot;, so.ewhere like Minnesota is more like 55&quot; so it varies by climate. Occasionally in really bad will they will get below freezing but it's really hard to freeze moving water so you're still ok. </p>
<p>Tldr: bury then where the ground stays warm. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Underground areas (holes, caves, buried pipes) stay much the same temperature year round.  This is also the reason why root cellars work - things stay cooler than the above ground air in the summer and warmer (above freezing) in the winter.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They often do. I recently measured the temperature 2' below ground (via a well vent pipe) at a constant 3 deg. C, in spite of the outside temperature being -30C. In Manitoba, our city water line to the house froze once (-35C or so), and it was thawed by running hundreds of amps through the water line to the street shutoff. They used an arc welder to generate the current.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Winnipeger here, when the frost starts to really get deep due to a long cold snap there are things you can do to lower the chances of your pipes freezing.
One of them is to leave snow uncleared over the area over the spot your water line comes from the street to the house,(like if the water line is inline with your side walk then leave the side walk covered and clear a different path to the street). You can also leave the water running on one of the taps in the house cause the water flow will keep the line from freezing up. Bails of hay and piles of insulating snow will work for septic fields sometimes as well. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A: Water mains and lines are generally buried lower than the average frost line.  We use 4-5 ft as the standard here in northern Indiana.</p>
<p>B: It's much harder to freeze moving water under pressure than it is to freeze standing water.</p>
<p>C: They do sometimes freeze.  Water mains get cold and break, customer lines freeze and bust, hydrants freeze.  Water utility workers have to do maintenance all year round.  Especially as infrastructure gets older.</p>

<p>If you have City water, chances are there's a crew of people that have been soaked and frozen to keep your water flowing and safe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
