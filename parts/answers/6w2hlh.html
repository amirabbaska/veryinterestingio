		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a recent post on here talking about kids and films/TV, the top answer mentioned that one thing that makes kids so prone to certain kinds of movies (and to watching them over and over again) is that the Toddler brain thrives on predictability.  </p>
<p>Facing a world that can be scary and unpredictable (and having a sort of inborn biological drive to learn about the world through positive and negative feedback) the toddler quickly fixes on anything that has a predictable positive result.  This is especially true -- cribbing from that answer -- when the toddler has the power to do something they already understand (like get a toy) and still get the same result (positive interaction with you.) </p>
<p>Eventually they'll tire of it or get distracted, but to them that kind of predictability and control is as valuable as hitting GM in overwatch or watching whatever the last episode was of GoT that you thought was good. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Haven't managed to read all the comments so forgive any repetition.</p>
<p>There are developmental &quot;stages&quot; (known as schemas) which children go through that teach them about the world around them. This particular phase falls under the &quot;Transportation&quot; schema.</p>
<p>These schemes are: </p>
<p>-Trajectory - creating lines in space by climbing up and jumping down. Dropping items from up high. (Throwing food from high chair)
-Positioning - lining items up and putting them in groups. (Cars/Trucks etc)
-Enveloping - covering themselves or objects completely. Wrapping items up or placing them in containers. (Hiding in boxes)
-Rotating - enjoys spinning items round and round. Likes to run around in circles or being swung round. (Pretty self explanatory)
-Enclosing - adding boundaries to play areas e.g. fences around animals. Adding borders to pictures.
-Transporting - carrying or moving items from one place to another; (carrying items in containers or bags.)
-Connecting - setting out and dismantling tracks, constructing, joining items together with tape or glue.
-Transforming - exploring the changing states of materials, transforming them from a solid to liquid state and back again.
Orienteering â€“ an interest in positioning themselves or objects in different places or positions e.g upside down or on their side.</p>

<p>Edit to add: Managed to read a few comments now. And yes, cause and effect, social interaction and object permanence are also being explored through this.
Children's brains are going a million miles a minute at this age. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As human beings, we are hard-wired to interact with other people from an extremely young age. Even babies will attempt to make eye contact with you. We are highly social animals. So, that simple act of interaction between you and the toddler is teaching her how to interact with another person she isn't normally around. </p>
<p>Now, from a cognitive perspective, a toddler is learning quickly that s/he can significantly manipulate their environment. One aspect of this is [object permanence] (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_permanence</a>), which is the mind-blowing concept (to a baby) that just because something can't be seen anymore, doesn't mean it ceases to exist.  Monkeys, apes, some birds, dogs, and cats may have this ability to a degree.  When the child hands you a toy, she is at the point where she knows that that toy isn't going anywhere. It's not going to disappear, she can get it back. It's part of the development of meta cognition. </p>
<p>As others have said, there is a psychological aspect too, one of control, but also one of love.  Handing you objects is how a toddler builds affection and trust with her caregivers. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two reasons.</p>
<p>1) Very young children do not understand how to control their hands and use them to move objects. They learn this throughout early childhood and are still learning it into toddlerhood. Picking up objects and throwing them or carrying them around is an expression of this new skill and is fun and interesting to the toddler.</p>
<p>2) When the toddler brings you a toy, you react. Young children <em>love</em> getting reactions from adults. Smile at a baby, and the baby will almost definitely smile back. This is why the toddler hands you the toy. You probably smile at them or talk to them when they do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've worked with children for years and I can PROMISE you it's because they want you to notice what they notice. </p>
<p>For example: a child walks to me and hands me a 'pete the cat' stuffed animals. I have two choices: </p>
<p>1) ignore it and the child, or take it for a second and hand it back (&quot;oh wow it's pete&quot;)</p>
<p>2) take what the child has given me and be in awe as they are! They have chosen to hand me something they believe is worthy of a notice - and notice I will. &quot;Wow - is this pete the cat? Don't you love pete the cat? I bet he loves you too!&quot; And engage. </p>
<p>Kids hand you shit so you talk to them about shit. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
