		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is really a combination of many factors, but I will try to break it down a bit.</p>
<p>*Prior to WW2, most families could not get by on one income.  Dad worked, mom worked around the house and sometimes in a factory or other capacity.  Many kids also worked on the farm or in the plant.  Labor was cheap because supply was high and life was expendable.  People barely got by.  Just before WW2 (1938), child labor was made illegal.  After WW2, most industrialized nations had their infrastructure destroyed, except for the US.  This meant we had this amazing infrastructure we built during the war and a ready labor force.  Global demand for the goods we made such as cars outpaced labor supply and unions formed and used this labor demand as leverage to demand higher wages and safer working conditions.  Now with higher wages, families could thrive on a single income.  Companies paid record high taxes (as high as 91%) on profits and so did the very wealthy and we had a thriving middle class.</p>
<p>*Then things began to swing too far the other direction.  Labor unions began becoming corrupt, would demand more for the workers even at the detriment of company competitiveness.  Europe and Asia began retooling and rebuilding their infrastructure and economies and started to once again compete globally.  Trade was normalized with China.  Companies began to ship factories and jobs overseas free from the pressure of unions.  New found profits were used to lobby lawmakers and the global competition gave companies a great argument that high taxation on the wealthy and high minimum wages would just force them to ship jobs overseas in order to stay competitive.  Therefore, unions lost their teeth for the most part and so did the ability to argue for a higher minimum wage.  Taxes on the rich were beginning to go down.</p>
<p>*To help support the family as wages' buying power decreased, women enter the work force in the 1960s.    The adds more supply for labor with an already decreasing demand.  But together it is enough to support a family as the net decrease it causes in wages is less than the combined wages.</p>
<p>*To differentiate themselves from the low-cost developing world labor pool, American start heading to college in droves in hopes of a higher income for skilled work.  For many this works and helps them remain competitive.  The internet opens up a global knowledge and skill marketplace and people in the developing world also go to college in droves to enter the skilled labor market.  Once again creating a global supply of skilled labor, thus bringing down the benefit of a college education.  Regardless, more and more Americans head off to college as their only means of competing for a decent wage, which increases demand for college, incentives private colleges and increases tuition costs.</p>
<p>What we had after WW2 was really a temporary environment created by a combination of a decimated global marketplace in need  of the resource to rebuild and no local infrastructure to support it where one person could make a high wage due to labor shortage and product demand.  Now that America is back as another (albeit still very powerful) global competitor with access to a global labor pool and in competition with companies with global labor pools, it is natural that we &quot;correct&quot; in the direction of the global standard of living, which, outside of first world developed countries, is much lower than our own. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Somewhat old person by reddit standard checking in. The scale of things has changed:
1-Houses are much bigger, with bigger windows, more bathrooms, better finishings.  Marble counter-tops would be found in a bakery, stainless steel appliances in a commercial kitchen.  Let's not even get into an island in your kitchen.  Ceramic tile?  Try linoleum for most floors.  </p>
<p>2- Cars are a different animal versus the 50/60/70's.  Five years w/o it falling apart (rust or poor mechanics) would be a miracle.  No leather seating surfaces, metal dashboard, no electronics, no power anything (steering might be powered).  Add in safety equipment (air bags, laminated glass, crumple zones, headrests) and it's amazing how cheap cars today are looking at what you get.</p>
<p>3- Electronics.  No microwave.  One TV.  TV was expensive, but had no recurring costs.</p>
<p>4- Taxes: Social security, IIRC, was about 5% on your first few grand.  Now it's 15% on your first 118K.  Add in increased local taxes (there was no local income tax most places pre 70's) and increased state taxes (income and sales).</p>
<p>5- Food.  Grocery shopping happens now in almost a &quot;food theater&quot;.  Pre-70's food was at the grocer in three basic forms: staples (flour, sugar, eggs, milk, pasta, rice, oils, spices, bread, meat), canned goods and produce.  Produce was truly seasonal: no strawberries in December, a few apples in June.  The &quot;frozen section&quot; was about 10' of ice cream and some veggies.  I can't fathom the food waste being priced into what's at the grocery store now.</p>
<p>6- Recurring costs.  This is interesting.  Back in the stone ages, paying a recurring bill for something was unusual.  Water, electricity, gas and phone.  Now there's many businesses built on charging for &quot;subscriptions&quot; while in the past you'd expect that to be priced into the product, like a roku would sell for 350 and include a lifetime of netflix, as a bad example.</p>
<p>7- Medical care.  Very, very crude compared today.  No MRI/CAT scans, xray or get cut.  That bank of machines behind you monitoring heart/O2/ekg/BP simply didn't exist.  A nurse would take this every once a while, scribble it on paper.  Caner? Dead.  Heart disease? Dead.  Kidney stones?  You'd be cut and have them removed.  Difficult pregnancy?  Low chance of survival for mother and/or child. DVT? Warm compress.  The fact that pharmaceuticals can treat a range of illnesses that were solved only with crude surgery is nothing short of a miracle.</p>
<p>8- Travel.  Few people traveled more than 100 miles from their home town.  Fly in a plane?  That was for rich people, maybe a once in a lifetime experience.  Driving far wasn't practical because cars weren't that reliable.  A trip across the county in a car, while possible, wasn't advisable because something would likely go wrong.  Vacation was a camping trip or a stay with family at another city.  </p>
<p>9- Kids: You maybe had one or two toys, a bike, pocket knife and baseball glove.  Maybe 3-5 changes of clothes, one or two &quot;good&quot; sets of clothes. What's spent on kids is just plain loopy. </p>
<p>10- Economizing on utilities: Electricity was relatively expensive, people economized more than you think.  A room might have one or two light bulbs that were turned-off if you weren't in the room, same with the TV.  TV on with nobody watching it was a minor offense.  Your house would have one refrigerator (with a small freezer section), your Mom would care how frequently it was opened.  You wouldn't leave an outside light on unless there was a good reason.  Likewise, you were careful with water consumption.  If you had natural gas service for heating or used heating oil, the house would be warmed by the fireplace to reduce fuel use.  Calling &quot;long distance&quot; was an infrequent event, even calling out of your exchange would be billed per call so you were very careful about using the telephone. </p>
<p>I think if things were scaled back late 1960's early 1970's one income would work just fine.  I just don't see people scaling back lifestyles and expectations to match.  For the advances in medical care, paying more makes perfect sense; but I could do without the inflated grocery prices caused by all of the waste displaying food.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a book about this, called The Two-Income Trap.</p>
<p>It has a lot of interesting information about the phenomenon, but the basic gist is &quot;women got jobs, so now the market has adjusted to match those two incomes, PLUS there is real economic value in having a homemaker (cheap cooked meals, babysitting, etc).&quot;</p>
<p>EDIT: jesus christ my inbox hurts. Apparently this book isn't as well known as I thought. It's been out quite a while. /u/sprachkundige provided a link to a video lecture on the subject: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akVL7QY0S8A</a></p>
<p>EDIT: another resource provided by /u/Miraten: <a href="http://robertreich.org/post/9789891366" target="_blank">http://robertreich.org/post/9789891366</a></p>
<p>EDIT: /u/San-A: There is another book about this: The Capital in the 20th century, from Thomas Piketty</p>
<p>and /u/feather_and_belle:  <a href="http://www.bestoftheleft.com/dr_harrietfraad_on_how_capitalism_s_changes_since_1970s_have_disrupted_the_personal_lives_of_us_men_and_women_economic_update_w_profwolff" target="_blank">http://www.bestoftheleft.com/dr_harrietfraad_on_how_capitalism_s_changes_since_1970s_have_disrupted_the_personal_lives_of_us_men_and_women_economic_update_w_profwolff</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The cost of living has not paced with the average income. Basically, things cost more than they used to (which is expected due to inflation) but wages have not increased by the same amount.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/inflation-and-actual-prices.png" target="_blank">http://www.mybudget360.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/inflation-and-actual-prices.png</a></p>
<p>On that chart, the middle column is what things would cost if it paced evenly with wages, and the right column is what they actually cost.</p>
<p>We can see that a long time ago, a house was a bit more than 2 years average salary. Now a house is almost 10 times the average salary.</p>
<p>So basically, the rise of cost has outpaced the rise of wages.</p>
<p>We could debate for ages about why this is the case.</p>
<p>EDIT - Thanks for the gold!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
