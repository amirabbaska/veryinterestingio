		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Generally we don't know. A big question is whether animal behavior we see is what we call &quot;sentient intelligence&quot; versus &quot;chaotic emergent behavior&quot;. In the former you consider the animal to be a thinking, reasoning entity. In the latter you simply have a set of rules that can generate apparently complex behavior even when followed slavishly.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Langton%27s_ant" target="_blank">Langton's Ant</a> is a thought experiment where an ant walking across a sheet of paper follows only two rules (governing when it turns left or right) and yet it can create complex, organic-looking patterns. Moreover, we don't know the full behavior of this system even though it only has one actor that follows two rules. If you let the ant wander it will apparently always start wandering off the paper eventually, but so far nobody has been able to prove that this is the case or furnish a counter-example. We know that Langton's Ant is an example of chaotic emergent behavior, and yet we can't always identify it as such even though we have perfect knowledge of its universe and the rules by which it operates.</p>
<p>For any sufficiently intelligent-looking animal, it will be hard to say whether that animal is just following an internal set of rules or whether it's actually an intelligent, reasoning entity. Some people even believe that our behavior is always determined by things such as our brain chemistry, and those people would say that even human beings are just following a long, complicated set of rules that determines our behavior (even if we're not aware of it).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a philosophical question, which is to say we don't know, we can only guess at this point.</p>
<p>One of the main ways of telling something is aware is the ability for it to express the fact, an ability which only we as humans have, that we know of.</p>
<p>Another key thing is being able to understand that other individuals possess information you do not. As i recall monkeys taught sign language never really demonstrate this, although Koko did shows signs of that.</p>
<p>So we can barely define what is consciousness in this context, being able to tell how it is made I am afraid we are far from.</p>
<p>No sources everything here is a recollection of my philosophy/ethics classes 3 years ago.</p>
<p>Edit: philosophy not phylosophy. #2 leading -&gt; main</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sentience is really hard to define. It is one of those things that we know it when we see it but it is hard to pin down what exactly it is. The broadest definition is self-awareness, where you recognize yourself as a discrete thinking entity. Compare this with the concept of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie" target="_blank">philosophical zombie</a>, which reacts to stimulus but only as an automatic response. There is no conscious process associated with the reaction beyond instinct.</p>
<p>To test for this, behavioral scientists have developed several evaluations of whether a species or even human infants have/acquire self-awareness.  One common tool for identifying sentience is the mirror test, where a subject is marked discretely and shown the mark in a mirror. If the subject grooms itself in the location of the mark, then they recognize the reflection as themselves. Have a look at the Wikipedia article on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_consciousness#Scientific_approaches" target="_blank">Animal Consciousness</a> for more information.</p>
<p>The mirror test on its own can't be a conclusive negative though. For example, dogs typically fail the mirror test because they are not visually oriented animals, but are considered sentient when the mirror test is changed to a &quot;sniff-test&quot;.</p>
<p>There are definitely borderline examples, such as Magpies which show signs of sapience, but not enough for it to be definite.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most comments have already stated the reality: We don't know very well yet, because even the definitions of &quot;sentience&quot; and &quot;consciousness&quot; will heavily determine the conclusions of any given experiment.</p>
<p>A way to understand how sentience works is looking at the human brain, where we could say there are 3 layers:</p>
<p>-Reptilian layer, for breathing, movement and other basic functions (anatomically is the &quot;core&quot; of the brain)</p>
<p>-Mammalian layer, where additional functions are added on top of the reptilian ones, like territoriality, group behaviour, decision between options, etc. This would be the &quot;mantle&quot; of the brain, adding complexity and feeding on the reptilian layer for a lot of the info.</p>
<p>-Human layer, the neocortex, and specially the part frontal lobe. This layer is only as thick as a napkin, and well, <em>you</em> are that layer. The &quot;crust&quot; of the brain, that uses information from both inferior layers. But it can also &quot;create&quot; information, have ideas, and associate complex items.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>We are different from monkeys only because this crust is more developed, and our forehead is bigger so the crust in that area is wider too. But what you can take from all of this is that many mammals have already 2 of this layers, and that means that they can feel or experience many stimuli very similar to us, they just can't put it to words, or remember it too well, or know when to expect it or what does it mean. But the information is there.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a very broad and fuzzy line. </p>
<p>There isn't actually a difference between basic stimuli response and intelligence. Intelligence is just a huge pile of stimuli responses piled on top of each other. This makes the intelligence appear more complex.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the comparison of a light switch and a computer. A light switch is just a basic &quot;yes/no&quot; toggle; it's the response stimuli. A computer appears to be complex; it's the intelligence. But, when you zoom in, a computer is nothing more than millions and millions of really tiny light switches (we call it 1/0 rather than on/off).</p>
<p>Because one is just a matter of quantity of the other, the line between the two is fuzzy. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
