		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are several reasons. </p>
<p>First, oil prices aren't the only cost for gasoline. Think about how the price of an omelette at your favorite diner would be affected by a drop in the price of eggs. While eggs are the main ingredient in omelette so, there are other things that go into an omelette. You need to pay the cook to break the eggs and cook the omelette, the waiter to deliver the omelette to you, and also any other ingredients you want put into your omelette besides eggs. While the price of the omelette should fall, it won't fall as much as eggs unless these other costs are also falling.</p>
<p>Second, the time of year play a large role in gas prices. Americans like driving in summer, whether it's to get to the beach or to Grandmas house for July 4th. And because there are lots of people driving around in the summer, there are lots of people who need to buy gas. Now think about what happens at dinner when there are 4 people and only three hot dogs left. The three people who are hungriest should get them, right? Well in  order to find out who is the hungriest for gas, the prices go up so that people who don't really need gas say never mind and take a bicycle instead. When fall and winter come and less people want to drive, the opposite will happen and gas will get less expensive. </p>
<p>The last reason are the refineries that make gas.  They are old and often break down. This causes a shortage of gas just like the shortage of hot dogs I just mentioned. In the Midwest one of the refineries broke so now it's like there are 4 people and only 1 hot dog. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>100 students need blue crayons. And blue crayons cost 1 dollar from the store but you cannot buy them at the store. Someone in your class has a ton of blue crayons and sells them at $3.00. </p>
<p>Another guy also has crayons and wants to start selling. The new seller realizes that the people who first bought the crayon have already gotten back in line after they used up their crayon. Once he sees that both he and the original seller can sell crayons at $3.00 and still receive the same amount of customers the new guy doesn't have to compete to sell the same amount as the other guy. </p>
<p>Once demand is high enough (gas reaching a point of necessity) you don't need to lower your price. </p>
<p>Another factor is general population wealth. As some people have pointed out. California gas prices are way higher than middle-of-nowhere Nebraska. You can sell a guy who has $200 something for $20 but a guy who has $40 will only buy it if you sell it for $5.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh I weep for you... <strong>it's $6.79 a gallon in the UK.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.globalpetrolprices.com/gasoline_prices/" target="_blank">http://www.globalpetrolprices.com/gasoline_prices/</a></p>
<p>(&quot;As a general rule, richer countries have higher prices while poorer countries and the countries that produce and export oil have significantly lower prices. One notable exception is the U.S. which is an economically advanced country but has low gas prices. The differences in prices across countries are due to the various taxes and subsidies for gasoline.&quot;)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't know where you are; I just paid $2.32 this morning.  That's not &quot;almost&quot; $3.00 a gallon.  But, there's no single answer to your question.  There are multiple influences, including:</p>
<p>(i) It takes some time for the changes in oil prices to ripple through the economy.  The gas station owner, for example, filled his tanks when oil was more expensive. </p>
<p>(ii) State gas taxes have increased</p>
<p>(iii) gas prices are based on the supply and demand of gasoline.  One of the things that goes into determining supply is the price of oil, but not the only thing. </p>
<p>(iv) There is not one national gas market -- refiners have to create multiple blends for different parts of the country.  That increases the cost of gasoline and also means that different areas of the country can be subject to regional effects.  For example, if a refinery  that produces California gas shuts down, that will impact gas supply in California (and, thus, prices), but have little effect elsewhere.</p>
<p>(iv) Besides taxes, other costs of refinery have also increased -- refinery workers, for example, are getting paid more today than they were 15 years ago.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
