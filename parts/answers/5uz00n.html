		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The slab is refrigerated and kept very cold. This allows you to manipulate the ice cream and mix things into without it melting. Doing this in the store allows you to have very personalized icecreams rather than just having to have pre-mixed choices only. But  you could do the same with a steel slab or anything else you could keep cold. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Marble takes ages of compaction geologic formation. Basically, rock is preasurized under the earth under such conditions that it changes. The act of it compacting makes it denser, tougher, overall more resistant to damage and weathering. Rocks and minerals react under different temperatures. Typically you can note more durable minerals will take higher temperatures to melt down. Some minerals are no longer deposited from volcanoes because the Earth just doesn't run hot enough to melt them and let them enter a lava flow and be taken to the surface. Quartz is an example of an unstable mineral. If I remember right it melts at about 600 degrees Fahrenheit. The more unstable a mineral or rock is the easier it breaks down. So back to marble. It has undergone intense pressurization and heat to form. And this is more stable. This means it will not break easily if at all if you slam a metal scoop on it many times. Marble also retains cold temperatures well and heats up slowly, so you can keep cold things colder, easier on it than on say an aluminum tray. Durable, resistant to damage, holds cold temperatures well, looks pretty, and can't very easily chip away into your ice cream. Nobody wants marble flakes mix-ins.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
