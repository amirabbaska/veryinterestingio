		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't believe there is any evidence to support that language affects palate morphology. However, vice versa it may be that morphology affected the development of (aspects of) languages.</p>
<p>For example, see these two paragraphs from a <a href="http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/faces/viewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=escidoc:2166182" target="_blank">2015 conference paper by Moisik and Dediu</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that human populations vary in certain systematic ways in their anatomy and physiology. This is true at both micro- and macroscopic levels, and advances in genetics will continue to elucidate the extent of these patterns of variation across populations. Early in the development of modern phonetic and phonological science, several proposals (e.g. <a href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/reader-in-historical-and-comparative-linguistics/oclc/220270" target="_blank">[24]</a> and <a href="https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/17928687?selectedversion=NBD4131403" target="_blank">[2]</a>) were made which held that some of the diversity observed in speech sound systems around the globe might be owing to systematic variation observed in the anatomy and physiology of the speakers of language, in addition to the other factors driving language change and diversification. These ideas were hastily dismissed as implausible, on the grounds that any human being can learn any human language.</p>
<p>It is an incontrovertible fact that normal variation of the human vocal tract does not preclude an individual from acquiring any spoken language. However, the hypothesis that human vocal tract morphology exerts a bias on the way we speak seems plausible, and the possibility that such biases might have expressions at the level of populations of speakers has never been satisfactorily ruled out. It also seems to have resulted in the unfortunate side- effect that details of vocal tract shape are rarely if ever correlated to production variables in phonetic research. A relatively recent return to the question of whether normal vocal tract variation can indeed exert such biases reflects the unresolved nature of the problem. Many examples exist for such research examining the individual level (e.g. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261256855_Palatal_Morphology_Can_Influence_Speaker-Specific_Realizations_of_Phonemic_Contrasts" target="_blank">[25]</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19507976" target="_blank">[3]</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4492454/" target="_blank">[18]</a>), and these are laden with implications for impacts at broader levels, with some researchers even suggesting it may be a driver of change of certain aspects of entire phonological systems (e.g. <a href="http://cogprints.org/3286/" target="_blank">[1]</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21615290" target="_blank">[5]</a>, and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23811472" target="_blank">[17]</a>).</p>

<p>Of course, this wouldn't help you identify which language someone spoke while alive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Sounds like a plot mover to me. The way the mouth and larynx are shaped isn't because of accent (plus there is no British accent...there are many, very different accents in the UK). There will be some difference between speakers but more of the accent you hear will come from formants and frequencies, and the way the speaker manipulates the air coming up the vocal tract. People with palate abnormalities such as cleft still have accents, so I doubt the palate was how they determined the person's nationality. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As far as I am aware, all evidence points to a somewhat opposite pattern. There is considerable variation among speakers of a given language with regard to the physical morphology of their vocal tracts, which leads to variation in articulatory strategies that speakers use to obtain a similar acoustic output. In other words: (1) a great deal of physical variation exits among speakers of a language, and (2) speakers find ways of compensating for this variation to create relative uniformity in the actual sound structure of the language.</p>
