		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleeping in a room with no windows and poor ventilation can mess with your body’s perception even when sleeping. External signals can be a large part of waking up (ever go camping and wake naturally with the sunrise?).</p>
<p>Depression can easily have large effects on motivation to get up and out of bed, leading to chemical and electrical signaling in your nervous system outside of the normalcy you’d find in a natural circadian rhythm for a healthy person.</p>
<p>Poor diet and exercise can contribute to oversleep as well if your body can not rest and repair as it would with proper nutrition and a previous day’s activity wearing you out.</p>
<p>Sleep is very complicated and individual if you are having sleep issues I would recommend asking your GP and considering talking to a specialist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the mechanics of sleep aside, remember that a lot of the questions concerning <em>&quot;why can't our bodies do this or that?&quot;</em> can be answered with the following: <strong>did it have some survival advantage that led to greater mating opportunities</strong> or <strong>prevent those with said traits from reaching breeding age</strong>.</p>
<p>Remember that you are a product of a long and unbroken chain of surviving organisms stretching back tens of millions of years, who's adaptions have led them to find sufficient food and successfully breed. &quot;Good enough&quot; is the motto of natural selection.</p>
<p>So, would the ability to precisely wake up the moment our bodies had rested enough have some major utility? The process of waking from an unconscious state to an alert one is already fairly fast, but what if it were faster and more precise? If an individual had a combination of genetic traits that led him to be able to wake up every so slightly sooner once he was fully rested, would that organism have a selective advantage over his immediate rivals insofar as mating is concerned?</p>
<p>The answer is likely <em>not really</em>. Therefore our evolution never trended towards it. And so long as our bodies get roughly sufficient rest. And so long as our bodies wake up when there are perceived threats (flight or fight), then it's good enough and no more precise adaptions would be observed in that area.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
