This is because, there is very little selective pressure on genes required for longevity and tissue regeneration after an animal can no longer reproduce and pass on genes. In other words, you might have a perfect set of genes that allow tissue generation and longevity but if those genes cannot grant you reproductive successes, they won't be selected.</p>
<p>Unlike animals trees do not become less successful in reproduction with age. Actually an older tree is larger and can produce far more offspring. So genes required  for tissue regeneration and longevity are selected for those. This is why many trees can live for thousands of years. Yet again mutation accumulate on DNA with time. This eventually wears them down. As a result they are not immortal. But evolution granted them with very long lifespans.</p>
<p>Edit1;According to the comments I wanted to point out that reproductive success does not only depend on the fertility or the ability to find and compete for mates, it is very strongly correlated to general survivability. For instance life span of rats in wild is about 1 year, as a pet rats can live up to 2-3 years and they are fertile and capable of reproducing during that period. Rats in wild have so short lifespans because they have many predators. So a rat is not likely to live much more than a year in wild due to predation even if it's genes would grant it 10 years lifespan. Since rats rarely live beyond a year in wild, they can only reproduce during that period. As a result, only the genes essential for survivability for the first few years are selected by evolution. Now even when we keep rats as pets, they can only go for 2-3 years at max because they lack the mechanisms that allow longevity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
