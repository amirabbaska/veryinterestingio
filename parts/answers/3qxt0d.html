		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of it like sugar in your tea.</p>
<p>100% means there is as much sugar dissolved in your tea as possible. If you add any more, it won't dissolve, instead it will stay as a solid and sit at the bottom of your cup.</p>
<p>Water &quot;dissolves&quot; in air in the same way when it evaporates and turns into water vapour, which is an invisible gas. 100% humidity means if you add any more, it will stay as a liquid and not evaporate.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humidity can be measured in two ways - <em>absolute</em> humidity and <em>relative</em> humidity. Absolute humidity is simply the amount of water in the air, and is measured in &quot;amount of water per unit of volume&quot;. Relative humidity is the absolute humidity relative to the maximum possible absolute humidity (at the current air pressure and temperature). &quot;100% humidity&quot; refers to relative humidity, which means that air is saturated and can't hold any more water vapor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>100% humidity means the air has as much water vapor mixed up in it as it can &quot;hold&quot; at a given temperature without the water beginning to condense into a liquid. It doesn't mean that the air is pure water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humidity isn't an exact measurement of the ratio of water to air... rather its a measurement of how saturated the air is with water. At 0% humidity there is no water in the air. At 50% humidity the air is half as saturated with water as it can possibly be. At 100% humidity absolutely no more vaporized water can mix in with the air, and if any more tried to, then the excess water would just return to its normal liquid state and cling to another body of water or a solid object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
