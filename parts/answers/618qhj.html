		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From <a href="https://redd.it/2rpq0u" target="_blank">Previous thread</a> - Here is a great ELI5 explanation. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever seen pizza made from scratch? The dough begins as a ball. It is then thrown in the air and spun. As it spins, the dough flattens and moves outwards into a disc shape. Solar systems and galaxies form like that.</p>
<p>Because they spin.
When you have loosely connected matter, like the dust from which galaxies are formed--or, say, pizza dough--as it rotates, it tends to push material away from the axis of rotation. Thus, gravity can compress the matter into a disc-like shape, but the faster it rotates, the harder it is for it to compress into a spherical shape.</p>
<p>This applies to the formation of many objects in astrophysics--it's why solar systems tend to have a 'plane' much like galaxies, and even stars are originally formed from a collapsing disk.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that there are more spherical galaxies, as well as a large central bulge in otherwise 'flat' galaxies. There's quite a lot of variance.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you have a large clump of particles swirling around randomly, there is generally a direction of rotation that the whole clump is spinning in. As for why its flat; generally, while the whole is spinning, the up and down motion tends to cancel out as particles crash into each other with the spin persisting. The result is a spinning flat disk that many galaxies this video describes it better than i ever could <a href="https://youtu.be/tmNXKqeUtJM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/tmNXKqeUtJM</a> </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So the main thing at work here is conservation of angular momentum, which is a fancy way of saying that the total amount of rotation in a closed (isolated, not connected to some other source or sink of energy) system has to stay the same.</p>
<p>So say you have a huge cloud of dust that will one day be a galaxy. At the moment it's a huge blob with particles flying in all directions and bumping into each other. If you add up the trajectories of all of the particles in that cloud, you will end up with a net amount of rotation on one axis (in 3D space), which means that the whole cloud is rotating in some direction on some 2D plane.</p>
<p>Since the total amount of angular momentum in an isolated system has to stay the same, that means that the cloud must rotate no matter how the forces inside it end up balancing out. Particles that aren't rotating in that direction continue to bump into each other, as well as rotating particles, and over time, all of those opposing directional forces cancel out, leaving the cloud more or less all rotating in the same direction, on that same flat plane.</p>
<p>The reason the disc doesn't collapse into a sphere is because the particles are individually too light relative to their distance between each other to overcome the centripetal forces keeping them locked in their orbits. Planets form spheres rather than discs because the particles that make them up, while starting as a cloud and collapsing into a disc, are able to pull together into clumps gravitationally. They still keep rotating in the same direction, but they all become larger chunks with enough mass to maintain a 3D shape against the speed of their rotation.</p>
<p>This is also why all of the planets in most solar systems orbit in the same direction, because all of the particles that made them did so as well, and had nowhere to dump that rotation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As kind of an addendum to this question, is it possible for a disc shaped planet or star to exist? Or is it not possible for one to spin fast enough to achieve the effect? Is a pulsar the closest you can get to this?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Actually most galaxies aren't flat. The ones you know like andromeda and our own milky way, have a disk where most of the stars, planets, dust etc is but theres also a halo or sphere/oval shaped area around these galaxies which have less tightly packed dust, stars, star clusters, and planets. Theres also alot of rogue objects which arent really bound to anything gravitationally and are just drifting. The halo isn't really visible but there are objects that are a part of the galaxy out there. Then there are other types of galaxies which some don't even have a defined shape.
