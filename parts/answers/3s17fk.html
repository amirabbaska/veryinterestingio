		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a company that make the salad bags here in the UK. There are a few reasons. One, a week is a long time for lettuce. The lettuce is picked on day one. Sent to us by day two AM, processed (cut, washed and bagged) and in our distribution chain by day two evening. Its in store day 3. Its 3 days old, its so far been washed and prepared in a very clean environment and packed in a bag containing a perfect mix of gasses to keep it fresh and safe to eat.</p>
<p>Lets say you buy it on day 5. Then keep it in your fridge for 7 days. Its 12 days old now, and if you're like me, you've had your grubby hand in there a few times too. Not much stuff lives to see 12 days without some kind of life extension aid, by preservation or natural defence (skin etc). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>OP, your <strong>HEAD</strong> of lettuce is the stem which the leaves are still attached to.</p>
<p>Your bag of salad <strong>MIX</strong> is all leaves picked from the stem. It's a bag of leaves.</p>
<p>Leaving the leaves on the stem and selling the full head of lettuce will keep the leaves much longer than picking them and putting them in a bag. They will continue to draw moisture from the stem to stay hydrated and crisp. Leaves that are picked will rapidly lose moisture, get floppy and wilted and turn black.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Holding lettuce in water during processing and keeping them stored in a cool, low oxygen environment helps keep them fresh from picking to processing.</p>
<p>Once processed they are packed in air-tight sealed containers with a mix of gasses aimed at keeping their shelf-life and nice green colour. </p>
<p>Generally if you want to keep your salad pretty green store it iced-water in the fridge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in transportation. Lettuce is cut from the field and shipped 6-8 hours later. It is always shipped using team service(2 truck drivers, 1 truck) so that the truck never stops moving. It is also cooled in a fridge before being loaded on a refrigerated trailer that is kept at a continuous temperature of 34 degrees F for the entire dueration of the trip. It will be cut in California and be in the Northeast 48 hours later for processing. It is processed that same day then shipped out over night to local grocery stores. So in roughly 72 hours (even less if it is not going across the entire country) it goes from the field to your grocery store shelf, while being kept at 34 degrees F for the entire duration of transit &amp; processing. You get the vast majority of the shelf life, 3 days of transit vs 7 days in your fridge.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your fridge isn't running at incredibly cold and controlled environments designed to be completely free of any fungi or bacteria that may rot the vegetable. There's a reason that packed salad is in an airtight bag. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
