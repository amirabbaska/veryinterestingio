The reason there is no measure of darkness is the same reason that there is no measure for shortness, or coldness...because there is already a measure for length and heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>How do you measure cold? It's the same thing as heat, just less of it. </p>
<p>Same with darkness. It's just a measurement of how <em>not</em> bright it is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because darkness is the absence of light. Total darkness is zero light. So instead of measuring darkness we would simply measure the light which is there and get a low to zero reading. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason there's no measuring unit for cold: because darkness isn't its own thing.  Darkness is, in physical terms, low levels of light.</p>
<p>So to measure darkness, you'd use one of the units we have for light, most likely lux, and remember that lower numbers mean it's darker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Measuring brightness and measuring darkness are both the same methods but happen in opposite directions, like the measuring of acidness or baseness happens in liquids with the pH scale which ranges between -1 and 14 (or so) where -1 is a high acidness and 14 is a high baseness.</p>
<p>Measuring brightness gets done by measuring the amount of photons reflected. A white surface will reflect all photons, a dark surface will reflect nearly none.</p>
<p>From Quora:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In terms of physics, an object is said to be dark when it absorbs photons, causing it to appear dim compared to other objects. For example, matte black paint does not reflect much visible light and appears dark, whereas white paint reflects lots of light and appears bright</p>
