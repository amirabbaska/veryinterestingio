		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For any content that Netflix licenses/purchases from a third party, those shows follow industry standards of 23 min / half hour and 42 min / hour run times.  However, any show that Netflix funds and produces can vary in length.  They have no standard run times for their original series, so while shows can go up to the 30 min / 60 min limit, they allow the show the time it needs in order to complete the story.  This is why run times of Netflix shows can vary by 7-10 mins from episode to episode (on an hour show).</p>

<p>Edit: Whoa, I step out for a 30 minute meeting and this goes wild.  Yes, there are many levels of producer, but, fortunately for me, I am at the &quot;coffee-receiving&quot; level - for the record, I almost entirely get my own coffee.  I work on Netflix original documentary series, but also had a position on Master of None.  </p>
<p>Edit 2:  For clarity, I work in post-production, not development, so I'm not the source for pitch meetings, auditions, or in with the development team.  RIP Inbox.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The mistake you're making is assuming there's an advantage to using up &quot;the full 30 minutes&quot;. Why is there an advantage to using a round number? Why use more time if you <em>don't need it</em>?      </p>
<p>One thing you might notice is times on Netflix shows can vary quite substantially. As an example, the latest episodes of House of Cards run from 42 to 57 minutes long. Traditional TV shows won't vary that wildly because each episode needs to fit snugly into the commercial slots. To illustrate, every recent episode of The Simpsons is either <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/episodes?season=28&amp;ref_=tt_eps_sn_28" target="_blank">21 or 22 minutes long</a>     </p>
<p>Since they don't have to weave in commercials, Netflix <em>wants</em> their creative staff to be free of formatting constraints. It gives the writers, directors and editors more freedom because they don't have to pad or cut scenes for set runtimes. They get to tell the story however they feel is best. Netflix feels this allows for higher quality programming.     </p>
<p>When you understand what they're going for, you see that &quot;using the full 30 minutes&quot; isn't more freedom - it's just a new time constraint, something they want to avoid.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While other have pointed out that actual original Netflix shows do often vary in length; it's also important to note there is some element of the production/post production systems that are already in place that influence the running time:</p>
<p>Shows have to be shot </p>
<ul>
<li>there are already models on how to budget for and shoot a 40-50 minute program including pages per day to hit in a typical 5 day schedule, union rules (so many unions are represented on a shooting set!) and facilities limitations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Shows have to be edited </p>
<ul>
<li>again models on how to budget for editorial, online and color correction, sound editing and mixing already exist.  When you have varying running time for episodes far outside these existing workflows you often encounter overages or might even have trouble fitting you show into the workdays of your vendors (and again union rules that mandate professionals be booked on a daily or weekly basis that don't allow much wiggle to add a half day to finish that extra 12 minutes).</li>
</ul>
<p>So as much as it can vary; the whole production and post production world is largely ruled by scheduling and budgeting; and those are often based on numbers and workflows very much based on the typical commercial television running time ballpark so it can be a bit difficult to stray too far...</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to the other reasons given, there's also the considerations of cost and form.</p>
<p>Increasing episode length by 50% is obviously more expensive than not doing that, and there's nothing saying that a longer episode is inherently better.  TV shows aren't hour or half hour long episodes cut down to 42 or 23 minutes, they're written to be that long and have been for a long time.  A lot of shows will keep being made that way because that's how they've been made for decades and the people making them aren't freshly hired out of college by Netflix, they've been in the business for years.</p>
<p>Oftentimes Netflix original shows will stray from exactly hitting TV time because they can, but they aren't going to dramatically change the episode length on a whim.</p>
<p>There's also a lot to be said for creating within limits.  Letting a creator go completely wild often ends in, well, the Star Wars prequels.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>this is actually not necessarily true. My roommate's brother is a primary (oh gosh forgot the title, filmer, he runs the primary camera). He recently worked on a Netflix show and was telling us how awesome it was because they weren't constrained by time and that they could make episodes as long and as short as they needed to tell their story. It gave a creative freedom he hadn't ever had on a show before </p>
<p>Like others have said, naturally most production studios are used to working in those confines, so it's very likely it's simply a habit. But Netflix does not enforce it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
