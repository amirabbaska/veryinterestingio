		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sometimes your throat gets scratched and swells up a little bit so you feel like the pill is still there. </p>
<p>Source: took a tablet. Was convinced it was stuck in my throat. Called NHS direct they told me I had to get it looked at or it could cause a serious infection that could travel to my voice box. Went to hospital. Waited 5 hours. Saw doctor. The doctor I needed wasn’t there. Told to report at 10am the next day. Had to take a day off sick. Turned up to hospital. ENT didn’t start til 11am. Waited til then. Went in. Had tube stuck down nose. No pill in throat. Doctors says it probs just scratched it. </p>
<p>£11 spent in hospital parking. Lots of time wasted. 1/7 would not do again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That’s called a globus sensation. Sometimes this is from food/pills/whatever getting stuck in a tiny pocket at the “base” of our tongue. Other times, if there was something there and then you get it out, the sensation can remain. Best strategy is to tuck your chin and swallow. This allows for the tongue base to basically move more and wash out anything that may have gotten caught in that tiny pocket. If it happens a lot, talk to a doctor! (Source: I’m a speech-language pathologist who works with swallowing patients) </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's to prevent possible choking your body reacts like that. They are 99% of the time never stuck it feels like they are when they hit the back of throat usually when swallowed dry.</p>
<p>Your esophagus has muscles that pull them downwards as you swallow greatly reducing the chance of a tablet being stuck.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
