		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What a great question!  I didn't know five minutes ago, but from a bit of googling it sounds like the energy involved in a crater impact is more like a bomb going off than a ball splatting into dust.  So your usual intuition for how impacts happen doesn't really apply.  Imagine lobbing a stick of lit dynamite at an angle, and it explodes the instant it hits the ground.  The damage from the explosion expands out in a circle, and the fact that it was traveling at an angle doesn't really change how that explosion happens.  Of course a meteorite isn't dynamite, but it's traveling so fast that it pulverizes into a circular explosion of hot expanding gas on impact, and that gas is what causes the crater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi! I'm doing a lot of work in structural geology currently and impact structures are something I work on. In order to keep this as simple as possible we can break the creation of an impact structure into three stages: </p>
<ol>
<li>Contact and Collision -- projectile strikes earth's surface</li>
<li>Excavation -- transient crater is created, sediment is launched upward </li>
<li>Modification -- erosion and uplift </li>
</ol>
<p>As mentioned above, the intital contact is less like an impact and more like an explosion. In fact, most of the projectile is vaporized upon contact and a lot of underlying sediments are vaporized too, that's how powerful it is. Stage 3 of the impact process also contributes to this circular look by slumping the rims of the transient crater. </p>
<p>Cheers!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Angled impacts still create circular craters, unless the angle is very glancing. When the meteor hits, the energy released is so great that it basically explodes, and the explosion spreads out spherically in all directions blasting a circular crater.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This phenomenon is explained very well by Neil Degrasse Tyson on episode 919 of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast. As explained below, when the kinetic energy of an object, in this case a meteor, exceeds the chemical energy holding that object together, you get a big ol' boom. </p>
<p>Degrasse Tyson's explanation is worth a listen. Actually I'd highly recommend this entire podcast. </p>

<p>Can I ask one on top of it:</p>
<p>Why are there craters facing earth anyway ?! - If the moon always show the same &quot;face&quot; to the Earth, how can asteroids/ meteorites hit it dead on if the Earth is basically &quot;shielding&quot; / &quot;protecting&quot; the moon with it's surface ?!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
