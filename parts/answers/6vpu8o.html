		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, as someone who has seen hundreds of people die and reviewed countless deaths for our ER, unfortunately I guess I am an expert to answer your question.</p>
<p>For younger people, the thing that kills you fastest is complete cessation of the circulation which usually involves the heart or its major vessels:</p>
<p>1) Ventricular Fibrillation or Ventricular Tachycardia:
Most people who are young and die of sudden death will be described as having died of a &quot;heart attack.&quot;  That's the easiest way to understand it.  A plaque forms in the heart that grows so big that it cuts off vital blood supply to critical muscle in the heart.  The reality is much more strange.  Yes, we have older people that get gradual narrowing of their coronaries and develop gradually poor stamina and eventually chest pressure with exertion.  They will then get seen by a Cardiologist and are often a candidate for angioplasty.  HOWEVER, there are a significant number of people (especially young people or people who have just been given a clean bill of health by their MD) who have death so sudden, many of them don't even make it to the ER.  The extremely lucky ones that do make it to the ER are usually found to be in ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation which is a very irregular rhythm that doesn't allow blood to flow from the heart.  These people have no pulse and can often be stabilized quickly by shocking them out of the rhythm.  When they go for emergent angiogram to look at the arteries, the amazing thing to me is that most of the time you may see a small arterial branch that got obstructed by a piece of plaque.  This is technically a heart attack but the amount of injured tissue is miniscule, heart contractility is not effected and the patient can make a complete recovery.  These people often had very little arterial plaque but the kind that is unstable and can break off and go to a small dead end portion of a vessel.  That localized irritated heart tissue that isn't getting blood can be a focus of irregular rhythm that disrupts the normal cycles of contractility of the heart.  The result is like an earthquake of irregular contractions that seizes up effective contractions.  This is why malls, airplanes and other public places have AEDs (automatic external defibrillators) which can identify this abnormal rhythm and shock the person out.  It will definitely save a life of someone who should expect to make a complete recovery and could live a long and healthy life.</p>
<p>2) Pulmonary Embolism
What we are talking about here is an &quot;acute saddle embolism&quot; which is a type of pulmonary embolism that is so large that it kills you instantly.  PE is when clot (typically originating in the leg) breaks off and lodges in the major artery that feeds the lungs blood.  As you know, you have two lungs and two arteries that carry blood to them but if the clot is large enough it can block the origin of the 2 arteries and completely shut down the circulation of the body as all the blood that will be circulated must travel through this passage.  This is commonly caused by people who have been sedentary for long periods such as through air travel or had an immobilized broken limb that developed large clots.  Often in a young person, they can have a yet to be diagnosed disorder that makes them clot easily like a genetic disease or sometimes I see a new diagnosis of cancer that presents with major blood clots.  Suffice it to say that sudden blockage of blood to the whole body kills people instantly if it lodges completely.</p>
<p>3) Miscelaneous
Other things that cause young people to die suddenly usually involve genetic anatomic failures of the circulatory system.  They include sudden tearing of the aorta, the main conduit of blood to the whole body, from such conditions as a variant of Marfan's disease or other collagen vascular disorders.  Other genetic conditions include abnormalities in the conduction system of the heart which often happens in people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (a form of enlarged heart from birth) or something called Wolf Parkinson White syndrome where they may have an abnormal resting EKG.  Something else that can kill in a matter of minutes is complete upper airway obstruction.  The body has little oxygen reserve which can deplete very quickly.  Other possibilities for sudden death include a major seizure occurring while swimming or driving.  The person will suddenly lose control of their muscles and can drown or plow into a wall.</p>
<p>Dying from &quot;Old Age&quot;
Now the old age question is an interesting one.  The short answer is that the dying process can be so complicated to explain that people just say &quot;old age&quot; but an example of this could be a major stroke which caused the person to become bed bound and then they had progressive skin breakdown from laying in bed all day and that created an infected wound that after many attempts to surgically clean and repair became so infected they went into septic shock and died.</p>
<p>Death from old age usually starts from disability and progresses into the complex set of problems that occur from that disability.  Sometimes its not just from a heart attack or stroke making them weaker, it can be from hip fracture or simply decline in stamina from age or associated factors such as progressive arthritis or even depression from a lack of enjoyment of life.  By being sedentary, circulation declines and people can develop terrible leg swelling including clots, skin breakdown where they make contact with the bed or chair and combined with lack of nutrition there is an increased risk for infection.  </p>
<p>I'm particularly paranoid about my own loved ones in their 80's who are admitted to the hospital for a procedure and knowing that a temporary disability in the elderly can rapidly progress into a permanent one.</p>
<p>Anyways hope this helps.  Rather than scare you, please understand that we all die and our respect for death should always lead us to have an appreciation for life rather than a paranoid existence.  You are never too young to consider your legacy and to be thankful for your health.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm a nurse.  I've worked in a nursing home, and currently work in a hospital. I've seen this happen many times, so I'll give it a shot.  </p>
<p>Your body is a bunch of interconnected systems.  They depend upon each other so they can function, not unlike  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qd05K6uKyQw" target="_blank">this</a>.  As you get older, your systems accumulate damage or wear and do not repair themselves as well as they used to.  When enough damage is accumulated, either through extreme age or through abuse of the particular system (often a little bit of both) the system begins to fail.  When it fails, the other systems are stressed in turn.  Since they too have accumulated damage over the years, they don't have much reserves left for dealing with this additional stress, and they begin to fail.  The result is cascade multi organ failure.  Sometimes a person dies of a heart attack or some such thing, and since they were so old we don't look into it, as other posters have said.  I think what you're asking is what it looks like when a body just wears out from extreme age.  I'll give a simplistic example.  </p>
<p>Suppose someone is 99 years old.  Every system in their body has been doing it's job for 99 years, and it is much less powerful and efficient than it used to be.   They have arthritis, so they take ibuprofen for pain management.  They also don't drink enough water, as many elderly don't.  This takes a toll on their kidneys.  Kidneys are responsible for managing waste and water in the body, so if the kidneys start to fail, waste products and fluids begin to back up in the body.  Their heart was functioning adequately for the amount of blood it was supposed to pump, but soon there's significantly more fluid than the heart is prepared for.  The heart begins to work harder, causing the person to get tired easier.  As time goes on, the kidneys continue to go down hill and the fluid backs up even further and begins to collect in the lungs.  The body begins to panic as it realizes the lungs are in danger, so the person starts breathing harder, heart rate increases to try and get oxygen to all the important tissues.  This puts more stress on the heart and lungs, as both systems are being pushed beyond capacity. This increase in blood pressure forces more fluid into the lungs, which results in less oxygen transfer with every breath.  This is a cycle which perpetuates itself, where each effort the body makes to overcome one problem makes another one worse.  Meanwhile, waste products are building up, so nothing works as well as it could, even with age taken into account.  Ultimately, one system or another finally exhausts its reserves and quits. The other systems are so exhausted from trying to prop up the failing system that they almost immediately fail as well. Ultimately, death is caused in the tissues by lack of oxygen.  If the heart fails, the oxygen cant move from the lungs to the tissues.  If the lungs fail, the oxygen can't get from the air into the blood.  In any case, you go long enough without oxygen to a tissue, it dies.  Enough tissue dies, it kills the organ.  Enough organs die, the person dies. So, in the case above you could say the person dies of respiratory arrest, or cardiac arrest, but ultimately it doesn't matter.  Technically I suppose you could call it multisystem organ failure? In any case, the phenomenon is most easily understood as a body just wearing out.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I do hospice visits once a week with my <a href="http://i.imgur.com/N6w1toZ.jpg" target="_blank">therapy dog</a>. </p>
<p>A typical patient we see has dementia and a full laundry list of other problems. They're usually in their late 80's or older, and they're almost always women. When I say laundry list, I mean they're in a body that has been going for a long, long time, and it's like a cheap hooptie on Craig's List. There's very little go left in it. </p>
<p>So let's say we see someone on Thursday. And they're a little present, in that they know a dog is visiting them, and they may interact a little bit with him, petting him, and talking to him. Some of the talk makes sense and some of it? They're talking to a dog they had when they were 10. It's all good. </p>
<p>And then I'll get a text that so and so is &quot;transitioning&quot;. So that means they're actively dying. If I go see that person, and they are now actively dying, they don't interact at all with me. They have no idea I'm there. If the family is there, they interact with the dog because for some people hugging a fuzzy dog makes a shitty situation a little more bearable. </p>
<p>But anyway, there's that point where the person is a person, and can understand that I'm there with a dog, even if it's an elusive understanding, and that point where they're still human, but what makes them them and not some other person, is leaving or fully gone. </p>
<p>I'll be honest: one day when I'm like that, I'm ok with leaving. When you get to that stage, there is not much left, unless these people are having a massively interesting internal dialog with themselves. I have no idea. </p>
<p>I see some people in hospice and you'd have no idea that they were on palliative care. They're fully present when you talk to them, and often much younger than that typical late 80's with dementia person. There was one woman we were visiting for awhile who had lung cancer, and was about my age. She had schizophrenia, so at times it was a bit odd to have a conversation with her, but we would go for walks around the grounds of the group home she lived in, and like I said, you would have no idea she was dying. </p>
<p>On that topic I wear a badge on a lanyard around my neck when I'm in a facility with my dog, but there are some patients where I hide the badge. It has the name of the group I volunteer for and the word &quot;HOSPICE&quot; on it, and some patients and their families don't want to see that word. </p>
<p>I think people used to be around dying people more often, and they had more acceptance and understanding of it, without maybe knowing all the nuts and bolts of exactly what was going on. But they knew that so and so was dying, and now was the time to see them before they left. </p>
<p>Finally, my husband's grandfather is 96 and grandma is 92. They still live on their own, drive, do volunteer work, etc. But if one day Gramps forgets to wake up, it's not going to surprise us. We'll be sad, and we're going to miss him, but things wear out, be they human or machine. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pretty much all deaths from non traumatic causes are ultimately due to cardiac arrest, which is when the heart is unable to adequately pump blood to maintain life. </p>
<p>So although it may sound very obvious, people who die of old age die of cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Then the next question becomes, what causes someone to suddenly go into cardiac arrest. There are lots of potential causes for this.</p>
<p>Once a person reaches a certain age, their heart generally will not function as well as a young person. There heart is at an increased risk of going into arrthymia, which is when the heart beats too erratically to have normal pump function. A few seconds of a cardiac arrthymia can lead to loss of consciousness. It occurring for a few more minutes can lead to death minutes of cardiac arrthymia.</p>
<p>Small things such as large changes in temperature, poorer breathing when sleeping in the middle of the night, a sudden heart attack can trigger a lethal arrthymia in the elderly.</p>
<p>Edit: removed the line about &quot;brain death&quot; since I might have mixed up my definitions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There will always be a more immediate cause than &quot;just&quot; dying, it's just that it's not always necessary or desirable to go in to the details. Sudden deaths tend to be failures of the circulatory system, such as heart failure or stroke, and it's possible to go in to more detail in each case e.g. a heart failure could be a heart attack (artery blockage), valve failure, electrical/nervous system. The general term &quot;stroke&quot; covers two different kinds of circulatory failure (blockage or bleeding). </p>
<p>So you could say &quot;dying of old age&quot; is shorthand for &quot;dying from one of those conditions that are more likely in old age&quot;! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
