		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dark matter doesn't clump the way atomic matter does, because it doesn't experience the forces that cause that clumping. Because of this dark matter in a galaxy tends to form a &quot;halo&quot;, a mostly spherically symmetric &quot;blob&quot; that has a slightly increasing density toward the center of the galaxy. The result of this distribution is that on small scales the density of dark matter is insignificant compared to the density of stuff made out of matter (stars and planets), but on larger scales dark matter catches up. Because it's density is about the same over huge regions.</p>
<p>The density of dark matter near the Sun is about 0.0025 solar masses per cubic light-year. That means within the cubic light-year of the Solar System atomic matter makes up 99.75% of the mass in that region (and within the volume of the Solar System enclosed by the radius of Neptune's orbit, only a trillionth of a solar mass, about the same as a 100km diameter asteroid, comes from dark matter). However, the density of stars in our galaxy is lower than 1 per cubic light-year, and the stars are concentrated into a very thin disk, whereas dark matter exists in an enormous spherical halo. The Milky Way has maybe 400 billion stars and is about 90,000 ly in radius, with a disk thickness of about 2,000 ly. The disk has a volume of about 51 trillion ly^3 which would add a mass of about 130 billion solar masses from dark matter, still less than the mass of stars, but getting closer. The entire spherical volume that encompasses the edge of the Milky Way disk contains 3 quadrillion cubic light-years, the density of dark matter falls off as you get farther from the galactic center so there aren't 7 trillion solar masses worth of dark matter in the Milky Way's halo, but there is likely about half that, which vastly outweighs the visible matter in the thin disk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, the key word here is &quot;measurable&quot;.  Dark matter likely has some effect on planets, but a negligible one.</p>
<p>Dark matter is extremely diffuse, even when it is &quot;clumping&quot; into dark matter halos that are found around all galaxies.  This means that you are only likely to have a measurable effect on objects of galactic scale, which really begins with stars on up and their paths through the galaxy.  </p>
<p>Anything bound to a star's gravity, such as a planet or asteroid, is much, much more closely bound to the star than could be affected by the small amount of dark matter diffused in that relatively small volume of space.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
