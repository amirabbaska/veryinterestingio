		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the morning it's usually because you've been dehydrated due to sleep or if symptoms just arose, you aren't used to it. In the evening, because of being tired and talking all day, you get worn out. Just think of going to a sporting event all night yelling then getting home and having a sore throat. Wear and tear of everyday things just exaggerates your ailment.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I find it depends on what I have.</p>
<p>A Cold, Flu, I feel better in the morning worse as the day progresses.</p>
<p>Bacterial infections, I feel horrible in the morning and better as the day progresses.</p>
<p>If you routinely feel bleh in the morning, drink a big glass of water before sleeping.  You may be dehydrating since u are going 6+ hours without any water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
