		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is massive preprocessing in the retina. Signals from photoreceptors are sent to bipolar, horizontal, amacrine and ganglion cells. The ganglion cell projections ultimately form the optic nerve. There are ~130 million photoreceptors but only ~1 million ganglion cells (see discussion below). </p>
<p>Furthermore, the pooling is not uniform so that in some areas of the retina (the fovea), the mapping is close to one-to-one in terms of photoreceptor to ganglion cell ratio. In other areas it is 120-to-1 (the periphery). This means there is a higher resolution representation of the light that falls on your fovea than the surrounding area which is why we see in greater detail in the part of the world that we focus on. This means that a weaker signal is more likely to be detected in the periphery because it's getting pooled. That's part of the reason why it's easier to see dim stars out of the corner of your eye rather than looking right at them. This difference in how signals are pooled in different parts of your eye is reflected in the representation in primary visual cortex, with a lot more real estate devoted to representing the central area of your vision than the periphery. This is called <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cortical_magnification" target="_blank">cortical magnification</a>.      </p>
<p>edit: if interested, I have written about the organization of the eye <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/5499cl/can_brain_damage_alter_what_a_person_sees/d809uio/" target="_blank">elsewhere</a> with lots of pictures. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It can be reasonably argued that the eyes and their associated ganglia are part of the brain in a way that our other 8ish sensor systems are not. In both anatomical and functional descriptions it is difficult to draw a clear line between brain and eye.</p>
<p>This doesn't make the top answer any less correct, but I think it adds an interesting viewpoint to the original question.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a couple of main functions that the retina does. The first one is sharpening the image. Basically this means that we get larger input of the edges and color gradients than just plain surfaces. The second one is mapping the photoreceptive cells to relevant neural paths so that the fovea area gets the most of them. Like already answered by someone else, the peripheral cells get pooled to same neural paths. This is essentially a data reduction. </p>
<p>What the brain does with that data is a good question itself. We understand quite a lot about the workings of primary visual cortex but actually quite little about what happens before it. The signal goes trough a crossing called optic chiasm that divides the left side of the both retinas to one side of the brain and the right side to the other. After that there are lateral geniculate nucleus which has something to do with dividing the basic features like colors, edges of different directions and motions to their own neural paths. These basic features are then sent to the visual cortex. </p>
<p>So Basically the actual visual processing system of the brain does not get the image we see but rather a data decomposition where different edge directions and colors are mapped to some kind of representation of the visual field. The visual cortex levels then process the data progressively into more abstract form and associate it with memories and such.</p>
<p>I should also mention the superior colliculus which has something to do with controlling the automatic eye movements. And the data is taken out in multiple points for other automatic functions like attention control.</p>
<p>Edit: we actually did a course work once where we tried to see if images of dangerous animals cause different kind of responses on the visual path before V1 than non dangerous animals. But i cannot remember if we found anything. It was a course practice work so we did not have too much time with the fMRI scanner.</p>
<p>Edit2: If someone has done more work on the field i am interested in sensory integration with the visual data. Does for example eye-hand coordination processing happen before the visual cortex?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The eye doesn't have &quot;pixels&quot;. It's basically a large light-sensing surface (plus a lens and all the other gadgetry that lets it focus and pan). The visual cortex identifies patterns in the signals to recognize images and objects.</p>
<p>That's why you can recall an image in limited detail, but not zoom in on it; you can notice a tiny flash of light but overlook a car; you have more accurate vision near the front of your visual field than at the side, and a blind spot you don't even notice. Your visual system - like the rest of your brain - deals with vague patterns, not precise recordings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Thinking of preprocessing as &quot;reducing the number of pixels&quot; is not the right way to think about it. It's correct--there are 100 photoreceptors (where light is actually turned into electrochemical signals) for every output cell of the retina (retinal ganglion cells). However, while you are decreasing the total amount of information, you're processing that information so that the most useful bits are sent to the thalamus and then cortex. So your brain is not &quot;losing&quot; on 99% of the information in your retinas!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
