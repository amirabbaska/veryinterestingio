		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The body cools during non-rem (light) sleep, but rises during rem (deep) sleep. Overall though, your body temperature probably drops about 2° overall through the night.</p>
<p>Do you use blankets? It takes time for your both warmth to heat up the blankets and bed. It feels cool initially, while you're falling asleep, but overtime it warms up. Since your body is about 98.6°, your bed will eventually rise from ambient room temperature (~70°). As the temperature of your bed rises, so does the temperature of your body, since it is harder to lose heat. Your temperature keeps increasing until your body can't cool itself anymore by touching the sheets and mattress. After this, your body will sweat to cool itself down.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Likely just your normal body heat building up against whatever material you're sleeping on, but when I was in my medical classes I ended up finding out I had a blood disorder that was causing me to wake up pretty frequently covered in sweat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If we're talking about that couch specifically, are there materials that don't breath well that you are surrounding yourself in? Like snuggling down underneath the back cushions? Regardless of what temperature it is, your body has to perspire. If that fabric doesn't let that process happen easily, your body is going to find other ways to cool itself.  </p>
<p>I just say that because &quot;we&quot; don't get hotter when we sleep. I wake up after my wife has burritoed herself with the whole comforter and the blanket and I am <em>freezing.</em></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
