<p>These two would be more than enough for the immediate firing of that clerk.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a law against it, in the US at least.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Officers and employees of the Patent and Trademark Office shall be incapable, during the period of their appointments and for one year thereafter, of applying for a patent and of acquiring, directly or indirectly, except by inheritance or bequest, any patent or any right or interest in any patent, issued or to be issued by the Office. In patents applied for thereafter they shall not be entitled to any priority date earlier than one year after the termination of their appointment.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you register a patent, you are simply declaring when you developed the idea. The application that was rejected will still be recorded, and this will be enough proof that the actual registered patent came after the original.
The same principal applies with prior-art. Proving that a thing was a thing prior to the patent will invalidate the patent.
The big trick with patent trolls is that they make it expensive enough to fight the patent that simply paying is the cheaper option.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides the aforementioned rules against this, under most jursdictions, all patent applications get published after some time (usually 18 months), regardless of if they have been granted or not. At that point, they become prior art and no one can have the same patent (or a very similar one) granted ever again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
