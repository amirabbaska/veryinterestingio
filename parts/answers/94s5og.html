		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Its 3 things combined. Weight, malleability, gravity.</p>
<p>The wires themselves are heavy, and gravity is always trying to pull them down. In order to attempt to keep a wire stretched straight across you need to put on enough tension to over come gravitys attempts to pull it down, however all metals used for powerlines will stretch if enough tension is placed on them. </p>
<p>The amount of tension required to over come gravity is more then what the wires will tolerate before they can't hold themselves together anymore and snap.</p>
<p>Edit: as u/OVERHEAD1 points out below, there is also the issue of expansion and contraction due to temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A rope can only be loaded with tension and only along the length of the rope. In order for a horizontal rope to bear any weight (even its own weight) there has to be some vertical component (i.e. it has to go a bit downwards in order to pull up). </p>
<p>This diagram shows how much more force you need at the anchor points at a given angle:

<p>This is also a nice illustration:

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the real world, you can only approach a straight cable, but never actually reach it. You can think about it in terms of the ratio of the force pulling down (gravity) vs the force pulling sideways (tension). A straight cable would have a ratio of zero, that is, zero units down to one unit sideways, which would only be possible with a weightless cable or an unbreakable cable with infinite tension, neither of which can exist on earth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also the next thing is temperature. Cables that long expand and shorten quite a bit from lets say -20 to +40. Even if you'd have some sort or strong cable than usual it'd eventually either snap or get destroyed some other way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the amount of energy required for lifting the middle of a cable increases exponentially. It's not worth the extreme  amount of extra tension on the poles.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
