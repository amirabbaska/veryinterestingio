		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The heat is changing the density of the air, because heat makes things expand.  This in turn changes the refractive index of the air, and hence the direction through which light rays pass through the air.  The ripple, reflection-type illusion is the light rays refracting differently through the air.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Refraction, &quot;the fact or phenomenon of light, radio waves, etc., being deflected in passing obliquely through the interface between one medium and another or through a medium of varying density.&quot;(from Google definition)
More simply, convection(the cause for hot/less-dense things-like air-to rise, and cold/more-dense things to fall [again, google paraphrase for convection]) causes the hot air to rise, and the cold air to fall, making wavy patterns that distort the light passing through them.
Hope this helps some.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You're seeing the air itself expanding from the heat! Well, the light being bent by that expansion anyway.</p>
<p>This creates unevenness because air is a mixed-content gas in a dynamic system (it's all moving around in a much larger system).</p>
<p>So locally, you're essentially seeing refraction waves from the normal and more expanded, faster rising air.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Light gets refracted when it goes from one medium to another. Hot air has a different density than cold air, so when you see the &quot;waves&quot; you are seeing the refraction of light going from one density to another. The same as how a straw gets distorted in water.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The refraction index of air is a function of temperature. On a hot, sunny day the tarmac can heat up significantly, leading to temperature gradients in the air above it, which in turn lead to changes in the refractive index in the air above the road. These differences in the refractive index lead to lensing effects and similar distortions. Add some turbulence of the air to the mix and what you end up seeing is a sort of wavy, irregular pattern.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
