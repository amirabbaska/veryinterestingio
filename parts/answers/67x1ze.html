<p><a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/64404/why-do-we-pace-when-were-thinking" target="_blank">This mentalfloss article summarizes a lot of points on why we pace while we think, and I think it likely applies to while talking on the phone too.</a>
Studies have shown that people are better at thinking of creative solutions while pacing about.
Studies have shown that performing repetitive actions (like moving up and down in the same way) often has a destressing effect.</p>
<p>Another study talks about how pacing about may be a somewhat involuntary response to stress and anxiety.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
