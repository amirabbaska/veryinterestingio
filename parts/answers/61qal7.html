		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chances are, even if your girlfriend went in voluntarily, if she is placed on a hold, then she will be held involuntarily for 72 hours. If she readily admits to being a danger to herself or others, she will very likely be put on a hold and transferred to a facility for treatment. If she does not meet the criteria for a hold, she should be released, as far as I'm aware. I'm certain recommendations will be made for her to follow and resources will be made known to her.</p>
<p>You are correct, those 72 hours will not begin until she is given a Psych eval at the emergency room by whoever is on at that time. The Psychiatrist will write his recommendations, whether that is a hold or otherwise and she will be either released outright or released to a facility for processing and treatment.</p>
<p>This is a tough situation to be in, hang in there, both of you.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your question has been answered by several other people, but I just wanted to say I'm so sorry your girlfriend is having a hard time. I hope she gets some help, I found that the coping skills I learned there were not too bad. </p>
<p>Please make sure to take care of yourself, I'm sure this is hard on you. </p>
<p>Forewarning: When she gets out of the inpatient bubble, she will most likely have a little bit of a hard time readjusting to regular life. I found it to be super overwhelming to be in public. </p>
<p>If you have any questions, I'd be happy to answer them if I can, I was in a facility for 5 days and I went in on a Thursday night and got caught by the same hold. </p>
<p>Both of you are in my thoughts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Honestly, in my opinion it is much better for the patient because on weekends they are seen by hospitalists and not psych necessarily. It helps with the revolving door of suicidal people and hospitals trying to off load them.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm in another jurisdiction with different rules, so won't add anything to that. I just wanted to acknowledge that this is a tough time for you as well as your girlfriend, and I hope you are ok. </p>
<p>When she comes out, things won't be fixed and she's likely to need a lot of support then - so please take care of yourself over the next few days and get some rest.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can tell you it depends on the State, the Hospital and how 'busy' they are. If she went to the ER and said she has thoughts of hurting herself or others but DID NOT act on them but was still admitted to the psych unit she has to request a form of release. This takes 24-48 hrs from when it is submitted, signed by the patient and a Nurse Practitioner or Doctor. (There SHOULD always be a NP or Doctor on staff seeing patients 24/7 but again due to the location and lack of staffing this could be the following day or it seems in her case the following business day which is a large issue in the Mental Health Care field) You cannot be at risk of hurting yourself or others. If you are, the Hospital will put you on a 72 hour mandatory hold. This does unfortunately mean 72 hours from her medical and psychological exams. This is for the safety of the patient and society. Its like a cool down period where you are forced to think about any future bad decisions you are planning. Most of these start with you breaking the law and being brought in by police. If you are depressed or just losing your mind a little and need a time out from life to recoup, you are likely in the Psych Unit at will and learn to understand that staying for at least 72 hours will allow you to regulate your medication safely. Some people don't take medication but choose to take advantage of some helpful 'classes' during their stay. Depending on how busy the hospital is and how many people in the area are a high risk and need to be admitted they will be able to release highly stressed but non-dangerous individuals earlier than those looking to harm. Good Luck and hopefully she feels better when she's out!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
