If you look at <a href="http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/chart/reColor.jsp?newColor=qa" target="_blank">this chart</a>, it's got all of the nuclides listed by Z and N, and the color indicates the Q-value for alpha decay. This is the amount of energy released by an alpha decay. Any nuclide which have a positive alpha Q-value can in principle decay by alpha emission.</p>
<p>You can see that the vast majority of alpha decays happen in heavy nuclei, but if you look carefully at very light nuclei, like beryllium-8 for example, you see that they can decay by alpha.</p>
<p>If you consider what beryllium-8 is, it's basically just two alpha particles bound together. So it can split apart into two alpha particles. This could just as well be considered an alpha decay as a spontaneous fission, it's the same underlying process.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
