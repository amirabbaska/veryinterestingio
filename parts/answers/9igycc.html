		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have worked in a CRISPR lab for a couple years. We were trying to establish optimal protocol in an organism where that didnâ€™t exist yet. Our biggest issue was actually having HDR take place, and our solution was to simply keep injecting until we got a good enough number. I imagine injecting 100s of human embryos is outlandish, so my question is how have you optimized the chances for the repair pathway? Or at least how do you address this problem, if you have this problem.</p>
<p>Thanks! :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://www.verywellhealth.com/telomere-shortening-the-secret-to-aging-2224346" target="_blank">teleomere theory of aging</a> states that the decay of teleomeres at the ends of DNA strands is associated with, or a partial cause of, aging.</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Has there been any research into using CRISPR to repair or lengthen teleomeres?</p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Is there something structurally different about teleomeres (as opposed to the usual CRISPR targets) that would make this possibility unworkable?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
