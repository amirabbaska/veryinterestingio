		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Batteries are fundamentally limited by their chemical reactions/functions. A lithium ion physically exists and interacts with other molecules to provide or absorb electrons. It takes up space and weighs some amount. We can improve the tech of the battery to allow more of the useful chemical and fewer metal walls for example, but revolutionizing the battery requires a new chemistry entirely.</p>
<p>With computer chips, we make functional pieces smaller so the same chunk of silicon can hold more of them. But we haven't necessarily made the chunk of silicon cheaper or more power-efficient, we can just use a smaller one.</p>
<p>There is no similar analogy for batteries, what we want to do <em>is</em> to make it cheaper or more efficient for the same size. Something we've never been great at with other pieces of electronics either. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Battery technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in the last 20 years.</p>
<p>You just think it hasn't  encase the physical size is still same in cell phones. That's due to increased demand by the electrical components.</p>
<p>The capacity of those same size batteries are worlds appart. Every year the same size battery gains the capacity to store more and more electricity.</p>
<p>Cell phone manufacturers don't shrink the size of their batteries because the CPUs are demanding more and more electricity and battery life of a device is one of consumers primary concerns. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We know how to make electronic integrated circuits smaller and thus faster and better.  It's a series of improvements of various kinds in terms of optics, process, etc., but it's a continuum over decades.</p>
<p>Whereas, if we make batteries smaller, they are just smaller, and hold less energy.</p>
<p>We have to change the fundamental chemistry of batteries to make them hold more energy, and that process doesn't advance nearly as quickly.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Others are addressing this from a technological perspective so I will approach the economic angle.</p>
<p>The mainstream demand for improved battery technology really did not exist to the same extent as it does today.  Before miniaturisation and widespread adoption of pocket computers (mobile phones etc) batteries were simply good enough for most consumers.  The idea of a pocket pc was still in the realm of scifi for many. Batteries were for things like torches, cars, radios, toys etc and a few extra grams and a slightly bulkier form factor really wasn't a problem for these items.</p>
<p>Once consumers saw value in newer technologies and began to demand smaller, faster, longer lasting and more powerful mobile computing devices, battery technology quickly became a limitation and thus more heavily researched as having better battery tech would give a competitive edge to hi tech manufacturers.</p>
<p>Now that we have mainstream mass produced high density batteries, we are starting to find applications in a wide range of industries, for example electric vehicles which have become more viable as a result.</p>
<p>There was nothing stopping the research and advancement of battery technology sooner, it just wasn't a priority compared to other major research.</p>
<p>Parallel streams of technology often behave in this way, feeding into each other and moving in fits and bursts based on new discoveries and market forces.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has improved a lot faster than many people realize.</p>
<p>The problem is modern devices like smart phones are designed to last about 18 hours on a charge.  You plug them in overnight, use them during the day, then plug them in again at bedtime.  As battery life improves, new features, like bright screens, GPS, wireless, 4G, and GPS are squeezed into phone, bringing the life back down to 18 hours or so.</p>
<p>Old Nokia 3000 series phones got about 100 hours standby on a 500 maH battery, and that was with the old, power hungry AMPS anology signals.  You put a modern 3000+ maH battery in one of those, and you would be charging it once a month.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
