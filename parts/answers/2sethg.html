		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In short, what ultimately stops cell processes after death is lack of oxygen. Without oxygen ions to fix electrons on the cellular level, cells are unable to function or reproduce, and they begin to decay. </p>
<p>For some cells that require constant oxygen (such as neurons) this can happen almost immediately (within minutes) after death. For other cells that are not quite as oxygen thirsty (such as in the transplant organs) this can take between 30 or 60 minutes. Structural cells which require even less oxygen, such as in bone and connective tissue, can survive for around 24 hours after death before cell death occurs. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Loss of circulation (say, from cardiac arrest) leads to three main problems for the tissues: loss of oxygen, loss of supply of fuel molecules like glucose and fatty acids, and buildup of waste products. Some cells are more susceptible to major dysfunction due to these factors than others, primarily as a result of their metabolic needs. </p>
<p>Loss of oxygen and fuel results in a decline of the cellular ability to produce ATP, the small molecule that the cell uses for the majority of its energy needs.  Lack of ATP results in decreased function of the sodium-potassium pump that maintains the cellular ion balances resulting in water influx and swelling of the cell. Other active cellular processes that require ATP also begin to decline in function. Additionally, the local changes in the chemical environment including decreased pH from C02 and lactic acid build up can affect the membrane permeability. Other cellular changes include changes to the structure of the chromosomes/nucleus, detachment of ribosomes and mitochondria from the cytoskeleton. </p>
<p>Ultimately, either damage to the mitochondria releases a number of molecules that cause the cell to turn itself off (apoptosis), or the damage to the integrity of the cellular membrane(s) is so great that it ruptures, or small packets of digesting enzymes are released that chew up the cell. Either way, energy dependent cellular processes for the most part halt by that point. This can take minutes for brain neurons, which have very high energy requirements, to hours and almost days for say, cartilage cells, which do not require much energy at all. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Several types of tissue may survive considerably longer after circulatory arrest, and some bodily functions may persist for several hours after clinical death. A timeline:</p>
<ul>
<li>0 min: The heart comes to a rest, the blood does not flow any more, the body's cells start to die due to lack of oxygen and nutrients as well as accumulation of toxic metabolic products. Depending on their demand for energy, tissues perish slowly or rapidly. This stage between individual and complete death of all cells is called the intermediate phase.</li>
<li>6min: Irreparable brain damage due to a lack of oxygen. Neuronal tissue depends heavily on the full amount of energy only the oxygen-dependent metabolisation of glucose in the citric acid cycle and the respiratory chain can supply, while the oxygen-free glycolysis may provide only about a fifth of that energy. If the patient may be resuscitated after this point, severe brain damage is almost certain.</li>
<li>15min: Heart tissue starts to decay. Successful resuscitation after this point is not only becoming more and more unlikely with every minute, but the chance for further life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia due to decay of cardiac tissue (besides from the event that caused cardiac arrest in the first place) is quite high.</li>
<li>15min: In case that no resuscitation was started, by now, blood has followed gravity and pooled in vessels and tissue nearer to the ground, forming postmortem lividity that can realign and reshape for up to 12h, eventually staying in place.</li>
<li>30min: Perspiratory glands may still excrete sweat after injection of adrenalin.</li>
<li>2h: Kidneys survive until this point.</li>
<li>2h: Rigor mortis develops, causing the muscles to become stiff, reaching its full extent until about 6h after cardiac arrest.</li>
<li>8h: Rigor mortis may still develop after it was broken before.</li>
<li>15h: Pupils can still be dilated or contracted with drugs.</li>
<li>20h: Blows to the muscles may still cause electrical discharge, resulting in reactive contractions.</li>
<li>30h: Bone and cartilage tissue dies.</li>
<li>36h: Sperms can still be gathered for following deep-freezing and later artificial fertilisation.</li>
<li>48h: Gut bacteria multiply rapidly, eventually breaching through the intestinal walls. Putrefaction develops in the abdomen, soon spreading throughout the body.</li>
<li>48-72h: Rigor mortis decreases, limbs become limp again.</li>
<li>72h: Corneal tissue can still be gathered for transplantation. Since the cornea has no blood vessels and survives only on the nutrients it receives through diffusion and the oxygen from the air, this tissue survives the longest.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note that most of these points in time vary heavily depending on many aspects such as ambient temperature, humidity, cause of death, health of the particular tissues before death etc. The given numbers represent ideal or near-to-ideal circumstances in terms of a slow decay without any considerable cooling.</em></p>
<p>EDIT: Sperms are viable for up to 36h, not 72h as previously stated.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first thing to happen is the cells continue to excrete carbon dioxide, it has no were to go so it builds up until the pockets in the cells rupture, releasing enzymes that start to break down cells from the inside out, after the cells have been broken down a whole army of different bacteria begin to feed on this..the last of the food chain is the worst, maggots and beetles eat the remains, all that is left is bone and not all the bone, protein in the bone is broken down and after a long time even the bone turns to a fertile dust, ashes to ashes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Adding to what others said, there is a myth that fingernails and hair continue to grow after death. What actually happens is that decaying and dehydrating skin actually retracts, leaving the fingernails and hair stubble to become more prominent, giving the illusion of growth.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
