<p>Yes. </p>

<p>If so, it seems kind of a waste of money</p>

<p>Why do you think that?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>is there some way to use the plasma to generate electricity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The best way is plasma to heat to steam to rotation to electricity. Modern power cycles operate close to the Carnot efficiency. It literally doesn't get any better than steam, especially for large-scale systems like a power plant. These aren't the steam engines of the 1800s, they're highly advanced, modern machinery. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a form of fusion that produces charged particles with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aneutronic_fusion" target="_blank">very few or no neutrons</a>. With reactions like that, we could have direct conversion to electricity, without generating heat.</p>
<p>However, since we haven't yet been able to create practical fusion reactions producing neutrons, the more difficult aneutronic reactions will have to wait, I guess. For now, the struggle is to create <em>any</em> form of practical commercial fusion power, which would use steam turbines to generate electricity.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of people seem to be missing the point in this thread so I'll answer. I'm currently a grad student at a Plasma Physics Lab but admittedly I'm only just finishing my first year so perhaps I'm not the most knowledgeable. </p>
<p>The reason everyone hypes up fusion energy is because of how incredibly cheap and clean it would be if it actually worked. The main fuels for fusion reactors (or at least the main ones being studied/constructed such as ITER, NSTX-U, Wendelstein etc.) are deuterium and/or tritium. This is just heavy hydrogen isotopes. You could potentially get this by simply filtering sea water, taking the heavy H2O molecules, and using hydrolysis to get the heavy hydrogen.</p>
<p>So imagine this: we have working fusion reactors and you can get the fuel by just looking through tons of sea water. Energy suddenly becomes super cheap, clean, and nearly infinite! Not to mention fusion reactors don't use the same fuel as nuclear weaponry. Current fission reactors cause a lot of hullabaloo in the media since they require fissile material which is also used for nukes (this was the main controversy that caused the Iran Deal). Thus fusion reactors are a HUGE step forward in nuclear disarmament. Not to mention once we get working fusion reactors there are offshoots like helium 3 reactors to power advanced thruster systems that are currently being developed.</p>
<p>In summary, the issue in energy production has never been that steam is too primitive. The issue is that the materials used to create the steam have their own problems. Fossil fuels create carbon pollution and fission plants create nuclear waste and can be used as a front for nuclear weapon production. Fusion would ideally have neither of these problems and be very cheap to operate. Of course now we just have to actually do it. Which is the hard part.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The conventional idea is to use heat in the &quot;blanket&quot; to heat steam and turn a turbine.  The blanket is a roughly 1 m thick layer of something that absorbs neutrons from the deuterium tritium reaction.  The neutrons carry 4/5th of the energy of the fusion reaction, so it's very necessary to capture that for electricity production.  Typically, the blanket is envisioned as consisting of a mixture of lead and lithium.  Lead helps shield the rest of the reactor from these high energy neutrons, and slows them down and multiplies them so that the lithium can breed tritium for use in future reactors.  The blanket will be cooled by water in a heat exchanger, which then goes to a turbine for electricity generation.</p>
<p>A less conventional idea is to use direct conversion of charged particles to electricity.  I don't know a lot about this, but the main idea is to take exhaust from something like a linear machine (like Tri-Alpha's) and collect the charge.  I'm not sure this has really ever been done yet, but it might be able to create higher efficiencies in the end.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
