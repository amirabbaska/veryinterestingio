		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the early days of the automobile manufacturers did sell directly to the consumer.  Then automobile sales began to boom.  Manufacturers didn't have the capital to create enough dealerships to sell all their cars in every city across the nation so they franchised out to dealerships.  This helped car manufacturers reach consumers fast and get into areas where it wasn't feasible to just sell their cars.  They could franchise their brands to dealers who sold competitor brands.  This allowed continual rapid growth for sales while keeping capital to a minimum.</p>
<p>These franchises feared automotive companies would be able to undercut them if they ever decided to build their own dealerships.  So they successfully lobbied politicians to create laws prohibiting direct sales.  This was done with the belief these laws would protect the small franchises from the large corporations and the belief that dealerships created local jobs.  There was also the belief that dealerships created a more personal experience and lowered prices by creating more competition.  These dealerships also banded together into networks and fought against OEM's if they tried to create their own dealerships.  Not all states outlaw direct sales, and the Big 3 in the past have tried to sell direct in those states.  Yet their own massive independent dealer network would freak out whenever it happened and would threaten to disrupt sales across the country.  So even in states where it's not illegal to sell direct the major manufacturers still sell through dealerships due to threats from other dealers if they don't.</p>
<p>Of course opponents to these regulations see dealerships as nothing more than useless middlemen, especially in an age with so much information available to the consumer.  Why shouldn't cars be sold like most products?  A person can go to an Apple store or Best Buy to get a new Macbook.  Heck, they could buy one from the comfort of their own home by buying one online directly from Apple or an Apple dealer.  Why can't a person do that with a car?  If dealerships truly lowered prices then they have nothing to fear.  These laws appear to be useless regulations that provide little benefit to the consumer while adding costs to the process of buying and owning an automobile.  Why not let the consumer decide what they value instead of being told how to buy a car?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I live in Germany. There are of course many dealerships, but the big German car makers (BMW, Mercedes, Audi, VW, Opel, Porsche, ...) also run 'branch offices' in many big cities where they sell directly. They use the same list pricing (and possible discounts) like their official dealerships, and when you think of the branch office being run like a dealership, bottom line will make the same margins as the dealers, basically. Of course the branche's profits go directly into the car manufacturer's profit, which benefits the car maker, not an independent dealer. So they basically control the supply chain from making the car, marketing, distribution etc. down to the sales the consumers, plus they run aftermarket and service facilities in their branches, too. </p>
<p>As another option you can order your car directly with the branch, and then even pick it up at the factory. You can go e.g. to the Volkswagen 'Autostadt' (=car city) in Wolfsburg, or BMW in Munich to pick up your shiny new treasure, VW makes a big show out of that by supplying it with a bouquet of flowers from an automated glass storage tower, your can stay even in the Ritz Carlton there and visit their museums and car shows for one or two days, against a fee of course. But you will save the fee of 'transfer from factory' of a 500-100 usd you would be charged when picking it up at the dealer or branch. <a href="https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aB5dh1WbQMs" target="_blank">https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aB5dh1WbQMs</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's been like this for a long time, originally car manufacturers didn't have the resources to sell their vehicles everywhere so letting 3rd party dealers do so in exchange for them making some profit off of it was a good deal historically. Now of course the various car companies are big enough they could that there are laws in place to protect the dealers from competition from the manufacturer who could undercut them. </p>
<p>There are some exceptions, Tesla do not sell via dealers. You can only buy new cars from them directly. Even if you order in store all they actually do is have you place the order on their website using a kiosk rather than anything in store mattering. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
