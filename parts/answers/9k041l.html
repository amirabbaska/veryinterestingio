		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>ADHD is a misnamed syndrome - it’s much more helpful to think of it not as an Attention Deficit, but as an Executive Functioning Deficit. </p>
<p>Think of Executive Functioning as the brain’s boss. It needs the most energy and resources in order to focus everyone else and tell them what to do. </p>
<p>In an ADHD brain, the boss doesn’t have the resources they need, so they can’t tell their employees what to do. Employees dedicate their time to unimportant projects, waste energy on unimportant tasks, have trouble starting essential projects, etc. They spend too much energy on very visible output and not enough on day-to-day operations. </p>
<p>In an ADHD brain, stimulants stimulate <em>the boss</em>. Suddenly, the boss comes online and can tell everyone where to go and what to do. The energy in the brain goes towards a lot of invisible but essential tasks - working memory, emotional regulation, self-activation - instead of being shunted towards the nearest possible output. </p>
<p>The stimulant is working, but it’s working on less-visible tasks. </p>
<p>A more helpful analogy might be a classroom. Imagine two classrooms - one where the teacher is asleep and the kids are running around crazy, and another where the teacher is awake and the kids are working quietly. In the second classroom, everyone is using more energy - <em>working harder</em> - even though they are not making as much noise. This is the ADHD brain on stimulants. </p>
<p>Edit: I can’t respond to everyone individually but I hope everyone who is having a realization about themselves is getting the help they need and parents/friends/family are getting a better understanding. It took me until my thirties to even START to address my ADHD and it caused a huge gulf between my potential and my reality. It still hurts a lot and it’s a struggle but I feel like if I can pass that on, it’s worth it. Take care of yourselves. </p>
<p>Edit 2: since so many people are asking about meds I’m posting this here again:</p>
<p>I’m definitely a little bit of a different person on meds. But that different person helps me build a much better life for myself. My gf likes unmedicated me more than medicated me, but she also likes me to be successful and confident and competent, so she gets it. It’s usually recommended that you not take meds when you don’t need to - weekends, vacations, light work stretches, etc. </p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to experiment. Brain medications are scary and weird but usually worth it. You may not get the right combo at first, don’t be discouraged. And sometimes you have to learn to adjust. For me I learned that I HAVE to eat a healthily high-fat breakfast and then throughout the day to avoid Ritalin jitters. </p>
<p>Also: meds don’t magically solve your problems, they just make you better equipped. I’m still capable of spending all day on meaningless tasks when I’m on meds. The only difference is that off-meds it doesn’t feel like I have a choice or awareness; on-meds I have some semblance of control over my path. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As the issues with ADHD are caused by a deficiency of dopamine, they increase availability  of dopmaine. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) inhibits dopamine reuptake and amphetamines (Adderall) increases dopamine production.</p>
<p>The aim is to create a higher baseline of dopamine so concentration and other stuff demanding the frontal lobe becomes easier.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine your brain is the fertile basin of a drought-stricken river. You need to provide more water to sustain the crops grown in the area, and you come up with two solutions. You can A: dam the river at some point, creating a reservoir or B: divert some other water sources into the river to increase the flow.</p>
<p>Option A is like methylphenidate and option B is like amphetamine.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of the ADHD brain like a dry sponge: a dry sponge needs more water to function properly than one that’s already been wetted. This is kind of the case with ADHD and the brain, with dopamine—a chemical our brain cells use to communicate—as the water. A neurotypical brain is like a wetted sponge, and the ADHD brain is like a dry sponge—needing more dopamine for the neurons to communicate properly. The ADHD brain is constantly under-stimulated due to this lack of dopamine, causing people with ADHD’s brains to seek out activities that cause the brain to release dopamine—this results in many of ADHD’s symptoms. Stimulant medications—like Adderall—cause the brain to release more dopamine (Ritalin actually prevents the reabsorption of dopamine by neurons—akin in the sponge analogy to preventing water evaporating) so that the neurons do not need as much of the chemical to work properly and the brain functions more similarly to a neurotypical brain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL;DR Lots of ADHD symptoms are caused by lack of dopamine, CNS stimulants put more of it in the brain and make it stay there. </p>
<p>So it sounds like what you wanna know is what's called the mechanism of action if memory serves me right. I forget the exact receptors it acts on, but the basics of how it works goes like this. Your brain uses a plethora of neurotransmitters to accomplish all of sorts things. A large of one these is dopamine, which is the primary &quot;reward&quot; chemical. CNS stimulants increase the amount of this chemical present in synaptic terminals, by releasing more of it and preventing it from being re-absorbed by the pre-synaptic neuron.(the one that release it.)</p>
<p>So a normal brain would be working toward a goal, literally anything, and assign a value to it. Lets take studying for a test. You know if study, you'll do well, get a better grade, and feel good for doing so. So the brain goes &quot;hey, we're gonna get a future reward, lets get some dopamine going so we can get even more later.&quot; This works with most anything. </p>
<p>If you have ADHD, your brain does not do this. Instead, it goes &quot;I'm not getting an immediate reward outta this so I'm not gonna release dopamine to help increase focus and motivation to complete a task&quot;. It's like your brain lacks the foresight to see the reward at the end of a task, or just doesn't care. This contributes to some of the major symptoms of ADHD. Impulse control, lack of focus, procrastination, and some other things I'm sure. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
