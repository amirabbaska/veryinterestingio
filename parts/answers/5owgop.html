		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As for how, the general consensus is that he learned at least some of the language somewhere, and that it took off from there. There are multiple cases dealing with brain injuries that deal with complete changes in personality and sometimes complete changes in language, so an alter ( alternative personality) knowing a different language isn't completely impossible. How Regan knew Serbian while Billy didn't? It's the same as why you might know English better than someone else. Regan is technically a completely different person. So he may think and speak in Serbian as his first language and English had secondary. You have to understand that the question isn't really why Billy can speak Serbian, it's where did Regan learn Serbian from. It wouldn't have to be a lot, just enough for Billy's brain to learn more. </p>
<p>Example: You know the French word for dog and door. You see a dog walk through a doorway. Someone says in French &quot;the dog walked through the door&quot;, you can figure out which word means &quot;walked&quot;. Now you know the French word for &quot;walked&quot;. </p>
<p>The brain is capable of amazing things. Absorbing a language isn't that hard for a brain wired to do so. That's why there are some people who can learn and speak in multiple languages easily, while someone else under the same circumstances, with the same opportunities, may not be able to learn a second language to save their life. Once the Regan personality fully developed he probably just went and interacted with Serbian people and media, which expanded his vocabulary.</p>
<p>As to how he can be stronger while still only possessing the qualities of Billy's body, that deals with Regan's mindset. </p>
<p>Have you ever seen people psych themselves up before lifting a heavy weight? Or someone else is yelling at them to &quot;get mad at it&quot;? People tend to exert more force when they're angry, even if you discount adrenaline as a factor. People tend to be stronger than they know, but without proper motivation or the proper mind set, they don't exert their full capability. </p>
<p>With Regan being the angriest personality (he was referred to as the &quot;keeper of hate&quot;) he would be more likely to put more effort behind something than Billy would. Therefore he'd be utilizing more of their body's capability (basically putting more &quot;umph&quot; into it) than Billy would.</p>
<p>In other cases, it comes down to the simple fact that the brain is the epicenter of DPD, and the brain tells everything else what to do. It could simply be that Billy's brain is convincing his personality that he's weak. He goes to pick up something, and he can't because his brain tells his muscles that they can't handle the weight, while it tells Regan's personality that they can. </p>
<p>When dealing with the traits of different personalities, outside of obvious answers, you start getting into unsolved neuroscience. Unlocking the brains full potential. If someone could figure out and reproduce how Regan learned Serbian without Billy really trying, they could make a whole lot of money selling that ability to people. There are cases of a personality having a disease that the others didn't. Why? Because no matter what condition your liver/kidneys/lungs/whatever are in, if your brain convinces them that they're not working, then they'll stop working. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you talk about DID, it's important to remember that <strong>there is no objective, empirical way to measure or evaluate claims of DID</strong>. In fact, there isn't even a universally accepted definition of the disorder. There is no measurable biological information that one would expect to observe with imaging like fMRI. It's just...what someone says is happening to them.</p>
<p>The leading theory is that trauma or stress causes dissociation and you &quot;forget&quot; about connections, which allows you to create separate identities. Say you have three groups of traits. Normally, you see yourself as the whole of the three. It's theorized that some people who dissociate lose whatever ties bind those that group together, leaving three separate groups of traits that appear as three separate identities. But <strong>there is no study that has ever demonstrated this mechanism</strong>.</p>
<p>Another theory is that alter identities are actually hallucinations, and one is experiencing psychosis not DID.</p>
<p>Now, dissociation as derealizing or depersonalization are well-studied reactions to stress, anxiety, trauma, etc. But they don't make people forget who they are.</p>
<p>With the Billy Milligan case specific, not criminally responsible is a <em>legal opinion</em>, not a medical diagnosis.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
