		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine you have all the words of a language (and their meaning) written on paper, sorted in front of you alphabetically - Im russian, so lets say its russian words. First stack has all russian words that begin with &quot;A&quot;, second stack all words that begin with &quot;Б&quot; (russian B), etc.</p>
<p>Now lets say someone tells you the russian word &quot;магазин&quot;. You know it starts on M, so your brain checks the M stack until it finds the word, and translates it to &quot;Shop&quot;.</p>
<p>But imagine you are shown a picture of a dog, and asked to translate it to russian. You still have all these sorted stacks in front of you, but that doesn't help you in any way. You could translate a word if it was given to you, but you can't just &quot;find&quot; the word you need to speak it.</p>
<p>Also, when you're &quot;understanding&quot; the language, you're usually understanding the meaning, not the word-to-word translation. So if someone tells you &quot;XXXXXX CLEAN ROOM XXX XXXXX NOW XXXXXX ANGRY&quot;, you can figure out that they want you to clean up your room asap. But when you try to say it yourself, you can;'t just &quot;make up&quot; the words or grammatic structures that you don't know, and thus you struggle to speak in that language.</p>
<p>This is obviously a gross oversimplification, but if gives you the right idea. Its much easier to recall a word to translate it than to remember what the word is for what you're trying to say - so if you dont use a language actively, you will struggle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eli5 version: </p>
<p>Recognizing something is muuuuch easier than reproducing it.</p>
<p>Example: </p>
<p>Can you recognize a map of the USA? Easy.</p>
<p>Can you draw a map of the USA? Probably not accurately.</p>
<p>So when your friend hears Polish he recognizes the words and meanings, but trying to think of the word on his own is hard and takes time.</p>
<p>This is just my take on it. I speak 4 languages and two of them I understand fine, but cannot reply to at the same level.</p>
<p>EDIT - Bonus comment:</p>
<p>When learning a new language, the opposite often occurs for a short while where you can speak more than you understand. This is because when you learn a word or phrase, you learn it phonetically or grammatically and you overpronounce it compared to native speakers. So the way you say a word sounds different to how it's said naturally or in native accents...meaning you often don't recognize the same word being used by other people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Oh hey, this sorta applies to me. I used to be fluent in French but after a decade or so of never using it I can barely speak it, but I understand it fine. If I try I can normally get my point across, but words come very slowly if they come at all, so while I can order food or something I can't hold a conversation. I was recently with some french speakers and while I could understand everything they were saying, by the time I could figure out how to reply to something someone said the conversation had moved on. To add to it, I'm constantly second guessing myself on word choice and grammar.</p>
<p>Your friend likely has something similar in that if he took the time and really tried he'd be able to say what he means but because he never does his brain isn't used to thinking in that way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While, overall, &quot;language&quot; is handled in a fairly specialized region of the brain, hearing and speaking are handled separately.</p>
<p>If you don't actually practice speaking, you won't develop the necessary skills to actually speak a language.</p>
<p>Think about juggling.  I can describe to you, exactly, how to juggle and you can understand it completely but, until you practice and develop the specific chunks of motor neurons necessary, you won't be able to juggle.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is just an anecdote, but I know a lot of Spanish words so when someone says a sentence in Spanish I can usually understand it through use of context. However, I was never formally taught how to speak Spanish, so I can't conjugate verbs or string together a sentence that makes much sense. I speak Spanish like a three year old child. Sure, I can say things like &quot;Give me that sandwich&quot; but I can't communicate on an adult level.</p>
<p>Edit: If someone says the word &quot;cerveza&quot; I instantly know it means &quot;beer&quot;. However, if I try to speak Spanish then I have to spend a few seconds searching my brain to find the right translation for every single word I am saying. It's too slow to communicate effectively.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
