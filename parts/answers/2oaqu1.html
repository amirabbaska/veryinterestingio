		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Since there's some wrong information in this thread, here's from the <a href="http://www.fsis.usda.gov/wps/portal/fsis/topics/food-safety-education/get-answers/food-safety-fact-sheets/safe-food-handling/molds-on-food-are-they-dangerous_/" target="_blank">USDAs</a> website. (Formating may be a problem but I'll try)</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Hard cheese</strong>
(not cheese where mold is part of the processing)</p>
<p>Handling: Use. Cut off at least 1 inch around and below the mold spot (keep the knife out of the mold itself so it will not cross-contaminate other parts of the cheese). After trimming off the mold, re-cover the cheese in fresh wrap.</p>
<p>Reason:Mold generally cannot penetrate deep into the product.</p>
<p><strong>Cheese made with mold</strong>
(such as Roquefort, blue, Gorgonzola, Stilton, Brie, Camembert)</p>
<p>Handling: Discard soft cheeses such as Brie and Camembert if they contain molds that are not a part of the manufacturing process. If surface mold is on hard cheeses such as Gorgonzola and Stilton, cut off mold at least 1 inch around and below the mold spot and handle like hard cheese (above).</p>
<p>Reason:Molds that are not a part of the manufacturing process can be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Soft cheese</strong>
(such as cottage, cream cheese, Neufchatel, chevre, Bel Paese, etc.) Crumbled, shredded, and sliced cheeses (all types)</p>
<p>Handling: Discard</p>
<p>Reason: Foods with high moisture content can be contaminated below the surface. Shredded, sliced, or crumbled cheese can be contaminated by the cutting instrument. Moldy soft cheese can also have bacteria growing along with the mold.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Dairy microbiologist here. Cheeses than can be aged and not mold are generally much lower in moisture and usually have a shell or rind the prevents mold grow. Once they cut up the aged cheese for sale it has lost the protection of its shell or rind. Your moldy fridge cheese and those aged cheeses both have mold in them, only on your cheese the mold can grow due to available water on the freshly exposed surface. Air is also the problem, cheese should be stored airtight as mold requires oxygen to grow.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey I make my living making cheese, and pack it up. Here is WHY.
First off, even a piece of cheese that has aged 4 weeks can develope mould, but it is cleaned (cut off) before packing it. The older the cheese is, the worse it generally looks when it has to be prepped for sale. But we clean em up, we re apply the wax on it (called Parafin(e), and then in the packaging, it isnt just air in those vacuum bags. Its a gas, that is ment to stop the micro organisms from developing. So as soon as you OPEN it, it will &quot;revive&quot; and start aging, maybe creating mould, or it will sweat. Ever seen a sticky yellow-ish licquid in the cheese box? That is just water from the cheese. So it is ALL down to the micro organisms start to react with oxygen, when its open from its sealed bag.
Ill give you a little tip: IF your cheese in the fridge gets a spot or 2 of mould on it, take it out of its bag, take a small knife, or cheese slice cutter, cut the moulden part off, put the cheese in a new plastic bag, and it is as good as it even was. Saves you some money, not having to throw it out. Little insider knowledge here.
And yes, your fridge has far from the optimal temps, humidity, for optimal cheese storage. And it is lying next to other types of food, which in the food industry is a SERIOUSLY BIG NO, FUCKING NO.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related -- if you want to keep your cheese from going moldy too fast, don't store it in plastic wrap. Humidity contributes to mold growth and you want to manage that as best you can; there's special cheese paper you can get if you're fancy, but I've found that wrapping it in parchment and then following that up with a loose wrap of aluminum foil keeps it fresh and mold-free for a lot longer than plastic wrap, which is typically good enough for me. (I eat cheese quickly.)</p>
