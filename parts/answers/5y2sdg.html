		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your magnifying glass is bigger than your solar panel you will get more power. The lens would collect over a larger area than what the panel is able to do on its own.</p>
<p>However there is a couple of things to consider. First the solar panels efficiency drops with temperature. So usually a 2m^2 panel would produce more power than a 2m^2 lens focusing light on a smaller panel. Moreover panels have a maximum operating temperature before the semi-conductor stops to work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, you need a magnifying glass larger than the panel to focus more light onto it and make it more effective. However, there's another way to make it more effective: Blu-Ray discs.</p>
