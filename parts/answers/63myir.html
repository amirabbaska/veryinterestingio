		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Surnames used to not be a thing. People had given names and their surname was descriptive. If it wasn't what they did for a living (i.e, smith, thatcher, cooper) it a reference to their lineage. Someone might introduce themselves as David, son of Douglas, son of Brian. This was the Irish tradition and O' meant &quot;grandson of&quot; while Mac meant &quot;son of&quot;. So David would be David MacDouglas or David O'Brian. However, David's son William would be William MacDavid or William O'Douglas. At some point where surnames had to be preserved to record family relationships for inheritance and the like, the name &quot;froze&quot; at that point and was adopted as a static surname for future generations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most surname prefixes mean either &quot;son of&quot; (e.g. Arabic <em>bin</em>) or &quot;from&quot; (e.g. German <em>von</em>). </p>
<p>Something I found interesting: historically, in a number of cultures, these were only used by nobility, presumably because if you were a commoner, no one gave a shit who your dad was or where you came from.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
