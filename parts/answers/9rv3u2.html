		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Matter that is heated expands, causing its density to decrease. Due to gravity heated (less dense) matter rises above cooler matter. With flames you see that typical shape because the heated air causes convection currents that pull the flame along. It doesn't always happen this way though - flames with pressure behind them like from a gas soldering torch will keep going in the direction the gas was emitted, and flames in zero-gravity will form balls.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As has been explained already. Lower density due to hot gases expanding, so less gravitational pull experienced than all the air around, so it burns upwards. </p>
<p>Unless you have a gas-burner, where you can speed up the gas to be fast enough to go against that upwards trend. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gravity, actually. </p>
<p>Flames heat the reactants very hot. According to the gas laws, hot gases expand, making them less dense, and they rise. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of the answers here are talking about hot and less dense air rising but don't really talk about the mechanism by which the air rises.  There isn't anything special about low density that would cause it to magically ignore and contradict its gravitational attraction.  If you were to heat all of the air equally, none of it would move.  </p>
<p>What is missing from these explanations is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion" target="_blank">diffusion.</a>  Air flows from areas of high density to areas of low density.  When the air in fire heats up, it expands, becoming less dense.  The cool air around it is still at the same high density that it was before, so it flows from the cool, high density area into the hot, low density area.  Due to a slight density gradient caused by gravity, it will come in more strongly from below and from the sides.  When the cool air enters the space of the hot air, it will push the hot air out of the way.  Since it pushes hardest from the bottom, it will push the hot air up.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
