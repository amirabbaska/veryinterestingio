		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Glottal blocking so that nose breathing is easier. If your tongue rested without touching the roof of your mouth it would not seal your mouth and it could allow air to be pulled in between your lips, or saliva to be inhaled. </p>
<p>Try this little experiment. Open your mouth and don't allow your tongue to touch the roof of your mouth or close your throat. What I mean is with our mouth open if we make a &quot;guh&quot; shape with our tongue like saying the letter G (which seals our glotis) most people (some say they can. Who am I to argue lol) will be unable to breath in through their nose at all. This is because there is less resistance inhaling through the mouth. If you start closing your mouth or allow your lips to come together a little to create more restriction, then it will start to come in through the nose more. But wide open mouth and wide open tongue/throat you cannot breath in through your nose. </p>
<p>The usual resting position of the tongue is low in the back and curving slightly at the tip lightly touching the back of the hard palate in the roof of your mouth just behind the front teeth (usually not touching the front teeth at all) Although people of different native languages sometimes have slightly different resting positions for the tongue depending on the sounds they use with the tongue more forward or more back in the mouth. This may affect a comfortable resting position that is not always the same in different people. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just another voice of the bottom-tonguers. Yeah you read that right. </p>
<p>Seriously tho, my tongue rests on the bottom of my mouth as well. I do have sinus issues, and so I've breathed primarily through my mouth for most of my life, so that might play a part, but I know plenty of people who rest their tongues at the bottom.</p>
<p>Case in point: there are certain qi gong and yoga practices that require the practitioner to place their tongue on the roof of their mouth, and it's not just taken for granted, it's really emphasized that people need to put their tongues there. If most people already had their tongues there, it wouldn't really need to be mentioned.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mine actually rests near the bottom and pushed against my teeth. I didn't realize I was doing things differently until a dentist told me the gap between my front teeth couldn't really be fixed unless I changed where my tongue rests. I would end up slowly pushing my teeth out until there was a gap again. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
