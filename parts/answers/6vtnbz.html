		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Opinions range on this from catastrophic collapse to practically no effect at all. Ecologically, one of their most important functions might actually be the control of other populations through the transmission of vector-borne diseases. They might limit populations from exceeding their carrying capacity in the same way, for example, an owl population might limit an increasing hare population. </p>
<p>There's a very interesting RadioLab <a href="http://www.radiolab.org/story/kill-em-all/" target="_blank">episode</a> where the discuss this exact question. I would also recommend <a href="https://www.nature.com/news/2010/100721/full/466432a.html" target="_blank">this</a> nature article where they discuss the total eradication of mosquitoes. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I see this question pop up in this subreddit all the time. Here is my answer from the last time:</p>
<p>People often cite that article that was floating around recently (which I have many issues with). My answer is going to be a bit more theoretical, but frankly much of the data we need to test these hypotheses do not exist. Models have shown that simply deleting a species from its corresponding ecological network has the potential to be devastating through <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1461-0248.2002.00354.x/full" target="_blank">cascading secondary extinctions</a>, that are often difficult to predict. Moreover, indirect effects among species in a food web are notoriously <a href="http://woottonlab.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/98LaskaWoottonsmall.pdf" target="_blank">tough to detect empirically or anticipate theoretically</a>. To throw in another wrench, we're just recently beginning to complicate this already complicated problem by documenting and modeling the numerous (and dynamically important) <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1890/13-1424.1/full" target="_blank">non-trophic interactions in ecosystems</a>. For these reasons, most sensible ecologists would never advocate driving anything to global extinction -- ecological systems are too complex and ecologists still <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=stability+complexity+ecology&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholart&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiZ_o7plr3OAhUL6GMKHS2uBsAQgQMIGjAA" target="_blank">do not understand how they remain stable in the face of perturbations</a>, and we cannot at this time hope to make statements like &quot;it'll probably be okay,&quot; as in that article cited below.</p>
<p>/u/RIKHAL below says</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although some animals eat mosquitos, they have other alternatives. Some changes in the ecosystem will occur but it will 100% not be devastating.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just because predators of mosquitos have alternate resources does not mean that their removal couldn't <em>potentially</em> be devastating. We've known that simply rewiring an ecological network can cause it to collapse in the face of perturbations for <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=BDA5-ipCLt4C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=stability+complexity+ecology&amp;ots=-vp7yLMor5&amp;sig=SLKOaFf1ejPjMQG268_ygKkvu2A#v=onepage&amp;q=stability%20complexity%20ecology&amp;f=false" target="_blank">many decades now</a>. Although May's monograph (the aforementioned link) makes assumptions that are violated by virtually all natural systems, it still demonstrates that simply rearranging the flows of energy in an ecosystem have very complex and difficult-to-predict dynamical consequences for all populations in the food web. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v395/n6704/abs/395794a0.html" target="_blank">More recent and biologically realistic models</a> demonstrate that simply changing the distributions of interspecific interaction strengths or energy flows (a phenomenon that would certainly accompany mosquito extinctions) is enough to drive a system to collapse.</p>
<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v437/n7060/full/nature03962.html" target="_blank">evidence of cross-ecosystem trophic cascades</a> mean that organisms (like the mosquito) that spend part of their time in aquatic habitats and the rest in terrestrial ones, introduce a critical spatial component to this problem as well. Larval mosquito emergence from freshwaters to land represents a massive cross-ecosystem flux of biomass that impacts everything from terrestrial predators to vegetation, and composition of the primary producer communities. Sure, we could have more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chironomidae" target="_blank">Chironomids</a> or something, and everything could functionally remain intact, but the consequences of such a major shift in species composition that would certainly accompany mosquito extinction is simply too difficult to predict.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We really don't know what would happen if they were completely eliminated. </p>
<p>And it's ironic; arguably <em>desireable</em> species like the passenger pigeon and (almost) the American bison can be eliminated.  While *undesireable&quot; species like Japanese Carp, Kudzu and feral hogs proliferate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Why the hell haven't Bed Bugs been extincted yet??? They can't fly, they don't hide well, yet somehow they have outlived their rumored extinction and have gotten worse than ever before. </p>
<p>I recently moved to Toronto, which has been great outside of the fact that these pests happen to be in my appt. I haven't had a quality sleep in months and would gladly spare the mosquitos, who I know are only outdoors, to obliterate all things bed bug related. </p>
