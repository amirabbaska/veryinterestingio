		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are able to exclusively hire people of one ethnicity because of a loophole called most qualified; if they are actually trying to discriminate based on race. The only ethnic restaurant, I personally know, that tried to racially discriminate hires had a language requirement. It was a language which one only learns if they're from that ethnicity.</p>
<p>The realistic reason is because of how they hire. Most ethnic restaurants hire through networks they have and in most cases the owners are immigrants. Their networks are typically limited to only their ethnic group which results in their staff being primarily whatever their network is made of. In addition, they often hire family members which also happen to be homogeneous in the ethnic spectrum. It's not like most owners are actively trying to discriminate but rather their methods of hiring has a side effect of discriminating. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many restaurants, particularly ethnic restaurants, are family run. The people who work there are related to or are friends with the owners, and that means they are likely to be of the same ethnicity.</p>
<p>Apart from that, people of the same ethnicity are likely to be more qualified, as they know the cuisine better.  They also might prefer to work in an environment that supports the ethnicity, and preferentially seek jobs there.</p>
<p>Finally, a lot of ethnic restaurants are run by immigrants, who will actively seek employees within their immigrant communities.</p>
<p>Legally speaking, in most cases they are not allowed to specifically discriminate on the basis of race.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They can't exclude people that are protected under the law, but they are rarely in the position of having to decide between candidates when openings occur. Most of the time in an environment where English is not the first language, there will be a list of candidates waiting for an opening. This isn't because of racism or anything nefarious, but simply due to friends and family getting word around. </p>
<p>In certain circumstances, I'd also bet that they can require a certain level of proficiency in a language to be considered viable. A fancy restaurant, or one serving international customers, might need their wait staff to speak a language other than English simply for appearances or customer convenience </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of these restaurants are actually hiring family or friends of family. I know one such Chinese restaurant in my hometown is run entirely by Chinese people, who are all part of one family. So to really answer your question about how they get away with it, it's usually just because they're family owned and ran. So they strictly hire family members. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My fianc√© was in an asian interest sorority and I've made friends with a few of them. Essentially, they tend to hire family members into the business. The same applies to other businesses such as nail salons. They tend to be family owned and help each other out. </p>
<p>But in larger chain restaurants such as buffets, I've noticed that only the front-end staff (waiters, hostess, cashier) will be of the same ethnicity while the back end (cooks) are much more diverse. I'd imagine that's to maintain a certain atmosphere for the clientele. I went to an Indian Bazzar and an Honduran was behind the counter and it was a bit jarring lol. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
