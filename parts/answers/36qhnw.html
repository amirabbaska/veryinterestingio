		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Nerves found in the teeth serve multiple important purposes. First, and perhaps most importantly for us day-to-day, they allow us to sense things such as heat, cold, and pressure on the teeth. This prevents us from damaging our mouths and teeth by eating the wrong things or exerting too much pressure on the teeth during chewing. In addition, nerves allow us to sense when there is infection of the tooth such as the case of cavities.   </p>
<p>EDIT (to clarify the point about why we can sense unrepairable damage): Even though we can't fix significant damage to the tooth, pain prevents us from doing further damage. As I outlined above, sensitivity of the teeth also has some significant advantages. If you lose sensitivity cavities won't hurt but you also lose a lot of the advantages. Therefore, sensitivity will be selected for because individuals who have it are more likely to maintain their oral health which will result in increased survival and reproduction. </p>
<p>EDIT: A lot of people have made good points about the fact that evolution doesn't have a direction (I wasn't even thinking of evolution in my original response!). I'd still argue that it's likely that tooth sensitivity may be under selective pressure but /u/ChideDaJungler probably has the best evolutionary answer as to <em>why</em> it arose in the first place.</p>
<p>Perhaps less obviously, these nerves also help regulate the blood flow into the tooth. The majority of the inside of your teeth is <em>not</em> nerves but rather something called dental pulp. This is composed of multiple cell types and is important in supporting the cells that help keep your teeth strong (by maintaining a hard layer below the enamel called dentin).  </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Teeth are functional for eating etc. without any nerves or living tissue inside. However, they are unable to repair themselves and do not have the same sensitivity as teeth that <em>do</em> have a living interior.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Same reason everything in your body has pain receptors. When there's a cavity, the sterile component inside your teeth is desterilised with mouth and outside bacteria. A cavity is the perfect environment for bacterial growth and further destruction of the teeth and underlying bony structures. This leads to abcesses that can break through the bone into either your brain (and cause meningitis) or farynx (causing infection of larynx and lungs) or eye socket (causing blindness). This doesnt happen to every undertreated tooth cavity of course, but apparently enough to cause evolutionary drift. You can compare this with a diabetic foot. Their nociception(pain receptors) are damaged so they dont feel when there's a small wound somewhere on the foot. They keep putting pressure on it, the wound is lacerated further. It becomes infected, the bone underneath is eaten away and some people use their foot this way. Hope this makes any sense.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only speak from experience.  I lost half a tooth in a pub-related accident. After an expensive process of extirpating the remaining nerve and sticking on a crown, it looks like a normal tooth, but it has no sensation.  I can feel my other teeth react when something is hot, cold, has an odd texture. But this tooth is numb and dumb.</p>
<p>It makes a huge difference not being able to feel what you're biting into.  Without the nerves in my other teeth I'd wager that I wouldn't know if I was biting into something hard or soft, hot or cold until it hit my gums, tongue or lip,  or a tooth broke.</p>
<p>Like any other receptor in the body the nerves in your teeth serve to provide feedback to your brain.  Most of the time it's not that important, but if something is slightly odd you'll know straight away and be able to react.  Without those receptors in your teeth, you're slightly less equipped.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

Your jaw muscles are insanely strong and if you never had any feeling in your teeth you could probably do some real damage grinding or smacking your teeth together. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
