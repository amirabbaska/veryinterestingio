		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can't answer directly. But it might interest you to  know that there is <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auditory_processing_disorder" target="_blank">auditory processing disorder</a> (aka hearing dyslexia). Dyslexia is an issue with how you process. I myself perfectly pass every hearing test I've ever had, but I still have to watch TV with the subtitles on because I so frequently mishear dialogue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there may be various reasons (six) that can surface as dyslexia; therefore, one cannot describe only one type of dyslexia. the problem may occur at different levels of the complex process of reading.</p>
<p>children with language acquisition delay have a 50% chance to develop problems such as dyslexia later. i.e., half of the late talkers have a problem that does not disappear. = dyslexia is only a side-effect of a different brain development. 4-7% of all children have some form of problems in this field. adults usually have some compensation strategy for the problem, although exactly the same inability.</p>
<p>dyslexia can have different outcome if one learns latin or chinese script. that is an important hint to the nature of the disability.</p>
<p>braille text is similar to an alphabetical system. therefore probably affected like latin letters, if not a visual problem (some dyslexics cannot get the visual interpretation of the symbol, therefore have trouble with d/b and so on; but then this may be a bigger problem with braille).</p>
<p>you could search in the pubmed database. i am not aware of blindness and dyslexia.</p>
