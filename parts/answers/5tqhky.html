		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Don't underestimate the power of beta decays. Voyager 1 and 2 spacecrafts that explored the solar system and now interstellar space are powered indirectly by weak force. They put around 13kg of plutonium. The weak force interaction makes beta decay happen and this generates a lot of heat which is then converted to 470W of electricity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">RTG</a>. This is needed because going away from the sun means you don't have enough sunlight to generate power thru the solar panel array.</p>
<p>It has been 39 years since launch, 17 light-hours away in pitch darkness, and weak force still generates enough power to run the spacecraft instruments. It's incredible that a man made object is so far away from man that it takes 17 hours for light from earth to reach it. Yet, it's still being controlled by man and still sending scientific data back home, all thanks to the weak force.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
