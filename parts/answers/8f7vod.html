		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 2 schools of thought on hot jupiters. The first is that they form close to their parent stars, and the second is that they form beyond the frost line and migrate inwards. The migration theory is more commonly accepted.</p>
<p>As for why Jupiter didn't migrate closer to our sun, dynamic models of the early solar system suggest that it formed closer to the sun than it is now and migrated as close as where Mars is now before moving back to where it is now. It's called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_tack_hypothesis" target="_blank">grand tack hypothesis</a></p>
<p>According to the model, Jupiter formed in a region of space about three-and-a-half times as far from the sun as Earth is (3.5 astronomical units). Because a huge amount of gas still swirled around the sun back then, the giant planet got caught in the currents of flowing gas and started to get pulled toward the sun. Jupiter spiraled slowly inward until it settled at a distance of about 1.5 astronomical unitsâ€”about where Mars is now. (Mars was not there yet.)</p>
<p>Like Jupiter, Saturn got drawn toward the sun shortly after it formed, and the model holds that once the two massive planets came close enough to each other, their fates became permanently linked. Gradually, all the gas in between the two planets got expelled, bringing their migration to a halt and eventually reversing the direction of their motion. The two planets then moved outward together until Jupiter reached its current position at 5.2 astronomical units and Saturn came to rest at about 7 astronomical units. (Later, other forces pushed Saturn out to 9.5 astronomical units, where it is today.)</p>
<p>So Jupiter could have theoretically moved even closer to the sun to become a true hot jupiter but the extremely complex, chaotic, and dynamic conditions of the early solar system set in motion a string of interactions that prevented that from happening and instead formed the solar system we see today. Had anything been slightly different (a little more mass here, a little less angular momentum there...etc) things could have turned out very differently.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Before exoplanets were known to be a dime a dozen, it was hypothesized that all stellar system would either be planetary systems like our own, or multiple (binary, trinary, etc.) stars. It was thought that there was no way a star system could form with multiple stars and also keep planets. The tiny, little things would get slingshotted out into the big black as rogue planets too easily.</p>
<p>Part of this theory was that Jupiter was an almost-star. If Jupiter had been large enough to ignite its own nuclear furnace, it would have been large enough to send the rocky inner planets we know and love on a gravitational joy ride.</p>
<p>Problem is, Jupiter's <em>not</em> big enough. Not big enough by far. In order for a tiny, low mass gas ball like Jupiter to spark up as a star, it would have to be about fourteen Jupiter masses. And even then, it would be the tiniest of stars, known as Brown Dwarfs. It would glow, but at the distance of the Earth to the Sun, it could not be said to give off any real heat.</p>
<p>Even so, our big gravitational protector does glow quite brightly in the infrared. There are ample photographic evidence on the Internet of just how warm Jupiter has gotten, even if it's no where near big/hot enough to start fusing hydrogen into helium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hot Jupiters or irradiated gas giants typically form around much smaller and cooler stars than our own. The solar nebular around our sun was too hot near the sun to allow for condensation of Hydrogen in abundances sufficient to form a gas giant. (it was, however, cool enough for less volatile elements and compounds to condense and form the rocky planets).
The hot Jupiters that you are asking about likely did not &quot;move&quot; closer to their sun but accreted near during solar formation. In effect, the solar nebula attempted to condense TWO stars, one of which ignited weak fusion and the other failed to accrete the mass to do so. The small star then irradiates its neighboring gas giant and heats it up.
To address the actual meat of your question, &quot;what stopped Jupiter from moving&quot;: The solar nebular (as most everything in our universe) was rotating around a central mass (which became our sun). This rotational inertia was imparted into everything in our solar system. Knowing this, it is easier to imagine planetary motion with respect to our Earth and satellites. Satellites (generally) stay in orbit by moving forward so fast that the trajectory gravity puts them on as it pulls them down never gets closer to the surface. The planets (Jupiter included) are moving so fast around the Sun, that their trajectories arc over the solar horizon and loop back around.</p>
<p>Edit: Stricly speaking, you can also have a hot jupiter as a sub-fusion mass &quot;star&quot; or brown dwarf.  The heat from compression and radiogenic elements heats the dwarf to several thousand Kelvin. </p>
<p>See J. Fortney et al 2008 in the Astrophysical Journal for more detail on Hot Jupiter classification. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
