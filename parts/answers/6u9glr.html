		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TL:DR at the bottom.</p>
<p>Players who look for these have a general to deep understanding of the mechanics behind the game. They only <em>seem</em> random and irrelevant to others.</p>
<p>I can give a personal example from 8 years ago. I discovered a glitch/exploit in a Wii game called <em>The Conduit</em> that allowed you to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AXdvl__lr6U" target="_blank">fire the pump action shotgun like a semi-automatic gun.</a> How do you do it? By performing a seemingly nonsensical string of button inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fire -&gt; hold reload button -&gt; tap melee button -&gt; release reload button -&gt; fire again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Nobody could discover this by pure chance as those inputs would never be used in that order during normal play. You'd never have a reason to <em>hold</em> the reload button in the first place. Instead, one would have to work it out by putting the following pieces of the puzzle together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Melee attacks interrupt the shotgun's pump animation. Once the melee animation ends, the shotgun pump animation starts again from the beginning.</li>
<li>Reloading cancels <em>the last half</em> your melee attack.</li>
<li>Shooting cancels your reload. Any gunshot will cancel the reload animation of the weapon, and the weapon is not reloaded.</li>
</ol>
<p>All three of those happen during normal play all the time. Once you connect the dots, you realize you can string them together to shoot faster by eliminating the shotgun's pump animation altogether... <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZsPNFfVSQE" target="_blank">like this.</a></p>
<p>Then someone discovers that trying this on your last bullet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=knrDHebss0o&amp;t=3s" target="_blank">leads to another glitch.</a> That makes no sense though, since the reload happened before pressing the melee button and this time the melee animation didn't play <em>at all</em>. Making sense of this leads to understanding the underlying mechanics of the game: &quot;Maybe the automatic reload is what prevented the melee animation from playing.&quot;</p>
<p>And so I tested it by &quot;simulating&quot; an automatic reload, by <em>holding</em> the reload button to reload at the soonest possible frame. It worked. This glitch allowed you to eliminate the pump animation, the melee animation and the reload animation, thus letting you fire as fast as your fingers could manage.</p>
<p>TL:DR - The people who find the glitches aren't randomly discovering things; they're working them out piece by piece. Only the end result seems random.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Sometimes it's a complete accident. You accidentally clip through somewhere, and you suddenly have knowledge of the clippable area. Then you go through trying find a setup to consistently clip through it every single time.</p>
<p>Other times, people have found the programming for a game and worked from there. In Ocarina of Time, going through a door leads to a location (obviously... bear with me). Going through the door provides a value. This value is the room you arrive at. If you manage to activate two rooms at the same time, those two values get added together.</p>
<p>So, not the correct numbers here (if you want to get really in-depth, go <a href="http://wiki.cloudmodding.com/oot/Scenes_and_Rooms" target="_blank">here</a>), but if exiting Gohma's boss room leading to the rest of the Deku Tree leads to a room with a value of 123, and entering the blue warp after killing Gohma leads to a room with a value of 234, the values get added together, and you don't end up at the room that has the value of 123 or 234, but instead in a room in Ganon's tower with the value of 357.</p>
<p>There are entire tables of room values, which is why so many have been &quot;discovered&quot;. Death warping is a pretty common idea in OoT now, which involves blue warp value + death room value. All it takes is looking up which numbers need to be added together to get to a certain location.</p>
<p>tl;dr Sometimes, it's an accident and you work backward from the accident. Sometimes, it's thoroughly searched for within the programming of the game.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'd imagine some of these people are quite knowledgeable about software and use that knowledge to exploit the game.</p>
<p>I can't remember the exact details but one glitch to catch Mew in the old pokémon games was based on tricking the game's memory. Basically some register or another contained some data, and that data is then used as part of a calculation to figure out what your next wild pokémon encounter would be.</p>
<p>The key thing is though, the value in this register could be affected by any number of actions in the game.</p>
<p>This means that if you can somehow get the necessary value into that register, you can essentially force the game to make you encounter whatever pokémon you like. Data for Mew already existed in the game but wasn't actually accessible through normal gameplay. So the challenge becomes &quot;how do I force the necessary data for a Mew encounter into that register?&quot;</p>
<p>Well the answer of course is to complete a &quot;sequence of completely random and irrelevant stuff&quot;. That stuff seems completely random to us if we are just looking at the game world. But infact it is a precise calculated set of moves with the objective of forcing a specific register to hold a specific value.</p>

<p>Edit: this of course only applies to some glitches, some of them are found purely by chance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Anything else is just random chance. And the above is what all the answers in this thread will boil down to.</p>
<p>Source: Over 10 years in Video Game Software QA and 3 + in web apps.</p>
<p>An example of blackbox, is this bug I found in a pre release build of Drakkan 2, the Ancients Gates.</p>
<p>Whenever you would transition from one area to another, a loading screen would occur. There were also consumables in the game that would give a buff that had a duration.</p>
<p>So, not knowing exactly how the code worked, I took a guess that something had to be checking the player state when moving between areas and hitting a loading screen, as it would need to re-create the user's character in the next zone in the same state. I wanted to see what would happen if you did actions right as you hit the loading screen.</p>
<p>So I timed using consumables exactly as I hit the loading screen.</p>
<p>What I found was that after loading in the next zone, the temporary consumable buff remained in effect for the rest of that game session. So if you took a limited invulnerability potion right as you hit the loading screen, you would be invincible for the rest of that game session, instead of only 30 seconds.</p>
<p>Since I couldn't see the actual code that was used there, I didn't know exactly what inputs and outputs I could use and had to just try some educated guesses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>One way of doing it is to run a trace as your play. This records everything, and is just a log of where the character is within the environment, interactions, all processes required for this bit of action. Like leaving a digital trail of breadcrumbs, so when you do encounter a glitch you can look back through your trace information and pinpoint the exact conditions present when the bug occurred, then you try and replicate it, Then you use that info to debug.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
