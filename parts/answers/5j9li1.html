		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To stop people from interrupting. In West Africa, it's common for folks in positions of power to stutter to achieve the same effect. Sort of an odd cross-cultural thing: some chieftain stuttering through a speech is perceived as charismatic and articulate, whereas a Westerner might perceive him as nervous and submissive for the stutter.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To let you (the listener) know that they are still talking. In a polite conversation, when one person is silent that is usually seen as permission for the other person to talk. If I stop talking to think of a word, you might take that to mean that I am through talking. If I keep making noise, you know that I am still talking. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I've heard than in gangster movies from the 1930s and 40s, but it wasn't just gangsters - that was the vernacular of the time.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Toastmasters and other public speaking groups use similar approaches... mostly a matter of pacing your speech, though, so you don't leave empty space.</p>
<p>The funny part is what sound we use... in American English usage it's Schwa  (uhm), while in French it's usually &quot;angle y&quot; (to make this sound shape your lips like &quot;oo&quot; but your tongue like &quot;ee.&quot; In Hebrew it seems to be &quot;ehm.&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
