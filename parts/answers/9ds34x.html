<p>There are definitely some things that will be an immediate sign that something is likely to be bad for our health such as organic heavy metals, organic halogens or organic sulphur compounds. But even these have exceptions.</p>
<p>And even for compounds that do not have obvious signs a lot can depend on how the compound is going to metabolize inside of our bodies which can't really be predicted all that well and has to be tested.</p>
<p>But I'm only a chemist, for a more detailed answer we'd need a toxicologist.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>First there are chemical substructures that can be deemed mutagens (e.g., many aromatic amines); then there are &quot;reactives&quot; that are harmful (e.g., sulfonyl-chlorides); then there are known poisons (from Hg and CO to strychnine and designed chemical warfare agents, such as &quot;Novichok&quot;).</p>
<p><em>So, as long as you catalog these, you can train computers to recognize them.</em></p>
<p>Then there are software based companies that predict toxicity - <a href="https://www.lhasalimited.org/" target="_blank">Lhasa Ltd</a>, <a href="http://www.leadscope.com/" target="_blank">Leadscope</a> and <a href="http://www.multicase.com/" target="_blank">MultiCASE</a> come to mind. However, do keep in mind that there is always uncertainty related to predictions, especially about the future (aka new chemicals).</p>
<p>Other computational substructure filters, such as <a href="https://www.eyesopen.com/filter" target="_blank">FILTER</a>  (unwanted reactive species) and <a href="http://pasilla.health.unm.edu/tomcat/badapple/badapple" target="_blank">BADAPPLE</a> (unwanted scaffolds) fulfill different (still comptox) related functions.</p>
<p>The entire field of Computational Toxicology has now been <a href="http://www.toxicology.org/groups/ss/ctss/" target="_blank">recognized</a> as an area of active interest by the <a href="https://www.toxicology.org/index.asp" target="_blank">SOT</a> (Society of Toxicology), and a <a href="https://www.journals.elsevier.com/computational-toxicology" target="_blank">dedicated journal</a> has been launched by Elsevier in 2016.</p>
<p>Many experienced (I'd say 15+ years) medicinal chemists  can look at the 2D structure of a molecule and intuitively know these molecules may be harmful. However, that skill is not universal, since it is humanly not possible to recognize every harmful (poisons, venoms, mutagens, carcinogens, etc.) chemical.</p>
<p>Using that entire catalog of toxic substances plus chemical similarity &amp; substructure recognition trained software is what most scientists who want to address this question use.</p>
<p>Last but not least, recall the words of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paracelsus" target="_blank">Theophrastus Bombastus Paracelsus</a>:  <em>Sola dosis facit venenum</em> &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_dose_makes_the_poison" target="_blank">Only the dose makes the poison</a>&quot; After all, even water (not to mention distilled water!) and salt (NaCl) are harmful when rapidly ingested in really high doses.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR: Yes - mostly with appropriate software.</strong></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>We can have a reasonable guess. For the most part we'd look at the structure and see if it looked like something we know to be toxic. If it's got the same functional groups organised in the same way then the shape of the rest of the molecule, the tail if you like, is usually somewhat less important. With drug discovery for example they will typically find a molecule that vaguely does what is needed and then just make loads of analogues of that with slightly different shapes until they find one that works well (or they give up).</p>
<p>AIUI this is changing a little bit now though. Some of the drugs we are looking into are active in tiny quantities (microgram range) because they are tuned perfectly to interact with specific receptors in the body. In that case I'd imagine structure is so important that even a slight variation could have a massive change on the effect. If you're interested the first chemical we found with this level of activity was LSD.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all every molecule is harmfull if the dose is high enough, but if you want to know if a new canidate drug is toxic at its therapeutic dose you can look at a few properties of compounds that we know can cause issues. You can for instance try to predict if a compound interacts with hERG, an ion channel that is known for causing issues cardiac issues (long  QT syndrom). So you can sort of predict whether a comound will have specific toxic effects. But knowing whether a molecule is safe without running lab/animal/clinical experiments is impossible. There are something like 16,000 proteins and predicting how a molecule will interact with a single protein can be a very though job and the margin of error is quite large if you don't do any experiments.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top commenter already gave a good explanation, but he asked for a toxicologist to give a more thorough answer.
I asked my SO this question (she's a biochemist, did have classes in toxicology). I'll let her answer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We can mostly tell whether things are corrosive, flammable or explosive by looking at their structure. But telling whether or not they are poisonous or otherwise bad for our health is difficult. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>It definitely is also possible to make a good guess whether a molecule will be let's, say carcinogenic or toxic, by looking at certain parts of the molecule.
It won't give you a 100% certainty, but when encountering these &quot;red flags&quot;, it tells us that there's a high likelihood of certain risks.</p>
<p>For example, there's the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1469697/" target="_blank">DEREK</a>-system which can be used to predict the toxicity/carcinogenicity of a molecule using previously gathered knowledge of other molecules.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
