		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just the actual flavor that gives you pleasure. Your body is hardwired to chew. It's starts when the teeth come in, and you never grow out of it. You actually get an imperceptible &quot;buzz&quot; from the entire eating process, and this includes the chewing. It's why people enjoy crunchy foods, like potato chips. Some people chew ice, chew pens/pencils/miscellaneous items. Some people grind their teeth in their sleep, so it an unconscious impulse. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
