		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First, thank you for this AMA. It seems that GenX adults with milder symptoms, more akin to those that used to be deemed Asperger’s before DSM-5, who were left to navigate the world before there was this current awareness, are still somewhat in a no-man’s land due to the fact that they’ve adopted certain behavioral accommodations to “pass” in social situations. Are there any specific diagnostic tools that are truly able to assess where these individuals exist on the spectrum? And if so, what treatment options exist for these now-middle-aged adults?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have two questions about autism that you may be able to answer (or maybe not, as they're pretty specific, but who knows, I may as well ask !) :</p>
<p>- First, I read that depression may make autistic people &quot;lose&quot; their special interest, but I can't find any science behind that, is that true and if it is, is there an explanation for that ? Is there any other autistic-specific symptoms of depression ?</p>
<p>- Second, a big part of adult life is love and sex, there was a poll that showed that there is less straight people in the autistic population then in the non-autistic one, do you have an explanation for that difference ? Is there any other difference between autistic and non-autistic people in that general field ?</p>
<p>Thanks for that AMA.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
