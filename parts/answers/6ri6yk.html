		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a theory commonly used in political science called 'Geopolitics'. According to this theory, the geography of nations determines their wealth, power, and foreign policy goals.</p>
<p>The United States has a number of geographic advantages not enjoyed by any other country on earth.</p>
<p>The eastern seaboard of the United States is composed almost exclusively of good harbors, many of them deep water. The ability to access ocean ports and particularly deepwater ports allow a nation to have a large civilian trading fleet, leveraging trades from around the world and warehousing goods on the move. This in turn leads to a nation being able to produce a strong and powerful navy, which allows that trading fleet to extend out to distant and dangerous harbors safely, acting as go-betweens for other nations, and importing raw goods to export finished ones.</p>
<p>The Mississippi Basin is the largest contiguous patch of arable land on earth. It is extremely fertile, with predictable and steady supplies of water, and more importantly, the Mississippi Basin is broadly navigable, allowing bulk cargo to move from trading hubs on major rivers down along the shallows and isolated bays to the Eastern Seaboard, allowing mass quantities of goods produced reliably in relative isolation to quickly find the world market. This land was already cleared and easy to begin cultivating: starting up a ranch was as cheap as a fence and some cattle, whereas densely forested or jungled regions are much more expensive to develop.</p>
<p>America enjoys unparalleled isolation, protecting it from the impacts of war. To the north, Canada faces too many geographic challenges to rise to a level where it can pose a legitimate threat to the United States, and for it's own geographic reasons must find friendship with the United States. To the south, great deserts and mountains make it very difficult, if not impossible, for Mexico to ever pose a legitimate threat to the United States, as demonstrated in a series of one-sided wars. This means that when war breaks out, it happens far from America, and American infrastructure easily survives.</p>
<p>Collectively, these have formed the basis of America's wealth, ideology, political power, and military strategy in the world. Latin American nations each have at most one of these. Each is adequately militarized to make the threat of war a historical problem, most of the continent is inaccessible by river, much of it is very expensive to cultivate, and those areas that are not lack adequate natural port infrastructure or are placed too far from trading partners who do not.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that under this theory, America's power was predicated on unity after the end of the Civil War. If the Confederacy had survived (as HBO is planning in it's bizzaro logic new show), America would look much more like Argentina and Brazil than how it looks today, with true military rivals on the continent and a disconnect between the perfect engine of agriculture in the Mississippi Basin and the perfect engine of commerce on the eastern seaboard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Emphasis on the word 'united'. The USA is the largest country in the Americas in terms of usable land (Canada is big, but the small population being ~10% of the US and large portions of land being tundra don't help) and population. </p>
<p>It also shows the difference between Spanish/Portuguese methods vs British and French methods when colonising land. The Spanish for example would send minimal settlers to kill the locals and extract resources, relying very heavily on native slaves for labour. Living in these colonies was absolute shit and Spain didn't give a damn about them. They only existed to Spain's benefit. </p>
<p>Britain on the other hand, though often unfair to colonists (and especially native people), tried to turn their colonies into powerful economic nations in their own right. This was done in India, where Britain constructed huge railway networks, civil infrastructure, etc. They were also far more willing to recruit locals and sign treaties. Lots of land in the US was gained by signing deals with Native Americans instead of killing them, not that white people didn't just kill them anyway as no treaties have ever been enforced.  </p>
<p>The US also abused its size and population early in its existence. It invaded many areas which are now US states and used its larger military to control Central American puppet states. This let them essentially use the same Imperialism that Europe used to colonise the Americas, except on neighboring countries. So not only is the US the biggest and most populous, it's also got dozens of smaller countries now having their resources extracted into the US too. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Of course it's a complicated subject with a lot of variable. But one of the most important is the stability of the government.</p>
<p>The US gained independance in 1783, kept the same constitution since 1788 and kept a very stable government ever since. They also fought mostly war overseas, with the exception of the civil war.</p>
<p>Now compare that to Colombia. It's independance was recognized in 1819, 36 years after the US. They got their constitution in 1821. By 1830 the republic collapsed into three new country of New Granada, Ecuador and Venezuela. The Republic was very centralized and by 1849 the first of a series of civil will broke out, the rebel lost. Other civil war or conflict will occur in 1860, 1876, 1899 and 1948, not counting the current low-intensity conflict that started 53 years ago. The republic changed name in 1858 (Granadine Confederation), 1863 (United States of Colombia and finally the Republic of Colombia in 1886. Panama seceded in 1903. The political situation was never stable in Colombia and unstability isn't good for economical growth.</p>
<p>The picture is pretty similar for most south and central american country. Brazil was an Empire then the Republic of the United States of Brazil, then the Dictatorship of Vargas then the Republic was reformed, then the military took control of the government after a coup d'Ã©tat, before the current Federative Republic of Brazil was formed. And if you follow the news, political corruption is a big problem right now in Brazil.</p>
<p>Basically, the US and Canada were able to build stable government that changed through history peacefully. Something that most other country in the americas were able to do.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is an excellent question that already has some excellent answers in this thread!  Many have already said a few of these points, but I just wanted to put them together in a semi-chronological format.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Our origins - This one is quite simple as some have pointed out before.  US colonists generally came here in search of personal liberty (religious, political, etc.), desperation, intrigue, a chance at a better life, and so on.  In other words, they came here <em>to stay.</em>  Many of the other nations who were &quot;colonized&quot; weren't so much concerned with long term empire building as much as simple exploitation of the people and natural resources in their captured lands.  Keep in mind, when the US on the verge of becoming a nation, the Enlightenment had gripped many who would later become our founding fathers.  Meanwhile, elsewhere on these two continents, these ideals simply did not reach enough minds to become a cohesive force.  Remember, our founders were willing to commit high treason not simply because of a taxation issue as it is commonly taught in primary education, but rather an amalgamation of all of the Enlightenment ideas that pointed away from  monarchical rule.  When many other nations gained their independence, their view of &quot;democracy&quot; was heavily influenced by authoritarian ideals, even to this day.  My Venezuelan friend said it best: &quot;Our people were so used to bowing down to kings, that even when Bolivar liberated us, we naturally bowed to him.  Maduro knows this, we know this, and we will continue bowing until all of the kings leave us not only in letter, but in spirit.&quot;  The point here isn't that authoritarian rule is inherently &quot;worse&quot; in an economic sense (in many cases it can be shown to be the opposite), but rather how all of the above circumstances freed up many US minds to pursue not only scientific and technological progress, but also social and political ones, whereas authoritarians tend to stagnate in their ability to rapidly adapt to a constantly changing sociopolitical environment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Geography - as many have said, the United States enjoyed and continues to enjoy one of the most strategic locations on the planet.  We have a temperate climate, plenty of fertile farmland, two giant coastlines, and teeming with natural resources including wildlife from sea to shining sea.  We also have strategic territories and bases located all over the world (our military presence will be another bullet point).  Our commerce lanes are second to none, especially with the construction of the Panama Canal.  This is perhaps the single most important factor, even though I put our origins first.  Many other commenters have elaborated on this one, so I will move on.  However, I just wanted to note that geography alone isn't a valid answer to the question.  North America has been inhabited for thousands of years.  There are a variety of other factors that led to our eventual rise to the top.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isolationalism - Washington famously declined to assist the French during their Revolution with any sort of direct aid, especially not committing American troops to the fight.  This seemingly small decision was crucial in maintaining our fledgling nation's strength at a time when the US had just <em>failed</em> in establishing a new government and was restarting again.  Isolationism persisted as a core ideology, arguably even until the onset of WWII.  Washington famously warned us that Europe's problems ought to be their own.  Combined with our geography, isolationism was absolutely critical in the sense that we weren't constantly subverted by foreign interests.  Combine isolationism with Manifest Destiny and we have the ideological basis of building an &quot;empire&quot; without the constraints of our actions being defined against another power.  In other terms, these two ideologies pointed us towards taking &quot;minor&quot; pieces of land from people who were themselves isolated, and therefore avoided much of what conquerors had to deal with historically, mainly, other conquerors and stiff indigenous resistance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Federalism - The failure of the Articles of Confederation was in a strange way, one of the biggest keys to our success.  In its stead, we received a strong, centralized government that called for states to work in a united union, rather than continuing along the path of meager cooperation.  This would lead to other things, some highly controversial at the time, such as the creation of the Federal Reserve and eventually a standing federal army.  Of course, other nations on both American continents would have eventually created these things, but the key with the US is the order and circumstances under which we completed Federalism, also including the staunch opposition by anti-Federalists.  Our modern iteration of federalism, despite what cynics may say, provide an incredible framework for our states, so much so that many of our states far surpass the GDP of entire countries in the world.  I do not want to sound like a Hamiltonian, but Federalism absolutely was a much needed force in the early years of the US, or else infighting between states would have stunted growth and development.</p>
</li>
<li>Representative Democracy - Other nations on both American continents would eventually develop some sort of democracy, but from the very onset, American representative democracy was a huge factor in the stabilization and growth of the US.  First and foremost in my mind is the idea of a peaceful transition between <strong>opposing</strong> parties.  This is by far been the exception to the rule throughout history.  This added an unparalleled (at the time) amount of stability in that ordinary citizens enjoyed despite radical differences in ideology.  This is not to say that there wasn't political discord and even violence, but what we experienced here pales in comparison to some of the messier revolutions, especially in South America.  Also, while it may seem contradictory, the idea of Tyranny of the Majority was another stabilizing force.  Keep in mind communications at this time was severely limited and slow, so political leaders by in large shunned the idea that the common public should be able to directly elect certain offices, such as the office of the POTUS.  The combination of showing the masses that they have a choice in their governance (cynics can laugh at this, truthfully) meanwhile ensuring that they do not have direct control, helped stabilize and establish a strong leadership for growth.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1) Spain had a habit of colonizing a region at bare minimum levels and extracting resources from said colonies via enslavement or virtual enslavement of native populations and actual implementation of imported slaves from Africa.
