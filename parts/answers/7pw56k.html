		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Blinking is a motor function controlled by the facial nerve, the seventh cranial nerve. Cranial nerves come directly from the brainstem, bypassing the spinal cord. Cranial nerve reflexes are often used to assess levels of brain function (diencephalon, mesencephalon, and medulla). </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>People are usually paralysed because the spinal cord has been damaged. To paralyse the legs, this can happen quite low down the spine; to paralyse the arms it's occurs higher up; to paralyse from the neck down, the spine is damaged in the neck area.</p>
<p>The nerves that control things on the face connect directly to the brain through the scull, so they are not likely to be damaged as easily as the spinal cord.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Simple answer: the neural pathway between the brain and the eye muscles is still intact, while the pathways between say, the brain and the arms/legs/torso are not. </p>
<p>If you suffer a spinal injury in your lower back, you may lose function and feeling in your legs. Suffer the same injury higher up, and you may lose the ability to control your diaphragm, which would require you to be on a ventilator.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your eyelids (and eyeballs) are innervated by the oculomotor nerve, which doesn't pass through the spinal cord. It goes straight from your brain to your eyes. So if the paralysis is caused by a spinal cord injury, blinking would not be affect. However, a paralysis that is caused by damage to the central nervous system could affect blinking, depending on the extent of the damage.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>kind of like how u/baloo_the_bear said, the nerves that control some parts of your head arent in the spine, where full body paralysis normally takes place. like hearing or seeing, blinking is still something those unfortunate few can do</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
