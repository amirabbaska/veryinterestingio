		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't know who recommends this, but as someone who's volunteered a lot at shelters, I can't agree at all. For the simple reason that in many people's opinion there's no such thing as a &quot;no kill&quot; shelter (at least in the US).</p>
<p>Right now in the US there are about twice as many dogs and cats born every year as people want. That means that every puppy born has about a 50% chance they'll be put down because they can't find a home. We're talking about millions of dogs and cats every year.</p>
<p>&quot;No kill&quot; shelters take in a tiny amount of animals, and they turn the rest away. They only have so much room, so they usually also prefer to take in pets that are very adoptable (puppies and kittens are much more adoptable than older cats and dogs, or pets with any medical problems), so that &quot;unadoptable&quot; pets won't take up space at their shelter.</p>
<p>This means that other shelters have to take in those pets, and because they don't discriminate they get more than their fair share of old and sick pets that need more help and are more likely to stick around for a long time. Unfortunately, no one is able to keep 100% of the pets that get abandoned. Remember we're breeding 2 cars and dogs for every 1 that's going to find a home. Look at how many pets are in america, now double it, where is that 2nd group going to go? No one wants them, and no shelter has enough room or money to take in that many pets. So they going to get put down, when the problem gets this bad, that's literally the most humane option.</p>
<p>So a &quot;no kill&quot; shelter does exactly nothing to unwanted pets from being put down, they just pass the problem on to someone else. That means that the vets at some other shelter have to deal with more old and sick pets and have to put down more pets because the people at the &quot;no kill&quot; shelter don't want to deal with it. They're not being humane, they're just passing the trouble on to someone else.</p>
<p>If you think that this sounds horrible, it is. And much more important than choosing what kind of shelter, is to just make sure that you're adopting from a shelter and not a breeder. Also, make sure you spay and neuter. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My wife and I have volunteered as a cat and dog foster home for 15 years now, and have worked with half a dozen or so different no-kill rescue groups.  </p>
<p>Here is why I recommend people go to a no-kill shelter, and it has virtually nothing to do with the killing or not: </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Behavioral Assessment.  First, we only pull dogs who have passed behavioral assessments regarding resource guarding, food aggression, dog reactivity, etc.  So if you go look at an animal in a <em>good</em> NK shelter, you know already that the dog has passed some sort of test.  Doesn't make it foolproof, and I'm sure some/many NK shelters don't do this, but it definitely lowers the risk; most kill pounds do not have the time/money/expertise to do these behavioral tests.    </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stable temperament.  <em>Good</em> NK shelters, particularly ones that foster, know the animal better.  After we've already pulled a dog that is likely to have a better (read: safer) temperament, that dog will usually spend some time in our care.  We have far more clarity on the nuances of the animal (is he/she better with a dog of the same sex or opposite or either? can he/she tolerate loud kids? is he/she happy to play chase with other dogs but gets aggressive when humped? is he/she likely to be the dominant or submissive pet?  good with cats inside but not outside or not at all?).  This means two HUGE things: you're more likely to get the right animal for you, and you're less likely to return it.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support.  If you adopt a dog from me, I'm going to help you.  All of the rescue groups we've volunteered for support adoptive families.  If the dog is struggling to settle, or isn't learning something he needs to know (stairs are a hard one for greyhound adoptive families), I will come to your house and I will help you. At the foster home, the animal has already begun acclimating to living in a household, making it much easier for you as an adoptive family.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Health.  We're a private organization getting reasonable donations.  Your dog/cat will come to you more healthy.  It will already have been spayed/neutered so you don't have to put an animal through a major surgery and deal with the post-care of an animal that doesn't trust you yet.  Your pet will not have worms.  Or mange.  Or heartworm.  Or fleas.  Or parvo.  Government-operated kill pounds do not have this luxury.  </p>
</li>
<li>Returns.  If the animal is not right for you, you have somewhere to return it and have peace of mind that you aren't sending the animal to its' death.  This is relatively rare, because of the aforementioned points, but it does happen, and we're happy to take the animal back.  There have been many times over the last 15+ years that I have taken back a dog from someone who wasn't quite right, and found them another one that was perfect for them.  </li>
</ol>
<p>Getting from a kill pound vs no-kill shelter has nothing to do with morality and everything to do with it being a safer bet for an adoptive family.  Of course, there are wonderful perfect animals that come from kill pounds; all of the animals in our NK shelter started out there.  But for an adoptive family, you know more what you're getting than if you just go to a pound and pick one out b/c it is pretty.  </p>
<p>Kill pounds are vital; as another poster mentioned, there are twice as many cats and dogs in the US as there are homes for them.  We'd have a lot less of a problem if we could legislate away the puppy mills and make it socially unacceptable to be a backyard breeder (or require people to be licensed to breed even their own pets); I have no problem with responsible/professional breeders.  But we can't.  So this country has to euthanize millions of cats and dogs every year b/c people can't be fucking responsible and it is better to euthanize an aggressive stray dog or a sick stray cat than to let it wander around outside spreading disease and causing fights, not to mention feeling unwell itself.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a person who fosters for a kill shelter I couldn't disagree more. I've also never heard anyone say this. Perhaps they're thinking that the kill shelters are &quot;bad&quot;. But they are kill shelters because they have too many animals. They are usually the city dump for unwanted animals. The shelter I foster for takes in more than 30,000 animals a year.
They are trying to transition to become a no kill shelter, but they can't do it without the help of the public. Spay, neuter, adopt, foster. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, if you don't take the animals from the 'no-kill' shelter, then two things happen. The first is that they don't have room for another animal and that animal goes to a kill shelter. The second is that you support an organization that has a philosophy you like and it is more likely they stay in business in the future.</p>
<p>Essentially, there are X number of shelter animals out there looking for a home. No matter where you get that animal, it takes one off the kill list.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
