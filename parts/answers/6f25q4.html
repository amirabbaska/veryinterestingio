		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ugh this is such a cool question!  The answer get's at some very real-life applications of quantum mechanics.  </p>
<p>The basic answer is infra-red radiation is a more effective way of heating up common materials (water, plastic, organic things) because photons in the infra-red part of the electromagnetic spectrum are more heavily absorbed by these compounds, but this is only part of the answer!  The next obvious question is: why is that?  Why for instance doesn't the visible and UV radiation from sunlight cause even more heating since it's higher in energy?  The reason for this has to do with a couple concepts: 1) what exactly is happening on the molecular level when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed and turned into thermal energy and 2) the concept or resonance and how this translates into absorption spectra of various compounds.  </p>
<p>Let's get into the first idea.  Several things can happen when electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by a material.  Classically we are taught in science class that electrons in lower energy orbitals are pushed up into higher energy orbitals when they absorb EM radiation but this only really tells a small part of the story (this is what causes the classic &quot;absorption spectrum&quot; of various chemical elements - so valuable to astronomy).  It turns out EM energy can actually be absorbed in myriad other ways, however to increase the temperature of a substance, it has to be absorbed in such a way as to increase the kinetic energy of the molecules making up that particular compound, since temperature is our perception of the average molecular kinetic energy of a substance.  To accomplish this, the EM radiation will typically increase the vibrational energy of the chemical bonds present in this substance, though interactions which increase the rotational energy or flex the bonds will increase kinetic energy as well.  In the case of your microwave for instance, a machine that projects high intensity EM radiation (in the microwave area of the spectrum - hence the name) the way kinetic energy (a.k.a. heat) is imparted on your food is by increasing the vibrational energy between the hydrogen-oxygen bonds in water.  That's why you'll notice that the more water-filled portions of food you heat in the microwave often heat up disproportionately compared to other parts!  </p>
<p>This takes us to #2, why is infrared the part of the spectrum that is responsible for temperature changes, not other parts of the spectrum.  Well this has to do with quantum resonance.  Let's take the example of water again as we just discussed.  Imagine a water molecule, with two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.  The hydrogen atoms and oxygen are mutually attracted to each other (if you're curious why, look up covalent bonds on wikipedia).  Their mutual attraction exists such that there is a perfect distance at which they will be at their lowest energy state; where the attraction they experience due to their electronegativity (another chemistry concept) is balanced by the repulsion their positively charged nuclei experience towards one another.  This is their &quot;bonding length&quot;.  In school we make models of molecules with balls and sticks, which implies bonding length is constant, but in reality, the hydrogen and oxygen in water are bouncing between each other as if they are on springs, constantly oscillating between attraction and repulsion.  </p>
<p>Remember earlier that increasing the vibrational energy of a chemical bond will in turn result in an increase in that molecules kinetic energy (resulting in a net temperature increase for the compound as a whole) so consider for a second what it would take to increase that vibrational energy.  You would need the right amount of energy to perfectly increase that &quot;bouncing back and forth&quot; oscillating motion between the hydrogen and the oxygen atom.  If the photon that interacts with this system is too high in energy, it will either disrupt the system violently (i.e. the way ionizing radiation works) or simply not be absorbed at all.  Alternatively, a photon with too little energy will not have sufficient &quot;oomph&quot; (read: energy) to significantly affect the vibration of the oxygen and hydrogen.  But a photon at just the right wavelength and frequency can add energy to the system by imparting just enough energy into the chemical bond as to increase the frequency and amplitude of the vibration, and lead to an increase in kinetic energy.  It is primarily infra-red and microwave radiation that exists in this &quot;sweet spot&quot; of energy to interact so strongly with the chemical bonds of most common organic compounds in a way that produces heat.  Other kinds of radiation simply are too energetic or not enough.  This is the concept of &quot;resonance&quot; and I think it's an apt word to describe it.  </p>
<p>Another way of thinking about this is what something looks like when it does NOT absorb a part of the EM spectrum.  Let's take water for example.  Water barely absorbs visible light (compared to something like ink for example), so it appears clear.  When visible light interacts with water molecules, it is hardly absorbed so the waves largely pass through it unhindered (they are in fact &quot;refracted&quot; but let's not get into that right now) and as a result it appears transparent.  In contrast, water would appear &quot;black&quot; in the infrared spectrum since it heavily absorbs these wavelengths.  Interestingly if you take this logic a step further, you could infer that black objects, which absorb the entirety of the visual spectrum, are essentially doing what water does to infra-red energy; they are absorbing it and transforming it into kinetic energy.  If you want to test this theory, take two water bottles, one filled with pure water, and another filled with india ink out into the sunshine on a bright sunny day.  Both bottles have similar infra-red absorption since they are largely filled with water, but the one with ink in it will additionally absorb most of the visible spectrum.  It should be noticeably warmer at the end of the day.  </p>
<p>tl;dr: Infra-red energy is absorbed by chemical bonds in most common organic compounds, increasing their vibrational energy and leading to higher average kinetic energy of the molecules making up that compound (i.e. tempearature); other areas of the EM spectrum are either too high energy or too low energy to interact with chemical bonds in this way!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, infrared is the type of light emitted by &quot;hot&quot; things, so we associate it with heat.</p>
<p>The process is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-body_radiation" target="_blank">blackbody radiation</a> and I think this <a href="https://www.mdscc.nasa.gov/upload/201211/Tabla_con_amarillo.jpg" target="_blank">graph</a> captures the relationship between being &quot;hot&quot; and infrared radiation well. Everything with a temperature (so, everything) emits light, and the frequency and amount of that radiation is a function of temperature. Room temperature is 300 K, so things that are &quot;hot&quot; in an everyday sense tend to be a few hundred to ~a thousand Kelvin, and all of those temperatures emit mainly in the infrared. Being &quot;red hot&quot; refers to the fact that something is hot enough to start emitting in the visible, but even then the vast majority of their radiation is in the infrared.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how a stove turns red when it gets hot?  Hot things glow -- that's the black body radiation people keep talking about.</p>
<p>It turns out that the stove is glowing, even if it's not visible to the human eye.  At room temperature, and especially body temperature, objects still emit light -- infrared light.  </p>
<p>Why haven't we evolved to see this light?  Well, our eyes are machines made of proteins that only work properly at certain temperatures.  It would be pretty difficult to distinguish the IR glow of a faraway object, from the ambient glow of the camera/eye itself.  IR cameras deal with this sometimes by actively cooling the assembly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>...because when objects absorb energy from other forms radiation, eg; gamma, x-ray, microwave, visible light and so on... it is typically remitted from the absorbing substance as infrared.</p>
<p>So you can detect heat energy using infrared but the source of the heat energy itself may be anything outside of the infrared spectrum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
