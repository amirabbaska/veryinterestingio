		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The problem of colorization has a huge amount of work behind it and I'm no expert, so this is going to be woefully incomplete.</p>
<p>There's two major approaches; automatic (more recent) and assisted. The assisted approach may rely either on a reference image (<a href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~dcor/online_papers/papers/colorization05.pdf" target="_blank">example</a>) - or a database of images, scenes, etc - or some user intervention (<a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~yweiss/Colorization/" target="_blank">example</a>). The automatic approach has used convolutional neural networks to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.08511.pdf" target="_blank">great effect</a>. A key thing to note is that the objective isn't always to match the colorized image to a reference, but also to produce a <em>plausible</em> colorization.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A straightforward explanation for colorization done manually (on a computer) -</p>
<p>Black and white photos are considered grayscale, so all their pixels are shades of gray. Some programs detect how gray each pixel is and can apply a dynamic filter (in this example, let's say we wanted a red photo, so we apply a 100% red layer) based off of the gray underneath. Now the program calculates all 25% gray as 25% red, 70% gray to 70% red, and so on.</p>
<p>You can make this filter multiple colors in different areas, so you eventually come out with a color photo.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
