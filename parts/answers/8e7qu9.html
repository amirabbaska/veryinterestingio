		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It feels warm to sit where anyone else was sitting, including where you were sitting, if your butt is colder than the seat.</p>
<p>But if you were just sitting there, then your butt is the same temperature as the seat, so it won't feel warm.  However, if you were standing, your butt gets a bit colder because you're not sitting, which causes the spot where someone else was sitting to feel warmer.</p>
<p>There's a third option that makes it all become clear.  Be sitting for a while, and when someone gets up, go sit in their seat.  It won't feel very warm, because your butt is already warm from sitting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because the seat is warmer than you. We cannot detect temperature absolutely. What we feel when something is warm or cool is the energy transfer taking place. A property of thermodynamics is equilibrium, which is essentially the system balancing out.</p>
<p>Imagine it like this:</p>
<p>Your hand is warmer than ice, so your hand contains more thermal energy than the ice. However, energy likes to be even, or at equilibrium. Since your hand isn’t even with the ice, energy from your hand flows into the ice when you touch it. This energy loss from your hand is detected as cold. Inversely, if your hand touched a stove, energy from the stove would flow into your hand, which is detected as hot.</p>
<p>When you sit in someone else’s chair, their body temperature is going to be slightly different than yours. If the chair feels warm, it’s because it’s warmer than your body. When you sit back down in your own chair, it’s the same temperature as you because it’s been at equilibrium with your body temperature.</p>
<p>EDIT: Changed &quot;objectively&quot; to &quot;absolutely&quot; to better reflect how thermoreceptors function.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you sit where something else was it's either warmer or cooler than you. Cooler tends to only go to down to room temperature unless really cold, so you don't tend to feel any different from if there was nothing there. Warmer, you'll almost definitely feel, so it sticks out in your mind. </p>
<p>You are you-temperature, and your body is so used to feeling you-temperature that things that are you-temperature get completely ignored. Like how your house doesn't usually smell like anything to you because you're used to it, but you can pick up on the normal smell of other people's houses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The thing they were sitting on absorbed heat energy from their body.  When you sat on it that heat energy started to transfer to your body through conduction.  </p>
<p>Your chair is probably close to room temperature so there might be a 15-20 degree (F) difference in temperature depending on the chair’s material and how long they were sitting there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your butt gets warmer when you're sitting than when you're standing, so does the chair you're sitting on. If you're stood up and sit in someone's chair right after they get up, their butt and chair will have gotten warmer than yours. If you stand up from your own seat and then sit back down a little while later, both your butt the chair have had the same amount of time to cool off, so it doesn't feel warm. I imagine if you and a person were both sitting and you immediately swapped in to their chair as they got up, the difference would be much smaller and just down to differences between people, however this doesn't happen often enough to notice.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
