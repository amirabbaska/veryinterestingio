		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The center is right where you are standing. If you hopped in a time machine that was stationary but could travel through time like the one in H.G. Wells's &quot;The Time Machine,&quot; and set the dials for the beginning of the universe, you'd zoom back through time as the universe shrank around you. The universe would shrink to a size too small for you and your time machine to be in before you got to the beginning though, and even before you got to the end of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_\(cosmology\)" target="_blank">cosmic inflation</a> period, at which time the universe was about the size of a grain of sand.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we can &quot;see&quot; all the way to the cosmological horizon already, the edge of the observable universe. What we see there is photons that were emitted about 380,000 years after the start of the universe. Before that, the universe was so densely packed with stuff that any photon emitted by one atom would be absorbed by another atom almost immediately. Those photons have been travelling for so long and so far that they are all <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift" target="_blank">redshifted</a> to microwaves, but in any direction, that redshift indicates a distance of 46.5 billion light years. The observable universe is a sphere 93 billion light years across, with you at the center.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

That makes you the center of your universe. Have a nice day!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The more space between two object the faster the expansion is. This is due to dark energy. This means that where ever you are in the universe everything is generally moving away from you (with exceptions due to gravity). This means that all points appear to be the location of the big bag and the center of the universe from that locations frame of reference. Therefore it is not possible to find the center ( if there is one ) with this method. An easy way to demostrate this is to take a rubber band cut it so that it is a straight line and make different points on it with a marker. Stretch it and check the movements of each of the points relative to several different frames of reference and you will find all things seem to move away from the frame of reference you choose. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are a few different theories of the shape of the universe, but none of them have a clearly-defined center.</p>
<p>The universe may be infinite - it can be infinite and still expanding - in which case there is no center by definition. </p>
<p>If it's finite, it's curved, so it's impossible to identify a central point, like trying to determine 0 longitude.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
