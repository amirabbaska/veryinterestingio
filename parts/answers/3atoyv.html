		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The active ingredients in your mouthwash are non-polar molecules — they're oils. Water is a polar molecule. Polar molecules and non-polar molecules don't mix well, with a few exceptions — alcohol is one of those exceptions. It's a polar solvent <em>with a non-polar region</em>, that mixes well with water, allowing the oils that are the active ingredients to remain dissolved in the water.</p>
<p>^(<em>edited to be more accurate, thanks /u/989490 and /u/shittiestscientist and /u/menkaure</em>)</p>
<hr />
<p>Many of the comments I am now receiving on this are &quot;this is a shitty ELI5&quot; and &quot;this is fine if you're a 17 year old Chem I student.&quot; Aside from the fact that this subreddit is supposed to be for layman-friendly explanations and not for literal five-year-olds:</p>
<p>The explanation above is nearly word-for-word how I explained to my <em>six-year-old</em> how ammonia window cleaner (Windex) works to dissolve oils, except tweaked a little to describe alcohol in water. I've also explained to him how soap binds to dirt, that dirt can be too small to see; the relationship between voltage, resistance, and current; how magnets work (okay, okay, I and Derek from Veritasium on YouTube); spiders, dinosaurs, whales, photons, how trees turn sunlight and air into sugar, and anything else that pops into his head. We use Wikipedia and google image search every day.</p>
<p>When you tell me &quot;this isn't an explanation appropriate for a five-year-old&quot;, I am simply <em>amazed</em>.</p>
<p>It is never too soon to start exploring science with your kids.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a very simple non-technical reason.  In the US if you are selling an Over the counter drug product (like mouthwash or toothpaste or Sunscreen make up) anything you list as an active ingredient MUST HAVE a label claim amount.  There maybe a bunch of technical ingredients that make the active ingredient perform, or in the case of Alcohol itself have active properties, but only if the label claims it to be active do you need to list it.</p>
<p>You can have triclosan as antimicrobial but the soap does just as much</p>
<p>You can have Ethanol as an anti-microbrial in hand santitizer but a cooling agent in deodorant.</p>
<p>You can have Titanium Dioxide as a pigment in make up, or a sunscreen in face cream</p>
<p>Qualifications: 20 years in consumer products, as a Chemical Engineer</p>
<p><strong>TL/DR; mostly for reasons to do with label copy, not because it doesn't work</strong></p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The top comment is totally wrong. The correct answer is that &quot;inactive&quot; ingredients are not inactive. The FDA requires that over the counter drugs be labeled with an active ingredients section that lists the actual drug ingredients in the product. In a flouride mouthwash, for example, the fluoride does some magic chemistry stuff with your teeth to make them more resistant to decay - it actually stays in your body and does something. The alcohol in mouthwash is important because it cleans your mouth. But then you spit it out. The intended use of the alcohol is not to absorb it and have it do something in your body - the intended use is for it to clean your mouth and kill bacteria - then you spit it out and its gone. Because the FDA does not consider alcohol to be a &quot;drug&quot; in the case of mouthwash, it is not listed as an &quot;active&quot; ingredient. But that doesn't mean it doesn't do anything. It just means that what it does is not considered to be worthy of designation as a drug in this case. </p>
<p>Another great example is cough drops that are essentially just pieces of candy. If there is no menthol or other &quot;drugs&quot; in the cough drops, you will not see an active ingredients section because nothing in the drops is considered to have drug activity. But these drops do still help by increasing salivation and thus soothing a sore throat. It's simply that the sugar in the drop does not actually do enough for the FDA to consider it a drug.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I programmed the production line for listerine in Lititz PA.  The original answer is correct: the flavor ingredients are oils. But the alcohol put into listerine never was clinically necessary.
Interesting facts about listerine manufacturing :
1 blue green and gold are made on one huge line called CALM(continuous automated listerine manufacturing ,all the rest are made in a large batching Suite in smaller batches.  The equipment used to make the blue green and gold is called a metering pump. It's a very cool technology look it up.  </p>
<ol>
<li>Even though the mouthwash has alcohol which kills bacteria.  the equipment is cleaned regularly because it's more expensive to prove that you can produce indefinetly and never clean.
3.it takes 2 to 5 people to make the world's supply of listerine (not including support or packaging staff) </li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Menthol, thymol, methyl salicylate, and eucalyptol- those are the active ingredients of listerine and they are all organic molecules. You need polar nonaqueous solvent to dissolve these chemicals and alcohol is a clear choice being cheap and safe. Just like any chemical, alcohol is unsafe beyond a certain point and claim of cancer from alcohol falls into that category. Be within noted dose and you will be safe. Even though they say alcohol is inactive ingredient, I doubt. Most bacteria/fungus will in contact with alcohol.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
