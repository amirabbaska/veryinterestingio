		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Without going to much into detail (this is ELI5 after all):</p>
<p>Why Japan is not facing a crisis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Japans debt has a very low interest rate, which makes it easier to pay off.</li>
<li>Japan is a rich country, and so it can afford to pay off the interest it owes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>edit:</strong> thanks to u/mustbemoney for reminding me:</p>
<ul>
<li>A significant amount of Japans debt is owned by the Bank of Japan. In effect one branch of gov owns the others debt, obviously BoJ is going to be more lenient with the Gov than EU with Greece.</li>
</ul>
<p>Why Greece is in trouble:</p>
<ul>
<li>Its debt is at a high interest rate</li>
<li>Its debt is attached to a currency it has no control over, the <strong>EURO</strong>. If their debt was in Greek Drachma's (currency prior to euro), In an extreme and unlikely scenario,It could print out more money and pay off its debt (this would of course make it harder for them to raise money in the future, since investors will not trust them. This would also lead to inflation. It would also cause other stuff I am not qualified to ELI5 because of their complexity)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, I'm pretty sure you're thinking: &quot;But isn't GDP the Wealth of a country? I mean, if I'm making 50k a year and I owe 50K in loans, aren't I better off than a guy who makes 100k a year but owes 300k?&quot;</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, GDP is an indicator of a Countries Wealth, <strong>not its Governments Wealth</strong>. Greece's government doesn't &quot;make&quot; the GDP, it makes what it can tax from the GDP, and then after it is done with government spending it can use what's left to start paying off debt. What's left is very little because of multiple factors, some of which but not all are:</p>
<p>edit: to be clear, the </p>
<ul>
<li>The Governments inability to get people to actually pay taxes (they're doing better than they used to).</li>
<li>The fact that raising taxes and/or cutting social programs <strong>will</strong> slow down the economy making it harder to make more money.     </li>
<li>Some social programs cannot feasibly be cut (e.i: the Greek version of social security) or risk destroying the country
-Greece is not growing very fast for various complicated reasons (aging pop is one)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong></p>
<p>To use the example of :</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Guy A</strong> that makes 50k a year and owes 50k </li>
<li><strong>Guy B</strong> that makes 100k a year and owes 300k</li>
</ul>
<p>If <strong>Guy A</strong> has expenses of 45k a year (rent,food,etc..), he will only have 5k left to pay off debt. </p>
<p>If <strong>Guy B</strong> on the other hand could have expenses of 60k a year and will have 40k a year to pay of his debt, making him better off than <strong>Guy A</strong></p>
<p>I'd like to add that Japan's huge debt is a big concern, but since they are able to afford their interest payments, they have lower interest payments, which makes their interest rates lower, which makes it easier to afford their interest payments, which....</p>
<p>Because I just had this argument with a friend I'm going to add something here:
The <strong>BoJ</strong> has the power to print more money to fulfill interest payments not the Japanese government. This means the BoJ could refuse to print money to pay debt obligations (in a worst case scenario), but in reality wouldn't because of the negative effects (i.e Japan defaulting). Clarifying that here.</p>
<p>Also typos...
more typos...
Jeeze... so many typos !</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of Japan's money is owed to itself, and in Yen. So if the value of the Yen falls...the debt is still basically the same. And it's Japanese citizens and Japanese banks that own most of the debt. Japan only has to answer to Japan. And Japan has enough money and is rich enough to pay off all its debt and to pay for what it needs. If the country needs more money, it can get it from the Japanese people and banks. </p>
<p>Greece had debts in the Euro. It's debts were controlled by foreigners.  The Greek economy went bad, and it was German and French banks that wanted money back. The economy went down and it couldn't pay its citizens or the debt. And it couldn't get more money from its own citizens. </p>
<p>The UK, after the Napoleonic Wars, had a debt to GDP ratio of over 250%.  And it was almost 250% after WW2. </p>
<p>It's not about the size of the debt, it's about the ability to make the payments. Japan is rich; Greece was poor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan is a middle-aged doctor who took out a second mortgage maybe they shouldn't have.  They are still wealthy, still have a great, high income job, so people are willing take more chances loaning them money, even if the debt is starting to pile up.  If worse comes to worst, they can always sell their vacation condo to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Greece is an assistant manager at Kinkos, who lied on a bunch of credit card applications and lived too large for a few years until it all caught up with them.  Even though they owe less than Japan, even as a ratio to their income, their job is much less stable, so the interest is higher and their creditors are much less patient.  They also live in their parents' basement, so they have no house to sell to get them out of trouble.  And most worrying, they haven't assumed responsibility for the mess they made and spend most of their time blaming other people rather than trying to fix it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Japan owes most of its debt to its own people and at a quasi non-existing interest rate. It's like they owe 200,000 USD at 0.05%, and have an income of 100K a year, so they need to pay 100 bucks every year. They can afford that.</p>
<p>Greece owes most of its debt to outsiders and at a much higher interest rate. It's like they owe 5,000 USD at 10%, with a 5K a year income, so they must shelve 500 USD every year. That's already a much more significant amount.</p>
<p>So Greece must pay five times what Japan has to pay although its debt is much smaller. Then you consider that Japan's population is 12 times higher, this means, per person, Greek people must pay 60 times what Japanese do.</p>
<p>That's the reason why Japan is not in dire straits but Greece is: Japan owes money to itself, at 0% interest rate while Greece owes money to the mafia at high interest rate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of Japan's debt is owed to the government of Japan.  And what debt Japan owes to private bond holders is owed in a currency it controls.  Japan can print their way out of debt should they wish, but doing so increases their costs of lending and is not sustainable long-term.  Which is why the Japanese have taken steps to decrease their long-term debt.</p>
<p>Greece, on the other hand, owes a bunch of countries, mainly Germany and France, a shit-load of money in Euros.  Since Greece can't just print Euros, they have to actually earn them through tax revenue.  Additionally, the Greek bailout came with onerous terms for the country that many, including the Greeks, believe will make the debt impossible to payback.</p>
<p>The ECB also caps the amount of debt that any one nation may hold, and it is unclear what they will do should Greece exceed this cap.</p>
<p>The Financial Times has a great primer on the subject, but it's behind a pay wall.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
