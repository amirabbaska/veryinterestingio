		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personally, it's stress that causes that irritability/restlessness. Cortisol keeps your body in a continued mode of being alert and ready to fight/run. Exercise lowers cortisol levels, eliminating stress and causes your body to relax the tension it has built up. Stress usually means that your body doesn't feel comfortable with your current situation, unsure if you are safe and/or are able to relax. Unfamiliar situations, sudden life changes, daunting work, sleep deprivation, and poor diet can increase stress levels. Exercise lowers stress levels and promotes relaxation. </p>
<p>(Exercise lowers circulating cortisol levels)
