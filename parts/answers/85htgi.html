		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Streaming services are the last to acquire rights to the video because they represent the customer segment with the lowest profit margins.</p>
<p>Why should a customer pay more to see the movie in a cinema/airplane when they can watch it at home anytime they want? The airlines are willing to pay a higher price per customer to capture passengers, and movie theatres are willing to pay even more, which is why they get the rights in that order.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would have expected that airplanes offered a lower risk profile for a commodity monetised on accessibility and &quot;newness&quot;. Ergo, should the film be &quot;compromised&quot; (recorded/uploaded/widely accessible) it would bring considerably less revenue. </p>
<p>The nice thing about a plane is that it's almost impossible to take the film away. You probably can't hack in out of the in-flight system (I know some people can), you can't sit there with a camcorder and even if you could, the screen is small so the quality would suck. It's low-risk to give them a new release.</p>
<p>People however can &quot;engineer&quot; something out of Netflix/Amazon surprisingly easily.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They get it fast because they pay for them. </p>
<p>The movie studios allow it because it's much harder to pirate on a plane than it is from your home.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Airlines pay premium money per view to get some selected movies quickly.</p>
<p>Movies (and other content) move through what's called &quot;windows&quot;, periods of time where they are available in different distribution channels. These include (with some approximate revenue numbers)</p>
<p>1) theaters
$10+ per person, studios get most of that (cinemas make money off popcorn).</p>
<p>2) DVD / Pay-per view (Amazon, YouTube, Apple, etc.).
$10 for a &quot;family&quot; and revenue shared with Amazon/Apple, etc. So maybe $2 per person viewing.</p>
<p>4) Subscriptions (Cable, Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc.)
At $10/month for unlimited viewing, the revenue is now down to cents, maybe tens of cents max, per viewer. This is one reason why content on Neflix and Prime has typically been out for years on DVD. Once people stop buying DVDs even on the $3 discount rack, content hits the subscription business.</p>
<p>5) Broadcast / Youtube (ads supported)
Really old stuff is on free broadcast and Youtube. Revenue from ads will be fractions of a cent per view (say $4 per thousand views)</p>
<p>Airlines may be paying the studios a few bucks per view to get popular new movies, but it could be less, if the studio considers it marketing. Flyers who would never pay for this movie in theaters will watch it because of lack of choice, and the airline prefers to get a few bucks from them rather than nothing.</p>
<p>It's similar for content made for TV, with the addition of live content, which could be subscription (e.g. ESPN) or pay per view (e.g. some boxing matches). </p>
<p>TV shows are also interesting. Early seasons of Game of Thrones were only available on HBO cable and the goal was to increase subscriptions, and hit DVDs later. But with HBO Now, they became basically pay per view, as you could sign up just for one or two months when they come out, then discontinue.</p>
<p>Revenues also vary widely between geographies and popularity of content. And e.g. on Broadcast, the studio is not actually paid per view, but through some formulas. With YouTube ads, they may be paid based on the ads revenue.</p>
<p>Some other interesting situations</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>DVD rentals, Netflix/redbox is an exception that makes studios very unhappy because they don't get paid per rental. In the US, courts have so far protected this business. </p>
</li>
<li>Bundles of DVD and online are interesting, too, as they raise the question of whether you can buy the bundle, then sell/rent the DVD and sell the online rights. This is being litigated right now between Disney and Red Box.</li>
</ul>
<p>-Amazon may have rights for Prime just for the US. So if you travel, your content is no longer available.</p>
<p>-I saw Amazon's &quot;The Big Sick&quot; on a plane before I noticed it on Prime. So Amazon was trying to monetize it better than Prime could, and it's advertising. They likely gave a really good price to the airlines.</p>
<p>Piracy comes into play right away, sometimes before content hits theaters. I doubt it's a big consideration when favoring planes.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a very complicated mess :-)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work for a major In-Flight Entertainment System manufacturer.  The Airlines don't want to mess around with all this stuff, they want a &quot;turn key&quot; system.  So we not only provided the entertainment system, but we also periodically send them &quot;big hard drives&quot; with all, currently in theater movies.  So we have deals with some major movie distributors that allow us to basically treat the Aircraft as a movie theater.  We load the movies on the &quot;hard disk&quot; so that when the plane is down for maintenance, they can just swap out to the latest movies.  We also own a satellite company that allows us to provide wireless internet on board.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
