		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many plants are programmed to begin senescence after reaching maturity and setting seed- without a lot of artificial intervention they will not live past their programmed lifespan. This can be as little as a few weeks with some early spring annuals to many decades, in the case of some species of bamboo, where even all divisions of a plant flower and die at the same time wherever they are in the world. On the other hand many perennial plants don't seem to have anything inherent to their development stopping them from living indefinitely</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If I remember correctly, cancer can also occur in plant cells. However, the plant cancer can't metastasize because of the cell walls. </p>
<p>Instead, giant knots called galls (or burls) form in the plant. Over time, this may lead to blockage of the xylem and phloem, preventing parts of the plant from receiving water and essential nutrients. </p>
<p>As the plant gets older, all the galls combined might kill the plant. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TL;DR: plants can get cancer, as more cancer growths appear, chances of plant death increase.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In general, yes. However, there are plants with negligible senescence (their likelihood of dying isn't age influenced so they don't die of old age). </p>
<p>There are also some grey areas. What does it mean for a plant to die? If it clones itself, is it still living? If there is a colony of many tree connected with a single root system, is that one plant? We have several clonal plants like with ages &gt;10 000. Pando is the oldest plant and heaviest organism, an aspen colony with a single root system. It's estimated to be around 80 000 years old. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
