		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A few things led up to this. </p>
<p>First, it's been considered that one way to resolve the issue of information loss in black holes is that the information isn't encoded in the volume of the hole, but the area. That is to say, small fluctuations in the event horizon- the surface- of the black hole carry all of the information for the entire hole. The rationale for this is somewhat involved, and hard to explain &quot;ELI5&quot;, but... a black hole is as much information as you can cram into a given space. That concept &quot;as much information as you can cram into a particular space&quot; has a name, &quot;Bekenstein bound&quot;. That bound is defined by the <em>square</em> of the radius of any region, not the <em>cube</em>... that means the area, and not the volume of a region defines it's total entropic capacity.</p>
<p>So... if that's the case it's argued by some, since that's true of any region (not just black holes), maybe the universe itself is composed of information encoded on a 2D boundary, not within a 3D volume. In essence, we'd be like a soap bubble, rather than a softball. </p>
<p>It doesn't <em>really</em> matter to you and I and our daily lives though; it doesn't imply some kind of unreality or ephemeral nature to things. All it says is that our perception of three dimensions is only valid on the macroscopic scales and very low energy levels we live our lives at. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think this one is a case of over-interpretation of scientific language by laypeople. Colloquially we use the term &quot;hologram&quot; to refer to some form of 3d image or illusion without substance such as the ones on credit cards or 3d displays. Which leads to these &quot;uuuh, is our world just a simulation?&quot; type ideas.</p>
<p>To a physicist it just means: some physical property inside this volume can be determined/reproduced by what happens on its surface. Somewhat similar to how I can determine the trajectory of a thrown object by only knowing its velocity and position at a single point in time. That doesn't imply that the remainder of the trajectory is &quot;just a simulation&quot; or &quot;not real&quot;.</p>
<p>The connection between these two terms is of course that you can use the physicists idea of hologram to produce a hologram in the 3d picture sense. This is due to wave phenomena such as light but also sound having exactly this property. If you can capture the wave field on some 2d surface surrounding a volume you can reconstruct what the wave field inside the volume looks like. Classic holograms work exactly like this. You bounce a laser off an object and bring it to interference with a reference laser beam and record the resulting interference pattern on a photographic plate. Which is like a fingerprint of the wave field. If you then shine only the reference beam back at the recorded pattern it reproduces the original wave field which our eyes interpret as an image of the object.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know those <a href="http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02763/hologram_2763844k.jpg" target="_blank">hologram stickers on old credit cards</a>?  Those are flat, 2-dimensional surfaces, but they are able to create a 3-D image when we look at it.  The idea is the same with a holographic universe: the universe would really be 2-dimensional, it just encodes information in a way that makes it appear 3-dimensional.</p>
<p>TLDR: The universe is one big flat credit card hologram sticker.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
