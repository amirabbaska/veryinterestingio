<p>In short, no. If it has a measurable viscosity, it isn't a &quot;true&quot; solid. </p>
<p>The popular definitions of &quot;liquid&quot; and &quot;solid&quot; don't rigorously exist in the science of rheology, which is the field that deals with how things flow (or don't flow). </p>
<p>Some things are purely viscous, and they clearly <em>behave</em> like liquids. Other things are purely elastic, and they clearly <em>behave</em> like solids. But a wide range of things have both viscous and elastic components, so they don't fall entirely under either definition. Some materials, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_fluid" target="_blank">complex fluids</a> can be a mixture of solids and liquids, and collectively behave much differently than the individual components.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>TLDR: You can pick your criterion, but materials can exhibit flow despite being called solids and liquid materials can break like solids despite being able to &quot;flow&quot;.</p>
<p>There are some good answers here but I wanted to add some technical boundaries and explanations...</p>
<p>As others have stated, a liquid colloquially means something that flows to fill the container around it under gravity. In materials science, a liquid is defined by a non-infinite zero shear viscosity, i.e. does it hold its own shape with infinitesimally small forces on it, much smaller than just gravity.</p>
<p>In reality, materials typically exhibit a viscoelastic behavior, specifically, if you push on them for a &quot;short&quot; time they elastically deform and go back to their original shape, but if you keep pushing for a &quot;long&quot; time they plastically (permanently) deform. This is characterized by the storage (G' or &quot;G prime&quot;) and loss (G'' or &quot;G double prime&quot;) viscoelastic moduli. G' characterizes the elastic behavior while G'' characterizes the viscous behavior. These values are time dependent, but this is characterized as frequency dependent as typically measured by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheometer" target="_blank">rheometer</a>. In general, if you go to short enough timescales (high frequency) all materials will act as a solid, or even brittle, this is true for water, steel, honey, glass, etc. The timescale and frequency required for this just depends on the material.</p>
<p>Colloquially, we look at liquids as things like water or honey, and solids like ice. These go through a melting point where the viscoelastic behavior undergoes a discontinuous change with changing temperatures. These are called 1st order transitions, where a discontinuous change occurs in thermodynamic properties with the 1st derivative (heat capacity etc.). This is in contrast to things like a glass transition which undergo a continuous change in the 1st derivative only showing a discontinuity in the second derivative, being clever, these are called second order transitions.</p>
<p>Okay, actual numbers now... Water has a viscosity of 0.01 Poise (P) = 1cP at 20 C, Honey is ~100 P. Glass (silicon dioxide potentially with additives like soda and lime) is probably the best characterized and well known material that undergoes a liquid to solid transition that is not discontinuous. It also forms the basis for the characteristics of where <strong>engineers</strong> define liquids and solids. For glass, the &quot;melting point&quot; is defined where the material flows readily under its own weight or 10^2 P (like honey). The glass &quot;working point&quot; where you see glassblowers work is 10^4 P. The &quot;softening point&quot; (where it starts to deform at longer times^(minutes to hours) under some stress) is approximately 10^6 - 10^8 P (depends on who is defining it). The &quot;glass transition temperature&quot; or T<em><em>g</em></em> is defined at 10^13 P and the &quot;strain point&quot; is 10^14.5 P (where you can no longer anneal out stresses within the glass). See <a href="http://www.glass-ts.com/temperature-viscosity" target="_blank">here</a>. For reference, the strain point of window glass is at about 450 C whereas high temperature glasses may have a strain point near 650-700 C, and fused silica (pure SiO<em><em>2</em></em>) has a strain point of ~1070 C. For the glass connoisseurs out there, the Ficktive temperature has more to do with free volume than with viscosity.</p>
<p>Random aside, the myth that glass flows at room temperature is false, old window panes were most commonly installed with the thick side down (though some were done opposite that), see <a href="http://www.cmog.org/article/does-glass-flow" target="_blank">here</a> and many many other places.</p>
<p>These definitions from the glass industry gives us a good start to look at. At T<em><em>g</em></em>, the viscosity is diverging and the material is said to be vitrifying (or vitrified at T&lt;T<em><em>g</em></em>) and this behavior happens for many materials including organic, polymeric, or even metal systems. You can create metallic glasses which is an odd thing to think about.</p>
<p>In addition to these statements with glass, I wanted to add that solids can also flow like liquids. Aluminum is a solid when crystallized and is by colloquial terms a solid. When heated and under some stress, aluminum moves or &quot;creeps&quot;. This is common to materials when heated to near their melting point (~2/3 the melting T in Kelvin or Rankine) due to motion of the individual atoms (or molecules in general) in response to some external stress or even gravity. In the case of aluminum, it can deform faster than glass at T<em><em>g</em></em> when just below the melting temperature.</p>
<p>So in reality, you can pick your criterion, creep is typically not called flow, nor aluminum below the melting temperature called a viscoelastic fluid, yet it has fluid like qualities. Honey is typically called a fluid, yet you can get it to fracture like steel if you hit it fast enough. Your definition of liquid and solid depend purely on the timescale you are looking at (and temperatures the material experiences). If it doesn't deform plastically on your timescale -- it is a solid, if it moves more than you want it to, then liquid. =-]</p>
<p>At this point, I am amazed you made it to here so kudos to you. Cheers!</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Edit2: As someone pointed out, peanut butter and cement are bad examples because they're mixtures of both. There isn't really a cut off point because liquid v. solid are two different phases defined by things other than viscosity. Viscosity is the resistance to continuous shear deformation but it only really applies to fluids. It gets messy at large time frames and very low rates. </p>
<p>There are big ranges of things that are not really solid or liquid, think of peanut butter or cement before it sets. One way to define it is by the mechanism of flow. Metal will flow at very long times because of diffusion and not viscous flow. The classic definition of a liquid is something that flows under its own weight so peanut butter would not be a liquid but it's not really solid either.  </p>
<p>Glass is interesting because it viscosity vs temperature curve is continuous and asymptotic. There is no phase transition, it only gets more viscous until it doesn't flow at all. There's no way to put a cut off because there's no point where you can say it's liquid but at -1 degree it's solid.</p>
<p>TLDR: liquid and solid are insufficient terms for defining the range of materials we have.  </p>
<p>Edit: &quot;Under it's own weight&quot; is maybe an insufficient way to say a fluid without a yield stress which means it will flow at an infinitesimally small shear stress. So the shear rate vs shear stress curve goes to the origin instead of hitting a minimum stress for shear deformation.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p><a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/worlds-slowest-moving-drop-caught-on-camera-at-last/" target="_blank">this experiment</a> shows how 'pitch' (asphalt) is actually a liquid. A scientist set up a funnel, filled with pitch, to watch it 'drip' like a liquid (at room temperature). It takes 7 to 13 years for a drop to fully form, then 1/10th of a second to actually drip. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you care for an answer from a materials scientist: when the viscosity of molten glass (a disordered, interconnected liquid) exceeds 10^12 pa•s, that glass is no longer considered a liquid and becomes a solid (disordered, with the same structure as the liquid - there is no crystallization). The distinction is made based on a calculation of the ability for the structure to relax or crystallize - basically, at a high enough viscosity, there is more opposition to atomic movement than driving force for favorable transformations and rearrangements. This happens to be right around 10^12 pa•s. </p>
<p>You can physically observe this transition using Differential Thermal Analysis, where the point is marked by a subtle change in the internal energy of the sample. </p>
<p>Now, at viscosities barely below 10^12 pa•s, liquids will still be very resistant to flow. To get any measurable flow rate on the macroscale you need to have a viscosity below ~10^10 or 10^9 pa•s, which is about where glass blowers try to keep their material during the process. </p>
<p>Most liquids will crystallize long before their viscosities reach anywhere near 10^12 pa•s. That's why glass formation is the exception rather than the rule. If you're interested, look up the glass transformation temperature and compare some different materials' properties!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
