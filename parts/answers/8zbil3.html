*Coffee cherries are their own fruit from the coffee tree.  We do not make coffee from the pits of the cherries we eat.  Please do not try this.  You could die. Thank you.</p>
<p>First off, remember that coffee is the roasted seed of a cherry that is pulverized in a grinder, while tea is actual dried leaves from the tea plant.  Because we can grind coffee really coarsely or super fine, we control the extraction time to get the proper strength from the coffee.  Finer grind has more surface area (i.e. espresso), and we can get all the good stuff out in under 30 seconds.  A big, coarse grind like for french press, can take 4 minutes.  As for why we don't use coffee bags regularly, it's for a couple of reasons.  Coffee stales very quickly once ground, much faster than tea.  It also has to do with 'fines'.  Because coffee is a brittle, organic seed, when it is ground, you get a range of particles from large to small.  You'd need a bag permeable enough to let the coffee steep and for water to move through it, but also not allow all of the fine particles through.  This is simple with gravity brewing like pour over or drip because the water will eventually get out.  It's not really moving if it is in a bag in a cup, so the filter would have to allow for the smaller stuff to wind up in the cup and your coffee will be 'muddy'.  This happens with french press too, and some people enjoy the body of this type of coffee for that reason.</p>
<p>Tea, on the other hand, more or less behaves the same, and needs to be steeped for several minutes to get the most flavor from it.  Chopping the leaves up finer helps somewhat, but it seriously affects the flavor of the tea, as breaking the leaves causes them to lose a lot of their essential oils and flavor.  If you've ever had a really nice loose leaf black tea next to, say, Liptons bagged tea, there's no comparison.  So, yes, you could mill up tea leaves small enough to make a drip machine make 'tea', but it probably wouldn't be very nice.</p>
<p>Your last question about cocoa - Chocolate is the most complicated process of the 3.  Cacao beans are fermented, dried, roasted, dechaffed, ground, pressed with sugar, blended with cocoa liquor....  It's a crazy process that I can't understand how we figured out it was possible in the first place.  If the roasted 'cocoa bean', or cacao nib were just ground up and steeped, it would be very bitter, and probably not to your taste, but this was basically what was drank by the ancient peoples of Mesoamerica (with added chili and spices for some fire).  Instead, we just make sweetened cocoa powder that is ground super fine, kinda water soluble and we drink the 'grinds', unlike coffee.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I would argue that a French press is pretty similar to the way we make loose-leaf tea. As others have said, the tea leaves need more contact with the water so a drip-type coffee maker wouldn't work with regular tea.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Cold brew is basically making tea without a bag, just not using heat. I guess its more like sun tea. And there definitely is a drink made up of ground cocoa beans like coffee. I don't know the name of it but had some in the Dominican Republic. It was literally just &quot;coffee&quot; made with roasted cocoa beans. It was really good, tasted like dark chocolate.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Every morning I choose three different teas to mix together along with a bit of coffee. I put the raw ingredients into a cup without a bag or anything, add hot water, add milk, and then drink it through a straw with a filter on the end as to not sip up tea leaves/coffee grounds. Before I got really into tea, I would put 2/3 coffee and 1/3 tea into my coffee machine and it also worked perfectly fine.</p>
<p>The method i currently use is more effective for tea than it is coffee, and my old method is more effective for coffee because coffee's optimal temperature is higher than tea, but both methods certainly work for both.</p>
<p>Edit: since this seems to bother people, on my days off I'll typically have about 4 or 5 cups of this, and when I work I usually have about 3. I pee roughly every 45 minutes or so.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
