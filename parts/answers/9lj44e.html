		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the time we don't have the tools to find something.</p>
<p>We don't have a clear confirmation of anything orbiting exoplanets. There is a very strong indication that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1SWASP_J140747.93-394542.6" target="_blank">this planet</a> has rings and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-1625b" target="_blank">Kepler-1625 b</a> probably has a moon, but that's it.</p>
<ul>
<li>We haven't found any trojans (orbiting 60 degree ahead/behind of a planet) outside the solar system.</li>
<li>We haven't found co-orbital planets similar to the moons <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janus_(moon\)" target="_blank">Janus</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epimetheus_(moon\)" target="_blank">Epimetheus</a> around Saturn.</li>
<li>We haven't found &quot;rings&quot; of several planets sharing the same orbit. Theoretically stable if there are enough planets but I'm not aware of plausible formation mechanisms.</li>
<li>As far as I know we don't know any system where different planets orbit in completely different planes.</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This would just count as interesting orbits, but there's a few known stable/non-chaotic solutions to the 3-body problem which could physically exist as an orbital system (but are unlikely to form in nature).</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0181" target="_blank">https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0181</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/03/physicists-discover-whopping-13-new-solutions-three-body-problem" target="_blank">https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2013/03/physicists-discover-whopping-13-new-solutions-three-body-problem</a></p>
<p>They're interesting because orbital systems with 3 or more objects of comparable mass are usually inherently chaotic, so it wasn't expected that stable solutions would be found.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know how Charon and Pluto orbit around each other and Charon has a pretty significant mass compared to Pluto so that their barycenter is outside of Pluto? Technically it could be possible for two gas giants to orbit in the same way, around each other and together around the star. But I don't think we found that kind of an example.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
