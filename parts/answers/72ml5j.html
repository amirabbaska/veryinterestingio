		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Fear is generally a learned response in humans rather than being present from birth. Whenever a human is observing another human as being a role model, the observer sees the response taken by the role model, and is more likely to recreate that response in the future. Because of this, it's easy to pass on your fear of bugs to another person, as long as that person's subconscious processing thinks you are worth learning from. </p>
<p>On the other hand, some fears are present from birth as a defensive response to tell an animal to run away when presented with a dangerous situation. Most animals don't fear bugs simply because bugs don't do anything to the animal. But if you put a cucumber behind a cat while it's eating, it will panic and run away because it is born with a fear of snakes, and the cat's innate processing mistakes the cucumber for a threat. </p>
<p>It's likely that our original fear of bugs did come from the knowledge that certain bugs can have bad or even deadly effects on us, which then spread the mentality that we should be afraid of all bugs. For an animal to fear that same bug, it would have to be because of a survival instinct, unless the animal somehow also learned to fear bugs.</p>
<p>Edit: apparently the cucumber/snake thing with cats may not be 100% scientific, but it was the first example that came to mind when thinking of innate fears.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My daughter grew up never afraid of insects or spiders.. then one day..  when she was 5.. she went to daycare for the first time.. and there she met a bunch of little girls who were raised to be idiots and to scream at spiders.  And &quot;POOF&quot; my kid was suddenly afraid of spiders too!  Humans have taught one and other to be scared of insects.. humans also grow up watching their parents swish insects, spray, them.. or scream when they see them in the house.. so they learn the same behaviors.. and when a kid sees an adult scream a bit at an insect.. you can get the kid starts being more afraid of it than the adult was!</p>
<p>Most other animals eat insects.. birds.. cats.. dogs.. all will eat insects.  Paleolithic man ate insects too.. even some other cultures eat them quite freely.  Some cultures react to them with fear or general disgust.  It does become &quot;learned&quot; to an extent, but we also know some spiders can be poisonous, and some insects can be &quot;bad&quot; and we do pass that on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Weird. because I have a dog who is scared of almost all tiny critters. Once we saw a giant house spider we showed it to our dog and he ran up the stairs! Minutes later when he decided to come down, before he stepped on the last stair he made sure the coast is clear.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've always wondered this too. Specifically why bugs seem to be the only thing which is not at least perceived as &quot;cute&quot; in its infantile/neotenous stage. Even fish and crabs are arguably &quot;cute&quot;. And most people would never kill a baby mouse or rat even though it's a pest and is likely more germy than a baby spider (I accidentally killed an infesting mouse trying to catch him years ago and I still feel bad). However, most people would kill a baby spider without a second thought; and this reality feels visceral to me but I suppose it could be cultural. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let me actually propose that it comes down to our skin.</p>
<p>You see, most animals either have very tough skin, or a good coat of fur. That makes it less noticeable when bugs crawl on them, and adds an extra layer of protection against bites, stings, fluids, etc.</p>
<p>But humans are pretty naked, and hence vulnerable and sensitive.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
