		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong>Short answer:</strong> White. Neutron stars are simply white hot. </p>
<p><strong>Long answer:</strong> Surface temperature of a neutron star is in the neighborhood of 1 million K. This has a peak blackbody spectra around a few nanometers, well below the 400 nm or so cutoff of the visible spectra. The visible spectra is just going to be an enormous blindingly bright wall of mixed light. </p>
<p>If you put on really really really thick sunglasses, you should be able to see the preference for blue. And even though the light will be redshifted by about 25%, that shouldn't really effect the spectra you see all that much. For every photon that's redshifted out of the range of human sight, another will be redshifted in from the ultraviolet, so it should more or less look the same, whether or not you consider general relativistic effects. </p>
<p>If you wait many many many billions (trillions?) of years, they'll eventually cool to a few thousand Kelvin, and their black body curve will begin to peak in the visible spectra, so the white/blue hotness will fade to a red hotness, before eventually they turn black with the heat death of the universe. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are blue-white as their emission peak is far above visible (even once you account for gravitational redshifting).</p>
<p>Here is an article about the first observation of a neutron star in the visible part of the spectrum:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When looking at the location of the x-ray source, called RX J185635-3754, with the Hubble Space Telescope, they saw a dim blue light that proved the source was a neutron star. &quot;There's really nothing else, no [other] astronomical source that could account for it,&quot; says Matthews, as nothing else could be so x-ray bright while being so dim in visible light.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Why would you need to filter the nonvisible EM frequencies to see a neutron star's color? Reducing the strength of the light -- or any nearby interfering visible light source -- sure, but if the light isn't visible, it's not affecting the color we see, is it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
