		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Barring actual binding like in this case, whether a surface is slippery or sticky depends on relative surface energies. In this case, since you're talking about wetting a surface, the difference in surface energy between water and the surface is low, so the water will adhere and spread out on the surface. Now you have something else that touches the surface. Whether the water likes to be in contact with that something else (which is dictated by whether the energy decreases or not), it will either want to stick together instead of being in contact with air (as it would be if it wasn't touching), or it will like the air more and won't want to stick to the other thing. If it doesn't want to stick to the other thing, then water instead reduces friction by essentially smoothing out all the micropits in the surface, which causes it to be slippery. Remember that friction is just caused by the fact that surfaces are rough, and have all sorts of jagged edges and pits. When things rub on each other, these edges can get caught on the pits, which is the cause of friction.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I haven't dealt with free film lubrication since college (and only very briefly), but here goes. Apologies for errors.</p>
<p>Water makes things slippery largely through seperation of the two surfaces - think like a puck on a air hockey table, only much thinner. If you have two flat, smooth surfaces - like, say, a drink glass on a varnished table - it can work very well. </p>
<p>When the surfaces are rough or porous, the water being squished between the surfaces can move out of the way instead of keeping them seperate, and so doesn't work as well. This is the idea behind grooves cut in tyres, rough asphalt, and even your fingerprints.</p>
<p>Water can also help to keep things stick together, though - like with suction cups on a window. Because water is a lot &quot;thicker&quot; and denser than air, it is harder to push through the microscopic gaps under the edge of the cup, in turn helping to seal the edge and maintain a vacuum. Two very flat pieces of metal can be briefly stuck together in the same way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
