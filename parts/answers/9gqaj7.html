If we are referring to the taxonomic class within <em>Arthropoda</em>, insects are known to undergo a period of less activity, with intermittent periods of higher activity. Insects can be diurnal, nocturnal and crepuscular(active at dawn and/or dusk).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Abstract from Shaw et al, <em>Science</em> (2000):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Drosophila exhibits a circadian rest-activity cycle, but it is not known whether fly rest constitutes sleep or is mere inactivity. It is shown here that, like mammalian sleep, rest in Drosophila is characterized by an increased arousal threshold and is homeostatically regulated independently of the circadian clock. As in mammals, rest is abundant in young flies, is reduced in older flies, and is modulated by stimulants and hypnotics. Several molecular markers modulated by sleep and waking in mammals are modulated by rest and activity in Drosophila, including cytochrome oxidase C, the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone protein BiP, and enzymes implicated in the catabolism of monoamines. Flies lacking one such enzyme, arylalkylamine N-acetyltransferase, show increased rest after rest deprivation. These results implicate the catabolism of monoamines in the regulation of sleep and waking in the fly and suggest that Drosophila may serve as a model system for the genetic dissection of sleep.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To sum this up, not only do insects (in this case fruit flies) sleep, their sleep is quite like mammalian sleep, both in overt structure (&quot;schedule&quot;: they have regular wake/sleep cycles, sleep debt, decline with age, etc) and in its molecular mechanisms; other research has shown that it has similar genetic basis and similar neural mechanisms.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
