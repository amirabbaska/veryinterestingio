<p>The noise of a gun is caused by the high-pressure gases escaping out of the barrel as soon as the bullet exits; it's kinda like the bullet uncorks the gun and the gases &quot;pop&quot; like champagne.  A suppressor adds some chambers to the process so the gases &quot;fizz&quot; out instead of &quot;popping&quot; out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To reduce the &quot;BANG&quot; of a gunshot, you have two things you have to fight:</p>
<ol>
<li>The explosive gasses</li>
<li>The supersonic crack of the bullet</li>
</ol>
<p>To reduce the sound of the explosion, the suppressor has a series of chambers that slow the expansion of the explosion. As the gasses hit each section, the gasses have to squeeze through restrictions then expand again on the other side... This takes the energy out of the explosion in steps.  Imagine the difference in sound between popping a balloon with a pin and letting the air out slowly. Same volume of air is moved, just less violence. </p>
<p>&#x200B;</p>
<p>Now that still leaves the supersonic crack. Picture a whip, that crack is the tip of the whip breaking the sound barrier. So anything moving fast enough will create that crack. You can eliminate or reduce this by slowing the bullet down. Example, a 9MM round that has a 115 grain projectile with 6 grains of powder will send the bullet faster than the speed of sound. So you may reduce the sound of the explosion, but you still get the sharp crack. To avoid this, you would load a 9MM round with a 147 grain projectile and about 3.5 grains of powder.  For a semi auto it is a balance between enough powder to cycle the action and not too much to avoid the supersonic crack. Too little powder and your semi auto acts like a bolt action, way to little powder and the projectile might not clear the barrel.  As a bonus: 45 cal is already subsonic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When guns fire, they produce superheated and pressurized gases. When the gases escape into the open, the dramatic change in environment causes the loud sound of a gun blast. So silencers work by making the transition more gradual for the gasses.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a &quot;labyrinth&quot; (realized as a series of baffles) inside the silencer that the expanding gases are forced through. This dissipates the acoustic energy.  </p>
<p>Suppressed weapons are still loud, though. A suppressed 9mm is still loud enough to incur temporary hearing damage. It's more about making the weapon not sound like a weapon than making it silent.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A supressor works much the same way a cars muffler works.</p>
<p>When you fire most moden guns, the firing pin strikes the primer which is essentially a blasting cap that ignites the gun powder inside the bullet cartridge. The expanding gasses have nowhere to escape, so they force the bullet out of the cartridge at a high velocity. The loud noise that you hear is the escaping gasses, or the &quot;explosion&quot;. </p>
<p>When you put a suppressor at the end of the barrel, it is basically a muffler, and has baffles for the gasses to escape into, slowing them down, which caused the sound to be reduced as there is less gas escaping through the end of the barrel. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
