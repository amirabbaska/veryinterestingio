<p>Everything starts out going all different directions, but just by chance there is a net angular momentum, and as everything collides that's going different directions, they all cancel out and fall into the center. You're left with only things that sum up to the net angular momentum of the system that are close to the average.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have mentioned, it's primarily because the gas and dust that made up the solar system was spinning and flattened out into a disk.  The gravitational interaction between planetoids (baby planets) wasn't great enough to fling themselves very far away from the orbital plane.</p>
<p>OK, with that being said, it's not impossible for a planet to orbit perpendicular to the orbital plane.  We have many comets that do.  What you would need is:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a small planet (Mercury to Earth sized) to interact with a huge planet (Jupiter or Saturn) very closely.  The big planet could fling the small planet in such a way as to be almost perpendicular to the orbital plane. If some other interactions occurred, it may eventually settle down into a stable orbit.</p>
</li>
<li>a small planet could be captured by the solar system.  Again, this would require interaction with a third body -- another small planet which could get flung out of the solar system or potentially a larger planet that could take some of the captured planet's energy.</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem with these two possibilities is that they are very statistically rare, so it's no surprise we don't see them in our solar system.  However, it's likely that this sort of thing has happened to some planetary system somewhere in our universe if not our galaxy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is not really true that all planets must orbit in line with the orbital plane or even all in the same direction. Mercury for example has a 7 degree inclination to the orbital plane which is the largest of the terrestrial/gas planets.. The dwarf planet Eris has an orbital inclination of almost 45 degrees.  If you want an example of a planet that does exactly what you ask then I give you WASP-79 b which is one of a number of planets found with polar orbits.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is true that in general planets will be closely aligned to the orbital plane at close distances to the host star but further out the mechanism of net angular momentum is far weaker due to a reduced density of the protoplanetary disk. This means that perturbations in a particles orbit requires far less energy. perturbations can be caused by a distant (if you want to know the mathematics behind this check out the Kozai-Lidov mechanism). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beyond this stars can also capture so called rogue planets which can orbit in the opposite direction and at any inclination. Estimates suggest there are twice as many planets in our galaxy without a star as there are stars in the galaxy. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In our own solar system it is thought Triton was a rogue moon caught by Neptune due to it being in a retrograde orbit (the other way round). Neptune itself is more evidence that the general structure people think of with planetary motion is not the full story as it has very high obliquity (the angle of the planets rotation relative to some other rotation axis often the host star). </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically orbits are crazy things and planets can be very surprising in their behaviour.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
