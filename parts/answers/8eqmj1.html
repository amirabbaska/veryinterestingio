		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chimpanzees really aren't that small. The average size of a male chimp is about 110 lbs and they can easily reach 150 lbs - with some males having reached over 200 lbs in captivity. If standing erect, males are over 5 ft. That's very similar to our average height and weight range - well, of a human female anyway.</p>
<p>Their muscle mass is easily equal to a humans. But the basic science as to how they're stronger than us is how their muscle fibers work.</p>
<p>Muscles are basically a bunch of ropes connected together. When you lift or pull something, the necessary muscles pull, like a crane. </p>
<p>Over the past million years or so, other primates have utilized &quot;fast fibers&quot; useful for sudden, tremendous effort - the rough maximum a human could lift is about 3 times our body weight (a 250 lbs powerlifter may be able to lift around 750 lbs). Chimps can lift around 5 times their body weight and pretty much all of them could be considered powerlifters - so, a 150 lbs chimpanzee would be as strong as the 250 lbs human (now, for fun, imagine what a 500 lbs Silverback Mountain Gorilla could lift - estimates of their strength run from 5 to 15(!) times what a human could lift. </p>
<p>Our muscles have developed for Endurance - we can run, walk, or do things much longer than other primates.</p>
<p>Let's say a chimp (or gorilla for that matter) tries to attack you; if it misses its first charge, a healthy human most likely could outrun and out-distance it fairly easily. </p>
<p>In fact, humans have one of the best endurances in nature. We can, in theory, run at a moderate speed for hours - and walk, literally, all day and night without stopping.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Chimps, pound for pound, <em>aren't</em> much stronger than humans. They just have different types of muscles to humans.<br />
Human muscles are designed for endurance. They're very efficient at working for longer lengths of time, with lower power output.<br />
Chimp muscles are designed for bursts of energy. They aren't very efficient and use lots of energy very quickly. This makes them excellent for the high bursts of energy required for climbing, jumping and so on, but not so great for walking great distances, particularly on two legs.  </p>
<p>If you compared a human's power output to a candle, a chimp's is like a camera flash.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While you have gotten good answers already, an important factor that hasn't been mentioned is the nervous system.</p>
<p>In todays society, your average human CNS isn't optimized for that kind of muscle control. This is why people can achieve great strength gains during their early gym career without putting on much mass. The first month or so is dominated by CNS development, enabling us to utilize our muscles in a more efficient manner.</p>
<p>Most animals don't have this problem, and are born with a well developed CNS, or at least develop it very early on.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Martial arts were originally developed by Monks observing how animals use their smaller mass to outfight larger animals. Animal bodies, like our own are systems of levers and pulleys. Humans can learn the optimal movements of these levers, harness momentum and manipulate their center of gravity like animals too.</p>
<p>Check out Aikido for an example of this.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading about an emotional connection to kinetic movement as well as the physiological differences.   </p>
<p>We donâ€™t really ever end up in situations where we have to use our full strength in general, but when we do, in times of extreme stress etc we are actually all a lot stronger than we think.   </p>
<p>Chimps being less developed than us from a critical thinking stand point, have a very strong link between emotion and movement so they can seemingly tap into their full physical abilities much more easily than we can.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
