		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite the common knowledge that space is &quot;cold,&quot; it's actually difficult to get rid of heat in a vacuum. Spacecraft without a highly reflective surface tend to absorb the sun's energy and heat up to the point of failure. Putting &quot;foil&quot; (which is actually a more advanced insulation) around satellites makes sure they can maintain a good operating temperature.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's thin insulating foil. It's made from a very thin and lightweight but strong mylar film, sprayed with vaporised aluminium which is very reflective but again very lightweight. All these properties make it very suitable for use as insulation round spacecraft to stop radiant heat from the sun building up and damaging them. </p>
<p>Also known as space blankets...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is referred to in the space community as Multi Layer Insulation (MLI). There are different types of it, the fancier stuff is made of alumnized polyimide (Kapton) which is where the gold color comes from. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-layer_insulation" target="_blank">This is a good basic read on how it works.</a></p>
<p>Depending on which way you have the outer and inner layers of the MLI configured you can have it both reflect solar energy and radiate heat, or retain heat while preventing radiation. So certain configurations will keep hot components hot and prevent them from losing heat to radiation, while other configurations will prevent heat from radiating into the component. It is also used to keep warmer spacecraft components (certain instruments, thrusters) from radiating heat to other parts of the spacecraft such as temperature-sensitive instruments. If you are interested in more detail about what MLI can do <a href="https://www.dunmore.com/products/multi-layer-films.html" target="_blank">check out Dunmore's website</a>. (I am not affiliated with them in any way but I have used their MLI before).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called MLI (Multi Layer Insulation). They have two different materials, alternatively arranged into a set and put over the satellites depending on the heat exposure allowed. In other places, special types of paints are used which again has various thermal properties. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are three types of heat transfer: conduction, convection, and radiation. When in space, radiation is the basically all you are dealing with. Radiation from the sun is quite intense and the foil they put on the space crafts is made to reflect the radiation. If you want more information it may be interesting to you to look up emissivity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
