		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Despite what you might think there aren't as many common medications available. Also, pharmacies only need to keep enough of any given medication in stock as long as they get frequent shipments every few days. They determine which medications are the most highly used by local physicians and stock those up enough to last until their next delivery with a safety supply always in reserve. And if they get dangerously low all they need to do is make a special order that comes a few days early. But pharmacies are getting shipments of medications all the time so this really shouldn't be a problem. Another thing that helps is that shelf life of most medications are at least a year. So even if you have to stock some exotic medication that no one really ever gets prescribed you can keep a small supply tucked away somewhere and have a computer system track when it is going to expire and you need to toss the old stuff out.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theres a lot of things pharmacies can do to predict trends. For example, coming up to bank holidays we order in surplus antibiotics, morning after pills and other contraceptives. We try to have a nine month supply of the more popular contraceptive pills so if someone comes in and wants their six month supply we can give it and still have enough for three other women to get a one month supply. At the end of August we get a big delivery of our flu vaccines, which we can top up if needed. Our computer system keeps track of sales statistics for each of our medications, we try to get people to leave in their prescriptions on file. It makes it easy for them, we get it ready, text them when they can collect and text them again of they havent collected after two weeks. But it also helps us predict what medications will be needed each month/week. Our pharmacy gets twice daily deliveries from our main supplier, and once daily delivery from our other suppliers so if the customer is in early and we dont have their meds in stock, we can have it for that afternoon. But we would still have a lot of medication readily available on the shelf, some of which we haven't dispensed in a year. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't. No where near it in fact. It's simply that most prescribers stick to a small list of drugs they are comfortable with and local pharmacies adapt to local prescribers. Anything unusual can be ordered and in the next day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pharmacies often work in networks. Common medications will be kept on site, and less common ones will be kept at a larger pharmacy or central supply hub and sent to the pharmacy as needed. You may not notice this if you live in a city where things are transferred quickly and pharmacies are larger, but if you live in a smaller town you will often have to wait a few days or even a week to have some meds filled. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can only talk about the UK as that's where I worked but I was a Dispensing Assistant for a 100 Hour Pharmacy for a few thousand people. Because we would get about 100 Customers a day, and dispense around 100-300 prescriptions depending on circumstance (If there is an outbreak of something like Noravirus or if it was a Monday because Repeat prescriptions that were sent on Friday come through) and most of these are for very common medicines. For example, we would stock around 30-40 boxes of Fluoxetine (Prozac for you Americans) in varying dosages because we knew around 10-30 would be dispensed. Every time we dispensed an item, we took note of it and ordered it.</p>
<p>Because Medicine boxes are usually small, you don't actually need that much space, but for the UK at least, do to daily deliveries, we didn't need to stock that much!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
