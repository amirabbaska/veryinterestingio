		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In his own words, he was &quot;saving classical electromagnetism&quot; when he came up with relativity. There are two constants in electromagnetism that set the strength of the electromagnetic interactions in a vaccuum: the permittivity (ε0) of free space and the permeability of free space (μ0). When the theory of electromagnetic waves came out, it was found that you can calculate the speed of light from these constants, i.e.:</p>
<p>c = (1/ε0μ0)^1/2 = 3.0x10^8 m/s</p>
<p>But now you have a problem; what happens if you are in a moving vehicle at constant velocity in a straight line and you do electromagnetic experiments? If the speed of light changes in that reference frame it would also mean the <em>constants</em> of electromagnetism would change and therefore the whole theory of electromagnetism would break down (the equations would all become velocity dependent whereas the formulation of say, the electric field, isn't normally). </p>
<p>This problem can be solved by assuming that the speed of light is constant. If this is so then the free space constants are also invariant and the laws of electromagnetism will still work properly in any inertial reference frame.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Maxwell's equations implied that the speed of light was a constant. You'd expect that if you were moving relative to me and then you emitted a burst of light that one of two things would happen:</p>
<p>1) like throwing a ball, I'd measure the light as having the sum of your velocity and the &quot;basic&quot; velocity of light. That would imply that you could eventually manage to collect light into buckets, so people didn't really expect this.</p>
<p>2) like a sound wave, it would have a fixed velocity with respect to the air, so you'd measure the light as going slower than I would.</p>
<p>But Maxwell's equations implied that both of these were wrong--that everyone measures the speed of light as being the same--no matter how we're moving.</p>
<p>The Michelson-Morley experiment gave this result too. As a result, lots of physicists knew that something was seriously wrong with our view of reality, but no one had a good solution to it.</p>
<p>Einstein started with two goals. The laws of physics would work the same in all frames. There would be no such thing as absolute velocity. Second, the speed of light would be a constant in all frames.</p>
<p>From that he derived all the rest.  There's a very nice account of it in <a href="http://www.phys.ufl.edu/~acosta/phy2061/lectures/Relativity2.pdf" target="_blank">UF's class notes for Enriched Physics</a>. Edited to fix link (thanks SquirrelicideScience!)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There were two things understood regarding frames of reference: according to Galilean relativity, physics is the same no matter what speed you're going, there are no special reference frames; but according to the recently developed electromagnetic theory, the speed of light depends only on the properties of the vacuum, it does gives no consideration to reference frames. These are seemingly inconsistent, and Einstein worked out a way to take both into account, which we now call special relativity.</p>
<p>In terms of experiments at the time, there was the Michelson-Morley experiment which showed that the measured speed of light doesn't depend on Earth's motion through space, but it's unclear if Einstein was aware of it or not. He claimed to be influenced by the Fizeau experiment, that showed light is not dragged through moving water, at  least not as much as one would naively expect. There was also the de Sitter double star &quot;experiment&quot; that came after 1905, but it showed that velocities from moving double stars don't add to the speed of light.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a book of Einstein's speeches and essays which is really cool: <a href="http://amzn.com/0486470113" target="_blank">http://amzn.com/0486470113</a> </p>
<p>The reason I know this is because I picked up an original edition in an antique shop.  Totally an accident, just found it.  Copyright 1933.  He's not only a genius but unlike many in the scientific community, he can communicate his ideas well.  I've never understood relativity until I read that book.  It's pretty good.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
