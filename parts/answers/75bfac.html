		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are different kinds of nuclear waste.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>High-level nuclear waste (the kind you're probably thinking of, waste fuel rods, etc.).  They mix it into liquid glass, pour it into steel barrels, put it in underground salt caverns, and wait for 200,000 years, hoping the under-water cave never floods.  The danger of this is not the radioactivity.  It is the toxicity of the waste.  <del>It takes a few grains of spent fuel  to poison an entire lake.</del>  <em>The toxicity is estimated to be between 114 and 136 mg U/kg.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medium and low level nuclear waste (the metal from the reactor, the water that was cycled through the reactor, etc.)  Let it sit for 20 years or so and you're good to go.</p>
</li>
<li>Mining trailings (the dirt that you got the radioactive materials from).  Throw it in a pile somewhere and hope it isn't rained on too much.</li>
</ul>
<p>But the safest way?  Use it up.  Current reactors in the US use about 0.5% of the usable fuel in them.  Breeder reactors use closer to 50%, and produce waste that is only dangerous for 20,000 years instead.  We don't use this, though, because it is the same process you use to make nuclear weapons.</p>
<p>A safer way still?  Thorium-cycle reactors.</p>
<p>Safer still?  Fusion reactors.</p>
<p>Edit: my numbers may be off.  Correct me if I'm wrong.</p>
<p>Edit 2: you asked what is the safe way to dispose.  The current way to dispose is to place the waste into a cooling pool for several years, then dump it in a steel barrel and store it on the nuclear power plant parking lot.  Pretty much anything else is safer.  There is no place anywhere in the world that permanently stores nuclear waste long-term.  A facility was built in Nevada, but after Nevada took the money for construction, they changed their minds about storing nuclear waste.</p>
<p>Edit 3: Thank you /u/FoxFluffFur for giving me better information on the toxicity!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Use it up. Most nuclear waste can be re-processed into usable fuel, which can then be put back into the reactor...The parts that aren't worth putting back into the reactor, are the parts that are easiest to store.</p>
<p>The reason this isn't done is political, rather than technical. Uranium is mostly what goes into the reactors, and plutonium is mostly what comes out, and refined plutonium is GREAT for making bombs, so we intentionally don't reprocess the fuel. At this point though, it seems pointless. If North Korea has nukes, then anyone can have them and we might as well deal with the waste properly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Safest cost effective way?put it in barrels (lead lined preferably), and put it deep underground far away from any fresh water source. Its not too different from how we deal with our regular waste, except its deeper underground. It works pretty well honestly.</p>
<p>More expensive option is to shoot it into space, but we dont, cause its way too expensive.</p>
<p>Also the quantities of waste produced per power generated are tiny, very very tiny, so its not as big of an issue as it sounds like.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The WIPP (waste isolation pilot plant) east of Carlsbad NM is 2,100 feet deep. I think the huge tunnels were potash mines. It opened in the 90's and has cost about $19 billion.  Despite claims of great safety, mistakes have been made that exposed workers and the thankfully unpopulated area around it to radiation.  Transporting waste long distances is also dangerous. We have HC traffic signs all over NM, indication Hazardous Cargo route. I dont know what I'm supposed to do with that information!  The answer is likely that so far we do not know how to get rid of nuclear waste, a clear indication we should stop making it </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
