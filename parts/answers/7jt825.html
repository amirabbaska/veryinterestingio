		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The common explanation you hear is that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_Stream" target="_blank">gulf stream</a> current carries heat to Europe.  This is actually a scientific myth that started in the 1800's.  The idea was tested in <a href="http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/pubs/Seager_etal_QJ_2002.pdf" target="_blank">this paper</a>. The authors &quot;removed&quot; the gulf stream and modeled the climate - the temperature difference persisted.</p>
<p>The difference comes mainly from <a href="http://ocp.ldeo.columbia.edu/res/div/ocp/gs/" target="_blank">two things</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Atlantic Ocean stores heat in the summer.  Europe is downwind of the Atlantic, and so in the winter it receives this heat.</p>
</li>
<li>The Rocky Mountains create a complex wave structure in the atmosphere due to conservation of momentum.  This causes air to flow south across the continental US (pulling cold air down from the artic) and flow north across continental Europe (pulling warm air up from the tropics).</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Historically the answer has been the Gulf Stream - a stream of warm water than originates in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/new-simulations-question-gulf-stream-role-tempering-europes-winters/" target="_blank">More recent simulations give conflicting results</a>, but seem to indicate it is a combination of pressure differences, stored energy and atmospheric winds.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
