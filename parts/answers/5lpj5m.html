		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Humans actually do still have small scent glands on their upper lips, behind their ears, and as you could probably guess, hulkin big ones under their armpits.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the accuracy of this, but I once read that since humans have these specific glands on their upper lips, your body reacts to it when you kiss them and makes you feel more attracted to them.</p>
<p>the pheremones you release from your armpit sweat, when smelled by other females, actually <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/pheromones-sex-lives/" target="_blank">modifies their menstrual cycle</a> which is why women who live in the same household tend to have synced menstrual cycles. not exactly an answer to your question but just an interesting fact I wanted to share</p>
<p>edit: <a href="http://prntscr.com/dr1mfz" target="_blank">okay guys, i get it.</a> the menstrual cycle thing was disproven. Kind of confused as to why both me and all of my female family members are constantly in sync all the time but eh, I'll say it's a coincidence as i very much don't want anymore backlash for it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We're marking our territory!</p>
<p>This behavior is from way way back when our animal ancestors had scent glands on their cheeks.  Rubbing your cheek against something put your scent on it, so other animals would know this was YOUR thing.  Animals like cats still have these glands, which is why if your cat loves you, it will probably rub its face all over you every once in a while, to tell all the other cats in the neighborhood that you're its human and nobody else better come ask you for pettings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Next time you go a few days without showering, rub your index finger along where your ear meets your head from back to front.  (like the opposite of a woman putting her hair behind her ear) </p>
<p>Then smell your fingers. A much less concentrated version of that smell ends up on things you use or enjoy due to a common set of &quot;idle&quot; behaviors found in humans (touching your hair, face). It has been posited that we still have the receptors to detect this odor on objects, and it influences our &quot;gut&quot; feelings. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert in <em>anything</em>, but I once listened to a podcast (Stuff You Should Know, on HowStuffWorks, I think) about &quot;cute agression&quot;, and what you're talking about may be linked to that in some way. I'm probably going to get this short explanation wrong, but supposedly when humans (and some animals even) observe or experience something incredibly &quot;cute&quot; our brains can sort of become &quot;overloaded&quot; with that feeling. When that happens, our brains want to restore balance (something something chemicals...) and the natural response for most people is to squish, pinch, squeeze, or distort, that cute thing. To make it <em>not</em> so cute. Have you ever thought a child's face was so cute that you just wanted to squish it beyond recognition? Acording to the podcast, that's a natural response to something that is &quot;too cute&quot;.</p>
<p>Edit: it could have been from the <em>Stuff to Blow Your Mind</em> podcast, also on How Stuff Works. It was about a year and a half ago that I listened to it via the How Stuff Works mobile app iirc.</p>
<p>Edit 2: [found the podcast] (<a href="http://www.stufftoblowyourmind.com/podcasts/so-cute-i-could-eat-you-up.htm" target="_blank">http://www.stufftoblowyourmind.com/podcasts/so-cute-i-could-eat-you-up.htm</a>)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
