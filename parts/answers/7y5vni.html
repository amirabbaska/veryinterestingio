		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scratching causes irritation, irritation causes inflamation.<br />
Inflamation is the body's go-to reaction for anything it percieves as harmful (whether or not it actually is harmful)<br />
It's characterised by swelling,redness,pain, local increase of heat and some level of function loss for the affected tissue.<br />
The area is flooded with cells that aim to reduce and repair any potential damage, or mess you up if you have an auto-immune disease.    </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you scratch your skin, you damage some of the cells present over there.</p>
<p>When cells get damaged or injured they release certain chemicals called as inflammatory mediators.</p>
<p>These inflammatory mediators cause inflammation over the area where they are released.</p>
<p>The inflammation is characterised by</p>
<ol>
<li>Redness</li>
<li>Swelling</li>
<li>Warmth</li>
<li>Pain</li>
</ol>
<p>Edit : </p>

<p>Inflammation is body's defence against any injury to its cells. It serves by bringing more white blood cells (body's soldiers) to the site of injury. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A slightly more in depth explanation, more like ELI10 than 5:</p>
<p>Inflammation is the one of the first levels of defense against infection: your body floods the area and, in general, if more fluid is flowing in than coming out it is much more difficult for bacteria to swim against a current. Because the current is going towards the infection it brings all of the good guys (white blood cells) with it and using a fancy chemical communication system the white blood cells call for more inflammation, increased temp, and extra help if need be like a Horn of Gondor. </p>
<p>The cells with the quickest response to foreign invaders are Mast Cells and their <del>carrion</del> clarion cry is Histamine. This is because they evolved to work best against parasites. Parasites are usually much larger than a single white blood cell and they can't just be swallowed up and digested like bacteria so the best response to a parasite is to quickly make the environment as hostile as possible while stopping the invader from getting to a vital area. Whenever your body recognizes a parasite (or something it might think is a parasite) the mast cells release their histamine and the body's response is swift. Flood the area with fluid, all droids to battle stations.</p>
<p>As a side note you've probably heard of histamines from allergy commercial or two. Seasonal allergies are your body mis-identifying large pollen molecules as scary parasites. Your body is effectively fighting an unnecessary war against something that cant actually hurt you. There is some thought that the lack of parasitic infections in modern society does not provide the appropriate training to the immune system and it gets bored and starts causing trouble (think of a standing army living on your land during peacetime). This is called the hygiene hypothesis.</p>
<p>Lastly, you can literally cause a mast cell to release its contents just by squeezing. Your body doesn't know that there are no invaders and it has evolved to be quick and fast in its response because &quot;better safe than sorry.&quot; Some people have a condition called dermatographia where they can literally write on their skin by scratching it because they have an extra release of histamine. </p>
<p>A nice caveat is that whenever any cell is damaged it releases chemicals which, like a death wail, start reving up the immune system whether it was due to an infection or not. For example, when you twist an ankle your body starts responding to the dead/dying cells of your tendons and soft tissue and you get a huge swollen, hot ankle even though there are no invaders present to warrant such a response.</p>
<p>That came out a little more in depth than I wanted to but here's some simple sources:</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scratching your skin causes some damage to the surface. The damaged cells leak some components that basically send messages to other cells that help is needed to protect against the threat/breach (your fingernails).  The blood flow in the area increased so that the cells and components that protect and heal can arrive on the scene. <em>Inflammation</em> is what the response is called and has been well defined in other comments. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
