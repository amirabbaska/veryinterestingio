		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mac OS had been calling them applications for a long time. Their application file type is .app while Windows uses .exe (which stands for executable). There are technical difference but Iâ€™d argue this is MOSTLY a tradition/preference. Maybe Apple liked that name since it reminds you of <em>Apple</em> and these <em>App</em>lications run on Apple computers. </p>
<p>Well, Apple produced the first massively-popular smartphone and continued to call iPhone programs Applications or Apps for short. This set the standard for how people talk about smartphones and the software they run... similar to <em>Podcasts</em> which have nothing to do with iPods anymore, but the name stuck from the time when iPods dominated the market. </p>
<p>And since smartphones are as common and often <em>more</em> familiar to people than desktop/laptop computers these days, the name also crept over to those devices. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mostly marketing perception. Small and portable computing is the rage right now (although laptops are making a slight comeback.) Most people hear 'program' and think computer which also makes you think bulky and clumsy but when you hear 'app' has been mostly used for mobile (although it was sometimes used to describe computer programs) which makes you think smaller and portable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Programmer since 1969 here.</p>
<p>Terms keep shifting with fashion and with fine or dubious distinctions.</p>
<p><strong>Algorithm:</strong> A strict set of instructions to accomplish something. e.g. cooking recipe.</p>
<p><strong>Computer Program:</strong> An algorithm expressed in code and run by a computer.</p>
<p><strong>Application:</strong> This started out meaning a computer program or set of computer programs <em>applied</em> to a business problem as opposed to a computer program to solve other computer programming needs. e.g. operating system or device driver. This gave rise to two disciplines: <em>Application Programming</em> and <em>Systems Programming</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Applet:</strong> A term coined by Sun (I think) to indicate that a Java Applet was small and run by a web browser.</p>
<p><strong>App:</strong> A term coined for use on phones and then on tablets and then on computers. These are actually full fledged applications and more sophisticated and complex than the applications of the past (c. 1980). However, it refers to a single program.</p>
<p>Back in the day (and still today) larger applications consist of multiple programs organized as a network of jobs to aid a business (or scientific) process. These are linked together and run via &quot;overseeing&quot; programs (JCL, bash, etc.) and operations staff (people).</p>
<p>EDIT: typos and spacing and &quot;Systems Programming&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
