		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hey Redditor!</p>
<p>My degree background is in Psycholinguistics, which is basically put: understanding how language functions in the brain. </p>
<p>I actually did a research project on dyslexia and hope I can be a help explaining it.</p>
<p>So, symbol languages, in linguistic terms, is called a logographic system. This basically means that the language is communicate (in writing systems) through logos, or symbols, representing - usually - a &quot;chunk&quot; or what is called a morpheme. A combination of these morphemes in a particular pattern and combination represent a word or phrase.</p>
<p>Languages like English are considered alphabetic (cause - you know - the alphabet).</p>
<p>There's a lot of different things to consider you'd need more information from studying to field, but basically our ability to read has mapped on to previously developed parts of the brain, utilizing their functions to process language. For alphabetic system, they are usually called &quot;t-junctions&quot; meaning before modern times, letter like the &quot;o&quot; weren't actually round, but were a series of lines making almost a diamond shape that has altered over the years to the circular &quot;o&quot; we all know and love.</p>
<p>Alphabetic languages actually access a part of the brain (which I can't currently recall) that has to do with your lexical phonetic storage system - meaning you link the letter to a specific sound (with has its variations between words in English... but that's a different topic all together). That is how it is simply organized.</p>
<p>Logographic systems actually activate parts of the visual cortex not activated in alphabetic systems (or only activated minimally). There are actually MRI testing that has been done on this demonstrating the results.</p>
<p>What's really cool is the fact that because these two systems of writing/reading don't full connect, a person who is dyslexic in one system, such as English, could be fully able to read and write with easy in another system, like Japanese, because of this lack of overlap between logographic and alphabet systems (you can find case studies on this which are actually pretty rad!) </p>
<p>There is much debate as to why dyslexia happens in the first place, but some of the best journal articles dispute that it has to do with the fact that writing and reading is a relatively new systems to our brains, and might have to do with the fact we are utilizing previous skills for other task that have evolved in our brain, to map the ability to read and write and make it accessible.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about it, or want me to send some academic literature your way, PLEASE reach out! I nerd out over stuff like this &lt;3</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My understanding is that dyslexia is primarily (in about 80% of cases) a disorder of phonemic processing; i.e. the capacity of the brain to order sounds into meaningful chunks. I assume that languages which represent <em>meaning</em> with characters such as Chinese and Japanese take some of this work out the equation: for example the Japanese character for fire (火) can be pronounced a few different ways, but it always has the meaning &quot;fire.&quot; This versus English and other languages whose writing only carries meaning <em>after</em> you've done the phonemic assembly required, meaning that &quot;f.i.r.e.&quot; means nothing until you've put the letters together and translated them mentally into a sound. I would assume that what you would see in languages like Chinese and Japanese is people with dyslexia having an easier time unless something was written in the phonetic Pinyin or Kana (for Chinese and Japanese, respectively) at which point presumably some of the phonemic processing issues would emerge. </p>
<p>There is also a small subset of dyslexics (20% or so) where the issue lies in visual/spatial processing, and has to do with the brain not being able to correctly mentally orient letters. I imagine for these folks Chinese might be a little easier because the complexity of the characters would help you to find the meaning regardless of its perceived orientation, but you would probably still have a hard time. </p>
<p>Source: I'm a pediatric occupational therapist who has read some books and articles in addition to working with lots of kiddos with language-based learning disabilities. The piece about dyslexia being based in phonemic and sometimes spatial processing is well-established neuroscience. The piece about why it might be different in pictographic languages is my educated speculation, so let the reader beware. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am dyslexic and it is actually quite commonly said that dyslexia doesn't exist in China, it's a bit more complex than that, but basically, the characters do not affect dyslexics in the same way as letters do. </p>
<p>These are a few interesting links that should tell you more, firstly an article about someone who is severely dyslexic in English but not at all in Japanese - <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/sep/23/research.highereducation2" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/education/2004/sep/23/research.highereducation2</a></p>
<p>The second is an article on the discovery that chinese 'dyslexics' actually suffer from a deficiency in a totally different part of the brain to english ones - <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2014/09/dyslexia-chinese" target="_blank">http://www.economist.com/blogs/analects/2014/09/dyslexia-chinese</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have dyslexia and have studied about dyslexia previously. Dyslexia is a specific learning difficulty similar to dyspraxia, dyscalculia and ADHD. All of the overlap and it is extremely common to have more than one (I have dyslexia and dyspraxia). </p>
<p>Dyslexia has a lot more to it than just have difficulty reading and writing, it come with difficulties in memory, attention, word finding, organisation, time management and so many other areas. Other language difficulties can include difficulties knowing which sentence particles to use, confusing similar or opposite words (e.g. Left and right), difficulty structuring sentences so that they make sense, and knowing which tense to use and the different conjugation of words (e.g. What is the past tense of 'write'). These are all things that would be experienced regardless of the language you speak/read. </p>
<p>As an adult my main difficulties are not to do with reading and writing, they are to do with memory and organising my though processes. I make a lot of speech errors, I find it very hard to explain things in a logical way even though they make perfect sense in my head. In terms of writing my difficulties are in structuring my ideas. I do still have difficulty with reading and writing but I've learned to manage this over the years. </p>
<p>TL;DR there is a lot more to dyslexia that spelling and reading, most of which would happen regardless of the language used. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm not an expert in dyslexia but am a Chinese speaker.</p>
<p>Written Chinese is not an alphabetic or syllabic language so dyslexia in Chinese is not really related with how sounds are represented but how the symbols are written. You know, Chinese characters are actually made up of components put in specific positions and written using a specific stroke order. If any of those components/strokes are <strong>1)</strong> missing or superfluous (e.g. 天 &quot;sky&quot; vs 大 &quot;big&quot;, 日 &quot;sun&quot; vs 目 &quot;eye&quot;), <strong>2)</strong> put in the wrong place (e.g. 太 &quot;very&quot; vs 犬 &quot;dog&quot;, 本 &quot;book/root&quot; vs 未 &quot;not yet&quot; vs 末 &quot;end&quot;), or <strong>3)</strong> wrongly written (e.g. 田 vs 由 vs 甲), it could cause problems for the readers.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/jB7ZX81.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/jB7ZX81.jpg</a>
In the the circled character above, some strokes are missing. (The correct form would be 麗 )</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/tyqyfm1.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/tyqyfm1.jpg</a>
Here the upper part of the character is horizontally mirrored.</p>
<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/fWXeril.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/fWXeril.jpg</a>
In image 1.9, the second character (夫) has an extra horizontal stroke.</p>
<p>In image 1.11, the characters are supposed to be 唱歌 , which means in this case the left and right of the first character got reversed, and the wrong component is used in the right hand side of the second word.</p>
<p>Apart from the mistakes in how a character is written, there are also problems with the mixing up of characters similar in form or related in meaning.</p>
<p><strong>Examples:</strong>
<a href="http://i.imgur.com/lNnGoN1.jpg" target="_blank">http://i.imgur.com/lNnGoN1.jpg</a>
In image 1.1, 橾 (ancient wheel hub) is used instead of 澡 (bath).
In image 1.2, 炮 (a cannon) is used instead of 跑 (to run).</p>
<p>In image 1.3, 回學 should be 回校 . This happens because 學 and 校 are often used together. (學校 means school)</p>
<p>Of course there are a host of other symptoms but I guess the above are several of the more obvious.</p>
