		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Physically, male humans develop slower because they are larger and more massive (mass wise) than females. Growing takes time, and growing too fast isn't good for the body.</p>
<p>Emotionally/intellectually this is more challenging. But it is a fact that women(girls) mature faster than men. Girls learn to &quot;prune&quot; information and generate more effective brain connections at an earlier age than boys. This means perhaps boys have longer to learn and form views and ideas on the world, but they take longer to do so.</p>
<p>Why is this? We're now onto a bit more speculation. In the wild, back when evolution was being selective, it was beneficial for girls to mature quickly so they can start reproducing (girls are the limiting resource in a populations growth rate much more than boys are, because men can have sex with multiple women) and in general the downsides for this (being smaller, perhaps being less creative or forming faster world-views) were acceptable.</p>
<p>However, men take the role of &quot;hunting&quot; or &quot;fighting&quot; (size needed for both). There was also probably typically more pressure on men to be innovative and different (in good and bad ways) due to the likely nature of early-human societies where women predominantly were suited to child care, and men were worth taking a &quot;risk&quot; on, due to them being more expendable. If you have 50 men and 50 women, and 30 of the men die because they experimented with something stupid, or because they were killed by an animal/other tribe, the tribe is still okay because the number of women determine how good the future is. But conversely, it is a bad evolutionary  idea if you design women to all be a bit nuts and reckless. </p>
<p>** - I sincerely hope I haven't offended anyone with the above, I am trying to be impartial.</p>
<p>In answer to your last question - in species were males are larger than females, yes males will grow slower.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've heard it explained that men mature slower so that they aren't killed by the dominant male or invading males. They rely on a growth spurt after which they may have a chance against a mature male.</p>
<p>Think of male lions killing Cubs of previous males as a similar pattern. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If females mature faster, then there are more females in the breeding population.  In theory, a species only needs one breeding-age male to propagate, but more breeding females means more babies.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
