<p>Now, a lot of newer cars make this impossible because of various security features (like chips in keys) but on older cars, all you need to do it grab the wires &amp; connect them in the same way the ignition switch would have.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, what you see in the movies is fake although this used to work back in the 60s.</p>
<p>On old cars, the ignition key just worked a switch. You had a switch for &quot;on&quot; which activated electrical circuits like the fuel pump and the spark ignition system. Then, there was a second switch which activates an electric motor which starts the engine turning. Once the engine is turning, and assuming it's OK, then as long as the engine has fuel and power to the spark system, it'll keep running.</p>
<p>So, a thief could break into the car, look under the dash for the wires to the ignition switch, and activate the circuits by touching the wires together. You'd have to tie the main power circuit &quot;on&quot;, and then you could run the starter motor by touching the start wires together.</p>
<p>By the 70s, the car manufacturers had learned that this wasn't particularly secure, so they put a backup system. The ignition key lock wouldn't just work the switch, but it would also mechanically block the steering wheel so you couldn't actually drive it. </p>
<p>My dad had an old toyota, and the ignition key wore out while we were on vacation hundreds of miles from home. The key just wouldn't turn enough to start the car. We called the local recovery guy, who worked out that the key would turn just enough to unlock the steering wheel, but not enough to work the switch. So, he pulled out the wires from the dash, and showed us how to hotwire it so that the engine would run. This allowed us to get home, and book it into the dealer for a proper repair at a more convenient time.</p>
<p>By the late 90s, computers had developed enough that engine spark and fuel systems could be electronically controlled, rather than controlled by complicated mechanisms of rotating shafts, gears, cams and switches. As a computer was running the engine, it wasn't that much more complicated to add computer security.</p>
<p>Since the late 90s, most cars have a chip in the key, which listens for a radio signal, and when it gets the signal it transmits a password. The ignition key barrel has an antenna in it, and when the engine control computer sees the start switch is active, it transmits a &quot;login password&quot; signal from the antenna to the key. The key responds, and if the computer gets the correct password, it activates the fuel and spark. If the password is wrong or missing, then the fuel and spark systems don't work. The engine will turn on the starter motor, but it won't actually start.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The method would not work on almost all cars made after 1970. It's always bothered me when I see them do this in movies. </p>
<p>Most cars without modern theft protection could still be STARTED but not DRIVEN by twisting the right wires together (First, twist an ignition+ source to +12V, then touch a starter+ wire to +12v until engine is running). But you couldn't drive the car.</p>
<p>What they never account for are the mechanical lockouts tied to the ignition switch. When you turn the key, a physical lockout releases the steering wheel lock and allows it to turn. Without physically turning the key, the steering wheel would remain locked, even with the engine running, hence making the car undrivable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Aside from the steering wheel lock, this used to be much easier to do because the ignition switch was in the dash and the dash had more open space underneath it.  You could see the two wires that you needed immediately.  Almost all of the other things that are now in the steering column were also separate switches arranged on the dashboard.</p>
<p>Now the necessary wires are bound up in a harness that goes up into the steering column.  Along with the ignition wires, you have the turn signals, wipers, headlights, airbag, parking lights, horn, and probably cruise, and radio.  There are probably twenty wires to sort out now, and since you can no longer see the back of the ignition switch, you may not know what color the ones you want are.  Just cutting that bundle apart without cutting wires can be five minutes work.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The funniest example I saw of this was yesterday in some movie. A guy gets into a car, reaches under the dash just to the right of the steering wheel, and brings out two wires that have been stripped back an inch and a half. That is, those wires were supposedly just sitting under there, no insulation, nothing to keep them from touching one another or the chassis of the car, causing a short and a fire.</p>
<p>Too too silly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
