		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Slotin#Harry_Daghlian.27s_death" target="_blank">Wikipedia on the incident</a> with the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core" target="_blank">Demon core</a>&quot; during the cavalier days of nuclear testing: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>On 21 May 1946, with seven colleagues watching, Slotin performed an experiment that involved the creation of one of the first steps of a fission reaction by placing two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around a 3.5-inch-diameter (89 mm) plutonium core. The experiment used the same 6.2-kilogram (13.7 lb) plutonium core that had irradiated Harry Daghlian, later called the &quot;demon core&quot; for its role in the two accidents. Slotin grasped the upper 9-inch beryllium hemisphere with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he maintained the separation of the half-spheres using the blade of a screwdriver with his right hand, having removed the shims normally used. Using a screwdriver was not a normal part of the experimental protocol.</p>
<p>At 3:20 p.m., the screwdriver slipped and the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a &quot;prompt critical&quot; reaction and a burst of hard radiation. <strong>At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of air ionization and felt a heat wave. Slotin experienced a sour taste in his mouth and an intense burning sensation in his left hand.</strong> He jerked his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation.</p>
<p>As soon as Slotin left the building, he vomited, a common reaction from exposure to extremely intense ionizing radiation. Slotin's colleagues rushed him to the hospital, but the radiation damage was irreversible.[1]</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can get a metallic taste in your mouth. The radiation damages the nerves and leads to a phantom sensation. This happened to emergency workers at Chernobyl, and it's a well documented side effect of radiotherapy for cancers.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what /u/Rannasha said, in theory one could feel radiation pressure. In layman terms it would be comparable to feeling wind from the direction of the radiation. However, at chernobyl the radiation is waaayy too weak for you to be able to notice radiation pressure.</p>
<p>But for example, in [solar sails <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_sail</a>] the effects are noticable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, you can certainly feel intense radiation. In fact, you can do this right now (depending on the weather). Just go outside and stand in the sun. The effect you feel is the radiation from the sun heating up your skin.</p>
<p>As for the radiation from Chernobyl. It is unlikely that you would've felt it directly. The peak radiation intensity received by one person just after the meltdown is estimated to be somewhat comparable to the total power output of a standard LED lamp.</p>
<p>However, the radiation coming from Chernobyl, while lower in total intensity, is much more damaging than radiation coming from the sun. Solar radiation is, for the most part, too low energy to be harmful (UV being a notable exception), so even though there's a lot of it, it won't do much. The radiation from Chernobyl consisted of much higher energy gamma radiation as well as other types of ionizing radiation. Forms of radiation that can and will damage living tissue, even in relatively small quantities.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes</p>
<p>You can get burns from microwaves and beta particles, you would most certainly feel burning and it would be extremely unpleasant, most likely from nerve damage it would be hard to breathe, your eyes would literally be being burnt out of their sockets</p>
<p>I remember reading a story about something that emitted just beta particles that 2 Russians found after a patrol in a vehicle crash, a blizzard set in and whatever it was kept them alive but they suffered burns and the rest of the unit came to retrieve it, they retrieved it by having 1 member pick it up and move it for a certain amount of time before passing it off to another before they suffered radiation poisoning</p>
<p>The Russians solve problems by any means necessary</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
