		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Pain is a sensation that we feel due to our nervous system. The nerves that go to the testicles have close associations with other nerves in our intestinal and pubic regions. This is why a sucker punch to the gonads gives a sick to the stomach feeling. The nerves innervating the testicles &quot;talk to&quot; nerves going to our intestines. It creates a big painful mess. </p>
<p>The other point to consider is known as referred pain. This type of pain is the reason a heart attack will cause pain in your arm or neck, even though it is your heart being damaged. Your body doesn't have the same pain receptors on the inside as it does on your skin for example. When you get pinched on your skin you can feel the exact place and pressure where the pinch occurred. Because the inside of your body has different pain receptors in different places, internal injuries &quot;refer&quot; the pain to different areas. The testicles have both the direct pain and referred pain pathways</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Both the testes in men and ovaries in women develop from the same place within the abdomen in an unborn human. The testes will eventually descend down to where its normally located but because it was developed in the abdomen, its original nerve connections are from there. Therefore, pain from hits there will feel local (skin surrounding your scrotum) and also abdominal from the nerve endings on the testes.</p>
<p>Plus your testes are quite unprotected. They're a dangling organ not protected by bones or muscles. There's nothing to help absorb a blow to the testicles so any hits are felt quite hard.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called referred pain. Basically, the nerve that innervates the testicles share an origin with another nerve that goes to a different part of the body. Another well-known example is when you have a heart attack, you have chest pain which usually presents with pain radiating to the arm.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s because they need to be protected. Without them you lack the ability to procreate which is the instinctual goal of our DNA. If it didn’t hurt so bad, getting kicked in the balls would be NBD and the human race probably would’ve died off sons ago. </p>
