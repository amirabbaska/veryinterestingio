		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Basically, there's a massive galaxy exactly between us and the distant supernova. The gravity of the cluster attracts the light from the supernova, and bends the path of the light towards the earth. <a href="http://i1.wp.com/astrobob.areavoices.com/files/2015/03/Hubble-lensed-SN-graphic.jpg" target="_blank">Since light can be redirected by gravity, light from the supernova can end up taking multiple paths to get to us.</a> There's a slight delay because the paths through the cluster have slightly different lengths. That difference in length is only a few light years, so we end up seeing the supernova multiple times over the span of a few years.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6226/1123?intcmp=collection-generalrelativity" target="_blank">For reference, this is the original paper.</a> If I can offer some personal commentary - this is an incredible discovery, and due to the potential for using it to measure the cosmic expansion rate it's definitely worth following up to observe those future supernova. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>/u/VeryLittle's explanation is great, but I'd like to explicitly call out what I think is a key point in answering your question:</p>
<p>The supernova already happened, and one of the images we are able to record came to us sooner than the other because it took a shorter path. It's like seeing someone walk by, then seeing their reflection walking by in the mirror, and the person and mirror are so far away that the time difference is years instead of infintisimally small.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neutrinos can also give us warning of a supernova due to the fact that they can pass through the turbulent exploding star before the blastwave and light can reach the surface. IIRC it can be a few seconds or minutes warning.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

The only time a supernova would be super awesome to see/measure would be one in our galaxy. Just trying to understand why people are excited.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
