		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not only do normal numbers contain every possible finite combination of digits, they contain each possibility infinitely many times.</p>
<p>The way that this is possible is that you do it by combination-length. There are only 10^(N) different possible combinations of digits of length N. So in a normal number, you can expect there to be one copy of any particular sequence of N digits in every N*10^(N) digits of a number. You can try to convince yourself that</p>
<ul>
<li>0.1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526...</li>
</ul>
<p>is normal because it does this for every integer N. </p>
<p>We will almost surely prove that pi is normal or not sometime in the future. Though it is hard to prove things like this for numbers like pi, because it arises purely from geometry and so figuring out numerical things about it is hard. Generally, pi, as a number, is a very typical and boring. Almost every number is irrational, transcendental, normal etc, and the reason why we thought pi was these things is because pi should be like every other number. But accessing the arithmetic content of the number pi is hard to do, and so proving that pi is a boring ol' number is hard and interesting. Same goes for e and other numbers arising from other topics. Though, there are formulas for pi that are promising, as they can allow you to compute digits (which are part of the arithmetic part of pi) efficiently and directly. Not enough to prove that pi is normal, but it suggests that this information is not impossibly hard to obtain.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>0.10100100010000100000...</p>
<p>This number is non repeating and never uses any other digits other than 0 and 1, and it doesn't even contain the (very simple) pattern 11.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As for (2), just take your favorite normal number and replace all the 1's with 2's in its decimal expansion. Or take your favorite normal number and consider its binary expansion as an expansion in another base to get some other number. </p>
<p>In either case you get an irrational, non-normal number. And the normality fails really badly because some digits don't <em>ever</em> appear. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>to answer two, that's easy.  Imagine a series of digits  that never repeat and never have a pattern, but simply do not contain the number 2.</p>
<p>You can still have an infinite sequence without repeating itself but by definition it can't include all possible numbers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the third question (contained in the edit), here's a simple way to make a number that's normal in base two.  Start by making a list of <em>all</em> finite binary sequences:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Length 1:</strong>  0 and 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Length 2:</strong> 00, 01, 10, and 11</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Length 3:</strong> 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, and 111</li>
</ul>
<p>and so forth.  Next, we concatenate all those sequences together to make a binary number:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>0 1 00 01 10 11 000 001 010 011 100 101 110 111 ...</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This number is normal in base two, since every finite binary sequence appears in it.   You can do the same thing in base ten if you want:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ol>
<li>0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 ...</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this only works for one base at a time.  There's no reason to expect our binary number to be normal in any base except base two, and there's no reason to expect our decimal number to be normal in any base except base ten.  Converting bases is complicated, so it's hard to see how it will turn out.</p>
<p>However, it's actually not too much harder to make a number that's normal in every base.  The idea is to just keep switching between different bases to make sure that all finite sequences appear in every base.  For example, first you pick a few digits in base 2, and then you pick a few in base 3, and then maybe a few more in base 2, and then you do a few in bases 3 and 4, and so forth, until you eventually hit every finite sequence in every single base.  You have to be a little careful about exactly how the base-switching works, and the number you end up with is pretty complicated, but it will be normal in every integer base.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
