		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because historically female virginity was something quite valuable and losing it or having it taken from you was a major thing with all sorts of implication beyond just sex.</p>
<p>People put a lot of worth into virginity because the physical aspect of it was something that could be actually verified. It being the first time you had sex with your husband was something that could be noticed and if you kept the bloody sheets the couple could even prove it to others.</p>
<p>This was important because paternity was important, because family was important.</p>
<p>Being a virgin on your wedding night was seen as a pretty good indicator that any child born 9 month or a bit less down the road would be the husbands. That is important for questions of inheritance.</p>
<p>Of course nowadays paternity and faithfulness are important too, but in those days there was no way to test paternity with DNA or even by comparing blood groups. Also in those days there was no real social welfare net. No unemployment benefits or anything like that you either had a family take care of you when you couldn't take care of yourself or you were mostly fucked.</p>
<p>Family was important because without the modern state taking care of people it was all they had.</p>
<p>A girl's virginity was a bargaining chip that could be exchanged for a lifetime of benefits. It was worth quite a lot and carelessly giving it away or having it cruelly taken from you is a catastrophe that could destroy a lot.</p>
<p>It is why rape was seen as such a big crime in many cultures. Not because of the suffering of the woman, but because of the damage done to her family, especially her father if she was a virgin.</p>
<p>It is why in old stories women who have done the deed will talk about being ruined or  no longer being fit for marriage. Or why even today people talk about &quot;taking responsibility&quot;.</p>
<p>It is the general idea of &quot;you broke it - you bought it&quot;. No one would want a bride who was not a virgin and thus the one who caused her to loose her virginity was expected to take care of her. It is why you get parts in the bible (and in older religious influenced law books), that have marriage as an out for rape or sex with a minor.</p>
<p>Even worse in societies were there is no strong central authority to keep the peace people and families survived based on their reputation. Reputation or honour was a life or death thing in many societies. A girl who got a reputation for having lost her virginity, would not just reflect badly on her, but also on her family. Which is why extreme measure were often taken to avoid harm to ones honour and repair ones reputation. It is how you get honour killings.</p>
<p>So virginity was a matter of life and death in some cultures (and evens still is in some today) and even if you weren't in danger of being killed by your own family over losing it, you might still get cast out or at miss out on finding a good husband who (together with his family) would provide for you for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>For quite a lot of girls their virginity was the greatest treasure they ever had and giving it away was a very big thing.</p>
<p>Nowadays we have a culture of law instead of honour and we have forms of social security and employment opportunities for single women and paternity tests and a lot of other things that make the worth of ones virginity much less of a life or death thing, the language that has built up around it however survives.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>These conceptualizations of virginity come to us from a history of European land ownership succession. In Europe, land was passed down father to firstborn son. With no DNA testing, the only way to &quot;ensure&quot; that your wife would give birth to your child and not someone else's was to make sure you were the first and only man she ever had. Considering women were literally regarded as property during this time, their worth was mostly determined by their ability to produce heirs you could trust to be yours. Add in a healthy dose of religious sexual repression and incurable STD's, and you've got yourself a great recipe for oppressing half of an entire species.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well evolutionary, it makes sense for men to value virginity in a prospective mate. In humans, it is impossible to tell which father a child belongs to through pregnancy and childhood (for the most part). This means that if a male raises another male's offspring, then the first male is hugely evolutionary disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Thus, males who most valued virginity in women were selected for. Through time, this became a trait that was evolutionary selected for men to &quot;value&quot; in women.</p>
<p>Edit: why am I being downvoted? These are not my ideas that I'm presenting, they're from the writings of David Buss, the most prominent scientist right now in human mating strategies...</p>
<p>From Wikipedia</p>
<blockquote>
<p>David M. Buss (born April 14, 1953) is a professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin, known for his evolutionary psychology theorizing and research on human sex differences in mate selection, with a focus on systems in which males are allowed violence against women in mating</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also from Wikipedia</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The primary topics of his research include male mating strategies, conflict between the sexes, social status, social reputation, prestige, the emotion of jealousy, homicide, anti-homicide defenses, and—most recently—stalking. All of these are approached from an evolutionary perspective. Buss is the author of more than 200 scientific articles and has won many awards, including an APA Distinguished Scientific Award for Early Career Contribution to Psychology in 1988 and an APA G. Stanley Hall Lectureship in 1990.</p>
