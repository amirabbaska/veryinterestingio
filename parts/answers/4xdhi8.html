		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I think its worth pointing out that telescopes likely aren't powerful enough at the moment.</p>
<p>Let's assume its true.  The cube with re-spawn on the other side (basically star fox multiplayer).</p>
<p>The first time the light from a star reaches you, it will have traveled simply the distance between you and the star.  The 2nd time it passes you, it will have traveled the distance between you and the star PLUS the length of the universe.  Since the 2nd is likely orders of magnitude larger, the lumonsity of the 2nd will be that much dimmer ie: likely on the order of a single photon per sq meter / year, or something absurd like that.</p>
<p>The photons aren't parallel, but near it, so over very large distances they slowly spread.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If that were the Universe's actual shape, and it were small enough and expanding slowly enough, yes, you could see the same star in multiple places and at multiple ages.</p>
<p>However, as I understand it, if this were true then the light from the Cosmic Microwave Background would form a sort of nonrandom striped or rippled pattern all across the sky. Not visible to human eyes, of course, but we have plenty of machines that can detect and map this light. No sign of such a pattern has been found, and so cosmologists strongly believe that the Universe is too large (possibly infinite) and expanding too quickly for the 'see the same star in different directions' thing to happen. I believe this holds for a number of models of the shape of an expanding universe, not just your hypertorus version.</p>
<p>With that being said, under certain conditions you can already see distant objects in two places at once due to gravitational lensing (which doesn't rely on how the Universe is joined onto itself at large scales). This doesn't happen with any of the stars you can see with your eyes because they are way too close and there are no objects around with strong enough gravity to generate the effect. But it can happen with very distant galaxies that are positioned behind nearer galaxies, because the effect becomes significant across those enormous distances. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c8/Einstein_cross.jpg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a telescope photograph showing this in action; there are only two objects in the picture, the nearer one in the center and the farther one shown four times around it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
