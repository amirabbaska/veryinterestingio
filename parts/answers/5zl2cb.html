		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>North Africa is covered by a patchy cover of sediment, some is clay, and some is sand. If you removed it all, you'd reach the underlying basement rocks. The geology you would expose would look something like <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Mohammed_Bouabdellah2/publication/303783409/figure/fig1/AS:393122354876416@1470739081126/Fig-1-Regional-geological-map-of-North-Africa-showing-main-lithotectonic-domains.png" target="_blank">this</a>. For the most part, you'd see Archean cratonic rocks - gneisses and shists, granites and things like that, with patches of younger crystalline and metamorphic rocks, locally with a few patches of younger volcanic rocks. At  the bottom of the sediment, while you were &quot;vacuuming away&quot;, you'd notice the bottom of the unconsolidated sediment pile is quite wet ... <a href="https://wileyearthpages.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/africa-well-productivity.png" target="_blank">those would be the regional aquifers</a>, water saturated layers in the sediment.</p>
<p>I'm not sure of the sediment thickness over the Sahara in general. It is certainly highly variable, and dune fields may be several hundred meters thick, but <a href="https://www.google.ca/maps/@23.8869489,11.567462,1306873m/data=!3m1!1e3?hl=fr" target="_blank">wide areas of inland Libya, Algeria and Chad appear to have quite thin overburden</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>First of all, you've been lied to by Hollywood et al, deserts don't look like tatooine, mostly. The &quot;stereotypical&quot; sandy desert terrain is called a dune sea or an &quot;erg&quot;, and these make up only a small fraction of most deserts, even the Sahara. They're just the most photogenic parts, often. Most of the Sahara, for example, is actually &quot;hamada&quot; or desert pavement which is pretty much the exact opposite of a dune sea (as one might guess, the sand has to come from somewhere), and is mostly gravel and bare rock.</p>
<p>In general hamada and bedrock is what lies under ergs. Sometimes at a shallow depth, sometimes at a depth of a few hundred meters, depending on the region.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other two responders seem to know more about the Sahara in particular, but from my general knowledge of geology, I could assure you that it would be nearly impossible to have magma underneath sand directly, unless you went and poured a bucket of sand on some magma, or a volcano was erupting near a beach, or some other &quot;cheaty&quot; example.</p>
<p>In a mostly quiet (in terms of lack of volcanism and such that might directly force these materials together in short timescales) geological situation like you're thinking of, sand would be compacted into sandstone and metamorphize into quartzite from the intermediate pressures and temperatures long before getting to actual straight up magma.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
