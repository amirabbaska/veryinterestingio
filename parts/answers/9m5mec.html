		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, PhD student here. Excess fat in adipose tissue stresses out the cells. When they have too much lipid in them, they release cytokines. Sometimes they burst and call in macrophages to remove the debris, also releasing cytokines. This becomes systemic and you have a constant low grade inflammation throughout your body. Over time, this constant inflammation interferes with insulin signalling (Insulin signalling is what controls your blood sugar and is very important in preventing diabetes). It prevents proper activation of a key signal transduction protein called IRS-1 and also interferes indirectly in downstream processes. This is why you are more likely to get diabetes when you're obese. Your liver is one of the key organs affected by insulin . When your signalling goes wonky, the excess fatty acids from your diet and the fat you make through lipogenesis either gets stored in your liver, giving you steatosis (or a fatty liver) or gets exported into the blood stream through the use of very low density lipoproteins (or V-LDL or the &quot;bad&quot; fat). This LDL is small and can stick to the insides of your arteries, giving you high blood pressure or artherosclerosis, putting you at risk for a cardiac event. If you have diabetes, this is even worse as the constant high blood sugar damages the heart tissue making you less likely to survive the attack. When you treat the obesity early enough, you can heal the damage and have a much better quality of life. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Adipose tissue is hormonally active.  It converts androgens (like testosterone) into estrogens.  High estrogen levels disrupt ovulation and cause ovarian cysts (hence polycystic ovarian syndrome's association with obesity).  They also encourage endometrial proliferation, leading to endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial cancer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Insulin and glucagon are the main hormones that signal the energy state of the body; more insulin is released when there's plenty of energy available, like after you've just eaten. Glucagon is the opposite. So obviously if you're gaining weight you're probably spending a lot more time in that high-insulin state, and vice versa. The connection to insulin resistance is hopefully more intuitive in that context, though the actual mechanism of insulin resistance is more complicated, and other factors like exercise definitely are involved.</p>
<p>As for other health effects, well for example you have the protein-fat complexes that carry fat through the blood (because fat is water-insoluble, it needs some carrier). The configuration of those complexes that are more common when someone is overweight is more likely to deposit its lipid content inappropriately inside blood vessels, which is when atherosclerosis gets really bad. Basically the fat transport system is more busy sending fat into storage than bringing it out of storage to be metabolised (burned for energy), and then some of that fat in transport can end up &quot;spilling&quot; in the wrong place. The other mechanisms involved in atherosclerosis are, again, pretty complicated, but at least this should give you an idea of why it's connected to obesity or weight loss at all.</p>
<p>(Those protein-fat complexes are often called &quot;cholesterol&quot; but that's actually inaccurate. Cholesterol itself is a specific molecule that's fat-soluble but pretty different from normal fat. It's also pretty harmless and continually being produced by the body)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Positive physiologic changes associated with weight loss aside, I would say that one giant benefit to weight loss is that when you DO ultimately get sick and end up in the hospital (as we all will at some point), it is literally just easier to effectively take care of a normal sized person. Morbidly obese patients generally seem to experience much longer and more complicated stays because it is physically harder to take care of them due to their excess mass: </p>
<p>Harder to turn to prevent pressure ulcers, higher risk of some various tube getting dislodged when moving between beds, difficulty or complete inability to use some forms of medical imaging because of excess fat, harder for the patient to physically move and rehabilitate themselves, harder to secure an airway, harder to ventilate with a machine, harder to get IV access, harder to get an effective systemic drug concentration achieved, harder to clear drugs that are fat soluble, harder to resuscitate if they have cardiac arrest, harder to operate on, harder to keep wounds clean. The list could go on</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

It is not weight loss that is beneficial it is fat or adipose tissue loss.
Adipose tissue is starting to be recognized as an endocrine (hormone secreting) organ. Which is totally true. Fat/adipose tissue stores and secretes a lot of hormones such as estrogen and steroids among a bunch of hormones. It also contributes to insulin resistance (diabetes) and the complications that come from that.
Fat is bad, muscle is good. Weight loss matters if you are talking about decreasing the amount of fat you own.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
