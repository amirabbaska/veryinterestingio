		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The other answers you are getting are right (yes), but I want to contrast them by pointing out that the stars you can see with your eyes are only dozens of light years away, not billions. There are a handful that are hundreds, they are ALL within out galaxy. Even with a very impressive backyard telescope you are still limited to the galactic neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Our nearest major neighbouring galaxy is 2 million light years away (Andromeda), far from a billion, and the individual stars are basically not discernible unless there is a major event like a supernova, or a specific pulsar we can detect. Hubble can pick out individual stars near the edges, but the middle is just too cluttered.</p>
<p><a href="http://jean-baptiste-faure.blogspot.com/2011/07/hubble-sees-individual-stars-in.html" target="_blank">http://jean-baptiste-faure.blogspot.com/2011/07/hubble-sees-individual-stars-in.html</a></p>
<p>So, given that the average star [light] you see is only a couple dozen years old, and the average [star] life is many orders of magnitude greater, the chance of a single star we can see with our eyes having already expired and we just don't know it yet is extremely low. For reference I think there are around 5-6 thousand visible stars in total, maybe 9k with great eyes, and only around 1500-2000 at a given moment when looking up in perfect conditions.</p>
<p>On the opposite hand, I believe a large galaxy (ours) averages about 1 supernova every 100 years or so, and has a diameter of about 100k light years. Thus there are hundreds of supernovas (of stars that aren't visible pre-explosion) that have already happened in our galaxy where the light just hasn't reached us yet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Or if you sit still you will also see it explode, a little later. </p>
<p>If the sun exploded right now, you could  (a) stay put and see the explosion in eight minutes, (b) move towards it and see the explosion sooner, or (c) move away and delay the moment of explosion, as experienced by you by a little.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, yeah. I mean...a &quot;reasonable rate&quot; really isn't scientific. However, assuming that you chose a star that exploded at the proper time, then yes, traveling towards that star would &quot;speed up&quot; (from your perspective) the explosion.</p>
<p>Scientists can detect the neutrino emissions from stellar supernovae a short time before seeing the visible light of a supernova. Let's say for argument's sake that this technology is &quot;advanced&quot; and you can suddenly detect a supernova about a year before it would become visible from Earth. </p>
<p>If you set out towards that star at say, half the speed of light and traveled for six months, you'd see the visible light explosion from the supernova sooner (a quarter sooner, I believe but I'm bad at math) than if you just sat there on Earth. </p>
<p>This is because the speed of light is a fixed number that doesn't change depending on where an observer is.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Suppose you have a spaceship that can go faster than the speed of light.  You could travel to that star, and see it explode.  If you miss it, you could just travel backwards a bit and watch it again.</p>
<p>(You would need to move slightly to one side though, as you would see your past self blocking the view)</p>
<p>As for reasonable speeds, not really.  Unless you are immortal, and have a lot of time to kill.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am pretty sure that by reasonable speed, you mean a speed that we've achieved with spacecraft today?  If we are quite liberal, the the max speed we've achieved is 1/20,000 the speed of light.  (Apollo 10 reached around 40,000 kh/h, speed of light is in the 1x10^9 km/h range).  Edit: I basically assumed we could create a spacecraft that went 50,000km/h.  </p>
<p>That means that for each given time interval, you move 1/20,000 the distance light travels.</p>
<p>So:</p>
<p>---&gt;---You----------------------------------Image of explosion--&lt;---&lt;--</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that physically, each hour you spend traveling towards the explosion only reduces the time it takes to meet it and to be able to observe it by 1/20,000 an hour.  </p>
<p>[In 20,000 hours, you travel the distance it takes light to cover in 1 hour.  So you are 1&quot;light hour&quot; closer.  This, intuitively, indicates you would observe the explosion an hour before you would if you stayed still]</p>
<p>Thus, traveling for 2.18 years (20,000hr -&gt; years), would mean you observe the death of the star an 1 hour earlier.  </p>
<p>If you want to observe the death of the star about a day early, you would need to travel for about 50 years.  Big waste of time if you ask me!</p>
<p>Conclusively, the speeds we can travel has little effect on how much sooner you would observe the death of a star.   Its problems like this that makes you realize how fast light is.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
