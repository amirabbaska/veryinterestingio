		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is only a data point and not a full explanation.</p>
<p>I have worked with composers at <a href="https://www.ircam.fr/" target="_blank">IRCAM</a> on some advanced user interfaces for experimental music. </p>
<p>One of the things that striked me the most is that at least some composers <em>visualize</em> the composition's partition rather than imagine the evolution of some kind of audio landscape and then transcribe it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a brain perspective I don't know, but from a cognitive perspective:</p>
<p>When you first learn to read, you take a long time even just deciphering the letters (think back to preschool). But after much practice, your brain instead recognizes entire words or phrases at a quick glance.</p>
<p>This is similar to how it feels with music. A beginner would read the score note by note. An advanced player does a quick glance and knows &quot;Okay, next up is an ascending broken C major chord from C4 to C5, then a C major scale down from C5 to G&quot;.</p>
<p>I'm sure you could study and measure this sort of &quot;chunking&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think about what you need to do to fluently read text aloud.  You actually need to make sense of their phrases and even sentences to be able to produce the sounds and intonations of the sentence in a flowing way.</p>
<p>I don't see why it would be any different for a skilled musician.  They would be reading ahead and making sense of what's coming up before they produce it after a delay.   </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Language processing is a dominant hemisphere function. Reading words tends to activate dominant (&quot;left&quot; usually) parietal lobe. Iirc music is bihemispheric. Back in the day they said melody was on the right, rhythm on the left.  I don't know if that's been confirmed since then.  Kind of makes sense though, speech has a music to it and in Western languages that intonation carries emotional information that is processed in the non dominant hemisphere.  People with right hemisphere damage become tone-deaf to the emotional content of speech. For example they don't get sarcasm.  &quot;Oh that's great. Just great&quot;.  &quot;Good!  I'm glad you're happy!&quot;. That sort of thing. </p>
<p>My question for you is, what is music?  Why we we driven to create that thing?  What of ourselves are we expressing?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
