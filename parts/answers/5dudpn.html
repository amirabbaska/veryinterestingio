		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's historically (in an evolutionary sense) been beneficial to brace those parts of our body when you use force (because presumably this often happened in a fight/struggle and this reaction minimises risks in those scenarios - of e.g. breaking your jaw). So when you enter &quot;combat mode&quot; and you ready to use your muscles, this is your instinctive response. </p>
<p>In other words, you've evolved to do this because it was more beneficial than other potential instinctive reactions in such situations in our deep past. </p>
<p>Good guy natural instincts got our back, even if we just go into &quot;combat mode&quot; to open a jar! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'd probably notice most muscles, not just those around the jaw, tense up when you're trying to exert force. Tensed muscles exert more pressure on the blood vessels in/around them, thus squeezing blood out of the peripheral circulation and into the heart and lungs where it can be oxygenated. The energy and oxygen needed for a sudden burst of strength or effort (fast twitch) is already available in the muscle cells, so it can afford to squeeze that extra blood out in favor of oxygenation in the central vasculature. This way, after the fast twitch movement the blood rushes back into the tissue rich with oxygen to get ready for the next movement. I don't know that this has been scientifically proven as the REASON  for clenching the jaw and other uninvolved muscles in a particular task, but I do know that everything I've said is independently true. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When we &quot;bear down&quot; to exert force, we build up pressure by shutting off our airways.  This is done by adducting (pushing together) our vocal folds, closing our mouths, and clenching our jaws.  It's called the Valsalva Maneuver.  It's common in weight lifting.  You also do it when you poop.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Super late to the party here, but I think I can contribute! </p>
<p>One of the reasons this likely happens is the concept of muscle coactivation. The idea with coactivation is, as the name implies, when one muscle or group of muscles activates, nearby and/or related groups of muscles will contribute to the benefit of the desired action. </p>
<p>Even when you do something simple like sticking your arms out, you're not solely using the muscles required for that action. You're also using other muscles to help adjust your balance, and to help stabilize and control the motion more generally. </p>
<p>Clenching your jaw, specifically, probably comes from attempting to balance out and/or stabilize some of the forces and moments generated in your upper arms and neck. </p>
<p>However, this is likely just a piece of the puzzle rather than the whole concept, so do keep that in mind. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>so if you slip, or if (like your body probably suspects) you are engaged in combat, you won't dislocate your jaw or bite you tongue off if something hits your face.  Stone age humans who clenched their jaws during fist fights probably had a better overall chance of getting laid than those who who didn't (on the count of mates like you to have a tongue and be able to eat).  You're the descendent of the humans who fucked the most!</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
