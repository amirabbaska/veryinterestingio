		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>1 trillion stars * about 40% of the galaxy is visible / <a href="http://www.spacetelescope.org/news/heic1502/" target="_blank">3.9 billion pixels</a> = 100 stars/pixel. So using the photo to count stars is definitely out of the question.</p>
<p>The way we estimate the number of stars in a galaxy is <a href="http://www.space.com/25959-how-many-stars-are-in-the-milky-way.html" target="_blank">by the mass of the galaxy and the average star</a>. This hasn't changed with the new high-res photo, as far as I'm aware.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Astronomer here with relevant username!  Short answer: I doubt it.  The reason is even though it's an astounding photograph, the majority of stars are too faint to image that far away.  Red dwarf stars make up the far majority of the individual stars in our galaxy, for example- like 90% of them- and are super faint.  Like Proxima Centauri, the closest star to us just over 4 light years away, is a red dwarf, but you need a telescope to see it.</p>
<p>So while this picture is great for working out stellar dynamics in a big galaxy and the like, you're still just seeing a small fraction of all the stars in Andromeda.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015AAS...22521303J" target="_blank">Here</a> is a link to the abstract of the talk(?) given at the American Astronomical Society meeting, possibly a paper to follow...</p>
<p>The crucial term used for understanding this image is &quot;spatially resolved&quot;, which is to say they have separated each star out, rather than being smeared into a continuous background glow.  Note the stars have individual colours assigned indicating different types of stars.</p>
<p>Apparently this was part of a citizen science project getting members of the public to count star clusters within the image, the goal (maybe) being to identify star formation rates between dense clusters and loose clusters.  The results confirmed the theories... </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The brain is an incredible structure with complexity, abilities, interactions and wonders that we may never understand. The entire human body is composed of an estimated 35 trillion cells with more than 300 different types all working together for the benefit of the whole. Along with our &quot;human&quot; cells more than 100 times as many bacteria, viruses and other microorganisms live in and on us any mostly contribute to the well being of the entire body. We and all the rest of the living beings as well as the non living materials and structures of the planet make up a whole biosphere that may be more complex than the rest of the known universe. So combined with the rest of the universe which we are indeed a part of we are participating in a most amazing dance of subatomic particles, energies, planets, stars, gas clouds and galaxies. We are made of the smallest things and part of the great great universe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
