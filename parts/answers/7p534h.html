		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A single channel record works by having one axis of modulation; the groove moves the needle back and forth and the needle follows, creating an electrical signal.</p>
<p>For two channels, as you would have with stereo sound, you need two axes of modulation. You could have one axis moving side to side and one axis moving up and down. The problem is that the vertical axis would be more prone to distortion due to the limited range (i.e., the needle can move further left to the right than it can up and down).</p>
<p>The compromise is that the two needles are turned 45 degrees, so that the point at which they meet is the needle tip. This way, they can have two axes, while still taking advantage of the greater horizontal space (the axes will <em>both</em> move up and down and left to right).</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;vinyl sound&quot; isn't really a hard science. Vinyl is an imperfect transfer of signal to electricity and is in my mind the reason for the &quot;vinyl sound&quot;. /u/Soloandthewookiee gave a pretty good explanation of how the channels are separated, and it works pretty good, but given that physical contact is needed to transfer the signal to electricity, there is always going to be slight distortion in vinyl.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The &quot;vinyl sound&quot; results from a combination of many different factors, but the main thing you need to be familiar with is second order harmonic distortion, the same thing responsible for the &quot;warmth&quot; associated with vacuum tube amplifiers.</p>
<p>Vinyl records don't have two entirely independent channels. Even super high end phono cartridges only have a channel separation of around 30dB, whereas digital formats have a channel separation of 90dB and greater, depending on the DAC.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>More important is the mono bass below 250Hz and the distortion it creates, along with slight wow and flutter. It is more &quot;alive&quot; since it in small amounts &quot;all over the place&quot;, the signal never repeats exactly the same way. Then is the bandwidth that stops bass below 40Hz and anything useful above 15k, forcing a bit &quot;tighter&quot; mix. And last comes dynamic range, useful range being somewhere in the 30-40dB range, thus forcing differently crushed mastering and mixing, using lots of saturation rather than aggressive peak limiting that is possible in digital.</p>
<p>There is way less room in every direction and it forces limits on the material. It is totally about preferences, there are ways of getting that vinyl sound without using a single analog device, all it takes is that audiophiles accept deliberately colorized processing. Which they don't, it has to be done in a sort of Rube Goldberg way: by using technically inferior format and then trying to do their best to salvage as much as it is possible.. Instead we could start from super dynamic source and apply the limitations and mistakes vinyl does. The difference in price is about 20$ vs 20 000$.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It’s a design limitation/ something to consider when making a record, but that’s why any song is mixed with mono compatibility in mind, so that anywhere between no crosstalk and full crosstalk (mono), it should still sound good. I don’t think anyone gets particularly excited about the crosstalk when talking about the sound of vinyl. </p>
<p>There is also some crosstalk between channels in many devices like stereo preamps, amplifiers, phones even. It’s usually there in some amount when listening to music.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
