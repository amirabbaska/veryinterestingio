		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I learned from this guy, <a href="https://youtu.be/JQc9L2RbQkw" target="_blank">Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli</a>. In time, this was reinforced by true life experience. To this day, a light rap on a CPU will unstick a CD tray.</p>
<p>Edit: CPU in the generic, 1985 definition meaning the desktop case and all components within. Note this definition is wildly newer than The Fonz's technique.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a result of frustration. Watched a study documenting frustration in animals; They basically taught a squirrel how to open a box with a nut in it, but when they made it so that the box wouldn't open or the nut was gone, the squirrel would become frustrated and try to break the box or throw it around. It was theorized that frustration in animals is a result of subverted expectations and in order to &quot;work around&quot; the new problem, excessive force was impulsive. If you can't open the box, break it. This mechanism is probably enough for regular animals, but is definitely obsolete when said animals start producing complicated and delicate machines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In old televisions and radios, there were tubes that made them work. Nowadays, everything is solid state but back when I was a kid, transistors and diodes were in vacuum tubes. These tubes plugged into backplanes. When the device got static in it or got to where it didn't receive a signal very well, hitting it on the top or the side would jostle things internally and make those tubes get a better connection in the backplane. The tubes had 5, 6, 7 and more connectors, so getting them all to make a good connection required some tweaking by hitting sometimes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
