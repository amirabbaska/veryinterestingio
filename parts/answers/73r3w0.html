		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've actually learned about this in anatomy courses (not specifically the cleaning it off surfaces part though) so here's a bit more information off the top of my head.</p>
<p>Without getting too detailed, there are a lot of things in semen.  Within the first few minutes or so, there are proteins that will coagulate and make it sticky.  Heat makes microscopic things move faster, so something warm will speed up the process.  There are also enzymes that will start to break down the proteins, making the semen more liquid again after another 10 minutes or so. There doesn't seem to be a reason for it as far as we know, and I can't confirm it because I've never left semen around long enough to find out.  I think you'll find that if exposed to air it will start to dry up anyway, which kinda negates the fact that it gets less sticky.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
