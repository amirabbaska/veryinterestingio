		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You know the spring door stopper behind many house hold doors.  Same concept. It's not made to be slammed into by a train but if the train were to roll to far or be under a little power the train stopper can absorb some of the impact and push the train back and keep it from falling off the tracks so to speak </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They are like heavy duty springs, If the train is  slowly rolling toward it it will push it back the way it came. If the train is going full speed it might as well not even be there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They absorb some low speed impacts. The shape of the buffer generally pushes the absorbed energy down to the rails and into the ground. At a certain speed though, it will just shear off the rails and the train will keep going. You can get hydraulic ones that can absorb more energy <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Estaci%C3%B3_de_Fran%C3%A7a_(Barcelona)_0016_Hydraulic_buffers.JPG" target="_blank">https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/15/Estaci%C3%B3_de_Fran%C3%A7a_(Barcelona)_0016_Hydraulic_buffers.JPG</a>. But chances are, a train going full speed, there isn't much that can stop it, or absorb all the energy safely.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
