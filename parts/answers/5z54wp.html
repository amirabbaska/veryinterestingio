		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer requires accepting that according to quantum mechanics, atoms and molecules can only have specific energies, called energy levels. You can be in energy level 0, 1, 2, etc, but higher energy levels require the atom to take in energy from the surroundings such as from heat. At absolute zero there is no heat, so every atom or molecule will be in energy level 0 at absolute zero (we call this the ground state). But the funny thing about quantum mechanics is, it teaches us that everything has what is called &quot;zero-point energy&quot;. This is the energy of the ground state, and you can never have less energy than this. For a very light atom like helium, the small amount of zero-point energy is actually enough to make the atoms move around a lot. This is called zero-point motion. (All things experience zero-point motion, but for bigger atoms or molecules these motions may be too small to make any noticeable difference). For helium, these zero-point motions prevent the atoms from coming close enough together to solidify, so even at absolute zero it exists as a liquid. </p>
<p>However, if you compress the liquid helium enough, you can form a solid,  but only at pressures above about 25 atm (25x atmospheric pressure) for helium-4, the most common isotope. Even in the solid form there are still large zero-point motions, so it doesn't behave like a classical solid where every atom has an exact fixed location. Because of this, solid helium is referred to as a quantum solid.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Absolute Zero is not the point where molecules stop moving. Molecules will still vibrate, even at Absolute Zero.</p>
<p>What Absolute Zero is, is the <em>ground state</em> energy. You cannot go to a lower energy level than that. Bonds between atoms have what's called &quot;Zero-point energy&quot; which means the ground state isn't 0. This is why heavy water is toxic while supposedly isotopes have the same chemical properties. The zero-point energy depends on the mass, and as deuterium is twice the mass of hydrogen, it has very different zero-point energy. This means the bonds between deuterium and oxygen in water are harder to break than between hydrogen and oxygen, and that changes the rates of reaction for a whole host of biological processes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A solid is defined by &quot;structural rigidity and resistance to changes of shape or volume.&quot; Meaning the atoms/molecules are all stuck together and don't move around.<br />
If it does not move around, but never gets stuck together, it is not a solid.<br />
Freezing helium to absolute zero would do that to helium.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to my understanding Helium as well as most other substances turns into a different state of matter called a Bose-Einstein Condensate when it approaches absolute zero.  At this point the wave properties of the particles become exaggerated and overlap making it difficult to know where one particle begins and another ends. </p>
<p>Look up the Nova documentary &quot;The Conquest of Cold&quot;. The second half deals with modern attempts to reach as close to absolute zero as we are able. </p>
