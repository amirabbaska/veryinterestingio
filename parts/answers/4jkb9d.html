		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://examine.com/supplements/marijuana/" target="_blank">Examine</a> compiled a list of confirmed and unconfirmed results by various studies. Scroll down to the Human Effect Matrix.</p>
<p>The results aren't shocking however. The medical properties found <em>and confirmed</em> so far are minor pain relief and minor MS symptom relief. Relaxation comes behind it with low consistency and while it's one of the properties it is most prescribed for, you could argue that it doesn't qualify as a medical property.</p>
<p>It's also used as a way to improve well-being for patients of harsh treatments like chemotherapy, but there is no consensus yet on whether it works as a pure medicine in this way or also partly as a placebo or regular food supplement. Of course it largely depends on what you define as 'medicine': a healing drug, a symptom reliever, a placebo that works, anything approved by the FDA etc. etc.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There isn't much evidence. There is anecdotal evidence that it helps things like seizures, but there's about as much as there is supporting homeopathy and acupuncture. That's the biggest reason why there have been next to no doctors advocating in favor of medical marijuana. Ultimately, the most physicians can say is that there should be more studies.</p>

<p>Edit: I realize that this is an unpopular opinion on Reddit, but the OP asked for evidence. Science, Nature, Jama, and the New England Journal of Medicine are high quality peer reviewed journals. Just because they don't give you what you want doesn't make them wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>EDIT: It's been pointed out that scheduling is a US-centric topic. There should be studies in other countries around the world (and they may be scattered in my links). Also, a better summary: research suggests that marijuana can help for pain, seizure, and cancer, but many places make it hard to do the research.</p>
<p>Marijuana's scheduling makes it exceedingly difficult to actually run studies on the drug, creating a somewhat self-fulfilling situation, but there are more and more studies about the medical uses.</p>
<p>There's a non-profit called <a href="https://norml.org" target="_blank">NORML</a> that seems to have a decent amount of well-cited articles on the drug.  On the current topic, you can take a look at their <a href="http://norml.org/component/zoo/category/recent-research-on-medical-marijuana" target="_blank">recent research page</a>. The <a href="http://norml.org/library/item/chronic-pain" target="_blank">chronic pain research page</a> has 22 citations, 12 of which link to the NIH website.  The studies seem to show a 30-50% decrease in pain over placebo.  One study seemed to show that THC and CBD combined create a greater pain reduction than THC alone. Another study suggests that cannabinoids may increase the efficacy of opioids, allowing for lower opioid doses (thereby lowering the chance of developing an addiction to the opoiods).</p>
<p>The biggest problem that I see with much of the research that is cited is small sample size, which is likely due to the scheduling of the drug making it difficult to get any significant amount for use in research.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>One of the major things marijuana does do is make you hungry, so you do want to eat. As such the non-affected parts of your body stay happy and the quality of life improves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From a neuroscientific point of view, cannabinoids bind to receptors within the body (CB receptors) and will elicit a response. Whether this response is 'medicinal' depends on what you define as medicinal and what alternatives are there for marijuana to elicit a similar response. We have endogenous cannabinoids named endocannabinoids which marijuana more or less mimics.</p>
<p>So far research has pointed out that marijuana is effective in:</p>
<p>1- Making patients feel less pain or have an altered and less 'hurtful' perception of pain.</p>
<p>2- Stimulate appetite and weight gain in normal as well as wasting individuals.</p>
<p>3- Induces a mild state of euphoria that may be related to the mechanism by which pain is ameliorated.</p>
<p>However, it has also been reported that exogenous cannabinoid intake may:</p>
<p>1- Trigger or induce psychiatric illness.</p>
<p>2- Cause excessive weight gain - including gynaecomastia (development of breasts in males)</p>
<p>3- (or may not) cause changes yet unknown to us to the developing nervous system.</p>
<p>Due to the nascency of the research, we know very little at this moment. Marijuana's therapeutic potential seems very plausible though more research is definitely needed. As a doctor to be, I think that if a patient would like to self-medicate with marijuana, that should be their choice and if they see benefit in it and have an improved quality of life, then my job is done. At present, we know of very little detriment associated with marijuana use to justify withdrawing it completely from patients. </p>
<p>There is potential for abuse with marijuana, as with many many drugs. I would definitely prescribe marijuana over an opioid for chronic pain. No marijuana overdoses have ever been documented.</p>
<p>edit: explanations for the points above:</p>
<p>As u/THE_CHRONIC_GARDENER said, marijuana is a stimulant that initially suppresses your appetite but then causes your body to enter a state where it feels that it should replenish the energy that was consumed during the 'stimulated' time. This is effective in patients who are losing weight due to malignancies and are often nauseated due to chemotherapy. Here, marijuana can allow them to tolerate the nausea better and replenish their energy.</p>
<p>The gynecomastia mechanism is poorly understood - it may be related to the altered fat metabolism or the changes in prolactin and other hormone levels due to marijuana use.</p>
<p>Many of the psychiatric problems associated with marijuana have been documented in association studies, which are subjective and don't really prove causation. It is just an association that was noticed that is subject to confounding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
