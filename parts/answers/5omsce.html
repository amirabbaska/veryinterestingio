		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Firstly, it is important to note that this is not the radius of the <em>entire</em> Universe. This is the radius of the <em>observable</em> Universe, that is the part of the Universe where light has had a chance to reach us.</p>
<p>So, if the Universe is only ~14 billion years old, how is it that we can see out to about 93 billion light-years? Well, that's because the Universe is expanding! After a distant galaxy released some light that began its 14 billion year journey, the space between us and that galaxy grew. Once the light finally reached us, that galaxy is now 93 billion light-years away. So we can actually &quot;see&quot; much farther than just 14 billion light-years!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="https://youtu.be/QXfhGxZFcVE" target="_blank">there's a great video by PBS spacetime on this</a> </p>
<p>Here's the premise. Space expands, as space expands, light traveling through it redshifts. If we know how much expansion has happened in the past and at what time, we can use this redshift of light and the original color of this light to figure out how far away the emission point of that light is. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When everyone talks about &quot;space between these two points are increasing&quot; -- I understand the analogy of the balloon. </p>
<p>But what I am having trouble with is that if two bodies are getting further apart due space increasing -- what the hell Is space? How is it increasing? Does space have mass? I don't understand what the hell it actually IS. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>What if there was another Big Bang trillions of light years away. And that adjacent event's light reached our view and essentially filled the sky with the light of trillions of stars never seen. How quickly would this light appear, and How quickly would we have to adapt to the new sources or light during what we currently call nighttime?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
