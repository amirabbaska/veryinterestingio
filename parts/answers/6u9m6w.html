		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>From what I gather, the conifer branches have structural differences on the top and bottom that allow half of the branch to take in or release water from the air much more quickly than the other half. As relative humidity in the air changes, the moisture content of one half of the branch changes and thus the turgidity of that half changes as well. Higher humidity leads to increased turgidity and will cause one half to expand, while lower humidity will cause that half to contract. In both cases, the other half will for the most part stay the same. This difference in lengths means the branch will flex to one side or another, very similar to the way an analog thermostat works (albeit with temperature rather than humidity). </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to <a href="http://www.new-potato.com/wstick/Science/science.html" target="_blank">this site</a>, it is caused in various softwoods (not just spruce) by differential absorption of moisture in the cells at the top of the branch from the bottom of the branch, which in turn is caused by forces on the branch while it is growing.</p>
<p>In short, as trees grow, a force presses  against them, making them curve away from the force, which could deform or even snap off parts of the tree.  In defense, the cells on the inside of the curve (the side toward which the force is pushing them) develop to be better at withstanding compressive forces.  The wood these cells form is called <em>reaction wood</em>.</p>
<p>Although these forces may sometimes be prevailing winds, something leaning against the tree, vines pulling at the tree, or the tree leaning because of landslide or erosion, gravity is a force that is always there, so while reaction wood might be found elsewhere, it is almost always found on the underside of branches.</p>
<p>Finally, we get to why the branches curve up or down according to weather:  Reaction wood absorbs more moisture, making it expand and contract more with humidity changes.  So, when humidity increases, the wood on the underside of the branch expands more than the wood on the topside.  This causes the branch to curve up when humidity increases, and down when it decreases.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
