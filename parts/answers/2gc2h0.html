<p><strong>TL;DR</strong> Caffeine has a half life of around 4-6 hours in the human body.  Withdrawal symptoms typically begin around 12-24 hours after abrupt caffeine abstinence.  Caffeine withdrawal symptoms have been shown to reach peak intensity between 20 and 51 hours after abstinence and tend to last between 2 to 9 days.  However, the possibility of withdrawal headaches have been suggested to occur up to 21 days after abstinence. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><strong><em>TL;DR: For a &quot;typical&quot; individual, withdrawal begins within 24 hours, peaks around 36 hours, and lasts around a week. Tolerance significantly decreases after a week of caffeine abstinence. Tolerance is built within a week of chronic usage. The increase in mental acuity is unrelated to caffeine tolerance.</em></strong></p>
<p>Bit late to the party, but I'm having a bit of difficulty locating exactly what I think you're looking for (might be due to my lack of caffeine after studying for so long). However, I can extrapolate a bit from glancing over a couple studies - one in particular (linked at bottom of post). The first part here is a general symptom-based answer and the end is a bit more technical:</p>
<p>Individuals experiencing significant symptoms following cessation of caffeine intake consume more than 129 mg caffeine daily. A typical withdrawal period begins within the first 6 to 24 hours since the last dose. This varies primarily depending upon how dependent the user is. The <strong>withdrawal peaks in symptoms at approximately 36 hours and last several days in total.</strong> Notable residual withdrawal <strong>may last up to a week,</strong> depending on the level of chronic usage. This indicates that the neurochemical pathways of interest (particularly the receptors) likely reset to a basal level within a week post-withdrawal.</p>
<p>There are some gems hidden in this article as well: </p>
<p>Interestingly, those people who are not tolerant to caffeine tend to experience negative side effects upon consuming caffeine:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Heavy consumers of coffee show a preference for coffee that contains caffeine, while those who used to drink decaffeinated coffee will choose either decaffeinated or caffeine-containing coffee. When subjects are categorized between caffeine choosers and nonchoosers, <strong>caffeine choosers tend to report both positive subjective effects of caffeine (stimulant and positive effects on mood and vigilance) as well as negative subjective effects of placebo (headache and fatigue), while caffeine nonchoosers tend to report negative effects of caffeine (primarily anxiety and dysphoria)...</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Caffeine tolerance is especially rapid in animals and made more rapid with intake of other methyxanthines. The typical result is an increased dosage over time to compensate. Locomotor function has been shown to return to normal by the third day following the last administration, though the mechanism is not certain.</p>
<p>More relevant to what I think you are trying to find out is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conversely, although tolerance to the enhancement of arithmetic skills by caffeine was recently shown, there is only limited evidence for tolerance to caffeine-induced alertness and wakefulness. These effects are paralleled by the lack of tolerance of cerebral energy metabolism to caffeine, since *<em>an acute administration of 10 mg/kg</em> caffeine induces the same metabolic increases whether the rats have been exposed to a previous daily chronic treatment by caffeine or saline for 15 days.** These data show that every single exposure to caffeine is able to produce cerebral stimulant effects and this is especially true in the areas that control locomotor activity (caudate nucleus) and the structures involved in the sleep-wake cycle (locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei and reticular formation).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>*10 mg/kg of caffeine in a rat is equivalent to 200-300 mg of caffeine in a 70 kg human.</p>
<p>This indicates, to me, that the mental effects that you benefit from while taking caffeine are <strong>not</strong> effected by a neurotransmitter tolerance.</p>
<p>FWIW, although I can't find any sources directly related to the neurochemical tolerance and withdrawal periods, it seems as though most effects balance out by the end of the week following going cold turkey. In this same vein, it seems as though tolerance to caffeine can be induced exceptionally quickly, somewhere between 2 and 7 days.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Likewise, tolerance to sleep latency and quality to caffeine has been shown to develop over 2 days of testing in one study and 7 days in another. However, the tolerance is not complete and the sleep efficiency remains below 90% of the baseline value after 7 days of caffeine treatment.</p>

<p>This measures symptoms of withdraw, rather than actual NT levels or receptors.  Nevertheless, I think it's unlikely that you're going to find a direct answer to your question as you need to sample tissue to properly assay.  Perhaps someone has done some rat studies, but I didn't find anything.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, it's going to vary by how much caffeine you consume and your own particular physiology.</p>
<p>Getting at the molecular biology, though, there's a few things going on.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Actual NT levels can vary quite quickly.  The transport, synthesis, and degradation of common NTs is on the order of microseconds (e.g. NT release) to minutes and hours.  When you cease caffeine intake, though, you're not going to have a large effect on NT levels at all; rather, these effects will come from the receptors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caffeine is an adenosine receptor antagonist.  In terms of receptor activity, caffeine will make it seem like there is less adenosine in your system.  Over time, your body compensates for this by upregulating adenosine receptor levels.  When you stop taking caffeine, you have more receptors than you need and the effects of normal adenosine levels are much greater.  Recovering from this compensation will take as long as it takes your receptor levels to go back to normal.  This involves cycling the receptors between places in the cell where they are and are not active, but also in the actual synthesis and degradation of the receptors.</p>
</li>
<li>The regulatory response depends on the specific genes involved, but generally they proceed by positive and negative feedback loops.  E.g. adenosine receptor signaling can act to downregulate adenosine receptor levels (negative-feedback).  For a basic idea of how long this might take, I found this paper talking about acetylcholine receptors:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>In studies using repeated imaging of identified neuromuscular junctions in living adult mice, the half-time of synaptic AChRs was estimated to be approximately 14 days36. Blockade of neurotransmission rapidly (within 2 h) decreased the half-time 25-fold, to less than 1 day. The decrease in half-time appeared to reflect a combination of increased lateral dispersal of synaptic nAChRs and increased internalization. More recent studies using repeated in vivo imaging have provided evidence that nAChRs that are internalized at neuromuscular junctions can be recycled to the cell surface and reincorporated at the synapse37; this recycling apparently requires synaptic activity37. It is interesting to note that recycled nAChRs are subsequently removed from the synapse more quickly than newly inserted nAChRs that were not (yet) recycled37, suggesting that recycled receptors are somehow tagged or in some way differ from “naive” receptors in their interactions with other proteins.</p>

<p>Clearly there's a pretty cool regulatory network in charge of this, and shows how responsive receptor levels can be.  The rate of degradation is strongly regulated in this case, and that's likely the key aspect of caffeine withdraw.  If nothing else, this tells us that we probably can't make assumptions about how adenosine receptors are regulated (and my quick lit search didn't find anything obvious).</p>
<p>Unfortunately that's not a real answer, but that at least gives you an idea of what might be going on.  Somewhere in that 2-9 day time frame your adenosine receptor levels go back to normal and the withdraw ends.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Relatively quickly. Unlike receptor downregulation found in other addictions due to over-activation of receptors (e.g., opiod addiction. alcohol addiction ,etc.), caffeine is an <em>antagonist</em> of the adenosine receptor types, which are responsible for making you feel tired when activated by free adenosine, a compound which naturally builds up in the brain as a consequence of waking metabolism.</p>
<p>What happens when you quit drinking caffeine is that the adenosine receptors become particularly sensitive to activation, which for all this time have been antagonized by caffeine, thus you feel sluggish and tired when the caffeine is taken away. Or you may have headaches due to narrowing of some blood vessels as a consequence of hypersensitivity to the vasoconstricting effects of certain adenosine receptor activation.</p>
<p>Overall, the receptor sensitivity returns to normal over the course of usually 1-3 days. Neurotransmitter levels themselves are not terribly impacted by caffeine; rather, it affects how the brain reacts to neurotransmitters.</p>
<p>Edit: I should add, 1-3 days following the first or second metabolic half-life (or third or fourth if you're a heavy caffeine user) of caffeine (around 9 hours for most people).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
