		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you smell &quot;chlorine&quot; in a pool then you should suspect the pool is becoming un-sanitized. In a balanced pool there should be little if any smell and the water should be sparkling blue. The smell people associate with chlorine is actually chloramine, which is chlorine bound with organic matter and when in high enough concentrations will also give the water a slight greenish tinge. There are three measurements for chlorine in a pool - Free Chlorine, Combined Chlorine, and Total Chlorine. Many pool owners only check for Total Chlorine and this is not an accurate measure of the sanitizer in the pool. Free Chlorine and Combined Chlorine make up the Total Chlorine. When free chlorine reacts with organic compounds it becomes bound with those and is Combined Chlorine. This is no longer an effective sanitizer since it's effectively &quot;used up&quot;. The only effective sanitizer is the Free Chlorine in the pool. So, if you smell chloramine and the water is a little dingy looking, you might want to stay out. The only way to clear the chloramine is to &quot;shock&quot; the pool with a very large dose of chlorine witch then basically &quot;burns up&quot; the chloramine leaving the water with fresh Free Chlorine until the introduction of more organic stuff like sweat, urine, bacteria and so on.</p>
<p>So, if a pool tester shows the Total Chlorine is high it will no be effective any longer if the Free Chlorine is low since most of the Total Chlorine is Combined Chlorine. Most pool owners do not check for Free Chlorine so their pools may not be as sanitary as they think.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>certified pool spa operator here.  The problem with using chlorine is that chlorine can take days to kill bacteria.  So just because someone put a buttload of chlorine in the water does not mean it is disinfected.  The reason i stopped using public pools/spas all together was because of this reason.  After many years of cleaning commercial pools there is one thing i realized.  Everyone and i mean EVERYONE pees in the pool.  Some people even shit in the pool.  The pool can have a chlorine level of 5 but the free chlorine which is the chlorine that kills germs may be 0-1 which is not gonna kill any germs.  Also chlorine does not last forever it will disintegrate from sunlight, heat, bodily fluids, and time.  So if there is one form of advice a pool guy can give is to never swim in a public pool, and if you are going to swim in a pool have chlorine strips to test the amount of free chlorine in the water.  It is amazing how much useless stuff i know about pools.. Also eyes burning is not from chlorine which actually has no effect on the burning of eyes its actually the ph of the water that makes your eyes burn.  When I was studying to get certified I remember a story of the play boy mansions grotto and how everyone that was swimming or even stood around the grotto and breathed in the fumes got sick from it.  I forgot what kind of sickness it was but it was a weird one so always remember never get in a pool or spa that is foamy that is all bacteria.  The pool must be blue crystal clear not dull and hazy.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Lots of good info here, though I have one more tidbit to add.</p>
<p>For the most part, if a pool is well maintained and keeps a constant level of sanitizer (chlorine, usually), most bacteria are killed off within 15-20 minutes. The problem comes from pools that aren't maintained properly, or pools that have had something particularly nasty introduced.</p>
<p>The big ones are giardia, legionnaire's, and cryptosporidium. The first two can be killed off with typical chlorine levels within a few hours, but crypto is a nasty contender that can stick around indefinitely if the water isn't treated well.</p>
<p>What it usually comes down to is negligence; if you got sick from a pool, someone want doing their job right to prevent it from happening in the first place.</p>
