		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm really worried about this thread. As a trauma surgeon I can tell u that the amount of energy passed to u during a high speed accident is so high it doesn't mean fuck all is you are relaxed or asleep or eating cheetos: MAYBE DURING A LOW SPEED, LOW ENERGY ACCIDENT but not in a life threatening high speed accident. A common injury in severe car accidents is pelvic fracture. You couldn't break a typical human pelvis bone with a sledge hammer. The amount of energy transmitted is astounding. No amount of relaxation will counter that .....</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It has to do with flexibility and how energy is absorbed. When a flexible object absorbs energy the energy is used and dispersed in making the object move. </p>
<p>If something solid and rigid were to absorb the same energy more of the energy is focused into the internal structure since it doesn't move as much and really rattles the composition. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I imagine the &quot;tense up to protect and reduce damage&quot; reaction is an evolutionary response to evolutionary problems. Your neighbour hitting you with a rock, an animal headbutting you, a tree branch falling on you. Evolutionary, we are not trained to properly react to impact in 60+mph metal cubicles so we use the only reaction we have, which happens to be the wrong one.</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p>If your question was about the actual act rather than the question of &quot;why don't we do this&quot; then imagine a series of three metal bars, connected in a line with lockable joints. Now lock the joins so the metal bars form into a stiff shape and imagine another group of bars but with unlocked joints. If you put a lot of impact onto it, the energy has to go somewhere. The energy doesn't simply dissipate into thin air. If the impact is hard enough, it can overcome either the strength of the locks or material strength of the bars, breaking them. but if they are unlocked, the system deforms (in a way that's easy for it usually) absorbing some of the energy. The act of deforming absorbs energy.</p>
<p>Your body, your bones and joints, are that system. When you tense up, you lock up your locks and the impact force either breaks those locks, or your bones. If you're not tense, then your body &quot;deforms&quot; (your arms bend, your legs bend, you bend your torso) and since the human body is generally <em>a lot</em> more elastic than people are comfortable thinking about, your body does a decent job of absorbing most of the energy in a relatively safe way.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In an accident, it all comes down to absorbing the energy from the impact so that as little of it is transferred to your body in the form of a sudden, jolting stop.  Your body does the same thing.  When relaxed, the muscle groups absorb large amounts of the energy from the impact.  If they are tensed up, they can't do that.  The energy just gets transferred through them.</p>
<p>If you want to try this yourself, stand on the bottom stair of a staircase and jump off.  As you land, you should notice that your legs automatically bend slightly and you'll feel almost no impact.  Now try it again with your leg muscles stiff.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
