		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Never go online. Never use a credit or debit card. Never get an ID card or government ID number. Make sure you never did any of these things in the past either. Also, when you are born, make sure you and your parents move to the woods and never have contact with other humans.</p>
<p>Seriously though, until this year (2016 tax year), someone could just submit tax returns with any SSN as long as they did it first. It's possible you just got unlucky rather than actually having your identity stolen. This year, there was more security in place. Your info could have also been stolen from somewhere else (corporate or government hack). It's hard to know why or how.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You put your SSN on a lot of shit.</p>
<p>Medical forms,</p>
<p>Applications</p>
<p>Etc...</p>
<p>It's possible that someone snagged a bunch of paper records, or someone hacked a company's database which stored this info (quite common in fact)</p>
<p>Then the person actually using your SSN probably just bought it on the black market </p>
<p>Unfortunately this is something you can never be truly protected from, especially since the secure storage of data is still the exception, rather than the norm</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The short answer: It is not possible.  </p>
<p>Longer Answer: Your identity getting stolen has a lot more to do with what the corporations and entities that have your information are doing with it than anything you are doing.  </p>
<p>Under a few specific circumstances, like say getting hacked and having health data stolen because you weren't following the law with regards to how it had to be handled, you can get in trouble for actions that will result in identity theft.  </p>
<p>But someone paying for LexisNexus data and then going out to steal your identity is probably one of the easiest ways. They already collected all the data that you need from public records ect. Unless it becomes illegal to traffic in data on people that can result in identity theft, its going to keep happening.</p>
<p>There are also a variety of other factors in play:</p>
<ul>
<li>Companies collect data that can be used to steal your identity, like your social insurance number, as a means of identifying you</li>
<li>There isn't any consequences to just covering up the fact you got hacked instead of disclosing it to people</li>
<li>If you do get hacked and a bunch of data stolen that lets other people steal identities, you aren't the person who deals with any repercussions, so no incentive to protect against it in the first place</li>
<li>Banks are the major fraud targets, and their &quot;solution&quot; to identity theft has typically been &quot;more of the same&quot; like asking additional questions about who you are on the phone ... which are frequently also stolen via the same methods thieves use now. Until some kind of two-factor authentication shows up that banks feel like integrating, no one else will follow suit</li>
<li>The &quot;Everyone else does it this way&quot; factor is really large in business. Its an excuse a lot of people hide behind for not having better processes in place, or just not collecting data they don't need in the first place</li>
<li>And if I recall, the terrorism laws after 2001 led to a proliferation of entities collecting Social Security Numbers, like clerks at CVS collecting them for those prepaid credit cards you can buy. This made it a lot easier to get ahold of them, and meant there were more places to find them, like the junky computer from 1993 CVS has in the back that has never been updated</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You aren't protected. You won't be protected until security professionals get ahead of data criminals.  All you can do is protect yourself and hope that the various agencies and corporations are as committed to preventing data theft as you are.</p>
<p>2015</p>
<blockquote>
<p>WASHINGTON — The Obama administration on Thursday revealed that 21.5 million people were swept up in a colossal breach of government computer systems that was far more damaging than initially thought, resulting in the theft of a vast trove of personal information, including Social Security numbers and some fingerprints.
Every person given a government background check for the last 15 years was probably affected, the Office of Personnel Management said in announcing the results of a forensic investigation of the episode, whose existence was known but not its sweeping toll.</p>

<p>May 26, 2015</p>
<blockquote>
<p>U.S. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen said on Tuesday there were about 200,000 attempts to illegally access tax information from February to May this year.
He said of those, about 100,000 were successful. The hackers used the &quot;get transcript&quot; application, which calls up information from previous returns, he said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>2016</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In February, a seemingly rogue hacker targeted the FBI and DHS, publishing contact information for 20k and 9k employees, respectively, on Twitter. The hacker compromised the email of a DoJ employee, which gave him access to the information. One of NASA’s drones was allegedly hacked by the known hacktivist group Anonsec, and data on over 2,400 employees, along with flight log and aircraft videos were released. A 300-page zine was released, detailing the information and security failings of NASA. The hack was executed through brute-forcing an administrator’s SSH password left with a default password, which led to root access to three network-attached-storage devices. Lastly, the IRS was hacked in February and an estimated 700,000 social security numbers and other sensitive information was stolen, just months after its most recent hack in May of 2015 (not counting compromised information resulting from a lost flash drive in August 2015). The attack, which took advantage of the ‘Get Transcript’ program, allowing you to check your tax history, severely increased the risk of identity theft for all victims who had data compromised.</p>
