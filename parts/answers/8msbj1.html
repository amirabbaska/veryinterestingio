<p>No, not &quot;cancer&quot; by definition, but they could get a mutation that makes them &quot;immortal&quot; and reproduce without limit.  Such a colonly would probably kill itself off by using up all its resources too quickly, though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The previous answer doesn't really address the question asked, since cellular immortality through division is only abnormal for multi-cellular organisms.</p>
<p>Cancer is typically defined as unregulated cellular replication. In the context of humans this makes sense - your cells are supposed to form a body, and only a specialized subset divide to replenish dying cells or try to make a new organism. So a cell that says, &quot;screw it&quot;, and starts dividing like crazy, is abnormal.</p>
<p>Well, for a single-celled organism, they are all already immortal! They are supposed to divide forever. But... and this is very important, they are not supposed to divide <em>unregulated</em>. You might wonder, why would a single-celled organism, which needs to divide to reproduce, ever want to not divide?</p>
<p>Well, this might happen when there is not enough food for two daughter cells to actually grow. Or maybe there is a poison in the environment that prevents DNA replication. Or maybe the cell is currently too small to divide again. In all three situations, the cell would benefit from holding off on division, and waiting out the problem.</p>
<p>So in the context of single-celled organisms, unregulated cell division doesn't result in a massive tumor. On the contrary, the cells are already kind of like a cancer in that they simply want to (and can) divide forever. No, unregulated cell division of a single celled organism can be <em>deadly</em>.</p>
<p>By trying to divide while starving, poisoned or small, these mutant cells basically kill themselves. What is very fascinating, though, is that the mutations that cause this to happen are very frequently in some of the same genes that contribute to cancer when mutated in humans.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of papers on the topic, though it is admittedly some dense reading:</p>
