		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Your body is repairing itself. Many cells DNA could have been damaged, so your cells need extra nutrients to repair the damage, make new cells, and make more melanin. That means extra blood goes to the area. The redness itself is capillaries expanding near the surface of the skin. It's not residual heat leftover from the sun.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Im curious about using aloe and how it effects DNA repair. If I put aloe on my sunburnt skin it doesn't peel. Does that mean it's being successfully repaired instead of the skin dieing? If that is true doesn't that increase the chance of a DNA strand not being repaired correctly becoming cancerous? Would it be better to not use aloe and let your skin die and slough off? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When the cells of your bodies undergo major damage from (as an example) excess UV exposure, this causes them to die. In the case of UV exposure this is because of excessive DNA damage that causes the cell to stop functioning correctly. This causes the cell to die and release it's contents into the matrix where it resides. </p>
<p>The cellular contents contain chemical signalling molecules called cytokines (among other things) this interacts with the nearby vasculature causing the cells surroudning blood vessels to become more porous. This allows more fluid to come into the surroudning cellular matrix and more cells called macrophages that &quot;eat&quot; what is remaining of the damaged cells. </p>
<p>This fluid buildup into the matrix causes the redness and swelling associated with DNA damage. This can last a couple of days until all the cellular content is cleaned up. </p>
<p>The other reason is that sometimes a damaged cell does not die immediately. It will die a few days later. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Semi-related question: I recently suffered from a poison ivy rash all over my arms. It felt somewhat like a sunburn, but also itchier. I see people are responding to the sunburn question that the heat is from cells being damaged and more blood flowing to the affected area. Is a poison ivy rash similar to a sunburn in that way?</p>
<p>Also, I went on a hike when the rash was at its peak. Normally I finish all my hikes, though they do wipe me out for the rest of the day. That day, I got very winded, and had to stop in the middle and sit for a while. My rash was turning dark purple and felt extra hot/painful. Is that because the blood was trying to go to both the recovery of my damaged cells and supplying oxygen to my muscles? I went on a hike a week later as the rash was significantly more healed with no trouble. So I wonder if my rash was the factor. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

Click stratum basalis on the right to see skin cells with melanin pigment. The pigment is concentrated on the side of the cell closer to the sun (the top of the page in this case) to try and protect it from UV damage. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
