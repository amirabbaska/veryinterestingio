		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes, for example the diphoton bump at 750 gev at CERN.  It reached statistical significance of 3.5 sigma, but nee data showed it was just a fluctuation. If it was not a statistical fluctuation it would have needed physics outside the standard model to explain it , so there was considerable interest in it last year until it sank down in significance</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Yes. Many of them. There are hundreds of analyses done - various 3 sigma excesses are expected.</p>
<p>The most prominent one in the last years was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/750_GeV_diphoton_excess" target="_blank">750 GeV bump</a> - more than three sigma local significance by two independent experiments at the same place. Triggered about 500 theory papers. Went away with more data.</p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1112.0938" target="_blank">3.5 sigma for delta A_CP</a> was a hot topic in flavor physics in 2011 and 2012 - CP violation in the charm sector was unexpected. Went away with more data.</p>
<p>Random other excesses:</p>
<p><a href="https://cds.cern.ch/record/2204915/" target="_blank">3.7 sigma for excited quarks</a></p>
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03290v3.pdf" target="_blank">3.0 sigma for Z+jets</a></p>
<p><a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/432527/contributions/2207037/attachments/1320513/1980135/ichep_atlas_stop.pdf" target="_blank">3.3 sigma for stop</a> - no update yet, will probably die at Moriond in March.</p>
<p>... and so on.</p>
<p>There were hints of signals with even higher significances that turned out to be no new physics. The OPERA neutrino speed measurement is the most prominent result here: 6 sigma significance of superluminal neutrinos. But then it turned out to be a loose cable.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Recent news articles on CP violation have reached 3-sigma.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CP violation where? The existence of CP violation has been confirmed decades ago, recent experiments just added more places where it has been found.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are multiple examples. You can roughly expect 3-sigma fluctuations 0.3% of the time. So if you run 1000 experiments, you can expect to get erroneous 3-sigma results in 3 of them on average.</p>
<p>Of all the analyses of all the datasets of all the particle physics experiments that have been run, you're bound to find examples.</p>
<p>As you take more data and accumulate more statistics, maybe you start to see that the significance of your &quot;thing&quot; decrease. Or maybe it doesn't go away. Eventually you either reach 5-sigma (the standard for discovery in HEP), or you don't, and all you can do is assume that your experiment was one of the unlucky 3 in 1000 where your result was just due to random chance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
