		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am not a lawyer and not your lawyer and this is not legal advice.</p>
<p>I used to work IT for a very large computer services / sales corporation where an employee had child porn on their system. I was the IT employee who discovered it. I had to preserve the evidence and eventually testify.</p>
<p>Every child porn possession case I've read since then all center on the prosecution proving <em>intent</em> â€” that the person being tried for the crime, <em>intended</em> to be in possession of the child porn.</p>
<p>Snap, Inc. does not intend to be in possession of child porn. They make at least an effort to inform their users to not break the law with their service.</p>
<p>If they bothered to use end-to-end encryption of messages, there would be absolutely no question of prosecutability because they would have no way to understand the content.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It may not be written in the law, but I am certain there is a precedent of sorts that differentiates between private ownership and third party ownership.  For example, if you keep stuff in a storage locker, the storage company becomes a third party owner.  If you kept your locker full of illegal material, the owner of the company would not get in trouble.  The same can apply with bank safety deposit boxes, the postal office, or any other institute that that holds someone else's possessions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Section 230 of the communications decency act offers a lot of protections for a website operator with regards to content posted by users.  You can read about it here:</p>

<p>In the case of Facebook, the objectionable content may be viewed by other parties depending on privacy settings, so reporting tools are made available to the user.  In the case of Snapchat, the message is directed to individuals who aren't likely to report the content as objectionable.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>That would be like arresting Apple or Microsoft CEOs for having a cloud service. Plus I'm pretty sure when you start using Snapchat you agree to a terms of service that prevents what you are suggesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>No because they are no facilitating it. They also are not looking at what people upload. When they do learn of this stuff they remove it. </p>
<p>The CEO doesn't personally oversee everything and as long as it's not his policy to keep/promote child porn on the servers(or really any illegal content) then they can't be found at fault. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
