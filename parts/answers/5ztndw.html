		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You'll notice all the replies you got were from people who a) were very ill, b) had/have depression or c) done all nighters for work or school. The reason is, sleep - how long and when - is closely linked to your biological state and health. In normal circumstances, healthy human adults sleep when it's dark and are awake during the day, eg approximately 8 hours in a 24hour cycle. </p>
<p>The time you feel sleepy, wakeful, and length of time you sleep is called circadian rhythm. At different times of day and night your body produces hormones that aid falling asleep/waking up. For example, melatonin is thought of as the 'sleep' hormone. </p>
<p>In normal people, your daily routine helps encourage a regular circadian rhythm. Sunlight can trigger the release of hormones that make you feel awake and inhibits the release of melatonin. This is why 'normal' people tend to sleep for 6-9 hours, the length of darkness/night time (in most seasons and locations on the earth). If you wake up and go to bed the same time every day, (along with eating at regular times, exercising at regular times, expose yourself to natural light and it's not the middle of summer or winter, etc) then your circadian rhythm will be regular.</p>
<p>People who sleep for different lengths of time- whether very short nights or 20+ hours as in your question, are likely suffering from a disruption of their circadian rhythms. They might have worked a very long day (as people have noted in anecdotes) or had high stress (stress hormones will disrupt the circadian rhythm). If someone does this regularly - shift workers, travelling across multiple time zones, those in the army, illness, etc, your circadian rhythm becomes more and more confused, and if you haven't had the 7-9 hours per 24 that most people need, you'll get what's called a sleep debt. So basically their hormones aren't strong enough to wake them after the normal periods or when it gets light, and they continue sleeping until their bodies have recovered sufficiently from the damage of staying awake too long. Unfortunately, no matter how much 'more' you sleep in the long run, repaying a sleep debt can never completely undo the damage of not allowing your body to sleep regularly. Look after your circadian rhythm!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I remember reading something about this Krakauer's book Eiger Dreams. He talks about being stuck in a tent in Alaska in the 1970s during a spell of bad weather, and how the body seems to naturally want to hibernate when there is nothing else going on. It's been years since I read it, but he speculates a bit about his own experience and the experiences of others.</p>
<p>Juxtapose that sort of isolation and quietude with the pace of industrialized modern life with blue light emitting mobile devices we use at all hours of the day, not sleeping based on natural light cycles, imbalances in nutrition, lack of physical fitness, etc etc and it's easy to see why our circadian rhythms are a mess and it can be hard to sleep 8 hours even on a day off.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I know a few wheat farmers on the Eyre Peninsula, South Australia. They do 18-20 hour days when harvesting as their window is short and they have quite a bit of land. There's also the ever present threat that foul weather will ruin their crops at any time. </p>
<p>One of their workers, Jimbo (actually), told me that after the six weeks of harvest last year, he slept two nights and three days, straight. Didn't even get up to piss. </p>
<p>Where I come from, we call that a coma (probably from undiagnosed diabeetus in this particular case).</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Jimbo's quite prone to embellishment, but it's still a cool story nonetheless. </p>
<p>Edit: I know this doesn't in any way answer your question, but I figured I'd throw it in as there were no other responses. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have severe sleep apnea. I can &quot;sleep&quot; for long periods, or rather stay in bed for long periods because I never really get rest. My body fights to breathe and continuously wakes me up when i should be getting REM sleep. I wake up something crazy like 60-80 times an hour. I hate the machine and it doesn't help me. I am getting a surgery done soon to &quot;cure&quot; me of it though. I can't wait to not need more than 8 hours in bed. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As someone with severe insomnia, I envy those who can fall asleep and stay asleep! </p>
<p>A recent conversation with my doctor opened my eyes to another chemical produced by your body as you are awake and moving, and enables falling asleep. Adenosine. From what he told me... As you move through your day, your body produces adenosine, and when you get to a certain level, your body shuts down to purge itself of the adenosine. As the levels get high enough in your body, your body starts to produce melatonin to aid in heading you to dreamland. The length of time you stay asleep is actually determined by how well your system purges the adenosine. Without underlying issues, those who sleep more purge the adenosine more slowly; those who sleep less, purge more quickly. Physical activity (exercise) early in your day can jump start adenosine production and help you to sleep better. </p>
<p>In my case, though I work a physically demanding job, my body doesn't produce enough adenosine to start melatonin production in levels that will put, and keep, me down. I can go 36 hours before sleeping for 4, and be back up and going for another 24+. Regimented medication and scheduling, plus doing more outside of work (exercising, staying active after my shift, etc.), is about the only way I can fall and stay asleep for more than a couple hours at a time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
