		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There <em>is</em> an optimal design... for any given purpose and set of operating conditions.  The problem is that such things as expected air pressure, the speed at which it's moving forward (in the case of a propeller), the amount of driving power available, whether or not the fan is ducted, and various others, will change the optimal design.  Hence, different designs for different purposes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><blockquote>
<p>Why do fan and propeller blades often have different shapes and angles of attack?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On all but the smallest airplanes, the angle of the propellers can be adjusted to match the speed, serving the same function as a transmission in a car.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why does the number of blades vary, shouldn't there be an optimal design?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For a given amount of power, few blades are better, but they have to be longer to get the same effect.  The number of blades will be a tradeoff between space and efficiency.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, I know that on AC condensers/heat pumps, the design of the fan blades can affect system performance. Different blade pitches and counts can have adverse affects on fan motor amperage by increasing or decreasing air resistance, refrigerant liquid (head) pressure by changing air flow across the coil, and compressor amperage by thusly changing the temperature and therefore pressure inside the condenser coil. With infinitely many applications, designs and manufacturers of equipment, it's impossible for there to be a universal fit</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason the angle of attack changes along the blade is because out towards the tip they're traveling faster and would exceed the speed at which they can bite the air if left the same along the whole blade. Conversely inside the angle of attack is steeper to make up for slower speeds. This doesn't really matter on household fans but on propellers it is imperative that the whole blade efficiently bites the air. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll take your question to mean different blades on the same fan. Looking at automotive fans and house fans you'll see that the blades have an uneven stagger. This breaks up acoustic resonances and makes the fan quieter. The same is true for tread blocks on tires. What you lose in efficiency you gain in happy customers. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
