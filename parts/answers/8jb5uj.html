		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot; <em>Cold receptors start to perceive cold sensations when the surface of the skin drops below 95 ° F. They are most stimulated when the surface of the skin is at 77 ° F and are no longer stimulated when the surface of the skin drops below 41 ° &quot;</em> <a href="https://learning-center.homesciencetools.com/article/skin-touch/" target="_blank">Please give the entire website a look. I copied this from the heading entitled &quot;Thermoreceptors&quot;</a> </p>
<p>The website already makes it easy to understand, but the way I can interpret this is that your body's temperature is constantly at an average temperature which is warm most of the time, so it is more sensitive to change in external temperatures. So when putting something cold (such as your hands in this case) against the warm surface of your belly, your body can feel the cold - and because your body tries to regulate its internal heat, the surface of your belly gradually becomes warmer and warms your hands at the same time. </p>
<p>P.S. Please correct me if I am wrong or missed a detail. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Some interesting answers but none mention receptor quantity.</p>
<p>We have some cells that pick up heat and some that pick up cold. These cells have one job and that's temperature. We happen to have more cells that pick up cold than we do warm and hot. </p>
<p>Interestingly, at very hot or very cold temperatures, these cells no longer pick up the heat or cold. Instead, the same cells that pick up pain tell us that something is really hot or cold.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to what our receptors are designed to sense, thermodynamics plays a role. When something warm touches something cold, the warmth wants to be equal in all of the things. The heat travels away from the warmth to the colder area until they are the same. </p>
<p>When you feel cold air, it is actually the air molecules colliding with you and pulling away heat. When you touch a warm part of your body with a cold part, the heat is leaving the warm area towards equilibrium- namely, the average of the two temperatures. Your body will be cooling under it’s normal range while your hand or foot won’t reach its normal range because they are both going towards the average of the two temperatures. </p>
<p>The coolest thing, pun not intended, is that there is no such thing as “cold”. There is only heat and less heat.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
