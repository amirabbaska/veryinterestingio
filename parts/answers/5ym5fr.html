		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schelling_point" target="_blank">Schelling point</a>. An intuitive solution. Flashing twice is an unusual and obviously intentional action that'd be noticed, and would cause other drivers to pay more attention and be more alert by snapping them out of the routine of driving.
