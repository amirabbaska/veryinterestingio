		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the interpretation of laws is not a completely impartial exercise that is undertaken by robots. People can disagree on what complicated words, sometimes written hundreds of years ago, mean, regardless of politics.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>The 14th amendment guarantees equal protection under the law to all people, regardless of race. The University of Texas creates a policy that gives a slight preference in admission to minority students, in order to rectify past disadvantages (e.g. slavery, Jim Crow) that have influenced these students to this day. They claim that this furthers the goal of equal protection. A white student sues because she was not admitted to the university, despite being more qualified on paper than some students who were admitted. She claims that SHE was denied equal protection under the law.</p>
<p>An impartial judge is one who has no allegiance to any party in the case. They didn't work for the University of Texas, and the white student is not their niece. They are called upon to decide whose interpretation of &quot;equal protection&quot; is correct, and as we all know, reasonable people can and do believe in very different ways on this issue.</p>
<p>So Senators, who are in charge of confirming Justices, ask questions to try to figure out which way the nominee feels on an issue like this. They aren't biased or unfair, they just feel a different way about a law that is open to interpretation. Obviously, Senators would like to confirm someone who views these problems the same way they do, so they ask these questions.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are 3 major historical drivers for it:</p>
<p>1) Roe v Wade - it was such a controversial decision in terms of left/right split, so politicians on both sides decided they needed judges that would fight for it (on the left) or fight to repeal it (on the right).  As time has gone on it has become a litmus test for all SCOTUS judges</p>
<p>2)The Robert Bork Nomination - Bork was nominated by Reagan, and was both extremely qualified and extremely Conservative.  He was outspoken about wanting to repeal Roe v Wade, and that galvanized the Democratic controlled Senate.  The Senate Judiciary committee ultimately voted down his nomination, which was the first time in American history a SCOTUS nominee was rejected on purely ideological grounds.  Since then, Republican nominated judges usually evade questions on Roe.  Ultimately Reagan nominated Kennedy for the seat, who was more moderate.</p>
<p>3) The David Souter nomination - Souter was nominated by Bush Sr to be another conservative anchor to the court.  In the end, he turned out to be one of the most liberal judges on the court, and helped maintain the 4-4+kennedy balance that remains to this day.  Since then, Republicans have put a lot more effort into vetting judges for ideological purity, with groups like the Federalist society leading the charge.</p>
<p>You could put Merrick Garland in here too, but the failure of his nomination is really an extension of the door opened by Bork and not a new development in itself.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two views on Supreme Court law, which are the personal views of the Justices themselves.  Think of the two sides as a sliding scale, much like liberal mindset and conservative mindset.</p>
<p>Strict Constitutionalist &lt;--------&gt; Living Document Constitutionalist</p>
<p>The Strict Constitutionalist law side believes that the United States Constitution is a document set in stone and the only interpretation of the document is exactly how it is written by the Founding Fathers.  </p>
<p>The Living Document Constitutionalist believes that the United States Constitution is a document that is meant to be interpreted as the spirit of the document to laws that the Founding Fathers could not foresee.</p>
<p>The conservative and liberal factions of both the Democrats and Republicans fight over the sides of Constitutional law and the interpretation of the document.</p>
<p>TL;DR - Justices are impartial, but interpret Constitutional law differently. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The simplest answer to your question is that cases that reach the Supreme Court are cases which either have conflicting laws or no applicable laws that govern the decisions of the court. Often, Supreme Court Justices are drawing from not only the law, but also their personal experiences to help decide what exactly is the best way to handle this and future cases of this type. While judges generally try to see the case objectively, it is impossible for anyone to truly be unbiased, so every judge's affiliations, political or not, can affect their decision, whether they know it or not.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The impartial part is not that they are robots.  They have their biases and personal view of how a law should be interpreted.  The impartiality is based on the fact that once they are appointed, they are on the bench for life or until they choose to retire.  That means they do not have to campaign every 4 or 6 years like congressmen or presidents.  Essentially, they owe no favors to anyone or any lobbies.  They donâ€™t have to worry about earning political points or pandering to public sentiments to keep their job.  It is that lack of leverage that makes the impartial relative to other public servants.  </p>
<p>Congress grills them on political and legal views to understand how they will rule and interpret the law.  Remember, once appointed, there is no going back, so you really want to vet them first.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
