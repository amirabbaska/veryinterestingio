		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The first question to answer is, what is the point of sleep? </p>
<p>Among some other functions, the primary purpose of sleep is for the brain to enter into a maintenance mode. Think of it as that 2am hard drive defragging that runs when you wouldn't otherwise be on your computer. Instead of space reallocation, however, the brain's process is biochemical and serves to &quot;wash and replenish&quot; the brain's cellular machinery, something that can't happen when the individual is in a waking state. This process is both reactive (meaning it doesn't do any good to do it before there's a mess to clean) and rate limited (which means that it takes X amount of time to achieve Y results). As such, the normal waking/sleeping cycle maintains an equilibrium of building up a mess and cleaning it up. </p>
<p>You can't bank sleep. That would be similar to cleaning an already clean house for the sake of cleaning it and expecting any mess that you make in the future to come out of the extra work you did. It just doesn't work like that. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sleep debt accumulates primarily because the hormone adenosine starts building when you wake up and grows through the day. The more you have, the sleepier you become until you fall asleep. It then goes away as you sleep until there isn't enough to keep you asleep.</p>
<p>The usual battery metaphor is bad because it presumes one starts at 100% &quot;fully charged&quot; when waking and goes down in charge as one is awake. In reality it's more like you wake up with an empty bucket that fills with sleepiness, and the longer you are awake the heavier it becomes. This demonstrates how you can't sleep extra because the bucket can't be any emptier.</p>

<p>For ex. I sleep a good 6 hours and wake up feeling refreshed but if I slep for 10 I'll wake up feeling like someone's been beating me with a bat during it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>If I get like 3 hours of sleep a night for 2 nights in a row, do I then need to sleep 10 or 12 or whatever hours to &quot;catch up&quot;, or will one normal nights sleep make up for it?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Think of sleep like recharging a battery - If you charge your phone to 100% and then keep it charging for another 5 hours, you don't get the benefit of that extra charge. The same applies for the cells in your body. They become reenergized, cleared of waste, and oxygenated far more in your sleep to a point where they can act at their maximal capacity, and then they are ready to expend energy again when you wake up. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
