		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bronze, while not as strong as steel, has comparable strength to aluminum and really good machinability, meaning for hard to make parts where the material is non critical, bronze makes a really great choice as it limits tool wear and machine time, two expensive elements when machining.</p>
<p>Bronze also is naturally lower in friction then steel or aluminum, which allows bronze parts to serve as bearing elements, allowing sliding or rotation with longer service lives than other metals.</p>
<p>Bronze also sticks to pretty much every aluminum and steel alloy, which allows it to be used as a brazing alloy to create joints not as strong as a weld, but certainly stronger than most other attachment methods and across multiple otherwise incompatible metals.</p>
<p>The softness of bronze and brass coupled with their fatigue resistance also lend the alloy to use in rivets where steel is unusable for corrosion properties, or the peening force that can be applied is limited.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's a relatively small thing, but acoustic guitar strings are made from bronze.</p>
<p>Steel and nickel (which is what electric guitar strings are made from) has a thin and wimpy tone that most folks dislike, whereas bronze has a much fuller tone.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
