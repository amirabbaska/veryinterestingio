		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While extensive studies have been done examining the ability for parents and newborns to identify each other VERY quickly after birth, I don't think there's yet been investigation into the similarities of babies to their parents.  But given that dog trainers encourage new parents with dogs to first bring a blanket the baby has been wrapped in home for the dog to acclimate to the new smell, the baby's scent is likely to be different <em>enough</em> from its parents for dogs to treat it as a new smell.  This also makes sense with what we know about the differences in smell that humans undergo as part of puberty: even if babies smelled similar to their parents in some identifiable ways, they wouldn't smell the same because the parents are adults and the baby is not.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>My son smells like a complete mixture of me and my wife. Example, I get a sweaty head in the night which smells weirdly like rice pudding (strange I know). My son, who is now two, also gets a similar sweaty head which smells like a slightly more pleasant (probably the wife's pheromones) version of my scent. I know this isn't scientific, but it is a genuinely weird sensation when you smell your child which, I guess, activates some animal instincts. I hope this is useful, although strange. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'll answer this directly for you since no one else seems to want to. Babies have their own unique smell. They produce tons of pheromones and that is why a lot of times pets will become very protective of the child. For example, my dog, although he wanted nothing to do with my son when it was just us in the house, when we had company he would always try position himself next to my son directly in between him and said guest. Especially people my dog was unfamiliar with. We brought this up with both the doctor and the vet and we were told that the smell of the pheromones was triggering an instinctual reaction to protect my son from harm and potential predators. Now that my son is a little older (almost 2), him and my dog are inseparable. Although he doesn't smell quite as nice. That boy can clear a room with a fart in 5 seconds flat</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Seems like it would be almost impossible for a baby to NOT smell like its parents since they come into so much daily and repeated skin to skin contact with the child. Is it inborn? Prob not but they most likely smell like the parent from repeated close contact. Who has a baby they dont touch 100X per day?</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
