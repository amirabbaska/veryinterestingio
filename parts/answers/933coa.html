		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things spoil because bacteria grow in it. </p>
<p>Cooking things kills the bacteria that's already inside them, but doesn't keep other bacteria from growing on them as soon as they cool down.  Things like cream and fruit, though, also dry out when they cook, and bacteria need water, so they can't grow on the dried-out fruit as easily as they could on fresh fruit.</p>
<p>Also, when you cook things, you usually add something like salt, yeast, or lemon juice that kills bacteria.  That stays in the food and keeps bacteria from growing, too.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you cook it, the preparation -- usually the application of heat -- kills most of the bacteria that are currently on it. That means the bacteria need time to regroup and increase their numbers back to the level where they can make the food spoil, which takes time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>in addition to what /u/Portarossa correctly says, I have to add the fact that many times, with your spoiling-inclined ingredient, you add also other ingredients, which may prolong the shelf life of the final product, like sugar or maybe lemon.
Also, during the cooking period you don't only &quot;<em>sanitize</em>&quot; the product but also dry it, prolonging the shelf life.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's all about &quot;hurdles&quot;. When preserving or extending shelf life, you introduce several methods of preservation to the equation. In food processing, you want to add as many hurdles as possible. You can add antimicrobials, change pH away from the best growing conditions for bacterial and also decrease you water activity (aW).</p>
<p>Heating, adding acidulants (lemon, etc), and adding sugar and coking can decrease water activity.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
