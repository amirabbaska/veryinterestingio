		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are many differences between rechargeable batteries (a group of secondary cells) and non-rechargeable batteries (a group of primary cells) the main differences being the materials used as cathode, anode and electrolyte in the battery as well as the shape, construction and purpose of the battery (pacemakers, emergency lighting, portable power tools all have different energy requirements and associated costs).</p>
<p>A primary cell is a battery that is designed to be used once and discarded, and not recharged with electricity and reused like a secondary cell (rechargeable battery). </p>
<p>In general, the electrochemical reaction occurring in a primary cell is not reversible, rendering the cell unrechargeable. As a primary cell is used, chemical reactions in the battery use up the chemicals that generate the power; when they are gone, the battery stops producing electricity and is useless. </p>
<p>In contrast, in a secondary cell, the reaction can be reversed by running a current into the cell with a battery charger to recharge it, regenerating the chemical reactants.</p>
<p>The processes and materials required to produce secondary cells are more expensive than those of primary cells so rechargeable batteries have a higher initial cost but tend to be more economical in the long run as you can usually recharge the battery up to 1000 times.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The typical 1.5V alkaline cells you buy are called primary cells. These are chemistries not designed to be rechargeable and are typically non-reversible reactions. These are relatively simple constructions and the technology is extremely mature. </p>
<p>Rechargeable cells are called secondary cells. These are designed with reversible chemical reactions that allow for them to be reused. These are typically more complex and more expensive to produce. For example, a lithium-ion cell consists of a &quot;jelly roll&quot; that contains a cathode (various materials) deposited on aluminum foil, a cathode (typically carbon on copper foil), 2 porous polyethylene separators, and electrolyte (lithium salt in organic solvent). Tabs are spot welded on and then it is stuffed in the can which has special safety features to vent gases and disconnect the electrodes in thermal runaway. </p>
<p>Pretty much all common cells are pretty commoditized, so the main difference in cost can be attributed to the difference in cost to manufacture the product.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>Discussion of different rechargeable battery chemistries follows. I am not am expert - just have read a little here and there over the years. </p>
<p>&quot;Standard&quot; 1.5V (AA, AAA, C, D) batteries are some alkaline/lithium chemistry. There are various grades with specific meanings (general purpose, heavy duty, lithium). The chemicals inside don't re-absorb electrical potential energy very well - it's mostly an un-reversible reaction. </p>
<p>Rechargeable batteries have a chemical reaction that can be reversed to store energy. For 1.2V cells (replacement for 1.5v) they are usually some form of Ni-Cd (nickel cadmium), NiMH (nickel metal hydride). For other devices, 3.7v cells are used - Li-Ion (lithium ion) or Li-Po (lithium polymer) </p>
<p>Ni-cd has been around for a long time and has a lot of drawbacks- low power density, low current output, very limited number of charge cycles.  It's also really safe and easy to charge. </p>
<p>NiMH is a large improvement in many ways, and has advanced a lot over the past 20 years. They can deliver a lot of current, hold a relatively large amount of power, and can be used thousands of times. They take a little more careful control on charging for optimal performance. </p>
<p>Lithium Ion batteries are 3.7v. These are found in most (larger) devices with integrated batteries, like phones  and laptops. These hold a LOT of power for their SIZE, can deliver a lot of current, and have hundreds of cycles worth of life. </p>
<p>Then there are lithium polymer (li-po) batteries that are generally used in extremely high power and small devices like remote control cars/planes/etc, as well as modern phones. These are generally lighter than lithium ion, but less power per unit of volume. They generally get used much harder than lithium ions, and have a shorter life as a result.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
