<p>Did you miss the part where you can make a beam with a temperature equal to the <em>surface of the sun</em>?  That's pretty damn hot.</p>
<p>None of your alternative lensing or reflecting options make much difference though. If I understand correctly, the limitations are due to the nature of light and refraction/reflection, so the phenomenon causing the refraction/reflection is irrelevant.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends on how narrowly you describe a &quot;beam&quot; but that is what is done by focusing mirrors at certain types of solar plants. The molton salt type like the one on the california/nevada state line focus the sun into pretty powerful heat beams. </p>
<p>Many birds are killed when they pass through the beams. Apparently the staff refers to them as &quot;streamers&quot; when they catch fire mid flight.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As pointed out by /u/ShoelessHodor, highly concentrated sunlight of great intensity can be achieved in applications such <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentrated_solar_power" target="_blank">concentrated solar thermal</a> power generation.  In such processes, coherance isn't important as long as you can deliver energy to a focal point at a high enough density to heat whatever working fluid is being used to transform heat into electricity.</p>
<p>On the flip side, there are collimating techniques you can use to produce beams of low divergence and low dispersion.  But this is mostly accomplished by blocking a great amount of the original source such that you end up with a much weaker beam instead of a more concentrated one.  For some applications such as college physics demonstrations like low precision interferometry, it exactly fits the bill, so no judgement there.</p>
<p>Because sunlight is composed of a spectrum, what you really want is basically impossible.  Magnetic fields do not affect photons in the way you think.  From a purely theoretical perspective, yes, if your engineering is advanced enough to manipulate gravity, you can use a processes similar to gravitational lensing to bend light at the scale you imagine.  But I can think of more exciting things to do with such power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For the original question: No. The XKCD idea that the sun is not a point source is the main problem. (it is about half a degree across.) So you're going to get about 1 % &quot;sunspread&quot; (the beam becomes 1 meter wider for every 100 meters it travels) and there's pretty much nothing you can do about it. </p>
<p>source: used to work in concentrating solar thermal. It felt like every time I turned around, I'd find some new way we lost efficiency. &quot;Sunspread&quot; was one I didn't see coming. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<li>Classically, external electric or magnetic fields do not act on light. A simple explanation is that electric and magnetic fields only act on charged particles, and photons have zero charge. There are much more complicated explanations of this when treating light as a wave (ones which I am not at all confident on myself), but they come out to the same thing. </li>
</ol>
<p>In quantum electrodynamics, there is some effect at high energy levels, delbruck scattering, which is related to the possibility that a photon will disintegrate into a electron-positron pair. I can't really explain it to you beyond that, but I suspect it wouldn't be able to do what you want. </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Gravitational lensing has many of the same properties as traditional optical lensing, and therefore should run into the same problems as the xkcd post you saw. </p>
</li>
<li>I don't believe this will work the way you want it to, but I don't know enough about the subject to be sure. </li>
</ol>
<p>At a certain point, you may just be better off collecting solar power and using it to power a laser, if your goal is minimal spread/diffraction. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
