		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Well, long story short: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if upright, passively by releasing the masseter muscle (excentric contraction)</p>
</li>
<li>for wider opening or a different position, there are muscles in the front of your neck that will open the mouth </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that muscles can only pull, but sometimes gravity + contraction can still work as if the agonist muscle is 'pushing' </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digastric_muscle" target="_blank">digastric muscle</a> is the major jaw opening muscle. It inserts on the bottom of the mandible in the front of the the jaw, and originates from an attachment on the skull behind the ear. It has a tendinous connection to the hyoid in between, allowing this muscle to control to the position of the hyoid (important for tongue movements, swallowing, speaking) when exercising finer scale contractions.</p>
<p>In humans, the digastric originates on the cranium from an attachment on the broad <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastoid_part_of_the_temporal_bone" target="_blank">mastoid process</a>. In other mammals this same attachment occurs on a much more well defined structure, the paroccipital process, which can be seen peaking out behind the jaw in this <a href="http://www.skullsite.co.uk/pig/vietpig_lat.jpg" target="_blank">pig skull</a>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You have a large number of muscles that attach to various points on the jaw and to the collarbone, sternum, and/or hyoid bone (fun fact, the hyoid is the only bone that doesn't articulate with another bone.)</p>
<p>I had the good fortune of having a cadaver to see all of the muscles of the speech mechanism back in college.  The area is really nice bit of engineering.  For reference you can look <a href="http://linguistics.ucla.edu/people/ladefoge/manual%20files/appendixb.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> under section B: Muscles that lower the mandible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
