<p>The parenchyma of the umbilical cord is made up of something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wharton%27s_jelly" target="_blank">Wharton's jelly</a>, it's basically a very thick, mucous-ey substance that provides structural support to the important stuff inside (umbilical arteries and vein). There are no nerves in Wharton's jelly, so no one feels the umbilical cord being cut.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Neither. There are no nerve endings, thus no connection to either person's nervous system, and no pain for mother or child, or even any kind of sensation. If you ever cut an umbilical cord it is the strangest feeling; it feels 'living' so your natural response is to stop, yet no-one can feel you cut it. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Is severing the umbilical cord still a natural instinct for humans? </p>
<p>How was it likely done in early homo erectus history?</p>
<p>Also, another weird question: how does the placenta detach from the body. There is a major blood connection there, right? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>there are no pain receptors on the cord so it would not hurt when it is cut. also there are almost no pain receptors in the brain, so there have been cases of people surviving knife and nail gun hits to the brain when they do not damage the brain extensively.</p>
