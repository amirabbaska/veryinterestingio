		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I'm by no means an expert, but my understanding as a mechanical engineer is that the shape and size of rain droplets depend on 3 sets of parameters:</p>
<p>1, the acceleration due to gravity (9.81 m/s^2 on earth)</p>
<p>2, the fluid dynamic properties of the atmosphere (namely density and viscosity of the air)</p>
<p>3, the fluid dynamic properties of the rain water (again density, viscosity, and other effects such as surface tension)</p>
<p>The size and shape of rain drops represents an equilibrium in the interaction between all of these parameters, so changing any of them will alter the result.</p>
<p>Now someone with more fluids experience than me can explain what would happen to the drops if they have less acceleration.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Disregarding all of the minor/major changes that lowering gravity would do to atmospheric formation of clouds, etc., and we accepted for the sake of the question that identical precipitation clouds are forming on this planet in relation to what we experience here on Earth:</p>
<p>I would think that with lower gravity the droplets formed would need to reach a higher &quot;critical mass&quot; before they could break from suspension in the atmosphere and fall as conventional rain. Obviously this mass point would change based on density of the atmosphere, ambient temperature at that altitude and more, but again, I'm saying that in identical circumstances as Earth save for lower gravity, I would theorize that yes, rain droplets would need to be larger due to a lessened force acting against their atmospheric suspension.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Raindrop size is a balance between surface tension of the drop, aerodynamic forces from its terminal fall speed and force from collisions with other drops. </p>
<p>In general, reduced gravity would result in a lower terminal velocity and increase the size drops could grow to before being torn apart by aerodynamic forces (assuming pressures and temperatures like that of earth).</p>
<p>There would likely be some feedback from collision dynamics as well as from reduced efficiency of surface tension of larger mass drops that would lead to a nonlinear change in the size dustribution. Lamb and Verlinde provide a detailed explanation of the microphysics involved </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This 2012 Nature paper,  <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature10890" target="_blank">Air density 2.7 billion years ago limited to less than twice modern levels by fossil raindrop imprints</a> (paywalled, I can provide a pdf if anyone wants), says that raindrop size is unrelated to atmospheric density (although raindrop velocity is related to it).</p>
<p>I'm not sure if that also applies to pressure, though I would imagine it does, in which case raindrop size will only depend on the species you're raining out. In that case, all water raindrops would be the same size (surface tension being the key factor).</p>
<p>Sidenote, other people have mentioned it, but in general atmospheric pressure and planet size are fairly independent, so lower gravity isn't all that important a parameter. Venus is about the same size as Earth but has 100x as much atmosphere. Mars is about half the size of the Earth but has less than 1% its atmospheric pressure. Titan is a bit smaller than mars but has a higher pressure (and significantly higher mass) atmosphere than Earth. Atmospheres are a tiny component of the total mass of a planet, so it's pretty easy to have way more atmosphere without asking much of your planet, allowing them to vary wildly.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I feel like this is a hard question to answer without knowing atmospheric composition... Presumably, if Earth had lower gravity, its likely that larger drops would form because the terminal velocity of the drop would be lower.</p>
<p>A big part of the drop size is determined by the relationship between velocity, air density, and surface tension. </p>
