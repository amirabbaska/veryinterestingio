		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Poorer societies typically have higher birth rates- it's a combination of insurance against death, wanting to have children in lieu of a pension plans policy, lack of education about/ availability of birth control and cultural attitudes to children. I can't speak for many of the ethiopian tribes as I haven't spent much time there, but some of them have an extremely patriarchal system, with men focused on having as many children as possible.</p>
<p>Ethiopia has had a prolonged period of economic growth this has led to increased life expectancy, mostly from availability of food and medicine as well as the end of armed conflict. People are living longer, and while the birth rate has fallen substantially, it's still double the USA. You can expect further massive gains in the eithopian population for a number of years to come, slowing as the country develops economically. It's a fairly typical pattern in developing countries.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ethiopia is coming out of decades of war, both civil and external.  The droughts it suffered in the 1990s are mostly gone.  It's economy is getting back on its feet.  A lot of neighboring countries aren't doing as well and Ethiopia is seeing immigration from them.    </p>
<p>Basically, the country went through hell for decades and is starting to come out the other side. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Poor countries have higher birth rates, and higher deathrates.  </p>
<p>To transition out from being third world and in poverty, you need to stop the child mortality.  Once you do that, the population doubles in size in a generation (since all those babies live).  Then in the next generation it does it again (so that there's not three times as many people as there were originally).  Then the population stabilises at 3 times the 'third world' version of the country.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is a concept called demographic transitions. Poor countries generally have very high infant mortality - so family have lots of children in order to guarantee that some of them will survive to adulthood.</p>
<p>As a society gets richer, infant mortality rates fall dramatically, but people's cultural practices don't change immediately, causing a boom in the number of children that survive to adulthood. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, after some time, the fertility rate begins to drop again as the costs of raising a child increase (due to greater need for educating children), causing the population to level off. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Birthrates have not decreased substantially in Ethiopia or many African nations. If a country is consistently growing at 2.6% a year, it will continually add increasing numbers of people. Growing 3% at 50,000,000 is an annual addition of 1.5 million people. At 100,000,000, it's 3,000,000.</p>
<p>This is called demographic momentum. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
