		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Let's imagine the worst-case scenario: a warhead containing plutonium misfires at a relatively low level, creating a cloud that contains a few kilograms of plutonium aerosolized inside of it. Is that a health hazard? It will contaminate the area beneath it, sure. We've seen this kind of thing before — the Palomares accident, for example (H-bomb jettisoned, high explosives fired irregularly), and the Bluegill Prime accident (a Thor missile explodes on the launchpad, dispersing plutonium). The result is a place that you have to spend a lot of money and time to clean up safely — remove layers of topsoil over a relatively large area. </p>
<p>Is that a good thing? No. Is it as bad a nuclear weapon going off? No. It is basically a &quot;dirty bomb&quot; scenario — a contamination threat that, if people were exposed to it, would have some adverse health consequences, but there are worse things to be accidentally exposed to that plutonium (e.g. nerve gas). </p>
<p>So it's not ideal, no. But it's not the real threat of a nuclear armed missile. Dirty bomb casualties might number in the hundreds of long-term fatal cancers if detonated in a major city. Not great. But a 150kt nuclear warhead going off in the same area would have short-term fatalities in the hundreds of <em>thousands</em>. </p>
<p>What would happen if said warhead broke apart higher up? You are still going to eventually get plutonium on the ground, but it's going to be dispersed over a wider area. On the one hand, that's bad — wider area of cleanup/exposure. On the other hand, that's good — less plutonium per square meter means less intense contamination. Actually modeling this stuff is a little tricky without the right tools but my guess is that there is probably a &quot;least good&quot; height that would result in a large area moderately contaminated, but above that and you end up with low-enough contamination that it's not a big deal, and below that the contamination is intense but localized. But that's just a rough guess based on how these kinds of plumes tend to work out. </p>
<p>As for &quot;how is this avoided&quot; — the main way to keep this from happening is to use insensitive high explosives. These are hard to set off without specific intention (i.e., they require a specialized blasting cap or something like that), so that even if they were hit with great force, or even set on fire, they shouldn't explode. The US started using insensitive high explosives in the late 1970s. I don't know if warheads like W87 use it or not, and I have no idea whether North Korea uses it (I doubt it). The main difficulty in using IHE is that they tend not to be as powerful as &quot;normal&quot; HE and so if you are really worried about a good yield-to-weight in a small volume, you can't really afford to use it (which is why I am not sure if W87 uses it — it is a very compact little thing, and is tricked out for compactness and efficiency; there is a JASON report that talks about the safety of various current warheads and I think it indicates that some use IHE and some don't, but I don't have it at my fingertips; update: it seems the main US missiles that still uses non-IHE are the submarine warheads, W76 and W88 — that makes sense giving that they are even more tricked-out than the ICBM warheads; W87 does use IHE). Since DPRK is likely worried about such things more than it is worried about safety, I would suspect they aren't using them. But I don't know. </p>
<p>Again, I don't think this is really the thing to worry about when thinking about DPRK missiles. It does come up with their supposed threat of testing a &quot;mated&quot; warhead/missile, because the chance of the missile having a mishap is not minimal (how's that for an alliterative reply?). <a href="https://www.popsci.com/h-bomb-test-pacific-North-Korea" target="_blank">But that is just one of several possible problems with such a test.</a> Frankly, it strikes me that the plutonium contamination threat is actually <em>most acute</em> for the North Koreans themselves — they could suffer a Bluegill Prime accident that would contaminate their launchpad and own personnel. So hopefully they won't try it, not so much because they care about other people, but because presumably they care about their own facilities...</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To answer this question, I actually turned to some worst-case scenario analysis of possible failures during launch with radioisotope thermal generators used in spacecraft. In the scenario you described, the forces would almost immediately destroy the core and cause it to disperse its radioactive material in a plume. You’re looking at a worst possible case of three or four extra cases of cancer over 50 years in a 400,000-person population, IF the radioactive material landed in a fishing area. Or, maybe 50-100 extra cases of cancer over 50 years if the whole world population were exposed equally. </p>
<p><a href="https://fas.org/nuke/space/pu-ulysses.pdf" target="_blank">source</a> </p>
<p>So in short, this wouldn’t be very dangerous. Now, nuclear weapons use Pu-239 instead of the Pu-238 used in RTGs. A study of nuclear workers at weapons factories in the Soviet Union found ~30 cases of cancer over 20 years in over 20,000 workers who were exposed to more than 1000 rem, but these were people who were exposed to much higher doses than you would be in the scenario you described, regularly over the course of a career as opposed to a one-time event. Weapons grade plutonium would be worse, but probably not substantially. Note for the sake of this question I’m assuming a plutonium-only bomb and I’m not taking the possible effects of a disintegrating tritium spark-plug into account. </p>
<p><a href="https://hazmap.nlm.nih.gov/category-details?id=786&amp;table=copytblagents" target="_blank">source</a> </p>
<p>To quantify it, Chernobyl caused a higher cancer risk in the population of Eastern Europe than a single warhead disintegrating in the atmosphere could ever cause. </p>
<p>To answer the remaining parts of your question, there’s no real safety mechanism if the heat shield fails and exposes the core to the atmosphere. RTGs have heavy cases that bombs do not, but their designers are more concerned with protecting the people they land near than bomb designers are. The heat shield IS the safety. The bomb itself is triggered by precision explosives placed around the outside of the core; if the core were exposed to the atmosphere at those speeds and temperatures, it would deform so quickly that the bomb itself could not go off. It would disintegrate. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Bear in mind that even in a successful detonation, only about a quarter of the fissile material is used. Since there have been over 500 atmospheric nuclear tests, this would not be a new issue.</p>
<p>The environmental impact of these tests was non-negligible, which is one of the reasons why they were banned, however it was certainly not catastrophic, and unused fissile material would have been quite a long way down the list of health concerns (in comparison to, for example, Caesium-137 and Strontium-90).</p>
<p>There have also been a few accidents, such as the one at Palomares in 1966 which caused the non-nuclear explosives in two Mk28 thermonuclear bombs to detonate. This resulted in some contamination, which had to be cleaned up, but in terms of harm done this is negligible compared to a full-yield explosion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To put this in perspective, similar events have occurred in the past, and was probably worse. Kosmos 954 was a Soviet reconnaissance satellite that was powered by an onboard nuclear reactor. It carried 50kg of U235, and it operated for about 3 months before it failed and re-entered the atmosphere, over Northern Canada.</p>
<p>In many respects, this is a far worse situation than what you're describing, as the reactor had been operating and was thus contained significant quantities of fission products, and overall contained more material than your typical warhead. </p>
<p>After the reentry, Canada and the US launched a mission to recover what they could, and after spending $6 million or so on the effort, recovered 12 large fragments, 10 of which were radioactive, and realistically only comprised 1% of the fuel. The rest just dissipated over the land.</p>
<p>So, in a certain/joking way, if it happens at high altitude, you really come down to &quot;The solution to pollution is dilution&quot;</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
