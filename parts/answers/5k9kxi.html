		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In addition to other reasons, it's not easy to donate eggs, it is a long and painful process with many doctor appointments. Psychological tests, blood work, ultrasounds, multiple medications, self-injections over a period of days, and egg &quot;retrieval&quot; which  requires IV sedation and a real big needle. The donor and recipient have to carefully align their cycles and the donor has to make sure they take the medications correctly and on time and give themselves shots without fail at the same time everyday within 15 minutes of the set time. Often times the hormones will affect a woman's mood. You can't just take an egg like you can take sperm, you have to chemically alter how your body works for months. A lot of work, time, and dedication goes into it. The recipients want their money's worth and don't want to waste their time with a mentally/physically unprepared donor who quits half way through. Some of the restrictions are a bit too much I think, but I guess if you're gonna spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on an egg with no guarantee it work, you'd want the &quot;best&quot; you can get. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Additionally to the other answers about quality, the cost of the procedure is also a huge factor.</p>
<p>Egg donors get paid large amounts (Â£8000 isn't uncommon), and the process is very expensive for company who are paying for it- unlike sperm, it isn't a single trip to a clinic, it's weeks of hormone injections and then an invasive procedure done under a general anaesthetic to surgically remove the matured eggs.<br />
Therefore, it is much cheaper and better for everyone involved to screen out anyone who has any potential to have low quality eggs as early into the process as possible by having very high standards.</p>
<p>EDIT: corrected 'local' to 'general' anaesthetic.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because the people who receive them want healthy eggs to produce healthy children, especially since they're paying for them. Messing up the eggs with drugs, excessive alcohol, and other unhealthy habits isn't fair to anyone involved.</p>
<p>Egg donors may be held to higher standards than sperm donors because sperm are constantly created and replenished, while a woman is born with all the egg cells she will ever have. Once those eggs are messed up, that's it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
