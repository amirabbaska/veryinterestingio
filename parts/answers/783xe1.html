		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Sugar is a molecule made of a particular arrangement of carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms.  When you heat up the sugar, this adds energy to the system that can be used to fuel chemical reactions that rearrange the bonds between these atoms.  Some of these compounds are dark brown in color and add caramel flavors to the sugar.  Similar reactions occur in meat when you cook it and get a tasty brown crust.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It turns brown because of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caramelization" target="_blank">caramelization</a>.</p>
<p>Now, caramelization in itself is a poorly understood process, but we know a few things about it. It is, simply put, the degradation of sugars under heat. Now, these sugars break up into simpler sugars, dehydrate, fragment into aldehydes and ketones, polymerise and undergo several other reactions. Don't concern yourself with the details of the reactions unless you want to - just understand that there are many reactions simultaneously occuring at that temperature.</p>
<p>For the compounds we are interested in, we can broadly separate them into two categories - volatile compounds and polymers. (It's a lot more complex than this but these are the two important classes).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Volatile compounds like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diacetyl" target="_blank">diacetyl</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydroxymethylfurfural" target="_blank">Hydroxymethylfurfural</a> etc. are released which gives caramel its characteristic smell/flavour.</p>
</li>
<li>The polymers (30+ carbon atoms/molecule) formed are grouped into three classes: Caramelans, Caramelens and Caramelins. They contribute to the brown colour of caramel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Clearing out some misconceptions</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Caramelization is not the same as the Maillard reaction (browning of bread, meat etc). <em>The Maillard reaction requires amino acids to react with sugars, whereas caramelization does not</em> (it is simply the degradation of sugars with heat). They both involve browning and can occur simultaneously, on the same food base, and with similar results on the taste buds, so they are quite easily confused.</p>
</li>
<li>It is not brown because of carbon. That sort of burning requires a much higher temperature than the caramelization reaction. If you try to caramelize on too high a flame, you will see it turning black and tasting charred. That is carbon (see pyrolysis/carbonization for such reactions).</li>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of whack answers in here and misinformation. First off, it has nothing to do with the Maillard reaction so ignore all those.</p>
<p>ELI5:</p>
<p>Think of sugar like a pyramid of Lego bricks, you start heating them up in a frying pan and start by breaking them into single bricks, this is your melted sugar. As you keep heating, your going to start melting some of your bricks that are touching the frying pan. Clearly these melted Lego bricks aren't going fit back together, maybe you can get a few together but you can't stack them like you could before and some of them might start melting together, these are your browning products and flavors in your sugar (caramelisation). If you keep heating your eventually going to burn your Lego, turning it black (pyrolysis).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
