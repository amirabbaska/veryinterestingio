		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The Roman architect Vitruvius tells us that in order to lay the foundations and supporting pillars the Romans would construct water tight vessels, rather like barrels. These were made of wood bound by metal. In order to provide water resistance the barrels could be lined with pitch or clay. By lowering these into the river it was then possible to divert the water from the place of work in order to dig down to build foundations. The foundations could be lain directly onto hard rock if it was found or onto wooden piles driven deep into the river bed. This last solution is relatively durable as is demonstrated by the result achieved with Venice. The wet mud and the lack of oxygen prevents the action of the bacteria which would in other cases destroy the wood.</p>
<p>Once the foundations had been laid the bottom portion of the pillar could be built within the &quot;barrel&quot; and from there brought up to the required height above the water level by means of scaffolding. As already described, the arches would be built by creating a truss to support the work until the arch had been spanned.</p>
<p>The Romans were also VERY good at pouring concrete underwater. In fact, as far as resiliency against wear and resistance to crushing, their concrete was hands down better than modern concrete. One doesn't often think about concrete being able to cure underwater, but it works perfectly fine, albeit it takes a lot longer.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They built them in air, not underwater. First they blocked off the water around where they were going to dig and build using what are called Cofferdams or Caissons made of pile driven wood or stone and pumped out by bucket, dug the foundation and built to the water line and then removed the temporary structure. Pressurized versions are relatively new but can go deeper but the original idea is almost 2 millennia old and would have been used for major bridges during that time. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Do realize that in some cases depending on the body of water like a river, they may divert the river further up river so that they were actually dealing with a dry bed while the water went by in a bypass.  This is a technique that we continue to use today when working on water in certain areas if practical.</p>
<p>Other building techniques they probably used was to create wooden frames, drop them down into the water (using ladders to get down inside) and then as they build they can float up the frame to rise with things and thus when you are finally at surface level you now have a solid base without having to actually get into the water.  This is a technique they used with pressurized frames with even some of the bridges and such they've built over the the last few centuries as well.</p>
<p>Not easy to find much on this but just thinking thru what they had materials wise to build such things based on the time and technology involved. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Another way that this was done was via boats! In the Persian Empire, Xerxes used a series of boats to bridge the Hellespont to get to Greece. After anchoring them and stringing them all together he built a bridge OVER them and marched the largest army the world had seen at that time over it! The bridge also held for multiple years while his campaign in Greece lasted, and he crossed back over it without a hitch in his retreat! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There's a book by Ken Follet called World Without End which incorporates a lot of medieval building and most particularly the building of a stone bridge. It gives intricate and detailed information about this exact thing. It's also a great story. The first book is about Cathedral building and is called Pillars of Earth. They made a show of it which is also on Netflix.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
