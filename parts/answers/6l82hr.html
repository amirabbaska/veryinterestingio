		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Partly it is because things like murder are just that much more rare in the UK compared to the US.</p>
<p>The countrywide murder rate in the US is 5 times higher than in the UK. ( 4.8 per 100,000 people in the US and only 0.9 in the UK)</p>
<p>London itself has a homicide rate of about 1 per 100,000 which is pretty low for a big city. Cities in the US with high crime rates can have a rate as high as 44.6 (Detroit), 45.2 (New Orleans), 51.1 (Baltimore) and 60 (St. Louis). Even relatively peaceful large cities in the US still have a far higher murder rate than London.</p>
<p>So generally weapons to exert lethal force with are far less needed when the average person you meet on the street is much less likely to be a killer.</p>
<p>The fact that guns are much less common in the UK even among career criminals, means that as a cop walking or driving the beat the fear of getting shot at is far more diminished.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_police_officers_killed_in_the_line_of_duty" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> has a list of British cops who died while on duty and actively trying to prevent a crime or pursue a criminal (excluding those who suffered regular workplace accidents and also during war or in paramilitary situations). It is a surprisingly short list and being shot appears about as often as collapsing dead while trying to run down a suspect on foot. Stabbings are a more serious risk and reportedly stab-prood west are more sought after than bullet proof vests.</p>
<p>It probably helps that the geography of England makes calling for backup to get professional help an easier thing than in a large and thinly settled country like the US. If shooting needs to be done they can call in those who are actually trained to handle guns rather than do it themselves.</p>
<p>All those however could be argue are just symptoms. The root cause is perhaps found in the cultural difference. You can broadly separate societies along a spectrum of cultures of honour vs cultures of law. In cultures of law the authorities have a much more firm grip on the monopoly of violence while the societies that focus more  on honour over law will have people seeking redress in case of being wronged personally.</p>
<p>Cultures of Honour tend to be more violent as a result. This goes on large scales like Europe vs the Americas and inside countries like North vs south in the US, but also in subcultures inside of societies like the inner cities with their gang violence in the US or insufficiently integrated immigrants almost everywhere.</p>
<p>If you don't trust the police to protect and help you and deal with you fairly, you will seek out you other means of keeping yourself safe.</p>
<p>In the US people will regularly own guns for the sake of protection while such a thing is mostly illegal in the UK. Gangs don't shoot at each other much in Britain and despite reports of no-go zones there generally are no place where the police won't go at all.</p>
<p>The people trust the police more in England and thus the police can trust the people more to not be out to violently murder them. Even criminals usually don't see the need to escalate things to levels of violence that would require guns to solve.</p>
<p>With the average person on the street far less likely to be armed with a gun and in a mood to kill a cop. Cops in Britain are far less concerned with being armed with guns themselves.</p>
<p>It is a crazy situation from an American perspective but it works.</p>
<p>Also to the guy who wondered if a five year old would know what Scotland yard is:</p>
<p>When I was a kid many, many years ago I knew Scotland Yard as sort of the place where all the inspectors were from in all those crime and mystery stories set in Britain.</p>
<p>&quot;Inspector X of the Yard&quot; used to be a very common trope in all sorts of murder mystery stories, so the whole idea of Scotland Yard being where all inspectors are from was something embedded in public consciousness. Most people especially kids probably had misconceptions about what agency and jurisdiction are associated with the building, but it was and to a degree is still very famous.</p>
<p>I even remember a board game named after Scotland Yard that involved hunting a criminal throughout London in cooperative play across a map of public transportation of they city.</p>
<p>I guess the whole thing may have become too much of a cliche and not bee as familiar for modern youths, but it should still be well enough known today especially as the 5 year old of this subreddit is not supposed to be literal one.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scotland Yard is the HQ of the Metropolitan police, the force responsible for policing most of London.</p>
<p>The metropolitan police do have guns. Not every officer, but they do have armed units which can be called out when necessary, or when needed to patrol high risk areas.</p>
<p>The average officer doing routine patrols is unlikely to need a gun. Guns are heavily restricted in Great Britain, so it's unlikely they will be facing a criminal with one. And if they do, they can call for backup and get armed units sent in.</p>
<p>Of course you might say that criminals don't follow the law, therefore might have a gun despite them being illegal.</p>
<p>That's true to some extent, but it's generally hard to get hold of a gun and simply having one is a serious crime. So usually only the most hardened career criminals will have one. And the police are unlikely to run into a situation with them on a routine patrol. If they're doing a planned raid they will bring guns if they think they might need them.</p>
<p>Also the more petty criminals might not feel the need to have a gun anyway, since they're not expecting police or random civilians to start shooting at them.</p>
<p>By the way, I've been saying &quot;guns are illegal&quot;, but that's not strictly true. Handguns are illegal, but some other types of guns such as rifles and shotguns are allowed in some cases, but heavily licenced.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I work in an company that advises / sells software to U.K. police forces, a large number of the other staff (not myself) are ex police of some kind.
A few weeks ago I had a very similar discussion with one of our guys who had been a firearms trained officer (which in it's self is quite a big deal) before leaving the force and joining us, but when policing the street always preferred to be unarmed, especially in situations involving volatile drunk crowds.</p>
<p>The example he gave was to imagine you are 2 on 1 or 2 on 2 with a couple of drunk blokes who need a stay in the drunk tank. You are going to end up on the floor with these guys to cuff and arrest them, but if you are armed you simply cant. The risk of you firearm being taken off you is too high, so you have to draw your gun instead to try and get them to comply... but they are drunk so they don't. How do you escalate now?
When the run either at you or away from you, does that justify lethal force? No.</p>
<p>Where as with a baton or even spray, it's non lethal and you can still muck in and risk approaching without the risk of arming the target with your own gun.
It's what he described as 'real' policing. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Scotland Yard do have guns - specialist armed response units made up of offices with advanced tactical and firearms training. They also have a UK version of SWAT called SFO, Specialist Firearms Officers.</p>
<p>Armed officers in the UK are very, very skilled and have often undergone extremely high level training with special forced units like the SAS. In counter terrorism roles they'll have contact with the security services too.</p>
<p>If you're in the middle of an armed heist and you face armed cops in the UK it's not going to be beat cops with pistols. It'll be more like taking on a special forces team. Usually that doesn't last very long.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because gun ownership is extremely high in the US -- 112.6 guns per 100 people -- and very low in the UK -- 6.6 guns per 100 people. [<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimated_number_of_guns_per_capita_by_country" target="_blank">source</a>]</p>
<p>Also, because of much more strict gun control regulation in the UK compared to the US, it's likely a greater proportion of those guns that <em>are</em> owned by UK citizens are less-easily-concealed hunting rifles, not handguns. </p>
<p>In short, cops don't need to be able to shoot people when people aren't able to shoot cops. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
