<p>As we all know you truly do not know what you want to do with your life when your 11. Regardless my 11 year old nephew wants to be a astrophysicist, which I am ecstatic for. He’s smart, a hard worker and creative. What advise would you give your 11 year old self to prepare you for the work you do? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>Also, what’s the process like for being a scientific advisor on a film? Do you offer a strictly scientific option on and let them run with it, or do you try to thread a needle between fantasy and reality? What is your goal when doing this advising in terms of what you want people to take away from a film?</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
