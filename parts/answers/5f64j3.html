		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It happens when the flash hits the eye while the pupil is still open - because the flash is too much faster than the pupils closing - hitting the back of the eye, reflecting the red color of the blood.
This effect is more easily demonstrated when people take flash photos in the dark, where the pupil is wide open.
Melanin plays a role, meaning that having more melanin will decrease the effect.
Also, animals and humans can show this effect. Take a look at this heterochromia animal and see the influence of melanin <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/63/Shiro_200504-2.jpg/220px-Shiro_200504-2.jpg" target="_blank">here</a>.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's because of the flash, not the photography itself.</p>
<p>Basically the very bright light illuminates the back of your eyeball, which is then picked up by the camera. In a dim room your pupils will be open wider, so the effect is more visible.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Eyes behave similarly to retroreflectors. That is-the type of reflectors you see on signs, marker lights on cars, and on most bicycles. What they do is reflect light back to their source.</p>
<p>Eyes do the same thing, but since there's only one small hole with which to reflect light from the interior of the eye, the eye has to be looking at the light source-or at least fairly close to it.</p>
<p>If you've ever wondered why some camera flashes have a pre-flash before the picture is taken, this is why. That is the camera's (or the flash's if it's a standalone flash) red eye reduction mode. It's not good to use for all situations because there's a noticeable delay between when you press the shutter button and when the photo is taken (so not good for action), but it works pretty well for photographing people.</p>
<p>What it does is fires a pre-flash, or a series of pre-flashes so that the subject's irises will close down their pupils so as to minimized the amount of camera flash that gets directed into the eyeball. Notice I said minimized, because obviously you can't completely close someone's pupil. So there's a possibility you'll still get a little red eye, but it does minimize it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You are seeing the Red Reflex in the eye. </p>
<p>Optometrists and Ophthalmologists use these reflections to prescribe lenses (Retinoscopy) and can use the color of the reflection to detect potential diseases (for example a white reflection could be a Retinoblastoma within the retina).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
