		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is really district specific. I've worked in districts where we were reimbursed for everything, in districts where we were given a budget of XX amount for which we could be reimbursed, and in districts where we got reimbursed for nothing.</p>
<p>A lot of it comes down to how much money the district has. Some are quite rich, some are critically poor.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It would cost money to reimburse the teacher. The teacher is usually purchasing the supplies because the school hasn't budgeted for providing those supplies, so obviously it won't be budgeting for reimbursement either. At schools with more funding, the school could simply purchase directly what teachers request.</p>
<p>Edit: if you work in the private sector, your employer assumes that you need your supplies to make more money for the business. It will be happy to reimburse you so long as your spending isn't wasteful. This logic doesn't apply in government or the nonprofit sector, because spending usually doesn't pay for itself, even if it accomplishes something useful or important.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Short version, schools don't make money. </p>
<p>When you work for a company, you're selling a product.  Maybe its consulting, or IT support, or something in aerospace... whatever it is, you've got a product, and selling that product earns money for your company.  If you kept showing up to client meetings and had to ask to borrow a pen, that wouldn't really look good, and might result in less product sold.  Likewise, if you have to spend an hour every day scrounging up printer paper, that's an hour wasted that could have been spent earning profits.  Standard office supplies help to sell the product, so they are payed for by the company. </p>
<p>Schools don't have a product to sell.  They subsist mostly on tax money, donations and bake sales.  If those sources of income can't supply enough pencils for everyone... well... </p>
<p>And if a teacher covers those expenses out of pocket, they do so knowing that the school couldn't afford the items in the first place, so the school obviously can't afford to reimburse.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
