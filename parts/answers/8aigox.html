		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is no limit to the prime numbers. There are infinitely many of them.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things that we know about prime numbers: Firstly, any number bigger than one is divisible by some prime number. Secondly, if N is a number divisible by the prime number p, then the next number divisible by p is N+p. Particularly, N+1 will never be divisible by p. For example, 21 is divisibly by 7, and the next number is 21+7=28.</p>
<p>Let's use this to try to see what would happen if there were only finitely many of them. If there were only n primes, then we would be able to list them p<em><em>1</em></em>, p<em><em>2</em></em>, p<em><em>3</em></em>,...,p<em><em>n</em></em>. We could then multiply them all together to get the number</p>
<ul>
<li>N = p<em><em>1</em></em>p<em><em>2</em></em>p<em><em>3</em></em>...p<em><em>n</em></em> </li>
</ul>
<p>Note that N is divisible by <em>every</em> prime, there are no extras. This means, by our second property, that N+1 can be divisible by <em>no</em> prime. But our first property of primes says that N+1 <em>is</em> divisible by some prime. These two things contradict each other and the only way to resolve it is if there are actually infinitely many primes.</p>
<p>The chances of a number being prime does go down as you get further along the number line. In fact, we have a fairly decent understanding of this probability. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem" target="_blank">Prime Number Theorem</a> says that the chances for a random number between 2 and N to be prime is about 1/ln(N). As N goes to infinity, 1/ln(N) goes to zero, so primes get rarer and rarer, but never actually go away. For primes to keep up with this probability, the nth prime needs to be about equal to n*ln(n). </p>
<p>Now, these values are approximations. We know that these are pretty good approximations, that's what the Prime Number Theorem says, but we think that they are really good approximations. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_hypothesis" target="_blank">Riemann Hypothesis</a> basically says that these approximations are actually really good, we just can't prove it yet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are, indeed, infinitely many primes. One of the simpler proofs of this fact is credited to Euclid, back in ancient Greece. It goes like this:</p>
<p>Suppose the amount of primes is finite, n. Then we have p<em><em>1</em></em>, ... p<em><em>n</em></em> - a list of all the prime numbers. Consider N = p<em><em>1</em></em> *... * p<em><em>n</em></em> + 1.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it cannot be a prime itself, as obviously it is larger than every prime we have in our grand list of all primes. On the other, it cannot be composite, i.e., product of prime powers: note that for every prime in our list dividing N by it gives remainder 1.</p>
<p>So we're at a contradiction: if our list really contained all the primes, N cannot be neither prime nor composite. Since all the proof relies on primes being finite, it follows this assumption is wrong.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We can know there's no limit to prime numbers through mathematical proof.  </p>
<p>A number has a thing called factors.  2 and 3 are factors of 6.  2 and 5 are factors of 10.  And we know for a fact that if 2 and 3 are factors of an arbitrary number, <em>n</em>, they are not factors of <em>n</em>+1.  So 2 and 3 are factors of 6, but not 7.  They're factors of 12, but not 13.</p>
<p>So if you multiply every known prime number together, then add 1, the number you have has no known primes as factors.  Therefore it is either prime, or the product of two previously unknown primes.  Once you know which, multiply all known primes together and repeat.  </p>
<p>For illustration, you know 2,3, and 5.  Multiply all 3 together, you get 30.  31 is prime.  Multiply 2,3,5,31 you get 930.  931 is a product of 7, 7, and 19.  So now you know 2,3,5,7,19,31.  Multiply them all together and you get 123,690.  123,691 is a product of 37 and 3343 (both prime).  So now you have 2,3,5,7,19,31,37,3343.</p>
<p>So you see this is a cycle without end.  There will always be larger primes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

<p>To throw in another fun proof of the infinitude of primes:</p>
<p>Let $\zeta(s) = \sum\limits_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n^s}$, the Riemann Zeta function.</p>
<p>This function can be rewritten as $\zeta(s) = \prod_{p \text{prime}} \left( \frac{1}{1+\frac{1}{p^s}}$ because of the unique factorization of integers into prime powers.</p>
<p>However, if you plug in $s=1$ into the sum formula, this sum diverges to infinity because it's the harmonic series. If there are finitely many primes though, when you plug $s=1$ into the second formula, you get a finite product of numbers, so it is impossible to be infinite! Hence, we have a contradiction, and so there must be infinitely many primes.</p>

<p>You can also prove this by proving that the sum of the reciprocals of all the primes diverges.  To do this, consider all primes less than a given number y, prove that the product of the infinite series 1/p + 1/p^2 + 1/p^3 + . . . is equal to the sum of all terms 1/n such that n is expressible as a product of primes less than y.  (You can take the product of these series because each of them is absolutely convergent).  Using an integral test, one can show that this sum is greater than log(y)-1.</p>
<p>Now 1/p + 1/p^2 + 1/p^3 + . . . is a convergent geometric series equal to (1-1/p)^-1.  So we have that the product of factors of the form (1-1/p)^-1 for p prime &lt; y is greater than log(y).  exp(v+v^2 ) &gt;= (1-v)^-1 for 0&lt;= v &lt;= 1/2 because the difference of these two functions is 0 at 0 and has positive derivative in the specified region.  This substituting in v=1/p (we can do this because all primes are greater than or equal to 2), we get that the product of terms of the form exp(1/p + 1/p^2 ) is greater than log(y).  taking the log of both sides we get the sum of terms (1/p + 1/p^2) for primes less than y is greater than log(log(y)).  Now 1/p^2 converges (by comparison with 1/n^2 ), log(log(y)) diverges, so this means that the sum of all prime reciprocals  diverges, and hence there must be an infinite number of them.</p>
