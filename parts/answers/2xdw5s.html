		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Hi, this is actually something I know about, I'm a speech and swallowing therapist. I work with patients who have trouble swallowing.</p>
<p>If you inhale food or liquid particles into your airway (&quot;aspiration&quot;), your body will respond with reflexes to clear the airway, i.e., you'll cough. Coughing causes highly pressurized air to push through your vocal cords and upper airway. Then, after you cough, you'll reflexively swallow, which brings those particles down to your esophagus where they belong.  (Try it: touch the front of your throat and cough. You'll notice that you probably swallow right after you cough).</p>
<p>If the particles aren't coughed up and swallowed the right way, two things could happen:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You could choke. If the particles are big enough to occlude your airway, you can't building up a strong enough cough clear the airway. This is why choking victims don't make any noise (no air going through vocal cords = no talking, no coughing) they just silently clutch their necks.</p>
</li>
<li>The particles could descend into your airway, pulled by gravity. There are cilia lining your airway which will try to move the particles up and out. And your immune system will attack the particles, too. But if food/liquid particles descend far enough into your lungs, you could end up with a gnarly case of aspiration pneumonia. Basically, the particles cause an infection and your lungs fill with fluid to fight the infection, but then the fluid prevents you from breathing good.</li>
</ol>
<p>TL;DR no, you do not have crumbs in your lungs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acute medical speech pathologist here. Short version, you could get aspiration pneumonia, and if you're old or ill enough, potentially die. Part of my job in a hospital is to help stop mostly old people and patients with neurological damage from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or degenerative neurological diseases from aspirating their food or drinks and potentially getting aspiration pneumonia. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
