		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Swept back wings have better supersonic performance, by keeping the wings inside the shockwave cone created at the nose of the plane.  Anything outside creates more shockwaves and increases drag substantially.</p>
<p>They have better transonic performance (speeds approaching mach 1), by keeping the airflow over the wings below mach 1 for as long as possible.  Unswept wings get supersonic bubbles of airflow on the wings easier, causing substantial drag.</p>
<p>They have worse performance at low speeds.  Lower aspect ratio means lower lift for more drag.  And increasing effective angle of attack towards the tips means easier to stall and lower lift in general, although this problem has effectively been solved by lift increasing devices like slats and flaps.</p>
<p>As such, most jets that operate near or above mach 1 have swept wings, while most small slow propeller craft have straight wings.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Swept wings increase Mach crit. Basically the aircraft can go faster before supersonic flow starts to develop on the wing. They produce less lift and have higher stall speeds. Stalls will start at wingtips and work inwards where your standard Hershey bar will stall at the root and work out. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Besides speed differences, swept wings change the static and dynamic stability of an aircraft. Forward swept wings tend to make an aircraft more unstable, and rear swept wings help the aircraft to return to trim after an input. There's a lot more to it than that though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Depends what you mean by the term. In aeronautics, &quot;high performance&quot; and &quot;low performance&quot; tend to relate to aspect ratio where high performance equates to energy efficiency, and slow roll rates. Low performance, low aspect ratio planes tend to be more agile for the same mass.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>So a lot of people here mentioned aspect ratio, they are referring to the length of the wing side to side (length) versus front to back (the cord). At the end of wings higher pressure air from below tries to flow around the end to the top, creating swirling air (vortices) which is wasted energy. Long skinny wings (high aspect ratio) minimize the energy lost to vortices. If you google sailplanes they have extremely long wings as part of their design to be very efficient. Often we talk about lift to drag ratios or glide rations as a measure of aircraft efficiency, the more feet forward a plane can glide when dropping a foot, the more efficient it is. So the swept wings are inefficient at slower speeds but make up for it with their superior performance as we reach the speed of sound (Mach 1). They were invented by the Germans in WWII and until the allies found the Germans research the allies struggled to design planes approaching Mach 1 which had acceptable performance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
