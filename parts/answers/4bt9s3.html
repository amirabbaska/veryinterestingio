		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To add something, I talked to a veterinary professor and my physics professor today about this and we discussed pretty much about their after-response. </p>
<p>My professor has a theory that their pain nerves are not as well-developed, hence they don't realize quickly when they DO bite themselves. To add to that, they have their spinal cords extending all the way to the tip of their tails with dorsal and ventral roots at each vertebral column, so they should have nerve endings at their tails.</p>
<p>As for why they bite themselves, she said a sensible explanation was probably the false sense of hunger triggered by temperature, just like what u/yesssssssssssno mentioned. But she also said outside of that not much is really known. </p>
<p>My physics professor came in from another interesting point of view: the environment these particular situations could be poorly set-up and that could very well have screwed up their IR sensing or the electrophysiology of their pit organs, and then that creates their own disorientation and mistake themselves as prey or predators.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>&quot;If snakes get too hot, they can become confused and disoriented. They also get a ramped-up metabolism, causing them to have a false sense of hunger and a desire to eat the first thing they see. As captive snakes typically live alone and food isnâ€™t routinely consistently available to them, they end up attacking themselves. </p>
<p>Snakes may also attack themselves if they are shedding and have diminished eyesight, mistaking their tail for prey.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rats and milk snakes are particularly bad for getting excited and accidentally grabbing themselves. They soon let go. I think one of the videos you've mentioned is the western hognose that's literally trying to swallow itself. This can be down to stress and improper husbandry, including wrong temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Snakes are opportunistic eaters and some species are not very intelligent. I had a Mexican black king snake who has bitten himself after I've handled him and I assume it's because it can smell my scent on him. Also this snake was a king snake and these eat snakes, so it might have mistaken its tail for another snake. Not quite sure why other species might do this though.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Top comment answered very well. I just want to add that snakes are really dumb. My pet snake seems to have the intelligence of a toddler when it comes to doing things that it should not be doing, meaning you always have to watch them when you take them out and occasionally have to try pull them off stuff as they wrap themselves around stubbornly refusing to let go. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
