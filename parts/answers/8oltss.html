		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Things ignite easier if there is maximum surface area between the air and flammable material.</p>
<p>It's the same reason why grain silos filled with grain dust can spontaneously combust if they get hot enough.</p>
<p>Lint is made up of lots of tiny fine particles stuck together.</p>
<p>So there is a LOT of surface area between air (oxygen) and the combustible material, lint.</p>
<p>Conversely, it's hard to ignite a large log from just a match, because there is not enough relative surface area between the wood and the air to sustain the combustion.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>it's something dry that has a lot of surface area.  it's like why dry thistle is also flammable and huge forest fires have been started from just cigarette butts.  the flash point of dryer lint is about 250-350C and since the dryer vents really hot air, if it gets clogged, it can get hot enough for the lint to ignite.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The reason dryer lint catches fire isn't because it is so flammable (which it is), but because of *where* it is. When a dryer duct hasn't been cleaned in awhile, it can become clogged, causing a back-pressure effect. When that happens, the lint is forced out of the duct it is supposed to be exiting, and gets sucked into the dryer's intake, which can cause the lint to coat the heating elements.

It has some pictures that show this happening. Full disclosure: I took those pictures on the web page. I co-own the business which cleans dryers and dryer ducts. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's made up of a mat of small flammable threads.  Lots of oxygen can get between the threads, and because it's not dense, ignition is easy.</p>
<p>Depending on what fabrics you put in the dryer, it'll be more or less flammable.  Plastics (rayon, dacron, nylon, etc.) will be the most flammable, wool lint will be one of the least flammable.  Cotton and Lycra will be somewhere in the middle. But mix them all together, and you've got something that will ignite quickly, gain temperature, and then burn hot for a while once the less flammable fibers start to burn.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
