		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the rings is just dust. But there are bigger rocks as well. Some can be as big as a house and very few even larger ones. Even a moon can be found inside the rings, causing waves in his surroundings. <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/vertical-structures-in-rings-e1417498285321.jpg" target="_blank">picture</a>.<br />
Another interesting fact is the thickness of the rings. The rings are only a few meters to a few hundreds of meters thick. That makes them almost invisible when viewed from the side. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The average particle size (radius) for Saturn's Rings is between 2 to 12 meters, with a likely minimum particle size of 1 to 10 cm and a maximum particle size of 10 to 20 metres. Saturn's Rings contain relatively little dust. They are mostly car to truck sized. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although detailed models of the size distribution in Saturn’s
rings below a radius of 1 cm are lacking, several lines of evidence
suggest that—at least in the main A, B, and C rings—very little
of the total surface area is accounted for by such particles. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>So most particle are &gt;1cm.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from the conclusions of the paper...</p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>With the exception of the Cassini Division, where
our results are the least well-constrained, the effective radii agree
to within ∼30%. Both studies find that aeff ' 2 m in the C Ring,
∼8 m in the inner B Ring, and 8–12 m in the inner A Ring.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>I not sure about distance. Though this could be inferred via predictions of density and frequency of collisions.</p>

<p>For objects of radius between 10 cm and 1 m (i.e., between a volleyball and a beach ball), the total number density is roughly 10^-2 per square meter, or about 50 over a football field.  Depending on the ring thickness, which gets a small as a few meters, this is pretty dense.  If you were floating around in the rings, they would be separated by about 10 meters.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
