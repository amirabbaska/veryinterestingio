		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's called &quot;The Paradox of Tragedy&quot;, and a lot of smart people, including Hume, have thought quite a bit about this!</p>
<p>There is no clear solution to this yet, but it might be because listening to other people have a bad time makes us feel like our own problems are not so bad, and we're not the only ones with problems. </p>
<p>The fact that we can kind of experience another person's pain, but at the same time know that we're not in real pain or danger ourselves, might make us slightly happy too, because it's a great way to train and learn and prepare for when tragedy strikes ourselves.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

I do 'like' to listen to sad songs when I'm feeling down, but that's not the wisest thing to do because it tends to make me feel even more sad. It's weird.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
