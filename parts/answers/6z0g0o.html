<p>&quot;Quoting Ed Landa: &quot;zinc sulfide was mixed with a radium salt to yield products containing about 25 to 300 ug [one ug is essentially the same as one uCi] of radium element per gram. The more concentrated preparations (generally containing 215 ug of radium per gram to meet British Admiralty standards) were used on aircraft and ship instrument dials, while lower-grade materials containing about 50 to 100 ug of radium per gram of mixture were used on watches, switch markings, and other devices requiring less critical reading.&quot;  According to a Department of Commerce Information Circular from 1930, the paint might contain &quot;from 0.7 to 3 and even 4 milligrams of radium element to 100 grams of zinc sulfide. Impurities may be added to the zinc sulfide as follows: Cadmium, 0.05 per cent; copper, 0.001 per cent; manganese, 0.0002 per cent.&quot; </p>
<p>As from the cited text, making radium paint required only micrograms to milligrams of elemental radium. So you could paint thousands to millions of dials and watches with just a gram of radium. The glow is actually caused by the zinc sulfide fluorescing in response to the radioactivity of the radium salt additive, which is so radioactive it can provide sufficient amount for radioluminescence at such low concentrations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
