		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't take futuristic technology to have such long-range communication. Voyagers were designed from the start to have enough radio power to communicate from interplanetary space, and their RTG will last for maybe another decade. On the receiving end, we're using gigantic radiotelescopes of the Deep Space Network. We have been able to continuously upgrade <em>those</em>, especially during the <em>Galileo</em> fiasco when a very fancy Jupiter mission failed to deploy its high-gain antenna dish, so to salvage the mission the groundside systems were dramatically overhauled.</p>
<p>That's ultimately the trick. We can use better and bigger groundside arrays - Russia has an old 600 m dish, for example, and that's before we start with synthetic apertures that allow you to combine dishes on different sides of the planet - to both receive the weakening signal, and to send signals of sufficient strength to be received.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not just what DDE93 said, but there isn't much blocking signals in space so they can travel very far depending on the band you are operating in.  Add the fact tha the technology used was so old they built it the satellites to be reliable and didn't use weaker more secure signals.  The DSCS satellite (a military communication satellite still used to day launched between 1980s-2003), initially had the same processing power as a standard $5 solar powered calculator.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You can find out more about the systems used to communicate with various spacecraft at <a href="http://eyes.nasa.gov/dsn/dsn.html" target="_blank">DSN Now</a>.  You'll see the Voyagers communicating with DSN a few times a week.</p>
<p>The transmission rate is very low at those distances - only about 192 bps (compared to about 68 Kbps for the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter).</p>
<p>You're right - those are fascinating.  To have traveled so far for so long and still be going, it's pretty amazing.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Also to add to the other points, the frequency they use for communication is not one subject to any significant background interference. It's a naturally quiet part of the spectrum, meaning that if the dish filters for only Voyager's transmission frequency, it will be pretty much the only thing in the direction they're looking.
This picture is how it's signal was seen by a radio telescope as recently as 2013.
