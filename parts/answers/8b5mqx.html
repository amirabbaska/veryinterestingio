		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Shock doesnt mean you feel shocked emotionally. In the medical sense, shock means that your organs aren’t getting enough oxygen. If your brain doesn’t get enough oxygen, you die. </p>
<p>There are four main types of shock:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hypovolemic ie low blood volume often due to blood loss - this causes low blood pressure and not enough blood getting to important places)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>cardiogenic - ie when your heart goes fucky and it can’t pump hard enough to produce a high enough blood pressure to supply blood to your body bits properly </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>obstructive - when something physically stops blood from exiting the heart properly </p>
</li>
<li>distributive - when the small blood vessels in your body dilate, so most of your blood stays there, causing a big drop in blood pressure (eg septic shock or anaphylactic shock).</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope that helps! </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've asked this question, and it is about language. People don't die from shock as in  &quot;surprise&quot;</p>
<p>In medicine, shock refers to a failure of the circulatory system, and lack of blood supply to vital organs.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people get bad boo-boos their body tries to make-up for the injury. There are 3 major types of shock, a problem with the pump (heart), a problem with the container (body) and a problem with the vessels (blood). Due to these problems the body/organs don’t receive enough oxygen. The tiny cells in your body begin to die and when too many of them die so do you. So really your injuries cause the shock so it still is your injuries killing you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The literal definition of shock I was taught was, &quot;cellular hypoxia, dysfunction, and death as a result of inadequate tissue perfusion.&quot;</p>
<p>Your cells die as a result of insufficient oxygenation from whichever type of shock is causing it</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>the traumamatic injury does cause the shock that &quot;leads&quot; to death. Shock is the lack of perfusion (oxygen and vital substances) in this cause caused by trauma (wounds). trauma insults cells, tissues and organs, these injuries/wounds results in shock to cells, tissues and organs. Technically cardio respiratory arrest kills a person, in your trauma case, the injury, resultant shock and further MODS/SIRS/TIC (flash terminology for your body shutting down and being overwhelmed) kills. To respond to your statement, traumatic injuries do kill people from the overwhelmimg injuries and sequalea that the person can not overcome. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
