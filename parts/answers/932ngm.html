<p>Then take the soda from blood in pancreas and dump it into intestines to neutralize the acid and get back to initial composition absorbed back to blood in intestines.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Acid is a solution of water with extra hydrogen ions, or protons, in it (a normal hydrogen atom is just one proton and one electron; a H+ ion has the electron removed, so is just a bare proton.) </p>
<p>Your stomach is lined with cells called parietal cells, which pump protons into the stomach cavity in exchange for potassium ions. The proton pump itself, known as H+/K+ ATPase, takes a lot of energy to operate, because it is pumping the protons against a huge concentration gradient, forming a highly concentrated H+ solution (i.e. highly acidic) in the stomach cavity. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are two types of glands in the body, endocrine that secrete stuff directly to your bodily fluids (such as hormones to your bloodstream) and exocrine glands that secret stuff to your body cavities (such as saliva in your mouth). Stomach acid is an example of the work of exocrine glands in your digestive system, and in order to protect your body from the harm of the acid, the stomach also produces a protective layer around itself. The acid itself is basically HCl (hydrochloric acid), which is the combination of only two elements, hydrogen and chlorine, which your body has more than the ability to produce at a fast enough rate. </p>
<p>Hope that helped.</p>
<p>Cheers.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Ok, there are good explanations here, but nothing ELI5. Here's my try:</p>
<p>An acid can be defined as something that has more protons in it. Your cells have something called a proton pump that can take protons from water and pump to your stomach, making acid as more protons are added. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
