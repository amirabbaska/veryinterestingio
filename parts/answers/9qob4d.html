The motor is large enough to carry a fully loaded escalator.  It will just draw more amperage when fully loaded than when empty.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Whenever electricity is involved it can't be truly ELI5 but I'll try by skipping over the details. I'm a winder electrician, which means I build motors and motor systems.</p>
<p>They are driven by induction motors that always turn at a constant speed linked to the 60Hz frequency of the electric lines. Every time the electricity changes polarity, the motor moves on to the next magnetic pole (simplified). Typical speeds are 1200/1800/3600RPM for 6/4/2 pole motors respectively.</p>
<p>As the load increases the motor will draw more power up until it stalls. Until then it won't slow down much.</p>
<p>Real speeds are actually a bit lower due to &quot;slip&quot; of the rotor but true synchronous motors do exist and are used as generators and in heavy industry.</p>
<p>The only motors that vary in speed greatly due to load are the brushed sort usually found in tools and small appliances. For reasons I won't go into, they are not linked to the frequency of the power, and can often run on both AC or DC power.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In a motor torque is proportional to current.
If you need to lift more people, increase current to increase torque.
Add a sensor to measure motor speed.
Use a small computer to control current based on desired speed. </p>
<p>Edit: Many are saying you don't need a speed controller for AC motors on an escalator, sweet.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It is using an Alternating Current motor that runs at a constant speed, the speed is directly related to the frequency of the AC power, 60 Hertz in North America. The motor is sized with enough torque for full load. Running it at no-load it will run at the same sped as full design load, just drawing much less current (power) from the source.  </p>
<p>Kind of like pedaling a bicycle in a low gear on flat ground, really easy to push the pedals.  As load increases the speed will remain the same but the motor will draw more current, like pedaling up a hill. If the load exceeds full design load and the motor should trip the Overload Protection device.  like a hill too steep to pedal up, you slow down and stop.  The motor should trip the O.L. long before it gets to the point of slowing down.</p>
<p>Not exactly for a 5 year old I think. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
