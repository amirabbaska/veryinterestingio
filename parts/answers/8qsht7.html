		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They're conserving energy. Many spiders are ambush predators. They build a trap (their web), and attack prey that falls into the trap. Moving around unnecessarily burns energy they could instead conserve to keep them alive longer between prey, and attack more energetically when it arrives. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If there’s a steady food source, why wouldn’t they? They spend a ton of energy and resources building a web, so they have to at least try to make that back before they move on. Many also eat their web when they leave!</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are great answers here already. I just want to add that spiders are cold-blooded, so waiting in one place uses less energy for them than it would for a warm-blooded animal like a mammal or bird. Cold-blooded animals tend to be very patient.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Mainly to conserve energy. This sort of daily torpor is shared by many species. Turns out, they can't just go for a leisurely walk and then casually order a pizza at home like many humans can. Energy is abundant for humans in their ecological niche, and that has been mostly true evolutionarily, which is also partly why we have evolved a very active metabolism and avoided the hibernation adaptations of some other mammals. But for spiders, the rule is basically only move when necessary. They are built for the survival marathon. Torpor provides thermoregulation during colder temperatures, and the ability to last them during regular periods of food scarcity. It can also give them a competitive advantage with other spiders and species in the ecosystem who compete for the same food, as they may survive for that next opportunity, and outlive those that can't.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I don't think what you asked applies to all spiders but I remember watching a documentary about a specific type of spider that remains stationary for hunting for a very specific strategy.</p>
<p>Basically what it does is weaving such a web pattern that different threads connect to different legs. This way it can pinpoint the location of its prey from the difference in vibration on each thread.</p>
<p>Given that their evolution favors spinning webs to incapacitate their prey in general, I'd say waiting for food to wander into their traps is their primary hunting strategy and stationariness (assuming that this is a word) is an eventual behavioral side-effect.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
