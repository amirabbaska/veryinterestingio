		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I strongly recommend Braitenberg's <em>Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic Psychology</em>. It's a series of thought experiments about how complex behaviors can arise from very simple circuits. For more intense reading, you could try <em>Optima for Animals</em> by Robert McNeill Alexander. Both authors emphasize that we should be careful to avoid anthropomorphizing non-human entities by ascribing mental states like desires, beliefs, and goals. It's all well and good to talk about those things colloquially as when we say that a thermostat &quot;wants&quot; or &quot;tries&quot; to get the temperature to be at some goal, but when pressed we wouldn't say that a thermostat actually has intentions or desires in the same way that we do. Likewise for all other organisms, whether they be single-celled or very complex, we should be extremely careful in talking about such things. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
