		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Viruses face pressures to survive and replicate like other organisms. In order for a virus to be considered helpful, the damage of the viruses lifecycle (which involves hijacking cellular machinery) would need to be outweighed by some benefit. </p>
<p>Imagine a possible &quot;confidence virus&quot;: the virus would enter a cell type in the brain (similar to rabies) and specifically stimulate the circuitry for confidence, but no others in a negative way. To maintain its label as a useful virus it would need to leave the brain cells unharmed but still replicate itself efficiently and pass itself on to another host. This may be possible by budding and sexual transmission, but it's a little difficult to imagine that this could be done efficiently without negatively disrupting the &quot;confidence circuits&quot;. Viral replication usually disrupts the cells ability to take care of itself (transcription). </p>
<p>Another issue with the confidence virus is specificity. Viruses choose which cells to invade by molecules expressed on the cell surface. The cell surface markers would need to be distinct for the confidence pathway (almost certainly not true). A possible way around this would for the virus to have some sort of dependency on confidence circuit cells once it gets into the cell type (let's assume neurons). Confidence neurons, with cell surface markers indistinguishable from other neurons, would need to provide some specific queue to activate the positive effect. This might be some cellular DNA regulator (transcription factor) that acts together with a viral factor. </p>
<p>I'm still hoping a positive virus will be discovered someday. There was a great episode of Red Dwarf that played with this idea. </p>
<p>Edit: after shower thoughts about confidence virus</p>
<p>ELI5 take 2: Viruses hurt people because they take and use things that cells need to survive. For viruses to be good they would either need to hurt bad cells or have a side effect that makes the cells help the person they are part of more than the virus hurts them. There are some things about viruses that make this difficult to imagine, but not impossible. I'll tell you about them when you're older.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There ARE helpful viruses in the human body. Endogenous retroviruses (<a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endogenous_retrovirus</a>), have left Viral DNA sequences that now comprise 5-8% of the human genome.  </p>
<p>Theses endogenous retro viral sequences have helped diversify the genome, playing a role in evolution. They also modulate gene expression, and have become critical to heathy physiology, such as estrogen levels during pregnancy, production of digestive enzymes, immune system development. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>To piggyback off of what everyone else is saying:</p>
<p>Let's just look at the physical constraints of a virus. Despite being the most diverse and omnipresent biological material in the world (there's an estimated 10^31 viral particles floating around - compared to the approximately 10^11 stars in the observable universe), they are also the smallest that we've encountered. This minuscule size means that they can spread far and wide, but it also limits how much information they can encode on their genome. As a reference, the smallest known viral genome is Hepatitis B, at 3.2 kb (3,200 bases or nucleotides); compare that to a human genome, which is which is 3 <em>billion</em> bases, a full six orders of magnitude larger. </p>
<p>With such little genomes, you might wonder why they can't fit more info in them. To answer that, we have to look at the &quot;body&quot; of a virus, called the capsid. Viral capsids are also tiny, but they are also economical. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Jacquet/publication/224708905/figure/fig2/AS:302858718203908@1449218553703/FIG-2-Cryo-electron-microscopy-of-SPP1-capsid-and-phage-particles-A-Images-of-H-12.png" target="_blank">Take a look at this bacterial virus</a>. In section D, you see all those parallel lines? That is the genome of the virus, packed in at about 5 atmospheres of pressure: roughly the same amount in a bottle of champagne. This isn't unique to this virus; many viruses have to stuff their genome into the capsid, and for one main reason: The bigger the capsid, the more genes you need to produce it, and thus the larger the capsid needed to carry those genes. Many of the larger viruses (like Mimiviruses or Poxviruses) actually include &quot;scaffolding proteins&quot; in their genome, which help assemble the capsid since it's too large to assemble spontaneously.</p>
<p>But why aren't there any mutations that may help us? It's possible that there are; however, with so little space to work with, these viruses encode, in general, exclusively genes that help it survive. This includes the capsid genes, genes that help regulate its life cycle in the host cell, and in many cases genes that modulate the cell's defenses. Thus, any gene mutations that appear must benefit the virus first if it's going to survive. And due to the specificity of their genes, the likelihood that the virus will encode for a helpful protein for us is highly unlikely.</p>
<p>However, that doesn't mean that viruses can't be helpful. An emerging field is called <em>phage therapy</em>. Like /u/hard_to_lee said, viruses tend to be very specific to a certain cell type. This can mean it only infects skin cells, or it only infects a single species of bacteria. Due to this, we can use viruses specifically tailored for bacteria as an alternative to antibiotics. Since the virus is so specific, we can use them to kill the pathogenic (bad) bacteria without hurting us or the good bacteria inside us (called our microbiome). Phage therapy isn't available for humans yet, but it has been successful in animals.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are resident viruses in humans, though they haven't been studied as well. It's not hard to imagine how bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) could be useful. In general, though, while bacteria can easily co-exist with our cells, viruses need to take over other cells to replicate. It's a hostile move.</p>
