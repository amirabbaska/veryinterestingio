Some people passed on the CCR5 delta32 gene which is thought to be a reaction to the Black Plague, only a few people have it today in Europe.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I was just in Eyam, England, a town that self-quarantined for a couple years during The Plague so it would be the last outpost north for its transmission. </p>
<p>There was a cool exhibit about who had it and who survived - they kept records. They lost something like 70% of the tiny village, but there were entire lineages preserved, almost always going through a mother. So the father would die but if the mother didn’t, in many cases her kids didn’t either.</p>
<p>They didn’t make any science of it, but the correlation was obvious, and pretty interesting.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I just watched a documentary on this in my bio class last semester, Iforget the title but I'll try to hunt it down. Basically yes and no, the survivors luckily had a gene mutation called delta r32 (idr the name of the gene this mutation affects). The plague didn't cause the mutation or any other immune effects and the gene wasn't very present. Mostly anyone that was exposed died and the few that survived all had this mutation. And the gene can be passed down all though not 100% .After the documentary explains how they were able to track down descendents of the survivors, some of them had the gene mutation. At the end of it, they relate how the genetic mutation was also present in a person who was heavily exposed to AIDs during the outbreak but survived. Curious scientist wanted to know why this man had many sexual encounters with confirmed aids victims but showed no signs in blood work. They attributed it to this mutation. Well, now it's time to hunt for links! Edit: gene: Ccr5 mutation: delta 32 thanks /u/itlawdy</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The answer to this question is no. If you are exposed to a disease and survive due to gaining immunity from exposure to the disease, it’s similar to having a scar. Your body has healed and has some memory or memento of the disease, but the change is not going to be passed on to your children.*</p>
<p>If you have some sort of inherited resistance that prevents the disease from infecting you, or is very good at fighting the disease, that can be passed on to your child, but it’s not something you gained from exposure to the disease. It’s something you always had and made it more likely for you and your child to survive the outbreak.</p>
<p>*This ‘memory’ of the disease is a feature of our immune system that we exploit with the use of vaccines. We expose ourselves to weak versions of a dangerous disease to train our bodies to recognize the threat. If the resulting immunity was inheritable, there would be no need to vaccinate subsequent generations.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
