		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because space travel is not inherently engaging for the vast majority of people. In order to be interested, there must be something novel or dramatic to keep people engaged. Hardly anybody saw the Apollo 13 launch, but as soon as lives were on the line it became an internationally captivating story.</p>
<p>It's similar in many other areas such as public safety. A man shoots up a school with 20 children dead and we have congressional inquiries and wall-to-wall media coverage, and people calling for armed guards in every school, but every year thousands of children are killed in the USA from automobile crashes and hardly anybody bats an eye.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Was it because the general public was actually bored or were TV stations losing money?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>TV stations certainly missed opportunities for paid programming, but would have likely continued if there was public interest if only to maintain good-will among their viewers.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Late to the party like usual on week days but short answer: NASA made space boring.  </p>
<p>Longer answer: There were a large number of Apollo missions planed before the landing of Apollo X1. And  no attempts were made to involve the public. The mission were treated more like military exercises some information was available but it was presented in a boring manner. Also after Apollo XI it was obvious to everyone that it would just be a matter of time before a moonbase and a space stations were built. So very few people really thought about space who were not heavy into science or science fiction. And the US government did very little to promote the fact that the booming economy of the late 60s was a result of the huge investment in going to the moon. Or to show how the new technologies were becoming part of everyday life.  </p>
<p>NASA did get better at public involvement during the Shuttle years with the Teacher in space program but really it was too little too late. It's sad that with all the involvement of the public over the last few years of ISS missions, there are only murmurs of what might come later.</p>
<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Everyone knew people would be living on the Moon by 2000, so why care how they get there.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Armstrong says &quot;hmmm.. theres somethng in our landing zone, gonna try a manuver, one sec&quot; (paraphrased) and everyone in mission control is shitting themselves because its not a planned move, a tiny bit of damage will strand them on the moon till they run out of oxygen, and they dont have a ton of fuel to spare, the press secretary is having a heart attack worring about <em>are we broadcasting the first space deaths on live tv</em> and in general everyone else is like, &quot;ok, a manuver, so its pretty close to landing&quot;. After that first, its not as interesting.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Personally as a 10 year old when Apollo 11 landed on the moon. It was incredibly boring at the time. We were all outside playing in the hood when everybody headed home to watch the landing. It took like hours it seemed and there was really nothing to see between the cameras and the position of them etc and all in b&amp;w. So ok now they claim it's down. Come back hours from now and watch another tediously boring grainy black and white static laden video of guys bouncing around. Intensely boring at the time and that was the mission viewed as the most noteworthy because it was the first. So why the hell would anyone want to subject themselves to that when it was just another mission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Space travel is boring for most people. The characters are dull, the action is minimal, there's no conflict, etc. It lacks the kinds of elements that make television interesting. </p>
<p>A reality TV show about astronauts on a mission to Mars might be a able to survive as a weekly show on the Discovery Channel but only if they introduce a bunch of conflict/danger which might jeopardize the mission.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
