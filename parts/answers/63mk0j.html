		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not all probes are crashed down at the end of their mission, and the crash itself is more complex than just getting rid of the probe. When they do crash a probe on purpose, it's often to collect new data that they could not otherwise get.</p>
<p>For Cassini in particular, they are planning what they call its <a href="https://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov/mission/grand-finale/overview/" target="_blank">Grand Finale</a>. From now until September, Cassini will dive between Saturn and its rings several times, gathering data on those regions which we've never been able to explore before (and most likely sending back some <em>incredible</em> pictures of the inner rings and planet atmosphere).</p>
<p>On the final orbit, the probe will dive into the atmosphere of Saturn, sending back data on the atmosphere itself for as long as it can survive. At some point, the probe will simply burn up and disintegrate, much like a small meteor burns up in the Earth's atmosphere.</p>
<hr />
<p>Other than gathering data on Saturn, NASA is also concerned that some of Saturn's moons - Enceladus and Titan - may contain organic life, even if just microscopic.</p>
<p>Similar to the Prime Directive in <em>Star Trek</em>, they don't want to risk contaminating those environments in the case that Cassini - after it spends all its fuel making orbit adjustments - crashes into one of them. So, disposing of the probe completely by burning it in Saturn's atmosphere is the safest way to prevent it from being a nuisance in the future.</p>
<p>If nothing else, it's nice to see NASA and JPL cleaning up after themselves. :)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>They don't always. Casini in particular was sent into the atmosphere of Saturn so that it couldn't accidentally contaminate any nearby moons potentially capable of harboring life. While it's pretty long odds that it would succeed to do so, destroying the probe in the atmosphere removes them entirely, and at the time the plan was to send future probes anyway that could take over the operation. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This question came up during an episode of Star Talk with Neil Degrasse Tyson. Their answer was that they use this as a final act of data-gathering. </p>
<p>To rephrase: they try to get as many different data as possible, and during the crash (or in the period leading up to it) much unique data is returned. </p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The #1 reason is to preclude any possibility that Earth-based lifeforms on the probe itself contaminate a possible source of extraterrestrial life. Space probes like Cassini are sterilized to kill anything off before they are launched, and of course outer space is not very conducive to life. But there's no way to guarantee that <em>some</em> microbe won't manage to survive the trip. </p>
<p>Should we one day discover extraterrestrial life on Europa, or Titan, or Enceladus, it would be a major bummer to determine that such life wasn't extraterrestrial at all and had just hitched a ride on an old probe a few hundred years before. Even worse: our Earth-based microbes might kill off any extraterrestrial life before we know it's there.</p>
<p>We limit where probes land on Mars for the same reason.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
