		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>While the tongue only detects 5 ‘tastes’, smell is also a compnent, and it is this that creates ‘flavour’. Without any sense of smell an apple and onion would taste VERY similar. Food is ‘smelt’ through olfactory glands in the nose, via the internal nasal cavity.</p>
<p>EDIT: Corrected location of glands per several commenters below. Thanks guys.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not just those 5! There has been some good research over the last decade that suggests &quot;fat&quot; is the 6th flavor that mammals (including humans) can taste.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a short overview of the gustatory pathway, this review brings together the key findings consistent with the existence of a sixth taste modality devoted to the perception of lipids.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I’m a little apprehensive seeing as how nobody has asked this question: what the actual fuck is “umami flavour”?

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There are not only five tastes.</p>
<p>It's a useful model for teaching schoolkids, but it's not an accurate one.</p>
<p>There are, in total, around thirty tastes.</p>
<p>I'll go over them.</p>
<p>Sweetness is detected by G protein coupled receptors, which respond to sugars, aldehydes, alcohols and ketones.</p>
<p>Sourness is quite simple, it is activated by hydrogen ions (it basically responds to low pH) and detects acidity.</p>
<p>Saltiness is activated by small singly charged cations, Li+, Na+ and K+. The larger Ca2+ and Mg2+ cations have a much weaker response. Other cations, like ammonium, do not elicit this response.</p>
<p>Bitterness is the most complex of tastes, using a G coupled receptor (to gustducin) like with sweetness, to form over 25 different taste receptors. Some types of bitterness, such as beer or wine, are pleasant. Other types are unpleasant, like dandelion milk. These have as much a claim to be basic tastes by themselves as any other receptor does. We even have a very tightly coupled receptor which responds to a molecule nobody's yet discovered, a completely unknown taste which was likely down to an unpleasant plant we encountered somewhere in our past. </p>
<p>Umami is another G coupled receptor, which is tightly coupled to detect the glutamate ion, the anion of the amino acid glutamic acid, a very versatile amino acid used as the building block of proteins. Most people describe it as &quot;savoury&quot; or &quot;meaty&quot;, but it is properly called &quot;umami&quot;. Nucelodites like guanylic acid and inosinic acid can also complement glutamate. Ribonucleotides are also often used to trigger the umami taste.</p>
<p>That's five basic tastes, and researchers at Purdue University believe they have found a sixth, that of rancid oils, which likely has its own receptors and therefore is a basic taste. Oils are usually triglycerides, which contribute to mouthfeel, but have no taste. Once the triglyceride begins to break into fatty acids (e.g. via bacterial fermentation), it imbues a taste which is pleasant in low concentrations, but as concentration increases becomes unpleasant and finally inedible. Fatty acids are a good nutrient, however their presence indicates food which is likely spoiled as they are not found in isolation in the human diet to any large degree.</p>
<p>The somatosensory system is also involved in taste, adding coolness (e.g. mint, menthol), pungency (chilli peppers, black peppers), numbness (sichuan pepper), astringency (tannins in tea, rhubarb, chestnuts), metallicness (blood) and we're still discovering new tastes such as calcium and fattiness, which are present in mice and may be present in humans.</p>
<p>So, in the ELI5 summary, of &quot;basic tastes&quot;, there are as many as six, and then the 25-strong bitterness complex, as well as those added by the somatosensory system, as well as temperature.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
