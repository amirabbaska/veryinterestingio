		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of the subsidies for the fossil fuels industry in the US comes in the form of tax breaks. Some economists would be upset at using the term subsidy to mean tax break, but common usage of the word includes them.</p>
<p>Petroleum companies get tax breaks for doing specific things that the government wants to incentivize (or avoid punishing). For example, they get a foreign tax credit which allows them to deduct taxes paid in foreign countries from their profits that are returned to the US. The government allows that because it wants US companies to do business abroad while bringing money back into the US. Companies either wouldn't do business abroad or would keep their earnings outside of the US if they got double taxed on them. It's also worth noting that this tax break is available to pretty much all US businesses, not just the petroleum industry.</p>
<p>There are also subsidies promoting domestic manufacturing, exploration for new wells, etc. </p>
<p>There are a couple reasons you can't just trade these out for a tax on petroluem. First, the tax on gasoline is collected by both the stats and the federal government, which means the states also rely on the tax for money. However, the federal government is the one who gives the subsidies. So the people doing the taxing aren't always the same ones providing the subsidies. Additionally, people are the ones paying the tax and it's on gasoline. Petroleum companies are the ones getting the subsidies and it's on their businesses in general and drilling for oil; not just gasoline.</p>
<p>Second, if you remove the subsidies you lose your ability to influence the behavior of the subsidized industries. Without the subsidies companies could get the same savings without having to undertake specific tasks to claim the subsidy.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I frequently see the same debate on reddit regarding subsidies  for fossil fuels. For the sake of clarity I've decided to compile all of the fossil fuel subsidies currently in use.  I'm tired of the top-line numbers that don't have much in the way of specifics.  Here is what was spent by the federal government from 2002-2008. The total amount of subsidies and direct payments over that period for the fossil fuel industry was $72,473 million.</p>
<p><strong>Tax Credits</strong></p>
<p><strong>Foreign Tax Credit ($15,300 million)</strong> - IRC Section 901. This is a generally applicable credit that is intended to enable taxpayers earning income or profits abroad to avoid double taxation. Special rules under this provision allow characterization of royalty payments to foreign governments as corporate income taxes, which have provided special benefits to oil and gas producers. IRC Section 907 imposes limitations on those benefits but does not eliminate them. </p>
<p><strong>Credit for Production of Nonconventional Fuels ($14,097 million)</strong>- IRC Section 45K. This provision provides a tax credit for the production of certain fuels. Qualifying fuels include: oil from shale, tar sands; gas from geopressurized brine, Devonian shale, coal seams, tight formations, biomass, and coal-based synthetic fuels. This credit has historically primarily benefited coal producers. </p>
<p><strong>Oil and Gas Exploration &amp; Development Expensing ($7,100 million)</strong>- IRC Section 617. Intangible Drilling Costs (IDC) (for example, wages, costs of machinery, or unsalvageable materials) may be deducted as business expenses rather than amortized. Integrated oil companies may deduct only 70 percent and must amortize the remainder. </p>
<p><strong>Oil and Gas Excess Percentage over Cost Depletion ($5,441 million)</strong>- IRC Section 613. Independent producers and royalty owners can deduct 15 percent of gross income earned from qualifying oil, gas, and oil shale deposits. </p>
<p><strong>Credit for Enhanced Oil Recovery Costs ($1,575 million)</strong> - IRC Section 43. This tax credit is available for hydrocarbon-based tertiary injectant methods defined by IRC Section 193. </p>
<p><strong>Characterizing Coal Royalty Payments as Capital Gains ($986 million)</strong> - IRC Section 631(c). Income from the sale of coal under royalty contract may be treated as a capital gain rather than ordinary income for qualifying individuals. </p>
<p><strong>Exclusion of Benefit Payments to Disabled Miners ($438 million)</strong> - 30 U.S.C. 922(c). Disability payments out of the Black Lung Disability Trust Fund are not treated as income to the recipients. </p>
<p><strong>Exclusion of Alternative Fuels from Fuel Excise Tax ($343 million)</strong> - IRC Section 6426(d). This section applies to liquified petroleum gas (LPG), P-series fuels (defined at 42 U.S.C. 13211(2)), compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied natural gas (LNG), liquefied hydrogen, liquid coal, and liquid hydrocarbon from biomass. </p>
<p><strong>Other-Fuel Exploration &amp; Development Expensing ($342 million)</strong> - IRC Section 617. Identical provisions as applied to oil and gas (above). Including, for example, the costs of surface stripping, and construction of shafts and tunnels. </p>
<p><strong>Other-Fuel Excess of Percentage over Cost Depletion ($323 million)</strong>- IRC Section 613. Taxpayers may deduct 10 percent of gross income from coal production. </p>
<p><strong>Deduction for Clean Fuel Vehicles and Refueling Property-Fossil Fuels ($209 million)</strong> - IRC Section 179A. This deduction is equal to the cost of property with certain limitations. Qualifying fuels: natural gas, LNG, LPG, hydrogen, electric, E85, methanol, and other alcohol fuels. Amounts were prorated between fossil fuels and renewables. </p>
<p><strong>Exception from Passive Loss Limitations for Oil and Gas ($190 million)</strong> - IRC Section 469(c)(3). Owners of working interests in oil and gas properties may aggregate negative taxable income from qualifying sources with all other income sources. </p>
<p><strong>Credit for Clean Coal Investment ($186 million)</strong>- IRC Sections 48A and 48B. Available for 20 percent of the basis of integrated gasification combined cycle property and 15 percent of the basis for other advanced coal-based generation technologies. </p>
<p><strong>Expensing Liquid Fuel Refineries ($164 million)</strong> - IRC Section 179C. This deduction is available to refiners of crude oil and other fuels defined at IRC Section 45K(c) (above). </p>
<p><strong>Special Rules for Mining Reclamation Reserves ($159 million)</strong> - IRC Section 468. This deduction is available for early payments into reserve trusts, with eligibility determined by the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act and the Solid Waste Management Act. The amounts attributable to mines rather than solid-waste facilities are conservatively assumed to be one-half of the total. </p>
<p><strong>Natural Gas Distribution Lines Treated as Fifteen-Year Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS) Property ($138 million)</strong> - IRC Section 168(e)(3)(E)(viii). The normally applicable depreciation period is shortened for qualifying natural gas distribution lines. </p>
<p><strong>Sulfur Regulatory Compliance Incentives for Small Diesel Refiners (Combined) ($109 million)</strong>- IRC Sections 179B and 45H. This tax credit is available for fuel that complies with EPA Highway Diesel Fuel Sulfur Control Requirements. Small refiners may claim a current-year deduction in lieu of depreciation for up to 75 percent of associated capital costs.</p>
<p><strong>84-month Amortization Period for Coal Pollution Control ($102 million)</strong> - IRC Section 169(d)(5). Extends the amortization period used in calculating the deduction from the generally applicable 60-month period available for other types of pollution control facilities. </p>
<p><strong>Expensing Advanced Mine Safety Equipment ($32 million)</strong> - IRC Section 179E. The costs of qualifying mine safety equipment may be expensed rather than recovered through depreciation. </p>
<p><strong>Credit for Clean Fuel Vehicles and Refueling Property-Fossil Fuels ($14 million)</strong>- IRC Section 30C. This tax credit is available for up to 30 percent of the cost of the property. Qualifying fuels include: E85, natural gas, LNG, CNG, LPG, hydrogen, and 20 percent biodiesel. Amounts were prorated between fossil fuels and biofuels. </p>
<p><strong>Natural Gas Gathering Lines Treated as Seven-year Property with Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) Relief ($6 million)</strong> - IRC Section 168(e)(3)(C)(iv). Depreciation period shortened for qualifying natural gas gathering lines. </p>
<p><strong>Natural Gas Arbitrage Exemption ($6 million)</strong> - IRC Section 148(b)(4). This provision excludes prepayments under qualified natural gas supply contracts from the definition of “investment-type property,” creating an exception to the general rule that tax-exempt bonds do not include bond issues used to obtain higher-yielding investments. </p>
<p><strong>Amortization of Oil and Gas Geological and Geophysical Costs ($145 million)</strong> - IRC Section 167(h). This provision allows a shortened depreciation period of two years for non-integrated oil companies and seven years for integrated companies.</p>
<p><strong>Direct Payments</strong></p>
<p><strong>LIHEAP ($6,358 million)</strong> The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) allocates block grants to states so they can provide low-income households with energy assistance. In a typical year, over half of the funds are used to assist with heating costs, while remaining funds are used to assist with cooling costs, state leveraging and outreach programs, and weatherization efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Strategic Petroleum Reserve ($6,183 million)</strong> - The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was created in 1975 after multiple oil crises, in order to protect the American economy from severe oil supply disruptions. The SPR is funded through annual appropriations to the Department of Energy with special appropriations for oil purchases. Oil is also obtained through a “royalty-in-kind” program with the Minerals Management Service.</p>
<p><strong>Black Lung Disability Trust Fund ($1,035 million)</strong> - The Black Lung Disability Trust Fund (BLDTF) pays health benefits to coal miners afflicted with pneumoconiosis or “black lung disease.” Created in 1978, it is funded through an excise tax of $1.10/ton on underground coal and $.55/ton on surface coal, exempting lignite coal, imports, and exports. As with other excise taxes (for example, those on crude petroleum or transportation fuels), these levies support a trust fund that accrues to the benefit of the fuel market itself (i.e., coal), by covering health costs incurred in the production of that fuel. Thus, the cost and benefit of the tax to the fuel should theoretically net to zero. However, as the excise tax payments did not sufficiently cover early benefits payments, the BLDTF was given “indefinite authority to borrow” from the U.S. General Fund.</p>
<p><strong>Highway Trust Fund ($500 million)</strong> - The Highway Trust Fund supports highway, road, and other transportation projects throughout the country.</p>
<p><strong>Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve ($50 million)</strong> - The Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve is intended to compensate for supply interruptions to home heating oil supplies, without distorting heating oil prices enough to alter consumer behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves ($28 million)</strong> - The Naval Petroleum and Oil Shale Reserves once functioned as a Navy counterpart to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When people hear the word &quot;subsidy&quot;, they think that the government is writing a check to an industry and the industry deposits the check in the bank as profit.  But that isn't the case, and opponents of the industry can intentionally use this misunderstanding to misrepresent the situation.</p>
<p>Here's some of the things that are included in that &quot;$4 billion&quot; figure:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The single largest expenditure is just over $1 billion for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which is designed to protect the U.S. from oil shortages. The second largest category is just under $1 billion in tax exemptions for farm fuel. The justification for that tax exemption is that fuel taxes pay for roads, and the farm equipment that benefits from the tax exemption is technically not supposed to be using the roads. The third largest category? $570 million for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program. (This program is classified as a petroleum subsidy because it artificially reduces the price of fuel, which helps oil companies sell more of it). Those three programs account for $2.5 billion a year in &quot;oil subsidies.&quot;</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>You need to understand what a is a tax deduction, what is a tax credit, and why the government (ideally) would issue them.</p>
<p>A tax credit of $100 means that what you owe in taxes is lowered by $100.  So if your business owes $200 and you have a credit of $100 you now only owe $100.  Credits apply to what you owe.</p>
<p>Deductions work differently.  Say you earn $100,000 and you have a $10,000 tax deduction.  You now only owe taxes on $100,000 - $10,000 = $90,000 at whatever rate you are taxed at in that particular bracket.</p>
<p>The government  subsidize through tax credits and deductions things we want to see more of, especially if we would not see that activity normally.</p>
<p>For oil companies often we subsidize exploration for new reserves.  If you are a small company you need these credits to explore for new wells.  This injects competition into the industry and generally the big companies don't like these small guys running around, driving up the cost of leases, and having to pay these guys money for what the big companies were eventually going to get to anyway.</p>
<p>But of course the big companies benefit as well.  Importantly to us, how do we benefit?  The argument is we benefit by taxing all the other stuff that comes along with the oil industry.  All the work clothes, all the account services, all these industries pay their income taxes, their sales taxes, etc.  </p>
<p>States benefit from royalty payments as well.  That is not inconsiderable.  The Federal government benefits from royalty payments as well.  Quite frankly a lot of the oil guys hate paying twice (royalties and production taxes).</p>
<p>And when you speak of taxes increasing the cost you need to define where the tax is.  A tax at the gas pump is paid by the consumer and is for maintenance of all the road construction and maintenance.  It is just and fair that those that get the most use out of the roads pay a tax for using the roads.</p>
<p>A &quot;good&quot; tax is avoidable by those that don't use the service and is unavoidable by those that do use the service.  A gas tax is a &quot;good&quot; tax at the pump because it targets exactly who is using the roads.</p>
<p>Taxes on gas get incorporated into tax. Everything that is moved by ship or truck pays some form of gas tax and is incorporated into the price of what you buy.  These are good taxes.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of these answers are misleading or missing the major reason.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tax breaks (&quot;subsidies&quot;) are for American petroleum countries.</p>
</li>
<li>Taxes are on <em>any</em> oil sold in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p>So by cutting taxes only on US companies, they are able to be more profitable in comparison to non-US companies. Oil has a price controlled by the market so everyone has to sell at that price (in general) so any way that their expenses can be reduced (expenses include taxes) will make the US companies more competitive.</p>
<p>Adding taxes on to oil later on (and in different amounts depending on the type/use) means that we're taxing all oil consumed in the US. This is not the same as oil made in the US. So we tilt the playing field in favor of the US companies and then tax them all evenly.</p>
<p>This gets way more complicated because other countries try to do the same thing, but this is the general idea of <em>why</em>.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
