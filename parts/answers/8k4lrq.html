		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If your pencil lead breaks constantly no matter how you sharpen it, that probably means the lead is already splintered inside the pencil.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The holes are usually just to hold the pencil centered in the sharpener.

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Rotating the sharpener around the pencil causes less breakage than turning the pencil. It’s something they teach you to help prevent breaking colored pencils, as they are softer. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
