		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Probably. The maximal mass of neutron stars is poorly known. The minimal mass is somewhere around 1.1 solar masses, although white dwarfs can exist up to 1.4 solar masses. The upper limit is somewhere around 2-3 solar masses. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star#Mass_and_temperature" target="_blank">Wikipedia discusses this in detail with many references</a>.</p>
<p>1.1 + 1.1 minus a bit of gravitational waves would generate an object with just a bit over 2 solar masses, probably low enough for a neutron star. 1.4 + 1.4 minus gravitational waves is more difficult already, as it is further away from the most massive observed neutron star and much closer to the theoretical limit.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Related question: Do you think it is possible for a very dense neutron star to be in a state of being quasi-black hole in terms of its mass/gravitational pull? What I mean by this is that the super dense neutron star/black hole object doesn't quite have enough mass to allow for an event horizon, but rather its gravitational pull makes light barely escape. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
