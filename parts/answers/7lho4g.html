		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>A lot of precious gemstones are basically natural versions of this: diamonds are carbon crystals which can be different colors (rose diamonds, blue diamonds - and even chocolate diamonds, the tilapia of diamonds) depending on the impurities present. </p>
<p>Same with sapphire/ruby, which are the same mineral, just colored differently depending on what else is scattered throughout the crystalline structure.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The style of glass you’re referring to (with sparkly bits in it) is called Aventurine. Chrome and cobalt are the easiest metals to make this class with and produce a green and dark blue respectively. </p>
<p>As far as other metals making different colors that wouldn’t necessarily be sparkly, copper can be used to make glass either blue or red, depending upon the oxidation/reduction state it’s melted under, gold will make vibrant pinks and purples, and silver is unique in that it is polychromatic and will produce a wide range of colors in different conditions. Cadmium is used to produce yellows, oranges and reds depending on the amount of selenium introduced to the batch. </p>
<p>Source: I work in a glass factory and handle a few thousand pounds of molten colored glass every day. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Gold and silver nanoparticles have been used for centuries to color glass, Google &quot;Ruby glass&quot; or &quot;cranberry glass&quot;. Essentially, the way the particles of metal interact with light changes when you get to the nanoscale, so instead of yellow gold can be brilliant red to purple or even blue. The same phenomenon happens with silver and other metals. It's called localized surface plasmon resonance if you want to dig into the physics of it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>glassblower here... just read this: <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_coloring_and_color_marking" target="_blank">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_coloring_and_color_marking</a>
then google something like Borosilicate colored glass and you'll see the huge range of what is achievable now.
My favorite are the new slyme colors and regular old school amberpurple </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It looks like the really interesting thing about these materials is their heterogeneity. What I mean by that is they consist of glass, which is colored from the inclusion of metal ions, and large precipitates of metal or metal oxide to give it the sparkle. </p>
<p>To directly answer your question, yes there are other metals that can and are added to glass to change its color. This is the basis of the different colors in the bulk material, and the color is dependent on the metal, how much there is, and the matrix - what is the glass (or whatever) made of. </p>
<p>The inclusion of chunks of metal to give it sparkle is going to be difficult to pull off, not least because the size of those particles will usually have a dramatic impact on what they will look like in the bulk. In fact, many colors can be obtained by changing the size of particles of the same material. I don't know, but I'd guess that people have tried other metals but it is difficult to achieve the effect. </p>
<p>For <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_coloring_and_color_marking" target="_blank">glass coloring</a> in brief, there's a wiki article. You might also enjoy reading about various gemstones and how they achieve their color, which is usually also the inclusion of trace impurities of different metals. Ruby and sapphire for example are the same kind of rock, just different colors. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
