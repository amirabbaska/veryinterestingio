		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Because language is a social phenomenon. And we do not speak exactly the same all the time with everyone. We use what are called speech <em>registers</em> depending on the situation and the other people present. We either try to identify with them, or contrast ourselves from them. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you ever visited cousins who speak a different dialect and then started to pick up their speech patterns when you are relaxed around them? Have you had friends that move away to a different area or social status, only for them to come back and no longer talk like you? They have changed, and you might think they are no longer &quot;one of you&quot;. People change how they talk if they want to fit in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think about how you talk to your friends who you have a lot in common with, you tend to speak similarly, in a quite laidback manner, using the same accents and vocabulary - especially slang and taboo phrases, which are socially acceptable within that group. Now think about how you speak with your parents or an elderly relative. Is it the same? It can be. But typically, using the wrong register is met with disapproval. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we talk to different groups: children, parents, clergy, teachers, judges, customers, strangers, etc., we will typically alter how we speak depending on our acquaintance, trust and respect level with them, and whether we want positive or negative results from our communication. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>People talking on the phone only have their voice by which to exchange information. A large component of human communication is context and physical cues like body language. So when you speak on the phone, you have to use a register that compensates for this. You might have to talk slower and clearer depending on your familiarity with the listener. If it is an unknown person that you are trying to get information or a service from, it would pay to speak in a pleasant register in order to obtain what you want. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Same goes if you are want a positive interaction in person. Wait staff will talk to you in this heightened manner if they are not familiar with you. They will pick up on your social intentions and adapt to you. If you speak and look posh, they will react accordingly. If you are nice and chill, they will be as well.  If you have ever had a regular waitress at your favorite restaurant, you will know this. Again, it all depends on the place, and the intentions of the people engaged in communication. In customer service, it literally pays to pay attention to your clientele and get them to identify with you. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I can probably eli5 how strippers work, at least how I do and how my suave voice is the deal-maker when I'm hustling.</p>
<p>I have a voice I use that is smoother, more romantic, just a little ghetto, if I could describe it, it is basically a porn star voice, and most guys watch porn. Stripping is a sales job based around sex. Anything low key slutty is the ticket. Some high key stuff is fine, but a lot of guys find it crass, overt, and trying too hard. </p>
<p>Obviously conversation content matters. Girls who can't speak English  are at a serious disadvantage. I can't use my sexy voice to tell a guy about bad stuff, I have to use it to tell him about all the flirty, naughty, sexy stuff.</p>
<p>Stripping is a customer service job and a sales job. Guys come in to forget their day, see some boobies, get romanced, feel special, get attention from a beautiful babe. Guys also want to be asked about themselves, so they feel important and special. I worked as an assistant who helped teach doctors to be more friendly and have better bedside manner, we put emphasis on how it's extremely important to cover the basics before getting into the nitty gritty. Example-</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hey baby, how you doin?</em></li>
<li><em>Hi my name is Candy, what's yours?</em></li>
<li><em>How is your day going today?</em></li>
<li><em>That's good/awful. I'm glad you're here! How's your beer/drink?</em></li>
<li><em>Can I sit in your lap?</em> (It's actually really important to point at their dick when you say it. I'm in the US so we use a single finger for pointing. I noticed this in porn and it fucking works. On a subconscious level, I'm asking to sit on their dick and not just their lap.)</li>
<li><em>What do you do? That's really cool/special/important/neat/fascinating.</em></li>
<li>(Ask about sexual interests, what they like, are into, if they like certain things.)*</li>
<li><em>I've been doing a new work out, do you think the squats are paying off?</em> (Show off ass, be a flirt)</li>
</ul>
<p>The first 10 minutes of conversation is the selling point. If I steer the conversation down a stupid road, or one filled with stress and weird shit, he won't feel the good things he needs to feel to even want a dance. It's verbal foreplay, and it's everything. The voice is what glues it all together and sells it.</p>
<p>Girls that are downers and negative don't cut it. It shows on their face and in the way they move. Guys are perceptive of this and will flat out comment &quot;She looks really angry/mean&quot;. If she is too aggressive and asking for dances without an introduction she comes off as self centered, self important, rude,  and usually doesn't make a lot of money until the last hour of the night when all the guys are fucked up and dgaf. </p>
<p>The voice is also how I keep Candy separate from my real persona. My bf says it's weird, but hot, if I use it to joke around with him. Candy is always a flirt, and a very naughty girl. This just isn't how I roll all the time in the real world. It isn't realistic, but guys don't come to the club for the <em>real world</em>.</p>
<p>(Btw, my name isn't Candy.)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When on the phone you can't see facial expressions or body language so you have to communicate all that information through just your voice. Therefore some people try to use a happier or overly emotional voice in order to be perceived the proper or happier tone.</p>
<p>While serving someone, the idea is to please the customer. No one wants to talk to a grumpy ass hat while trying to buy something so the person providing service puts on a show so they can continue having a job. Sometimes you have a shit day and it would be bad if that reflected. Also, some people aren't confident in their speaking skills so they use a &quot;different persona&quot; in order to overcome the fear</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Been in the food service industry about 19 years: people respond far better to a higher, softer, sing-songy voice. My voice is naturally deep, if I use it when I go to the table, my guests will react defensively, because bass in the voice is assertive and that seems threatening on a subconscious level. </p>
<p>So I have a fake voice that is easily over an octave higher. I use softer words, I say ok a lot, I keep my hands low, and I make them feel dominant. It might sound cheesy, but it works. People, whether they actively realize it or not, want to be served when they eat out, they want to be in charge. Establish that feel and everything goes so much better.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you're in a customer service position, it's literally in the training. I have a very monotone way of speaking while on the phone because I hate it, but I took a cs phone job anyway. They train you to smile while you speak so you sound more friendly and open. Called it voice quality, and it was part of our on-call scores. High scores are the way to get the best schedules/any perks, so you eventually develop a &quot;customer service voice.&quot; Mine is apparently creepy to people that actually know me.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
