		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For RAM, the data is stored as charge in extremely small capacitors. The charge slowly leaks out of the capacitors and into the substrate, hence it must be periodically read out and written back. When the computer is turned off, the data is lost after a few seconds when the charge leaks away.</p>
<p>For flash memory, the data is stored as charge inside of 'floating gates', which are more or less significantly better isolated capacitors. These require larger voltages to write and erase, but don't need to be periodically rewritten and hence will retain the data when power is removed.</p>
<p>Hard drives store data in the orientation of magnetic domains on the platters. The write head uses a magnetic field to change the direction that the domains are magnetized in, and the magnetized domains induce a voltage in the read head as the platter rotates underneath.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>If you want to see some cool new technology on how memory can be stored without power, google memristors. They are resistors that can maintain a state indefinitely. I don't understand all of it, but it has neat implications for improving performance.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>For modern electronics, its usually flash memory which can store data for 10s of years before corruption</p>

<p>Smaller amounts of data and data on older machines can be stored on battery backed static ram which will hold up as long as the battery does, usually months to years</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It doesn't.  Without power with which the memory controller uses to read and re-write data in memory it fades away.  Any data not stored in a more permanent form such as on a hard drive, flash drive, or CD is gone when you flip the switch.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
