		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Imagine a rubber ruler that is infinite in length, that has marks at centimeter intervals in either direction.</p>
<p>This is an infinite ruler, but it can stretch as it is made of rubber.</p>
<p>Now, stretch it. Despite it being infinite the tally marks have moved and are no longer 1cm apart, but a bit further than 1cm. The ruler has expanded, despite being infinite it is now longer than it was before.</p>
<p>That's the general idea behind &quot;expanding universe.&quot; it isn't so much that the universe is expanding into something but that the space between two points in the universe are moving apart, the space itself is expanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe is not known to be infinite.  It could be, but that's not something that could be proved.  </p>
<p>Infinite is bigger than any number imaginable.</p>
<p>If you counted up all the atoms in all the 100 billion estimated  galaxies, and than multiplied that by all the nanoseconds since the Big Bang, then you'd get a number that represented only a vanishingly small percentage of infinity.  On a practical level, you'd be no closer to infinity than you were before you started.  </p>
<p>That said, it's certainly possible for something infinite to seem to expand.  You just take the distance between any two objects in the infinite universe, and double it.  (Or, whatever expansion factor you want.)  Expanded, but still infinite.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I run a motel with an infinite number of rooms, numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. It's beach season, so all of my rooms are full, but i find out there's a convention of mathematicians coming to town this weekend, and an infinite number of mathematicians will need rooms.</p>
<p>All my rooms are full, but i really want that sweet conference cash, so i tell all of my current guests to pack up, leave their rooms, and move into the room number twice their current room number, and i give them a few bucks off today's fee. The person in room one moves to room two, the person in room two moves to room four, the person in room three moves to room six, etc.</p>
<p>Now all of my current guests are in even-numbered rooms, and i have an infinity of odd-numbered rooms to rent to mathematicians.</p>
<p>It's like that, but different.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The universe <em>may</em> be infinite, but it also may not be. At this point we're reasonably certain it's infinite. If it is, then what is happening is not the universe expanding, but rather, the space between objects in the universe is growing larger and larger over time. The whole universe will always be infinite regardless of what the scale of space is, and this scale can (and one day, will) reach mind-mindbogglingly huge levels and still always have plenty of room left to grow into.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Someone else mentioned a balloon, but the way I could understand is slightly different than what they mentioned.  If you blow up a balloon, the surface area has no boundaries - there is are no edges, as you would have if you drew a flat square - so in a way the surface of the balloon is infinite - you could trace path around the balloon over and over and never come to and end point. But it can also expand, as you blow up the balloon more, not only does the volume increase but the surface of the balloon increases as well.  So it is infinite and expanding.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
