		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>American curbs are there to protect pedestrians, protect drivers from driving off the road, protect landscaping beyond the curb, to retain and direct storm water in the road. The height is just easier to use in a design phase due to it being 0.50 feet rather than 0.33. </p>
<p>Curbs 3-5 centimeters are tripping hazards, not ADA compliant and serve little purpose from a storm water standpoint. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Standard kerbs^1 here in the UK are about 15cm (I can't be bothered to go out and measure one, but it's about that size)</p>
<p>We do have what are usually called &quot;dropped kerbs&quot; where pedestrians are expected to cross so wheelchairs / pushchairs can get up / down more easily, or where a driveway meets a road or the like. Those are about 3-5cm tall.</p>
<p>Occasionally, there will be a longer dropped kerb where a section of pavement is dual use, such as a shared footpath / cycle path, or where a bus lane crosses a footpath or whatever.</p>
<p>Googling &quot;dropped kerb&quot; finds lots of examples of the kind of thing I'm talking about.</p>
<p>^1 &quot;kerb&quot; in English, &quot;curb&quot; in USAian.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most answers are wrong.</p>
<p>Main reason: In Europe, we remove and recycle the old paving before adding new pavement (sometimes the one just removed, mixed with more bitumen), which is usually not don in the US. By having higher curbs, you can repave more times before you need to adjust the curb or remove old pavements.</p>
<p>Secondary reason: The low curbs are much more wheel chair friendly. With high curbs, you need ramps.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
