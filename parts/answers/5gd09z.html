		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I am assuming you are referring to math problems which have not been solved, but may be solved in the future like the and Riemann Hypothesis. These problems are usually conjectures (sort of like a hypothesis in science) meaning that they appear to be true for every number, but we have not been able to prove it. Testing every number is impossible since there are infinitely many numbers so mathematicians use mathematical rules to try to come up with a proof and show that the conjecture is true for for all numbers. An example of this is the famous Fermant's Last Theorem that no three positive integers a, b, and c satisfy the equation a^n + b^n = c^n for any integer value of n greater than two. While it appeared to be true for all numbers it took mathematicians 400 years to prove that it is using some very complex mathematics.. These problems often do not have obvious real world applications, however the our understanding of the physical world tends to play catch up with mathematics meaning that they may very well be discovered to have physical meanings in the future. That being said there are math problems like the Continuum Hypothesis which appear to be truly unsolvable and they arise from the axioms of mathematics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's pretty simple. Someone wants to know something. Let's take multiplying an even number by an odd number gives you an even number. (obviously this isn't an unsolved math problem, but it is easy to deal with and understand)</p>
<p>They realize that for every number they can think of this is true, yet they want to know if it is ALWAYS true that way it can be used in all math problems without checking. Until someone can figure out a way to mathematically prove it, it is an unsolved problem.</p>
<p>The current great unsolved problems are just scenarios like this that for one reason or another no one has come up with a proof for yet.</p>
<p>edit:changed odd to even</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In terms of why things are worth solving, mathematicians don't necessarily know to begin with. For many, it's just about having a greater understanding of mathematics. There's some hole in our understanding of math that they're trying to fill, some mystery that is like a burning itch for a curious mathematician.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean there's no applications. I took an introductory abstract algebra course recently (that stuff is really bloody hard btw) and it has many applications in computer science, such as cryptography and channel coding (how to send data and make sure you don't lose information to noise).</p>
<p>These applications aren't immediately apparent when your head is full of really vague abstract stuff like finite fields and abelian groups, but some really smart guy at some point figured out a use for it.</p>
<p>People often ask the same thing about science for the sake of science. What's it useful for? Well, we may not know <em>yet</em>, but you wouldn't have that smartphone if it weren't for people doing science &quot;just because&quot;.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Most of you are referring to <strong>unsolved</strong> problems. The answers are great for that question. However, there's an interesting, alternative interpretation of &quot;unsolvable&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;Unsolvable&quot; problems is, interpreted very literally, a different class of problems altogether. They are problems that we've determined (conclusively) to have no consistent solution beyond relying on an additional &quot;primitive&quot; assumption. </p>
<p>One well-known problem that was later proven to be unsolvable is &quot;How do we axiomatically define sets in a way that allows for their usage in modern mathematics?&quot; Traditionally, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory" target="_blank">ZFC axioms</a> were considered &quot;necessary&quot; for mathematics to be easy to use for applications, but some of them are unintuitive, so perhaps there is an alternative set of more basic axioms that allow us to define the whole system. As it turns out, this is unsolvable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>if ZFC is consistent, it is impossible to axiomatize ZFC using only finitely many axioms</p>
</blockquote>
<p>-</p>
<p>Another closely related problem is how to define cardinality of infinite sets. As it turns out, the statement...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is there a set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and the real numbers? (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_hypothesis" target="_blank">CH</a>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>...cannot be proved <em>or</em> disproved in a world with ZFC axioms. It is possible to to think of a ZFC-consistent world where such a set can exist, and it is also possible to think of a ZFC-consistent world where such a set can never exist. </p>
<p>The more general mathematical term is to say &quot;ZFC and CH are <em>independent</em>&quot;. This term is preferred because it indicates the fundamental symmetry of unprovable propositions: in a world where you assume CH as primitive, but <em>not all</em> of the ZFC axioms are assumed, you wouldn't be able to determine if <em>all</em> the ZFC axioms are valid.</p>
<p>These results aren't as deep as they sound; rather, they simply indicate that a prior object/axiom was not rigorously defined. In a sense, each &quot;fundamental&quot; problem that is unsolvable is associated with a &quot;dual&quot; problem that becomes solved as a result: whether the definitions used in the statement of the fundamental problem are exhaustive ways to define a system. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If a &quot;fundamental&quot; problem is proven to be unsolvable, we have solved the &quot;dual&quot; problem by showing that the definitions do not cover all aspects of a system. </p>
</li>
<li>If a &quot;fundamental&quot; problem is solved, we haven't yet solved the &quot;dual&quot; problem of establishing whether the definitions are exhaustive. </li>
</ul></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't know how people will come up with the solutions. Yet :p</p>
<p>People think it's worth solving for two main reasons. </p>
<p>a) it might help humanity in some way down the track. Maths comes well before (often centuries) practical uses for it come into play. </p>
<p>b) because we can. Why does it need a purpose? Can't it be like art? Something that serves no higher purpose, but people enjoy. Archeology is in the same boat. We do it because it's interesting. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
