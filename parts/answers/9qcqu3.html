		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>According to your research and the existing body of literature, would you say dogs are directly descended from <em>Canis lupus</em>, or from a shared common ancestor that has since gone extinct?</p>
<p>As a followup, if it's the 2nd one, are some wolf subspecies worthy of classification as another species (Himalayan/Indian wolves in particular) if they are found to have diverged at a similar time?</p>
<p>Also, have you ever done any coyote genetics work, particularly with Dan Bogan's NYS coyote project?</p>
<p>I'm a CALS alum currently in grad school for an MSc in conservation bio and I am wondering if a lack of coursework in population genetics will be an issue when applying to PhD programs or if I'll just have to take grad-level courses in it to catch me up. Currently my school doesn't offer grad-level population or conservation genetics.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I have your kit!  The problem is my concern about getting a decent sample.  I keep waiting to do it right in the morning before our dog chews or licks or drinks.  I've had it over a month.  How important is it to get a &quot;clean&quot; specimen like that? </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
