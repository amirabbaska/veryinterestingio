		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This same problem turns out to be one of the flaws in Larry Niven's science fiction novel <em>Ringworld</em>.</p>
<p>Let's imagine the Earth is a perfect sphere (since with only 1000 ft in the air and a perfect circle in your original question, that seems to be what you're imagining).  It turns out that if you put a ring of material around the Earth like that, that situation would be unstable.  At the slightest perturbation pushing any spot towards or from the center of the Earth, the ring would come crashing to the Earth.</p>
<p>In <em>Ringworld</em>, Niven had an &quot;alien megastructure,&quot; as I guess we're calling these things today, a giant ring that had been constructed around a star, with a radius around the size of the Earth-Sun distance. As people pointed out after the novel was published, this situation is unstable (if you push the ring up or down out of the plane of its orbit, it will bounce back, but a sideways push or pull will lead the ring to crash into the star).  Niven ultimately wrote a sequel to address this, in which he writes that there are jets on the ring world to keep it in position against this gravitational instability.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In the <strong>spirit</strong> of your question, yes, the beam would effectively levitate given that situation. Gravity would act on all sides equally keeping it in a suspension above the ground (which would be awesome)</p>
<p>It would, however, be in <strong>unstable equilibrium</strong>. A small bump would easily knock it &quot;out of sync&quot;.</p>
<p>The earth is bumpy (non-equal distribution of gravity), windy (couldn't set up the initial condition), and has other limiting factors.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Theoretically, if it had insanely high compressive strength, it were perfectly machined, the Earth were perfectly round, and it were perfectly centered around the center of the Earth, then yes it could. However, as soon as the slightest breeze pushed it any distance off center, it would unbalance and one side of it would &quot;fall&quot; toward the Earth.
If it were made of any real material, it wouldn't be able to withstand its own weight and it would collapse before balance even became an issue.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
