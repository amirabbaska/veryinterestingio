		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>I've done electroshocking fish for research purposes.  You have a backpack and you run electricity through the water to zap fish.  </p>
<p>The thing is, you can't really do electroshocking in <em>salt</em> water.  It's too conductive.  Electroshockers work because the electricity passing through the water essentially &quot;short circuits&quot; through fish, zapping them.  Fish are more conductive than fresh water, but salt water is more conductive than fish.  So the electricity just goes around them.  </p>
<p>So lightning isn't going to have a huge effect on marine life for that reason alone.</p>
<p>EDIT: For clarity, a fish close enough to where the lightning hits will still feel the effects, and could even be killed if it was really close.  But as the distance increases the effects will drop off relatively quickly, compared to a similar strike applied to freshwater.  </p>
<p>I attempted to find some papers that could provide some better numbers but came up empty. It seems to be a little-studied area.</p>
<p>EDIT EDIT:  Also, <em>you</em> obviously shouldn't be out swimming in the ocean in a lightning storm.  For one thing people tend to stick out of the surface of the ocean and no amount of salt water is going to help if you get hit directly.  Or if lightning hits nearby, a little shock that merely stuns a fish temporarily could cause you to drown.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As a Bluewater Sailor,  I can say definitely that  lightning frequently strikes the ocean.  Fish within a few feet of the surface can be stunned or killed.  Most fish usually stay a few feet down or more unless feeding on something near the surface,  in order to avoid predation by seabirds.... But... </p>
<p>I have observed hundreds (thousands?) of small fish at a time severely stunned or killed during a lightning storm... I Sailed through them within a minute or two of the strike. </p>
<p>Do not imagine that if you do not &quot;Pierce the surface&quot; then you will be safe from lightning at sea..... You need to be a few feet down,  not sure how much (this would vary considerably with sea temperature and salinity ,  I suspect).  Also,  if the water is shallow and the strike very close by,  you are in the current path,  and will likely be electrocuted in any case. Fish in my lobster trap (about 3-4 meters deep,  on the bottom,  not connected to but less than 10 meters away from my boat)  were killed when my boat was struck by lightning.  (steel boat)  so,  there's that.  </p>
<p>As an electrical engineer, I'd say that if the sea were a perfect conductor,  the bit about piercing the surface would sort of be true (except you still wouldn't get shocked because perfect conductivity would divert the current around your body)  but it's not, and compared to highly conductive metals like copper or silver,  seawater is a poorer conductor by seven orders of magnitude. </p>
<p>This means that the &quot;skin effect&quot;  (conduction only happening on the surface of a conductor) will be distributed over a pretty wide area,  and the current flowing through the water will be reduced,  but not eliminated with depth and distance from the strike. </p>
<p>Edit: it seems,  based on a little googling,  the estimates of the lethal distance in Salt water from the strike point range from 20 to 100 feet.  I have personally seen lethal effects at more than 20 feet. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/13tGKSA.jpg" target="_blank">Here's a photo of a lightning strike over water</a> off the coast of Key Largo while I was doing a night dive (scuba) off the coast of Key Largo.</p>
<p>Once lightning &quot;hits&quot; water, its effect is reduced as distance increases. Whatever is very close to the location of the flash is gonna have a bad time.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>a lot of people have a misconception that the ocean, which is water, is non-conductive. <em>distilled</em> water is an insulator, but with minerals (especially salts) dissolved in the water, it becomes an excellent conductor. The fish are usually okay (unless they were unfortunate enough to have been at the surface at the time of a direct strike) because the electricity is conducted through the water around most things and dissipates quickly. You're not safe swimming during a thunderstorm however, because your body sticks out of the water, and becomes a target for the lightning. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
