		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Exponential growth.  Each fold doubles the thickness of the paper.  If I gave you 1 penny today, and promised to give you twice as much money tomorrow, and twice as much the day after, and so on and so on, on day 30 I'm giving you over $5 million dollars.  </p>
<p>You can do the math on this yourself pretty easily though.  Open the calculator on your computer, and type in 0.0039 (the thickness of a piece of paper).  Press the Times button, and then the number 2, and press enter.  Now press enter 102 more times.  By the mid-50's your calculator will actually reach a point where it has to start using exponents, and by 60 you'll have surpassed the what the calculator is capable of. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>And not to be pedantic, but wouldn't the stack of folded paper be <em>thicker</em> than the diameter of the observable universe, but it's <em>width</em> would be 1/2^103 times the size of the original width dimension, and it's length unchanged? The point being the <em>folded  paper</em> won't be bigger than the observable universe; only one of it's principal dimensions (thickness).</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>When you fold something once, you make it 2x as thick.  Fold it again, you make it 4x as thick.  Fold it N times, you make it 2^N times as thick.  2^103 is a very, very, very large number.  (Approximately 1 followed by 31 zeros.)  </p>
<p>So even if you are folding something very thin, if you were able to fold it that many times, it would become 10^31 times thicker. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's math. Theoretical in that I think 10 times is about the most that's ever been achieved.</p>
<p>More interesting to me has always been how big a piece of paper would have to be to start with, assuming it possible to be in a position to fold it 103 times. That's even simpler math but I've never gotten around to it.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>As others have pointed, it's not physically possible. If it were, the surface area of the paper would also shrink by a factor of 2 each time. So you'd end up with more like one very, very, very thin rod that's longer than the observable universe.</p>
<p>The long and short of it is, exponential growth is <em>very</em> fast. The difference between a single byte and a kibibyte is just 10 powers of 2. Same with going up to a mebibyte, gibibyte, tebibyte.. That's still &quot;only&quot; 40 powers of 2.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
