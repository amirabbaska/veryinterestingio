<p>Menthol produces the <em>sensation</em> of cooling without <em>actually</em> cooling, by activating the nerve receptors that would normally react to cold temperatures.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>There is a particular family of receptors that react to compounds like menthol and capcasin. They transmit temperature signals as well as pain signals. They submit the information of heating or cooling from external sources to your brain.  You brain, therefore interprets the binding of menthol or capcasin as a cooling/heating event on your extremities or skin. The relationship to pain is not well understood, but these receptors can also transmit pain signals. It is thought that loading these receptors up with the temperature-related compounds keep them from transmitting a pain signal as they are now more actively transmitting the temperature specific signals to the brain. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Just like how hot peppers and spicy food taste &quot;hot&quot; some chemicals can make your skin feel cold. There temperature isn't changing, but your skin feels like it is. These hot/cold sensations can interfere with pain receptors so they're an effective analgesic (substance that makes you hurt less) for muscle and joint pain.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The active ingredients in Icy Hot formulations are menthol or a combination of menthol and methyl salicylate. The ingredients cause a cooling sensation followed by a warming sensation that distracts you from the pain by blocking pain signals sent to the brain. The cooling sensation dulls the pain while the warming sensation relaxes it away.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
