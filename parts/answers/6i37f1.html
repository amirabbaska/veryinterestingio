		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Paleontologists can use the features, shapes, and dimensions of the nasal cavities and other parts of the skull to determine what kinds of sounds dinosaurs might be able to make. In recent decades, we have found mummified dinosaurs with enough fossilized soft tissue to help with this kind of investigation.</p>
<p>In the case of cartoons and fairly non-scientific videos, the sounds we hear might be exaggerated in some ways, or even just made up. But more scientifically-grounded shows often do a good job of making sounds match what the scientists think they should be.</p>
<p>Like all science, paleontology is constantly refining its knowledge, so new fossils will no doubt come to light in the future which will continue to improve our understanding of dinosaur sounds. </p>
<p>I'm not a paleontologist, but I love dinosaurs, and have been following the research for most of my 60-odd years. </p>
<p>Edit: A good way to demonstrate this to a 5 year old might be to get a tin whistle, recorder, or kazoo, and show them how covering different holes and blowing into the instrument will make different sounds.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>It's not, at least not in the sense we normally hear.  Dinosaur roars are usually 100% based on what sounds good in the movies.  The famous Jurrassic park roar was a combination of baby elephant trumpet, alligator gurgle, and tiger  snarl.  It's got nothing whatsoever to do with what dinosaurs might have sounded like.</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-animals-hiding-in-a-t-rexs-roar/" target="_blank">https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-animals-hiding-in-a-t-rexs-roar/</a></p>
<p>Most dinosaur noises in the movies are similarly totally made up to sound good.</p>
<p>However, we do expect that many dinosaurs would have made some sort of noise.  Alligators and crocodiles make noise.  Birds make noise.  Dinosaurs are kind of &quot;in between&quot; the two on the family tree of life.  And certain specific dinosaurs, most notably hadrosaurs, had bone structures that were clearly intended to produce loud calls.  </p>

<p>So your dinosaurs may well have made noise, but it might not be what you are expecting.</p>
<p>Personally I like to picture the T rex posing on a hill-top, waving it's tiny arms frantically as a display, and making a call quite like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlq2kcYQcLc" target="_blank">majestic cry of the bald eagle</a></p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Many traits of dinosaurs (skin/feather color, behaviors, noises, etc.) obviously cannot be directly observed from fossils.  As an alternative, paleontologists infer these traits by looking at those same things in the closest descendants of these dinosaurs: birds.  By observing behaviors of a relatively large bird (say, an ostrich), paleontologists can get as solid of a guess about how a dinosaur sounds as they possibly can.  If you've ever heard a large bird, they can actually make very deep and monster-like vocalizations.</p>
<p>As for if/when a dinosaur roars, that is less clear.  Obviously these noises would serve to communicate to others, but I doubt a T-Rex would ever roar just before charging (why would it blow any element of surprise it had with a lengthy scream)</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>In many cases paleontologists can make an educated guess based on the structure of the bones in the larynx. But most likely, many dinosaurs didn't roar. Many of the bird-like ones probably made noises more reminiscent of chirps or whoops. One way that scientists make these educated guesses is by comparing the fossilized structures of dinosaurs to those of living reptiles (and birds). It is logical to think that if dinosaurs and living reptiles have similarly-shaped larynges (voice boxes) they might make similar noises. You make an adjustment for the increased size in dinosaurs, and boom, sometimes you have a roar. Other times you don't. Again, these are just educated guesses (hypotheses). </p>
<p>This type of deductive reasoning has been used to generate other hypotheses about dinosaurs that have later been proven true. For example, paleontologists hypothesized long ago that bird-like dinosaurs had bird-like behaviors like building nests and incubating their eggs. Then, in the 90's (?) several fossils of bird-like dinosaurs were discovered in China and a few of them actually showed the adult females sitting on top of their unhatched eggs in the nest. </p>
<p>Science for the win.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
