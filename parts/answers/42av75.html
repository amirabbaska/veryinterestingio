		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>This is actually a physics question.  There a multiple things happening here.  First, there are an odd number of protons.  Protons/neutrons like to pair up.  This is the pairing energy term in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semi-empirical_mass_formula" target="_blank">semi-empirical mass formula</a>.  Now that does not explain everything.  </p>
<p>Part of the answer lies in the idea that it lies far from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_number_\(physics\)" target="_blank">nuclear magic numbers</a>.  Magic numbers impart additional binding that helps hold nuclei together.   Now there is one more piece.  Technetium is special in that it lies next to two elements that are unusually very stable (Mo and Ru).  Because if this, nuclei of Tc will decay to the most stable configurations.  This means they will beta decay to either Ru or Mo.  </p>
<p>It is important to remember what stable means.  In many cases it means the isotope will not decay for a very long time.  Many &quot;stable&quot; isotopes actually decay.  </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>The unfortunate reality is that you will find no simple, &quot;just-so&quot; story about why Technetium in particular has no stable isotopes. To compute the stability of Technetium, for example, from first principles (that is without assuming any semi-empirical model) would require solving for the allowed states of a quantum system with 43 protons + 43 electrons + ~50 Neutrons = ~136 particles interacting via the strong, weak, and electromagnetic forces (gravity is probably negligible here) crammed into a size of about 10^(-15)m for the nucleus and 10^(-9)m for the whole atom. </p>
<p>This is a VERY hard problem to try and get some qualitative understanding out of for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>It is highly non-classical. This is why the semi-empirical mass formula and the liquid drop model sometimes fail. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It includes the strong force. Electromagnetism and the weak force can generally be analysed using the techniques of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory#Theories" target="_blank">perturbative quantum field theory</a>, but the larger coupling constant of the strong force makes this basically impossible for the strong force. So we're left with a much smaller set of usable tools for analysis.</p>
</li>
<li>It sits in the uncomfortable range where there are too many particles to solve the problem exactly, but there are too few to apply a thermodynamic approach. Most exact methods in quantum mechanics are tractable for 2, sometimes 3 and 4 particles (this is why, for example, every student studies the hydrogen and helium systems). For 5 - ~10 particles there may be some kind of approximation which keeps the problem tractable. Technetium has over 100 particles though (and they are potentially unstable), which puts it well beyond this tractable regime. But, on the other hand, physicists have a lot of tools to deal with thermodynamic systems containing anywhere from millions to Avogadro's number of particles and up. Technetium (and all heavy elements) falls in the sort of 'dead-zone' where we do not have as many useful tools.</li>
</ol>
<p>One thing that's interesting to consider are the decay channels which happen to make light nuclei unstable. <a href="http://www.dommelen.net/quantum2/style_a/img3381.gif" target="_blank">This chart</a> was already posted and shows that for light nuclei (including the ones that do have a stable isotope) the most common decay path is beta decay, either beta- with the emission of an electron, or beta+ with the emission of a positron. Typically, there are some stable isotopes and then isotopes with more neutrons and unstable due to beta- decay, while isotopes with fewer neutrons are unstable due to beta+ decay.</p>
<p>With that pattern in mind, consider just the section of the chart near Technetium. As already mentioned, nuclei with odd numbers of protons tend to be less stable. The elements with odd numbers of protons around Technetium, Niobium and Rhodium, have just 1 stable isotope. So, we can ask, what happened to the isotopes of Technetium that we might think are stable, based on what's around it, and these are the already mentioned Technetium-97 and Technetium-99?</p>
<p>The 'problem' with Technetium-97 is somewhat unique: it is stable (apparently) against both beta+ and beta- decay, but not against electron capture. Electron capture occurs when a proton absorbs one of the inner-shell electrons of the atom, transforming itself into a neutron. Electron capture does happen with these lighter nuclei, but usually in situations where BOTH electron capture AND beta+ decay are allowed. Unusually, the energy difference between Technetium-97 and Molybdenum-97 is not large enough to allow a transition via beta+ decay, but just by coincidence it happens to be that 43 protons + 54 neutrons has higher energy than 42 protons + 55 neutrons and so the decay can occur. That 42+55 has lower energy is totally not obvious (for example, neither combination has any magic numbers) and just depends on the details of whether the change in electromagnetic potential energy or the mass difference between proton and neutron happens to be larger.</p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Not an expert, but I was curious so I did some research into it.</p>
<p>Looks like one factor leading to Technicium to being radioactive is the fact that it has an odd number of protons, which leads to more radioactive isotopes since nuclei can't &quot;pair up&quot;^<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technetium#Isotopes" target="_blank">[1]</a> .</p>
<p>However, that doesn't answer the question of why other near-by odd elements aren't radioactive. The best answer I could find is from a post on Physics StackExchange^<a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/a/40990" target="_blank">[2]</a> . To quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because the theoretical stable line slopes towards the right in figure 14.49, only one of the two odd-even isotopes next to technetium-98 should be unstable, and the same for the ones next to promethium-146. However, the energy liberated in the decay of these odd-even nuclei is only a few hundred keV in each case, far below the level for which the von Weizsäcker formula is anywhere meaningful. For technetium and promethium, neither neighboring isotope is stable. This is a quali­tative failure of the von Weizsäcker model. But it is rare; it happens only for these two out of the lowest 82 elements.</p>
<p>So these models fail to explain why no isotopes of Tc are stable, even though they generally work pretty well. This just shows how hard the problem is.</p>

		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>Here's an interesting way to look at the problem:</p>
<p>The vast majority of proton+neutron combinations, even in small nuclei, are unstable. A nucleus of one proton and five neutrons will immediately decay. When we say an element is stable, we're really just saying there's at least one isotope of it that's stable -- that given X protons, there is at least one value for Y neutrons that holds it together. Sometimes more than one: for Carbon (6 protons), 6p+6n holds together just as well as 6p+7n. </p>
<p><a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/80/Isotopes_and_half-life.svg" target="_blank">Here</a> is a map of all the possible isotopes. The maroon squares signify a stable combination of protons and neutrons. There's somewhat of a pattern, but details look pretty random.</p>
<p>See that column at Z = 43, that has two reds and an orange, but no maroons? That's technetium. Sure, part of the reason is it's because of an odd number of protons and all that, but it seems like 43 just drew a bad hand in this game. </p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">
