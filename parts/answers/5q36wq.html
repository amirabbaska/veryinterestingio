		<span class="qa" title="Answer">A:</span><div class="markdown"><p>We don't exactly know how big a black hole is. The math says it has zero volume (a singularity), but we don't know what happens to the physics in these situations. What we do know is, given a certain amount of mass, how big the radius is of the sphere that encompasses the region from which light can't escape.</p>
<p>This radius is called the Schwarzschild radius and it is given by the expression 2 G M / c^2 (G = Gravitational constant, M = mass, c = speed of light). If the object is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius, then it's a black hole.</p>
<p>Plugging in the numbers for Earth gives a value of 8.8 mm. This is around the size of a large marble.</p></div>		<div class="replies-controls">

<p>r= (2GM)/(c^2 )
or
M= (r * c^2 )/2G</p>
<p>Which for a marble (~5mm=0.005m) is</p>
<p>M~= (0.005 <em> 9.0e16)/(2 </em> 6.67eâˆ’11)
~= 3.37e24 kg</p>
<p>and with the earth at 5.972e24 kg, yes the earth squeezed down to marble would form a black hole and something about 56% of the earth's mass would be enough to become a black hole if squeezed down to marble. </p></div>		<div class="replies-placeholder"></div>
